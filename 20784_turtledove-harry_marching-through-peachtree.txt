harry turtledove marching through peachtree war of the provinces this is a work of fiction all the characters and events portrayed in this book are fictional and any resemblance to real people or incidents is purely coincidental i count joseph called the gamecock was not a happy man joseph was seldom a happy man he would have been of more service to king geoffrey had he been but then he most cordially loathed his sovereign a feeling that was mutual still and all when avram the new king of detina had made it plain he intended to free the blond serfs in the northern provinces joseph couldnt stomach that either sooner than accepting it he and the rest of the north had followed avrams cousin grand dukenow kinggeoffrey into rebellion a sour expression on his face josepha dapper erect little man with neat graying chin whiskers on his long thin clever faceleft his pavilion and stared south toward the province of franklin from which the foe would come probably before too long the air of southern peachtree province was warm and moist with spring it would have been sweet with spring too but for the presence of josephs army and its encampment by the little town of borders not even the sweetest spring air could outdo thousands of slit trenches and tens of thousands of unwashed soldiers one of josephs wing commanders came up to him some said roastbeef william had got his nickname from his red red face others from his favorite dish saluting he said good morning your grace is it joseph the gamecock asked sardonically well yes sir i think it is william replied unlike a lot of officers who followed king geoffrey he was not a man of breeding he was a skilled tactician and had written the tactical manual both geoffreys soldiers and the southrons used also unlike a lot of geoffreys officers joseph emphatically included he was not a prickly man always sensitive of his honor hed even got on pretty wellas well as anyone couldwith josephs luckless predecessor in command of the army of franklin count thraxton the braggart by the lion gods mane what makes you think so joseph inquired with real if dyspeptic curiosity he pointed south every southron in the worldwell every southron east of the green ridge mountainswho can carry a crossbow or a pike is gathering there with nothing on his mind but stomping us into the mud gods damn me to the seven hells if im sure we can stop them either things could be worse sir roastbeef william said stolidly things bloody well were worse when the southrons chased us up here last fall after they drove us off sentry peak and proselytizers rise i was afraid this whole army would just up and fall to pieces then thunderer smite me if i wasnt i know precisely how bad things were then lieutenant general joseph the gamecock said precisely he pronounced the word with acerbic gusto how could you sir william inquired confusion on his face you werent here then how could i ill tell you how things were so bad king geoffrey felt compelled to lift me from the shelf where he stowed me dust me off and put me back in the service of his kingdom things had to be pretty desperate wouldnt you say for his badtempered majesty to chew his cud of pride and judge a soldier only by his soldierly virtues and not by whose hindquarters he kisses earnest and honest roastbeef william coughed and looked embarrassed sir i wouldnt know anything about that lucky you josephs scorn was withering as drought in high summer three years of war now and ive been on the kings shelf for half that time near enough you were wounded sir william reminded him well what if i was i shed my blood for this kingdom in parthenia province protecting geoffrey in nonesuch and what thanks did i get i was shoved aside given an impossible assignment by the great river blamed when it turned out i couldnt do the impossible and put out to pasture till thraxton so totally buggered up this campaign even geoffrey couldnt help but notice er yes sir roastbeef william nervously coughed a couple of times then asked sir when the southrons move on marthasville can we hold them out of it we have to joseph said its the biggest glideway junction we have left if we lose it how do we move men and goods between parthenia and the east so we have to make the best fight we can lieutenant general thats all there is to it we have to hold the foe away from marthasville he brightened as much as a man of his temperament could and here comes a man who will help us do it good day to you lieutenant general bell he bowed to the approaching wing commander good day sir bells voice was deep and slow his approach was even slower he stayed upright only with the aid of two crutches and endless determination hed lost a leg leading soldiers forward in the fight by the river of death and hed had his left arm crippled in the northern invasion of the south only a couple of months before that using the crutches was torment but staying flat on his back was worse for him how are you feeling today lieutenant general joseph asked solicitously it hurts bell replied everything hurts joseph the gamecock nodded he recalled bell from the days before hed got hurt when the dashing young officer had made girls sigh all through the north some called bell the lion god come to earth with his long full dark beard and his fiercely handsome features hed lived up to the name hed also lived up to it with his style of fighting hed thrown himself and his men at the southrons and broken them time and again now hed broken himself doing it his features still showed traces of their old good looks but ravaged by pain and blurred by the heroic doses of laudanum he guzzled to try to dull it does the medicine do you any good joseph inquired bell shrugged with his right shoulder only his left arm would not answer some he said without it i should be quite mad as things are i think i am only somewhat mad his chuckle was wintry i have to take ever more of it to win some small relief but my mind is clear i am glad to hear it joseph said he didnt fully believe it laudanum blurred thought as well as pain but it did so more in some men than in others though he carried scars of his own he didnt like to think about what lieutenant general bell had become to hide his own unease he went on roastbeef william and i were just talking about our chances of holding the southrons away from marthasville this campaigning season we had better do it bell said in his dragging tones laudanum was probably to blame for that too but hed reached the right answer here joseph was in no doubt of it whatsoever his wing commander continued the southrons humiliated us at sentry peak and proselytizers rise we have to keep them out of marthasville or we become a laughingstock that wasnt the reason joseph the gamecock wanted to keep general hesmucets army out of marthasville or roastbeef william either but bell wasnt necessarily wrong joseph said by what i hear we humiliated ourselves at proselytizers rise i wouldnt know sir not firsthand bell replied i was ah trying to get used to being lopsided you might say joseph nodded trying not to stare at the pinnedup leg of bells blue pantaloons i believe youre correct sir roastbeef william said count thraxtons spell did not work as hed hoped it might no eh joseph the gamecocks voice dripped sarcasm i never would have noticed why i thought wed be moving from rising rock on to ramblerton next week that is our plan isnt it sir lieutenant general bell said face blank from more than laudanum he wouldnt have recognized irony had it pierced him like iron all right sir roastbeef william saidhe at least got the point joseph was making count thraxtons magic flatout failed it beat us without it why would our men have run from the top of proselytizers rise when they could have held off every southron in the world if only theyd stood their ground still no excuse for that skedaddle bell said no excuse at all you go forward and you fight like a man thats what the gods love you go forward and you fight like a man bell had lived by that and hed nearly died by it too now im in command here and well try things my way joseph thought if we can make the southrons pay and pay and pay for every foot of ground they take maybe all their mechanics and artisans and farmers will get sick of fighting us and let us have our own kingdom its the best hope we have anyhowwere not going to drive them away by force of arms i intend to make the enemy come forward and fight like men he said i intend to make them die like men too in the largest numbers i can arrange lets see if they go on backing avrams plan to crush us into the dust and free all our blonds from the land after theyve spent a while bleeding not chivalrous bell said i dont care joseph the gamecock replied that brought shock to lieutenant general bells face despite the laudanum he poured down joseph repeated it i dont careand by all the gods my friends that is the truth i am here to keep the southrons from snuffing out this kingdom whether i do that or not matters how i do it who cares dont you want the bards singing songs about you hundreds of years after youre dead bell asked dont you want them treating you the same way they treated the heroes of the first conquest the men who crossed the western ocean and threw down the blonds kingdoms i couldnt care less joseph said and shocked bell all over again king geoffrey gave me this job to do he thought i was the right man for it and i aim to show him he was right i aim to show him he was a perfect jackass for not giving me more to do a long time ago roastbeef william said a defensive campaign on our part will be the most expensive for the southrons and the least expensive for us since general hesmucet has far more men than we do we need every advantage we can find where is the valor in letting the enemy dictate the terms of the campaign bell asked where is the sense in attacking the enemy when you are weaker than he joseph the gamecock returned we attacked the southrons at the river of death and prevailed bell said yes and you outnumbered them when you did it too joseph pointed out king geoffrey detached james of broadpaths forceand you with it lieutenant generalfrom duke edward of arlingtons army of southern parthenia and sent it here by glideway to add its weight to the fight without it count thraxton would have been badly outnumbered and wouldnt have attacked slowly bell shook his head you make war most coldbloodedly your grace king geoffrey says the same thing joseph replied as you may have gathered the king and i have a good many differing opinions my opinion is that one makes war for the purpose of defeating the enemy by whatever means are available if that involves wearing him out to the point where he chooses not to fight any more so be it i see no better hope do you he looked from bell to roastbeef william no your grace though i wish i did william said my own view is that the purpose of war is to fight to smash the foe lieutenant general bell said if we could do that nothing would make me happier joseph the gamecock said do you see us doing it against general hesmucet and the host he has assembled by rising rock had bell nodded to that joseph would have lost his temper but the cripple who still wanted to be a soldier shook his big leonine head it is as my comrade says he answered i wish i did but i do not all right then joseph told him we are in accord he had his doubts about that but for once did not state them he made more allowances for bell than for most mencertainly more than he made for king geoffrey that being so i intend to make my fight in the way i mentioned i have sent orders to the north and west to have estateholders get their serfs out to start building fieldworks for us already sir so soon roastbeef william asked in surprise already so soon joseph the gamecock said grimly youre our master tactician lieutenant general so think tactically here if we are going to make this kind of fight shouldnt we get ready for it ahead of time otherwise our soldiers would have to do the digging themselves as the southrons do here i agree with you completely bell said not fitting for detinans to do such labor when we can call on the subjected blonds just so joseph said he was for once as well pleased to have escaped argument unless this campaign very much surprises me we shall need those works if hesmucet thinks he and the southrons can storm straight through us he had better think again bell said i have to be strapped onto a unicorn to stay aboard but i expect i may have one last charge left in me joseph the gamecock was an irascible man yes but also a courtly one he did not care to think about twicemangled lieutenant general bell going at the foe like that but bowed from respect for his courage bell would do it he didnt doubt that in the least bell would in fact surely do it with a song on his lips that didnt mean joseph didnt reckon him somewhere close to mad for even thinking of such a thing but joseph didnt say that either what he did say was let us hope gentlemen that we never have the need for such desperate measures for a wonder neither roastbeef william nor lieutenant general bell disagreed with him from his unicorn general hesmucet looked west to proselytizers rise then north to sentry peak the stony knob that towered above the town of rising rock the autumn before blueclad men who called grand duke geoffrey the rightful king of detina had held both strongpoints the traitors flag red dragon on gold had flown above them even hesmucet as grimly aggressive a warrior as any who followed king avram against the traitors marveled that the northerners had been driven from those heights but now avrams banner the proper royal banner gold dragon on red waved over the high ground hesmucet scratched at his chin he wore a closecropped almost stubbly black beard just beginning to be streaked with gray as he edged into his forties he was not very tall and not very thick through the shoulders but had a lithe sort of wrestlers strength that made him much more dangerous in a melee than he looked he also had a driving energy that was at the moment aimed northwest beside him mounted on a unicorn finer than his own sat lieutenant general george his secondincommand turning to him hesmucet said were going to smash right through the traitors by all the gods may it be so sir george replied but i have my doubts of course you do hesmucet answered why else would they call you doubting george they also called george the rock in the river of death if it hadnt been for the stand his soldiers had made the autumn before thraxton the braggarts men wouldnt just have beaten southron general guildensterns armythey would have annihilated it george had earned all the credit hed got for himself that day hesmucet contemplated general guildensterns fate these days that worthy was chasing blond savages on the trackless steppes of the east he was lucky to have been allowed to remain in king avrams service if going off to the steppes to harry savages counted as luck at any rate that could happen to me if i bungle this campaign general hesmucet thought unusually for a detinan he was named after a blond himself the chieftain whod given the kingdom so much trouble in the war of that did nothing to improve his opinion of blonds and especially of unsubdued blonds as far as he was concerned the only good one was a dead one he brought himself back to the business at hand i had a message by scryer this morning from marshal bart in the west he told doubting george did you indeed george said as if that were a great surprise to him and what did the marshal say that he is moving north today against duke edward of arlington and the army of southern parthenia hesmucet answered thunderer and lion god bring him all success george said hesmucet wondered exactly what the lieutenant general was thinking like duke edward doubting george was a parthenian also like edward he was a serfholding noble unlike edward though hed stayed loyal to avram and the idea of a united detina rather than going into revolt and treason with his province and false king geoffrey did george ever stop to count the cost hed paid one geoffrey had confiscated his lands as avram had confiscated duke edwards estate which lay just across the river from the royal capital at georgetown had george chosen to shout provincial prerogative forever he could have kept his holdingsand the north would have gained a dangerous fighting man george looked north and west too if marshal bart is setting off to tangle with duke edward and the army of southern parthenia dont you suppose its time we paid a social call on joseph the gamecock and the army of franklin ah hesmucet said that must be what this little assemblage here is all about again doubting george spoke as if in surprise well who would ever have thought of such a thing this time hesmucet looked back over his shoulder the entire might of his force was mustered there unicornriders aboard mounts whose horns were shod with polished iron pikemen whose spearheads gleamed in the bright spring sun endless regiments of crossbowmen with shortswords on their hips to give them something with which to fight in case they shot their bolts and missed mages riding asses the soldiers tunics and pantaloons and the mages robes were all of one shade of gray or another hundreds of colorbearers carried the red dragon on gold great columns of assdrawn supply wagons and siege engines on wheeled carriages completed the immense warlike host are we ready hesmucet asked george youre the general commanding sir doubting george replied hesmucet cocked his head to one side studying the reply george wished marshal bart had named him not hesmucet commander over all of king avrams armies east of the green ridge mountains he made no bones about that but was he so jealous and resentful as to be unable to serve as hesmucets chief subordinate hed better not be hesmucet thought if he is ill find somebody else and i wont waste a heartbeat before i do for now he gave george the benefit of the doubt thats right he said i am lets go then he waved to the mounted trumpeters just behind him their polished bugles gleamed like gold under the strong spring sun as they raised them to their lips the first thrilling notes of the detinan royal hymn blared forth a moment later a great cheer from the long column of grayclad soldiers drowned out the hymn forward hesmucet shouted trying to make himself heard above the din forward against the traitors those of his men who did hear him cheered louder than ever in the manner of a northern noble doubting george made his unicorn rear and paw the air with its forelegs that too wrung a cheer from the soldiers hesmucet who was only an ordinary rider himself found the stunt showy and artificial again he wondered whether george was trying to show him up again he gave his secondincommand the benefit of the doubt i wonder if joseph the gamecock has these worries he thought as he began to ride north i know thraxton the braggart did but then thraxton worried about every officer under his command he did everything he could to make every officer under his command hate him too just as well for the rightful kings cause that thraxton never came close to realizing it thraxton these days was back in nonesuch giving king geoffrey advice the two of them got on well however much trouble both of them had getting along with anybody else they deserve each other hesmucet thought youre not dividing up the force lieutenant general george remarked no im not hesmucet agreed i dont know where in the seven hells well end up having to fight wherever it is i want to strike as hard a blow as i can with my men good doubting george said when guildenstern marched north from rising rock last fall he split his army into three parts were lucky count thraxton didnt destroy us in detail losing the battle by the river of death was bad but that would have been even worse ive got a whole swarm of scouts out ahead of us hesmucet said if joseph wants to try to ambush me i wish him joy of it he wont have an easy time of it george agreed but he has his own scouts too you know hesmucet nodded sourly every single godsdamned northerner who sees us is a scout for joseph the godsdamned gamecock he said and waved in the direction of a woman planting crops in a field her husbands probably fighting for geoffrey and she probably has ways of getting news to his commanders too true george said the other thing youll notice in country where weve been around for a while is that youll see almost no blonds in the fields they will all have abandoned their lands and their liege lords and run off to us i know hesmucet replied and gods damn me to the hells if i know whether thats a good thing or not lieutenant general i have no great use for blonds i never have and i probably never will i dont know what the devils were going to do with all these northern blonds if they arent going to be serfs any more and if anybody including king avram himself has any clearer notion it would come as a great surprise to me doubting george chuckled you sound more like a northern aristocrat than many a northern aristocrat ive heard if you feel that way why didnt you side with grand duke geoffrey against king avram some few southrons did and theyre all traitors too and they all deserve to be crucified for treason right along with geoffrey hesmucet ground out its very simple as far as im concerned there is only one kingdom of detina one mind you not two or three or twelve or twentyseven and theres no doubt whatsoever that avram is the rightful king of detina as far as i can see that settles that im a simple man i dont much believe in or care about complicated arguments any man who calls himself simple opens himself to suspicion in my view george said if someone else calls him simple simple he may be if he calls himself simple simple he is not for if he were he would not see that there was any other possibility hmm after thinking about it for a little while hesmucet took off his gray felt hat and scratched his head thats a little too unsimple for me is it youll forgive me sir but i have my doubts about that doubting george said he hadnt got his nickname by accident from everything hesmucet could see he had his doubts about everything after a moment he went on and things generally arent quite so clear as you make them out to be if youll be kind enough to forgive me that as well no eh now hesmucet bristled he didnt care to be told he was or even might be mistaken about anything how not well sir if you reckon blonds worthless for anything but serfdom how is it that you have some thousands of them serving in the various regiments of your army they arent all good soldiers by any means having taken a position hesmucet was not a man to retreat from it even in the face of long odds no doubt youre right sir for a moment lieutenant general george sounded like the northern noble he was most dangerous when most polite but then would you say all the ordinary detinans fighting for king avram are good soldiers only a fool would say all of them are and i hope im not that particular kind of fool hesmucet replied i will say though that more detinans make good soldiers than is true for the blonds were warriors in the blood and theyre not he stuck out his chin and defied doubting george to disagree with him and doubting george didntnot at least in so many words he did murmur surely the chieftain for whom youre named would have some remarks on that subject hesmucets ears grew hot hesmucet the blond had been as fierce a warrior as any ever born whether of his kind or among the swarthy detinans george added these northern blonds you must recall have been raised as serfs if you untie a man whos been tightly bound do you not expect to see the marks of the rope on his flesh for a time well well hesmucet said i didnt think you were a blondlover sir he wondered if hed gone too far in a different tone of voice that could have been a deadly insult as things were george only shrugged and remarked some of them i assure you are quite lovable he took his hands from the reins for a moment to shape an hourglass in the air hesmucet laughed well maybe so i have heard stories along those lines i suspect you would know better than i though how had doubting george amused himself on his estate in parthenia did he use the labor of any young serfs who looked like him george didnt answer any of that instead he counterattacked you had your chances too sir didnt you dont i remember that you were teaching in a military collegium near old capet when grand duke geoffrey took the northern provinces out of detina i was indeed hesmucet replied but what you also need to remember is that i had my wife along with me while i was there i see george said yes that could matter it would make more difference to some than to others i suppose which sort are you lingered behind his words im not general guildenstern if thats what youre wondering hesmucet said few men are doubting george replied i know of at least one pretty little blond girl in rising rock whom marshal barthe was only general bart then of courseturned down flat not that she was so flat herself you understand and not that guildenstern had turned her down before either im not surprised bart turned her down hesmucet said he really is enamored of his wife shethe blond girlwas quite miffed george said marshal barts wife would have been had things gone otherwise turned me down flat the maid kept saying lets see if we can turn the traitors down flat hesmucet said and his secondincommand nodded agreement hesmucet wondered if george had tried to soothe the blond girls wounded feelings bold as he was he lacked the nerve to ask captain gremio was still getting used to wearing epaulets on both shoulders hed spent the first two and a half years of the war as captain ormerods lieutenant in this company of crossbowmen recruited from in and around karlsburg the capital and chief town of palmetto province but ormerod had stopped a crossbow quarrel trying to stem the northerners rout at proselytizers rise and so the company had been in gremios hands ever since hed finally even got the rank that went with company command not all the other officers in colonel florizels regiment approved of gremios promotion his lip curled he had a long thin intelligent faceand a gift for making his lip curl and assuming other expressions at need he was a reasonably successful barrister in karlsburg his success in his chosen field kept his brother officers from making their sneers too open but it also guaranteed that the sneers would be there almost all those putative brothers were noblemen liege lords owners of broad estates and overlords of serfs sometimes by the dozen sometimes by the thousand they looked down their noses at him because he made his living by his own wits and not from the sweat of blond brows he looked down his nose at them because they were for the most part blockheads of the purest ray serene he also envied them because in the society of the north acquiring an estate full of hardworking serfs was the beall and endall he was a hardworking curiosity the nobles in their opinion and his as well were the salt of the earth good morning colonel florizel he called tipping his hat as the regimental commander limped by and a good day to you as well captain florizel though a belted earl did treat gremio as if he were of noble blood himself gremio couldnt find fault with the regimental commander over that and gremio was a man who before the war began had made his living by finding fault hows your leg your excellency he asked now well itll never be what it was earl florizel replied hed been wounded in the battle by the river of death the autumn before and hadnt been able to get about for some time afterwards even now he looked as if he would be more comfortable leaning on a stick but he went on if lieutenant general bell can lead a wing without a leg i suppose i can try to lead a regiment with a sore one bells courage is an example to us all gremio agreed he had a lower opinion of lieutenant general bells brains but kept that to himself it didnt change the point colonel florizel was trying to make florizel snapped his fingers speaking of wing commanders that reminds me youll be pleased to hear that leonidas the priest has returned to command a wing of the army of franklin i will captain gremio said in real surprise why colonel florizel had big bushy eyebrows they fluttered now like moths trying to escape from his forehead why ill tell you why captain because having a hierophant of the lion god leading our soldiers will surely lead the god to support us with claws and fangs surely gremio said being a barrister he had practice disguising his tone and florizel would think he had agreement not sarcasm in mind indeed sir leonidas the priest is a very holy and pious man he certainly is florizel said and any man dismissed from his command by thraxton the braggart has to have more going for him than meets the eye hmm i hadnt thought of that youve got a point your excellency no doubt about it gremio said that he meant but it remained one of the all too few points in leonidas favor as far as he was concerned the hierophant of the lion god was a holy and pious man as far as gremio could see though neither holiness nor piety was an essential soldierly virtue of those virtues leonidas had displayed very few thraxton was a disaster for this armya disaster i tell you florizel said i do hope count joseph will be able to pick up the pieces and shape us into a decent fighting force once more so do i gremio said hed better if he doesnt this whole eastern land is lost to king geoffrey and i dont see how he can hope to hold off king avram without it avram is a tyrant the gods hate him florizel growled gremio nodded he certainly agreed with that and knew hardly anyone from palmetto province who didnt his home province had been the first to renounce allegiance to avram and fall in behind geoffreys banner after a ruminative pause colonel florizel continued but as you say captain geoffrey does need land of which to be the king we shall have to do everything in our power to hold back general hesmucet then hell have more men than we do gremio said gloomily the southrons always have more men than we doexcept at the river of death and count thraxton frittered away what we won there they may have more men but we have better mages florizel said we have to have strong sorcery at our disposal for we need it to keep the serfs subdued the southrons are a land of shopkeepers and peddlers what need have they for the true practice of magecraft the true practice of magecraft is a very fine and important thing gremio said what weve had everyone denies it but everyone knows we lost at proselytizers rise because thraxton bungled his spells one of them was supposed to come down on the southrons heads but landed on our poor men instead and sent them running off to be shot down like partridges i have heard that florizel said i was not close by at the time of the battle so i cant testify as to its truth gremio smiled spoken like a barrister sir from you captain i will take that for a compliment the regimental commander replied with a smile of his own there are other men you will understand who would use it intending something else yes sir gremio said resignedly he knew people sneered at men who practiced law he never had quite understood why without barristers and solicitors how would men who disagreed solve their problems by going to war with one another thats how he thought some wars were necessarythis one for example since king avram insisted on trampling down longestablished law and custom in the northern provinces but most arguments were or could be settled more readily than that colonel florizel tipped his hat and took his leave still favoring that leg in an odd sort of way the wound hed taken by the river of death might have saved his life major thersites whod taken over the regiment while florizel couldnt fight had died on the forward slopes of sentry peak vainly trying to hold back fighting josephs southrons florizel was a brave man he might easily have perished there himself gremio missed thersites even less than he missed captain ormerod the major had been a swampcountry baron hed claimed he was a baron at any rate and he was a good enough man of his hands that no one ever challenged him on it but all hed done besides aping and envying his betters was criticize and carp at them a little of that was bracing a lot of it was like drinking vinegar all the time gremio wondered in which of the seven hells the unlamented thersites soul currently resided leonidas the priest in charge of a wing again gremio saideven easier and more enjoyable to resent a live man than a dead one for a live man might yet offend afresh where a dead mans affronts were fixed immutable after a moment though gremio shrugged the army of franklin hadnt performed noticeably better without leonidas than it had with him presumably that meant his return wouldnt hurt the army much someone coughed behind gremio as if tired of waiting to be noticed gremio turned oh sergeant thisbe he said what is it the companys first sergeant was a lean young man who unusually for a detinan kept his cheeks and chin shaved smooth gremio approved of him he did his job competently and without any fuss i was just wondering sir he said now if the colonel had any word on when wed be moving out of winter quarters the sooner i can prepare the men the better quite right quite right gremio said approvingly but no joseph the gamecock has yet to issue any orders along those lines all right sir thisbe said i expect well know when general hesmucet starts moving north against us i should hope so gremio exclaimed this is our country after all when the enemy moves through it the people always let us hear what hes up to yes sir the sergeant said same as the blonds do for the foe with us eryes gremio said it wasnt so much that thisbe was wrong the sergeant in fact made a real and important point good of you to think of that here in the north detinans were so used to thinking of their serfs as hewers of wood and drawers of water they too readily forgot blonds were men like any others with eyes to see wits to think and tongues to speak i hear weve got serfs digging trenches and making earthworks for us from here all the way up to marthasville sergeant thisbe said do you really suppose sir that some of them wont tell the southrons as much of what were up to as they can figure out no i dont suppose anything of the sort even had gremio supposed anything of the sort he wouldnt have admitted it a barrister never admitted anything he didnt have to he went on we do try to keep as many blonds from escaping as we can you know im sure the general commanding is doing his best to make sure no really important information gets to hesmucet i hope so thisbes light tenor could be remarkably expressive here the sergeant packed a world of doubt into three words gremio wouldnt have wanted to go to court against a barrister with such dangerous skills before he could say sohe would have meant it as nothing but praisehorns blared summoning the regiment to assembly no not just the regiment the whole brigade maybe even the whole army those horns were blaring all over the encampment in and around borders we can talk about this more another time sergeant gremio said for now weve got to round up the men he spoke of them as if they were so many sheep he sometimes thought of them that way too though he was careful not to let them know it he had to keep their respect after all yes sir thisbe saluted the sergeant went about the job with quiet but unhurried competence gremio wondered what hed done in or around karlsburg before taking service with king geoffreys army he didnt know unlike most of his men thisbe didnt talk much about what hed done or what he hoped to do he just did whatever needed doing and did it well thanks in no small part to him gremios company was among the first in colonel florizels regiment to assemble small farmers tradesmen shopkeepersby now after three years of war telling at a glance what a soldier had been was a hopeless unwinnable game despite individual differences all the men looked very much alike lean sunbrowned poorly groomed dirty wearing blue uniforms in no better shape than they were some of those blue tunics and pantaloons had started life as gray tunics and pantaloons and been taken from southrons who didnt need them any more and then dyed some few gray pantaloons hadnt been dyed at all that went against orders but happened nonetheless a nasty frowzy crew would have been the first thought of anyone seeing gremios companyor very likely any company in the army of franklin but a second thought would have followed hard on its heels these men can fight florizel limped out in front of the regiment he carried a folded sheet of paper and ostentatiously unfolded it to draw the mens attention a nice bit of business gremio thought resolving to use it in the courtroom one day men of palmetto province florizel boomed we were first in our rejection of that godsdamned maniac who calls himself king avram and sits in the black palace in georgetown like a hovering vulture waiting for the north to die so he may feast on our dead flesh and crack our bones now once more his wicked armies advance on us and we must be among the first to throw them back they raised a cheer gremio found himself cheering too he wondered why theyd all had countless chances to be maimed or killed now florizel was telling them they were about to get more and instead of cursing him they cheered if they werent utterly mad gremio had never heard of anyone who was men of detina brave men patriots florizel went on there are two gaps through which the cursed southrons might attack us we shall beat them back from both we shall not let them ravage peachtree province we shall not let them steal from us the great city of marthasville the gods love king geoffrey our cause is just provincial prerogative forever provincial prerogative forever the men shouted gremios voice was loud among them the army of franklin was in good spirits if nothing else however much that would help in the fight against hesmucet joseph the gamecock had it working in his favor lieutenant general bell reached for his crutches getting out of a chair was a struggle for a man with one leg and one good arm but he managed the trick was to lunge forward and upward gain momentary balance get one crutch under his good arm for a second point of support and then get the other crutch under his bad arm under the worthless piece of flesh and bone that hung from his shoulder but would never be good for anything again oh its good for something he thought as he swung himself forward and ducked his way out of his pavilion its good for causing me pain the shattered shoulder still felt as if it had melted led poured into the joint it hurt even worse than the stump of his leg and the festering in his thigh had almost taken his life there after the fight by the river of death he remembered the stink of the pus after theyd drained it the chirurgeons assured him that was all over now they assured him of that yes but why did he still hurt then why in the end didnt matter so much that he still hurt that mattered he paused steadied himself on his crutches and used his good hand to extract the bottle of laudanum he always carried with him bringing the bottle up to his mouth he extracted the cork with his teeth he swigged laudanum wasnt made to be swigged it was made to be taken by the drop bell didnt care drops didnt come close to making his torment retreat spirits and distilled poppy juice fire and night going down his throat together after a little while he grunted softly and said ahhh the pain didnt disappear it never disappeared but it receded or more accurately he floated away from it the laudanum didnt make him sleepy as it did with many men if anything it left him more awake than ever but it did make him slow so that he often had to grope for a word or an idea all around him the army of franklins encampment bubbled like a pot left unwatched on a cookfire a squadron of unicorns trotted off toward the south a column of men tramped away heading southeast joseph the gamecock was doing everything he could to hold back general hesmucets bigger army everything he could to hold it back yes lieutenant general bell muttered something his bushy beard and mustaches fortunately swallowed hed never been one for hanging back he wanted to go at the enemy not try to keep him away from a city what kind of war was that josephs kind of war he answered his own question he muttered again rather louder a sentry gave him an odd look he glowered back the man dropped his eyes his aidedecamp a dour major named zibeon came up to him and asked what do you need sir now there was a question with a multitude of possible answers a new leg was the first that sprang to bells mind an arm that works followed almost at once not far behind ran a way to banish pain without slowing my wits to a crawl and outdistanced by those three but still galloping hard came a command due my station but zibeon couldnt give him any of those things the first two would have taken a miracle from the gods and the gods doled out miracles in niggardly wise these days the third would have taken a miracle among the healersmore likely but not much as for the fourth that lay in king geoffreys hands lieutenant general bell found himself not altogether without hope there fetch me my unicorn bell said that major zibeon could do that major zibeon plainly did not want to do sir wouldnt you be more comfortable in a buggy he asked no bell snapped so far as it went that was true bell would not be comfortable in a buggy he wouldnt be comfortable anywhere probably not till they laid him on his funeral pyre he might perhaps be less uncomfortable in a buggy but he had no intention of admitting that to his aidedecamp my unicorn is what i asked for major and my unicorn is what i require zibeons long sad face got longer and sadder sir if you were to fall off the beast the result would be unfortunate for you it would also be unfortunate for the kingdom if i may take the liberty of saying so fall off bell echoed in tones of disbelief fall off how in the seven hells can i fall off the godsdamned beast he gestured toward his pinnedup pantaloon leg youve got to tie me aboard the miserable animal to get me to stay on at all does a lashedon sack of beans fall off an ass back my name isnt george major but i doubt it the laudanum took the edge off his temper as it took the edge off his torment it would have left most men as insensitive as they were insensible bell now bell reached for his swordhilt although considering his mobility he would have had a better chance trying to brain any foe with a crutch with a sigh major zibeon yielded let it be exactly as you say lieutenant general he raised his voice shouting for a serf the blond groom fetched the unicorn in short order bell clambered aboard the splendid white beast disdaining help from either the blond or his aidedecamp he wasnt weak even now certain parts were missing sure enough or didnt work as the gods intended but what remained in working order still worked well he tolerated the straps that did indeed make him feel like a sack of beans without them he could not sit the unicorn another general whod served in the army of southern parthenia was known as pegleg dick these days but hed lost his leg below the knee and had enough left to grip a unicorns barrel as he rode even if the peg stuck out at an odd angle and made him instantly recognizable bells leg was off only a few inches below the hip he would never have a peg he would never be able to stay on a unicorn without help either but once helped he could ride he set spurswell spurto the beast it bounded away leaving zibeon and the serf groom behind for a moment bell felt almost like the man hed been before the fights at essoville and the river of death for a moment he felt free and strong and able maybe the laudanum let him forget his wounds a little longer than he would have without it when he reached the house where count joseph made his headquarters he had to untie himself from the saddle hand his crutches down to a waiting soldier and then descend from the unicorn and reclaim the crutches the process was slow laborious and painful almost everything lieutenant general bell did since his maimingno since his maimingsinvolved long slow painful processes joseph the gamecock came out of the house while bell dismounted courteous as a cat the general commanding the army of franklin waited for his wing commander to gather himself before bowing good day lieutenant general joseph said what can i do for you this lovely afternoon is it bell hadnt noticed he attacked conversations as directly as he attacked enemies the southrons are moving indeed they are joseph agreed both hereabouts and in parthenia i am given to understand bell ignored that too parthenia was at the moment outside his purview where do we strike them he demanded we dont joseph the gamecock was every bit as blunt we have been over this ground before you know yes i do know and the more i think about it the more it pains me bell replied some pains sir laudanum does not touch with a sigh joseph the gamecock condescended to explain consider lieutenant general we have to the south of us the rough country of rockface rise there are only two gaps in the rise two places where the southrons can come at us by all the gods i hope they try smashing through the vultures nest or the dogs path if they do well still be killing them there this fall i intend to send your wing to hold the vultures nest that will give you enough bloodshed i vow to satisfy the most sanguinary man ever born killing southrons is all very well bell said stiffly indeed it is better than very well i should hope soits what were here for joseph the gamecock said and when your wing takes its position you will find that the serfs ive set to work have fortified the gap so that not even a mouse could sneak through without paying with its lifenot even a mouse i tell you that is good in its way bell said but only in its way i do not care to fight in the open field as if i were besieged in a castle our whole kingdom is besieged joseph said and we needs must keep the enemy from entering into it we can drive them back lieutenant general bell insisted we can beat them in the open field you may perhaps be right joseph said if the army of franklin were yours to command you might venture the experiment but since king geoffrey has seen fit to entrust it to me i have to do what i believe to be in its best interest and in the best interest of the kingdom do you understand me have i made myself clear enough or shall i scratch pictures in the dirt for you with the point of my sword bell glared at him is that an insult sir only if you choose to take it as one joseph the gamecock retorted his temper was if anything even shorter than bells and he had not the excuse of pain from his wounds for hed been hurt almost two years before and was fully healed his own eyes snapping he went on i reckon it an insult that you challenge the orders of your commanding officer in this unseemly fashion you are welcome to challenge me sir bell said unfortunately as my rank is lower than yours i am forbidden by king geoffreys regulations from challenging you but i assure you sir i will endeavor to give satisfaction i dont want to challenge you you young idiot joseph said testily i want to use you i want to use you to kill the southrons in great whacking lots as they come north in my view that remains our best hope of winning this war to make the enemy too sick of the fight to go on if every other household in new eborac and loveton and horatii is in mourning the people will make king avram give up the fight and let the north go our own way gods grant it be so lieutenant general bell replied a surer way i think is to defeat the invader on the battlefield in open combat that would be easier if we had twice the men he did rather than the other way round joseph the gamecock said i ask you straight out will you defend the vultures nest for me or shall i give the job to roastbeef william or to leonidas the priest i will defend it bell said i fail in no obedience sir but i am a free detinan no less than you i do intend to state my mind really one of josephs expressive eyebrows quirked i never would have noticed very well lieutenant general you are dismissed and i shall rely upon your formidable skills i know you serve the kingdom with a whole heart regardless of how you chance to feel about me yes sir that is true bell agreed because of his crutches he didnt have to salute the commanding general he hitched away struggled aboard his unicorn after stowing his crutches waited for the attendant to tie him on and rode back to his own headquarters once there he sat down inside his pavilion inked a pen and began a letter to a man with whom hed been corresponding ever since becoming one of joseph the gamecocks wing commanders your majesty he wrote i have just come from yet another conversation with the general commanding this one no more satisfactory than any of those i have previously held with him as i have said in my earlier letters my opinion continues to be that the army offranklin is in better condition and more capable of offensive operations than count joseph believes how can any man doubt the fire inherent in the hearts of our brave northern soldiers and their innate superiority to the southron foe we could and we should go forth against the enemy instead of waiting for him to come to us he inked the pen again paused for thought and then continued as proof of the straits to which the southrons are reduced i need do no more than note that in the army now moving against us general hesmucet has mixed promiscuously through its ranks several brigades worth of blonds if the fighting spirit of the southrons were not all but extinct would they resort to such a desperate expedient surely not your majesty surely not in the hope that the gods grant you the good fortune and victory you deserve i have the honor to remain your most humble and obedient servant after signing the letter he sealed it with his personal signet addressed it and called for a runner see that this gets into the post to nonesuch without delay he told the man its existence is of course completely confidential of course sir the courier replied rollant was glad to be marching north marching against the detinan noblemen the detinan liege lords who would have left the kingdom when avram proposed freeing their serfs from the land they tilled he sang the detinan royal hymn with particular fervor as he tramped along it meant he thought more to him than to many of his comrades you cant sing worth a lick smitty told him the two crossbowmen had fought side by side ever since the regiment formed a year or so before smitty came off a farm outside the great city of new eborac he was a typical enough detinan on the stocky side swarthy with black hair and eyes and a shaggy black beard i dont care rollant answered i have fun trying nobody who listens to you has any fun smitty assured him dont listen then rollant said sing sing he did himself loudly enthusiastically and probably not very well he lived in new eborac with his wife and little boy he made a good enough living as a carpenter or had in peacetime thus far he seemed a typical enough detinan himself thus farand no further he wore gray tunic and pantaloons like smitty like everyone else around him there their resemblance ended rollant was fairskinned and blueeyed with hair and beard yellow as butter hed grown up on a feudal estate in palmetto province not far outside karlsburgand had fled the land to which he was legally bound fled south to new eborac where serfdom had long been extinct about ten years before his wife was born in the south and had never known a liege lords exactions thanks to norina rollant had his letters smitty said suppose i tell you to shut the hells up or ill pop you one talk is cheap rollant answered you want to try and do something about it after march today you come right ahead and see what kind of welcome you get smitty was his friend or as close to a friend as a blond could have among detinans theyd fought shoulder to shoulder theyd saved each other a couple of times but rollant didnt dare take a challenge like that lightly and he wasnt sure whether or how much smitty was joking i have to be twice as good twice as tough as an ordinary detinan to get myself reckoned half as good half as tough rollant had had that thought so many times it hardly sparked resentment in him any more it was part of what being a blond in a blackhaired land meant a lot of detinans thought blonds couldnt wouldnt fight for beans the detinans ancestors had crossed the western ocean centuries before and promptly subjected the kingdoms full of blonds they found in the north of this new landand the more scattered hunters and farmers who lived farther south the campaigns were monotonously onesided from which the detinans inferred that blonds were and always would be a pack of spineless cowards they had iron weapons we had bronze they rode unicorns wed never seen them beforewe had assdrawn chariots they knew how to make fancy siege engines we didnt their mages were stronger than ours their gods were stronger than ours no wonder we went down like barley under the scythe like almost all blonds in the kingdom of detina these days rollant reverenced the thunderer and the lion god and the rest of the detinan pantheon he knew the names of the gods his own ancestors had worshippedor of some of them anyhow he still believed in those gods he believed in them but he didnt reverence them what point to that the blonds gods had been as thoroughly beaten as their former votaries never mind smitty said and started blatting out the royal hymn himself rollant howled like a wolf youre worse than i amto the seven hells with me if youre not to the seven hells with you anyway smitty said cheerfully he kept on singing sergeant joram winced lion gods hairy ears smitty stuff a sock in it you couldnt carry a tune in a knapsack sergeant smitty said reproachfully but he did quiet down i told you you couldnt sing too rollant said would you listen to me i wouldnt listen to joram if he werent my sergeant smitty answered thats what being a free detinan is all about the only person you have to listen to is yourself most of the time by the gods i know that rollant said why do you think i ran away from my liege lords estate i got sick of having somebody else tell me what to do all the time wouldnt you before smitty could answer joram went on and you rollant you sound like a cat just after its tail got stepped on thank you sergeant rollant said sweetly under his breath he said something else something less polite smitty guffawed sergeant joram sent them both suspicious looks then went off to harass somebody else smitty said ill tell you something back before the war i didnt have any idea what being a serf was like we havent had anybody tied to the land since before my pa was born not in new eborac we havent but this whole business of soldiering of having somebody telling you what to do just on account of hes got himself a higher rank than yoursit sticks in the craw it surely does rollant didnt particularly like taking orders either not when hed run away from baron ormerod to escape them by the mad fortune of war ormerod had almost killed him in the skirmishing before the battle by the river of death and he had killed his former liege lord not long after gaining the top of proselytizers rise he couldnt think of many things of which he was more proud still smitty needed an answer rollant did his best to give him one its not the same there are rules here liege lords the only rules they have are the ones they make up if you lose a trowel and your liege lord decides to flay the hide off your back with a whip for it whos to say he cant nobody if you give him a sour look afterwards and he whips you again wholl stop him nobody hell say he reckoned you were plotting an uprising and he doesnt have to say anything past that or if he thinks your sister is pretty or your wife they really do that smitty said of course they really do that rollant said baron ormerod he was a regular tomcat amongst the serf huts why not if your mother was a serf youre a serf too even if you do look like your liege lord thats a pretty filthy business all right smitty said with a shrug rollant answered whoevers on top is going to give it to whoevers on the bottom he used a gesture that showed exactly what he meant by give it to smitty clucked in delicious horror rollant went on if wed licked you detinans a long time ago youdve ended up slaving for us but thats not what the gods had in mind and so it didnt happen smitty grunted he plainly didnt like thinking about mighthavebeens but then he wagged a finger at rollant youve got no business talking about you detinans if youre not one yourself then whats king avram been fussing and fuming about all this time if youre not one yourself what are you what am i rollant echoed it was a good question he spoke detinan he followed detinan gods avram did want to free his people from their ties to the land and make the law look at them the same way it looked at every other detinan and yet the question had a dreadfully obvious answer what am i just a godsdamned blond thats all and theres plenty of southrons whod say it along with the traitors in the north he wondered if smitty had ever said such a thing probably by everything hed seen and heard there werent a whole lot of detinansordinary godsfearing detinans they would surely call themselveswho didnt say such things in places where they didnt think blonds could hear but smitty didnt mock blonds when rollant could hear him which put him up on a lot of his countrymen what smitty said now was you arent the only blond in king avrams army rollant when we get done licking the northerners with them helping folksll have a lot harder time saying blonds cant fight and if a man can do a proper job of fighting hes on his way to being a real detinan if a man can stand up to a detinan was part of what he meant the detinans had spent centuries forcing blonds down and then wondered that they didnt leap to their feet at once when no longer held down by laws rollant said well theres hagen or there was gods damn hagen and i daresay theyre doing it smitty said on account of hagen weve got lieutenant griff in charge of this company instead of captain cephas and griff isnt half the man the captain was captain cephas turned out to be too much of a man for his own good rollant said if he hadnt messed around with hagens wife corliss didnt need much messing with smitty said rollant couldnt argue that it hadnt been a rape or anything of the sort he felt a certain amount of responsibility for what had happened because hed found the two blonds and their children near rising rock after theyd fled their liege lord hagen had cooked and cut wood and fetched and carried for the company getting paid for his labor for the first time in his life corliss had got paid for doing laundry too she hadnt got paid for warming cephas cot not so far as rollant knew shed just wanted the company commander as hed wanted her and right after the battle of proselytizers rise shed gone into his tentand hagen had followed her with a butcher knife now all three of them were dead cephas had managed to use his sword before falling you cant say hagen didnt act the way any outraged detinan husband would have rollant remarked well no so you cant smitty admitted but i wish to the gods he hadnt done it griff squeaks when he talks gods damn it his voice went into falsetto for a moment to imitate the young lieutenant they tramped on theyd come this way before on the way to what turned out to be the fight by the river of death they had a bigger army now and it was all together not scattered into several detachments they also had general hesmucet leading them now not harddrinking general guildensternsurely a gain even so rollant made sure his crossbow and quiver of bolts were where he could grab them in a hurry a cheer started somewhere behind him he looked back over his shoulder trying to see what was going on and almost tripped over the feet of the man in front of him that put his mind back on what really needed doing but hed seen enough and started cheering too whats going on smitty asked doubting george is coming up rollant answered in his normal voice then he shouted some more huzzah huzzah huzzah for the rock in the river of death smitty cheered too and waved his hat lieutenant general george rode up alongside the marching men on a fine unicorn he smiled at them and called hello boys when we finally get our hands on those stinking northerners are we going to whip em right out of their boots hells yes you bet we will lieutenant general nobody can stop us long as youre along for the ride the men yelled lots of things like that rollant wasnt behindhand in shouting georges praises either nobody whod been through the fight by the river of death whod watched doubting georges defense of merkles hill after the rest of the army was routed would ever greet him with anything less than heartfelt praise george tipped his hat to the soldiers well win because weve got the best fighters in the world he said and rode on more cheers echoing behind him you know what the funny thing is smitty said you mean besides you rollant returned smitty made a face at him but refused to be distracted whats funny is doubting george talks like a stinking northerner himself he did his best to put on a northern twang as he spoke his best was none too good rollant considered he just talks he said at last georges parthenian accent wasnt that much different from the one he had himself you think i sound like a stinking northerner sometimes smitty said but anybody can see why you got the devils out of there george hes a nobleman he had estates with serfs on em himself but he didnt turn traitor along with geoffrey and the rest hes loyal to detina rollant raised an eyebrow why should that be so hard for a detinan to understand smitty gave him a dirty look you like to try and twist everything i say dont you of course rollant said gravely if i didnt what would you have to complain about huh smitty said you ought to be a sergeant the way you think me rollants voice squeaked in surprise there were a few blond corporals and sergeants in king avrams army but only a few detinansordinary detinansdidnt take kindly to the idea of obeying orders from blonds but smitty answered stranger things have happened maybe rollant didnt sound convinced but he did like the idea now that he thought about it maybe he repeated in an altogether different tone of voice ii doubting george had seen a good many strong positions in his day the one joseph the gamecock held here in southeastern peachtree province looked as formidable as any and more so than most well have a demon of a time breaking in he told general hesmucet that ridge line shelters the enemy almost as well as proselytizers rise did and i know joseph hell have fortified the gaps till a flea couldnt get through them let alone an army i know joseph too hesmucet replied and ive got no doubt that youre right if we put our head into one of those gaps well be asking the terrible jaws of death to close on it you have a gift for the picturesque phrase sir george replied wondering if hesmucet also had a gift for hard fighting marshal bart must have thought so or he wouldnt have left hesmucet in command here in the east when he was summoned to georgetown to oppose duke edward of arlington and the army of southern parthenia no he would have left me george thoughtnot with a great deal of bitterness but some seemed inescapable general hesmucet didnt look unduly worried joseph the gamecock is strong here but i think we can shift him he said i hope youre right sir lieutenant general george looked at the forbidding terrain ahead i have to say though i have my doubts if we try to go straight at them theyll give us lumps who said anything about going straight at them hesmucet replied joseph the gamecock is strong herewhat better reason not to hit him here ah doubting george heard the enthusiasm return to his voice what have you got in mind then sir up about twenty miles northeast of here is a valley called viper river gap the general commanding answered if we can push a force through there well march right into caesar square in josephs rear hell have to retreat well smash him up this part of the war will be won and well all be heroes as simple as that george said dryly as simple as that hesmucet agreed as simple as that provided the gamecock doesnt make it more complicated he may id be a liar if i said anything else but its the best chance i can see of getting joseph out of the position hes taken not a bad notion at all sir george said hed proposed something not too different back in the middle of winter nothing had come of thathe wasnt the general commanding but he still thought the plan good no matter who ended up with the credit for it only one thing how do we fix joseph here while we shift part of our army toward the gap and caesar hesmucet looked faintly embarrassed an unusual expression for him some large part of our army will have to stay here by borders while the rest slides north some large part of our army eh george said why do i think i have a pretty fair notion of which large part of the army you have in mind youve proved you know how to make a convincing demonstration against strong enemy positions hesmucet said is that what ive proved doubting george wondered i thought it was just a knack for banging my head against a stone wall and also a knack for being ordered to bang my head against a stone wall he added to himself your men were the ones who broke through at proselytizers rise hesmucet said who knows maybe theyll do it again and steal the glory from brigadier james youll send james the birds eye on the flanking move george said i will indeed general hesmucet grinned who better to see the opportunity if it be there james had got his nickname at the military collegium at annasville because of his extraordinarily keen eyesight hes an able officer george allowed why not use him to make the demonstration here and send the larger force up onto josephs flank i thought about that hesmucet replied it seems to me that were i to do so joseph would realize what i had done and shift footsoldiers north to block the move before it could have any hope of success doubting george considered he wasnt sure general hesmucet was right about that but he wasnt sure hesmucet was wrong either very well sir he said i shall of course do whatever you require of me i knew you would hesmucet said in tones suggesting hed known no such thing i intend to get james the birds eye moving this afternoon your men will i hope keep joseph the gamecock too busy to use his own eyes well do our best sir george said that being the only thing he could say no almost the only thing for he couldnt help adding i do wish my men would sometimes get the command to do themselves rather than to help their comrades do somewhere else that day is coming lieutenant general hesmucet said you may rely on it that day is coming its a hundred miles more or less from here to marthasville only the gods know how many battles well fight before we get there im no god im just a man but i can tell you well fight a lot of them and i can tell you your men will have their chance to do great things they can hardly help it wouldnt you agree put that way i dont see how i can do anything but agree doubting george plucked at his long thick beard which was just beginning to be frosted with gray you plan an ambitious campaign marshal bart aims at the traitor realms head in his move against nonesuch hesmucet replied me i intend to tear out its heart a kingdom cant live without a head and no more can it live without a heart if we take both of them away from false king geoffrey what has he got left wind and air lieutenant general wind and air and nothing else but and not even a windbag like geoffrey can make a kingdom from wind and air alone i do not for a moment disagree with you sir its only that doubting george had to pause and marshal his thoughts before he could continue its only that the first three summers of this war we were fighting battles one of our armies would collide with an enemy force wed fight and then we would see what happened next herehe paused to think againhere the battles are just incidents parts of something bigger that you and marshal bart have in mind and king avram hesmucet said never forget king avram i wouldnt dream of it george said if it werent for king avram we wouldnt have a war right now not right now hesmucet said but we would have fought a war over serfdom sooner or later we almost did ten years ago till daniel the weaver henry feet of clay and john the typhoon worked out the compromise that satisfied king zachary and the northern nobles both but it didnt satisfy anyone for long this fight was coming now that its here we have to win it fair enough george said he went off to confer with his own subordinates his wing commander brigadier absalom the bear wore a long face we can do what you want sir he rumbled in the bass growl that helped give him his sobriquet we can do it sure enough but we wont get through and we will get mangled we have to try it george replied for the sake of the army as a whole he turned to brigadier brannan who commanded all his siege engines and dart throwers what can you do to make our job easier easier not fornicating much sir brannan was a man who spoke his mind absalom has it right were going to get mangled the most i can hope to do is mangle a few more traitors than we would otherwise all right do that doubting george said we commence this afternoon give us the best chance you can at the appointed hour horns blared all of brigadier brannans engines brought forward to bear on the trenches protecting the northerners began to shoot at once stones and firepots flew through the air so did streams of darts from repeating crossbows columns of smoke marked where firepots struck home georges wizards in long gray robes to match the southron soldiers uniform tunics and pantaloons sent bolts of lightning down from a clear sky onto the enemys heads had joseph the gamecocks troopers just taken their positions the bombardment and the sorcerous assault might have driven them off but theyd had daysweeksin which to ready themselves for the assault they must have thought likely darts and firepots and levinbolts no doubt slew some of the northerners but had not a prayer of dislodging them from their field fortifications doubting george sighed hed expected nothing different general hesmucet had expected nothing different either if he was going to keep joseph the gamecock from looking north and west toward james the birds eyes column advancing on caesar he would have to make a convincing assault on the vultures nest and the dogs path a convincing assault would also be an expensive assault with another sigh lieutenant general george nodded to the trumpeters standing close by him forward he said their martial music blared out obedient to his will the southrons hurled themselves at the two gaps in rockface rise king avram the soldiers shouted and freedom and one detina now and forever doubting george believed in all those things especially the last if he hadnt believed in a united detina with all his soul he would have gone with king geoffrey gone with the province of parthenia instead instead in the name of a united detina im sending hundreds thousands of young men forward in an attack i know and they probably also know has no chance of getting through he thought i had better be right thats all regardless of whether he was right about the cause he served he rapidly proved right about the attacks chances joseph and his wing commanders and brigadiers were every bit as capable as the southrons facing them exactly as capable doubting george thought how could it be otherwise when we all studied side by side together at the military collegium the men who wore blue and had followed king geoffrey away from detina struck back and struck back hard as soon as georges soldiers came into range at the vultures nest where he watched the assault neither bombardment nor sorcerous assault had silenced the northerners catapults and repeating crossbows they scythed through the southrons ranks as did the quarrels from the crossbowmen in the trenches across the mouth of the vultures nest absalom the bear came back to him in something of a temper sir may i withdraw the men now if i keep sending them forward for long enough the traitors will kill every last one of them and then where will we be in the front rank i assume george said mildly his wing commander gaped at him he went on no you may not withdraw them brigadier as you know their purpose is not to break through but to distract it had better not be to break through absaloms voice was hot we havent a prayer of breaking through any more than we did at he hesitated at proselytizers rise you were going to say doubting george smiled absalom the bear didnt he looked positively bedeviled by bees that was thraxton the braggarts magic going wrong otherwise wed have been battered there too as if to prove him right northern wizards struck at the men in gray trying to get into the vultures nest their lightningsmost of their spellswere more potent than those of the southrons their magecraft been honed in keeping their blond serfs afraid and subjected in the south spells went into manufactories and werent so readily adaptable to war runners brought back reports of how the fight was going at the dogs path as far as doubting george was concerned they hardly needed to have come the southrons had no more luck breaking through joseph the gamecocks defenses there than at the vultures nest he hadnt expected better news but he had hoped for it not all hopes were realized wounded men came back past him in a steady stream some were walking clutching wounded arms or roughly bandaged about the head others lay on litters some still and silent others writhing and screaming out their torment to the world at large the hot iron stink of blood grew stronger as the day wore on so that the battlefield took on the reek of a vast outdoor butchers shopwhich in a manner of speaking it was the setting sun shone red as blood too when at last it touched the western horizon george spoke again to the trumpeters sound the recall weve done everything we can do today as the notes that surely must have relieved his army rang out he called for a messenger when the runner trotted up to him he said go ask general hesmucet if what weve done here today has been worth it saluting the young man dashed off he returned half an hour later with twilight deepening saluting again he said the commanding generals compliments sir and he says this attack did just what it was supposed to do good doubting george said considering what we paid id hate to see it wasted joseph the gamecock was about as happy as a man of his dour temperament could be we held them he said to anyone who would listen as twilight deepened around him by all the gods we held them he was as bubbly as if hed been drinking sparkling wine his good mood even survived the arrival of a runner who said sir the scryers need to see you right away im coming joseph replied the way i feel right now id come even if it were king geoffrey looking at me out of the crystal ball geoffrey was his sovereign he gave the king all due obedience that didnt keep him from thinking his majesty had not a clue concealed anywhere about his person when it came to running a war but it wasnt geoffreys face in the crystal ball it was one of roastbeef williams brigadiers an officer called husham forkbeard who had charge of the northern garrison up in caesar even in an outstandingly shaggy army hushams whiskers were exceptional at the moment so was his alarmed expression sir youve got to help me he exclaimed the moment he saw joseph the gamecock whats wrong demanded the commander of the army of franklin ill tell you whats wrong sir husham replied whats wrong is weve got a whole great swarm of southrons pouring through viper river gap and coming straight for caesar thats what i am an idiot joseph said softly sir husham forkbeard asked never mind joseph told him which did not stop the commanding general from bitterly reproaching himself of course general hesmucet wasnt so stupid as to think he could break through at the vultures nest or by the dogs path hed made a big noisy demonstration there to keep the army of franklin in its position and then swung part of his own enormous force north on a flanking maneuverand it was liable to work you have to hold him joseph said urgently you have to if he takes caesar hes got the glideway line between us and marthasville we cant afford that the understatement there would do till somebody came up with a bigger one joseph the gamecock suspected that would take a while if he couldnt get supplies up from marthasville the only question was whether the army of franklin ran out of crossbow bolts before or after it started starving joseph didnt care to make the experiment he didnt intend to make the experiment either husham forkbeard asked what am i going to do sir all at once everything became glassy clear for joseph you are going to hold on till the end of tomorrow afternoon he replied you are going to hold on at any cost and at any hazard but you are going to hold on do you understand me brigadier yes sir i understand you fine husham replied the only thing is i dont know if we can do it you will do it joseph said coldly it is not a matter of choice it is obligatory if you run short of firepots and quarrels you will receive the enemy with pikes and shortswords whatever happens however you will not retreat from caesar and you will not yield the glideway line you are to fight to the last man if your soldiers are all slain their ghosts are to continue the struggle heh husham said nervously then he saw that joseph the gamecock was not laughingwas in fact deadly serious husham nodded yes sir stout fellow joseph said i will get reinforcements to you directly you hang on till they arrive thats all he made it sound simple he wished it were simple he knew the problems involved in holding off a substantially larger force hed had to do it in parthenia defending nonesuch against the massive southron attack up the henry river and if i hadnt been wounded there the army of southern parthenia would still be mine and no one very possibly would ever have heard anything much of duke edward of arlington joseph the gamecock shrugged he couldnt do anything about that not now no one could do anything about that now not even the gods dealing with the southron attack at caesar was going to be trouble enough and that was within the theoretical range of things possible hang on he told husham forkbeard once more then he nodded to his scryer the fellow broke the mystical connection between his crystal ball and the one up in caesar hushams shaggy face vanished joseph the gamecock hurried out of the tent shouting for runners he sent one man off to order two brigades north right away the others summoned his wing commanders to him as fast as they could get there roastbeef william arrived first and in a jubilant mood the way the men fought today goes a long way towards redeeming their sorry performance at proselytizers rise he said leonidas the priest came next the lion god favored our arms with victory today he declared i presume he told you afterwards that hed done it joseph murmured the hierophant of the lion god gave him a wounded look but did not reply lieutenant general bell got there lastnot surprising given his wounds but he was as always full of fight now weve shown the southrons they cant come in he said when the sun rises tomorrow we ought to charge out through the gaps and drive them away no joseph the gamecock said i beg your pardon sir bell said eyebrows rising at josephs bluntness count joseph had never been one to suffer fools or even disagreement gladly that is a technical term lieutenant general meaning in essence no bell had a temper of his own why the devils not sir he demanded waving his good arm we can go forth and conquer or we can go forth and be beaten joseph the gamecock said since general hesmucet has close to twice as many men as we do which do you reckon more likely we cant afford a beating like that not when we have marthasville to protect if we beat hesmucet what happens he falls back to rising rock at the most that does us very little good i can see but sir bell tried again no joseph repeated and took no small pleasure at interrupting his insubordinate subordinate and i will give you one more reason lieutenant general a column of southrons is pushing through viper river gap toward caesar twenty miles north of here dont you feel we ought to think just a little about that perhaps even do something about it viper river gap caesar bell brooded for a momentalthough after his pair of dreadful wounds his expression was always brooding at last he said oh that alters the situation just a bit joseph the gamecock could no more resist being waspish than lieutenant general bell could resist charging forward regardless of whether the situation called for it roastbeef william said i wouldnt be surprised if hesmucet didnt attack so hard here to keep us busy while he sent that column up to the north exactly what i was thinking joseph replied as benignly as he could even he had a hard time barking at someone who agreed with him very clever leonidas the priest said by which he no doubt meant he would never have thought of it himself very clever indeed bell said sneaky perfidious underhanded by that he no doubt meant he not only would never have thought of it himself but also reckoned less than chivalrous the enemy who had the only rule you cant break in war is that you must win joseph said bell looked ready to argue but joseph overrode him husham forkbeard is up at caesar all by his lonesome the first thing i have to do is reinforce him so the southrons cant seize the glideway leonidas sir the hierophant of the lion god replied he wasnt a great soldier he never would be but he was willing he was brave and even more to the point he led the soldiers farthest north in the main body of the army of franklin joseph said get your men on the road at once i want them to reach caesar as fast as humanly possible and to give husham all the help he needs to hold the place yes sir leonidas said ah what do i do if i reach caesar and find it fallen to the southrons that was a better question than joseph the gamecock would have expected from him after a moments thought the commanding general answered counterattack the southrons cant have enormous numbers there but i hopei pray if you like holy sirhusham will hold the town hes a solid fighting man a warrior of the old school all right sir leonidas the priest saluted i just wanted to know what you required of me he saluted and strode away his bloodred vestments bright even in the deepening twilight what of the rest of the army sir roastbeef william asked well leave enough men behind at the gaps for a little while to make sure the southrons dont swarm through joseph answered as for the rest well all get down to caesar as quick as we can unless im altogether mad thats where general hesmucet is going if he brings his whole army down there we ought to give him a proper reception dont you think i think we ought to attack lieutenant general bell said joseph the gamecock shook his head if you ever command this army you may lead it as you please while i command you will obey me we have trenches waiting all around caesar our men are going into them stubbornly bell said entrenchments weaken the fighting spirit of the men they would be bolder fighting out in the open they would take more losses fighting out in the open joseph said we cannot afford to take more losses why wont you listen to me the idea is to make the southrons take losses to make them take so many that they get sick of the war give it up and leave us alone have you got that the idea of fighting a war sir is to win it bell had no more give in him than did his superior go on joseph the gamecock growled just go on i promise you there will be plenty of fighting for everyone before this campaign is through as for now just go he didnt quite scream get out of my sight that he didnt he reckoned a sign of nearly godlike restraint on his part if the southrons break into caesar if husham forkbeard cant hold them away from the glideway well all have more fighting than we want but not for very long he thought the army of franklin would break up and that would be the end of king geoffreys cause here in the east riding a unicorn toward caesar was a torment for joseph not because he was saddle sore but because he was in an agony of suspense finally he couldnt stand it any more he rode off into a field and motioned for a scryer to come to him the man did his best but said i cant bring husham forkbeards scryer onto the crystal ball sir im sorry gods damn it how am i supposed to know whats going on if no one will tell me joseph ground out the likeliest reason hushams scryer wouldnt or couldnt talk was that the man was busy fighting for his life joseph knew that only too well however well he knew it though he didnt care to think about it at last when joseph was within three or four miles of caesar and about to boot his unicorn up into a gallop so he could find out how things were going there the scryer said sir heres brigadier husham well gods be praised joseph the gamecock snatched the crystal out of the scryers hands and rode along with it in his lap husham tell me at once are we holding there yes sir husham forkbeards fierce features blazed with pride they also showed a sword cut he hadnt had before they came at caesar we gave em a nice warm northern hello with massed crossbow volleys and all the engines and they fell back right now theyre digging in across the mouth of viper river gap let em joseph said were not trying to break out no matter what lieutenant general bell says he breathed a sigh of relieftwo sighs of relief in fact one for holding and the other seems to me general hesmucet doesnt quite know what to do with his great big army yet good maybe thats it husham allowed i tell you for true though sir if theyd hit me with everything they had gods only know how i wouldve held em now ive got that brigade from leonidas the priest so im good for a while longer anyways and i hear tell youre bringing more men up towards caesar im bringing the whole army brigadier joseph answered and ill tell you something else too i dont think im the only one in a tent just east of viper river gap general hesmucet looked daggers at brigadier john the birds eye you had them hesmucet growled gods damn it you had them and you let them get away the sort of chance a soldier only gets once in a lifetime you could have strolled right into caesar begging your pardon sir the younger man broke in but that isnt true at all i tried to break into caesar and i took some hundreds of men killed and wounded for my trouble and i did not succeed one understrength brigade holding the town hesmucet grumbled you outnumbered the traitors three or four to one you could have had your way with them could have seized caesar could have cut joseph the gamecock off from marthasville which is the one thing in all the worldthe one and only thing mind youhe knows must not happen to his army sir james the birds eye said stiffly my orders were to attack the glideway line to see how it was defended and then to dig in at the mouth of viper river gap and to have my men ready to pursue the northerners if they took flight i followed them exactly as you gave them to me if you blame me for that sir he didnt go on not with words but the tip of his curly black beard quivered in indignation and hesmucet contemplating the orders he had indeed given let out a long rueful sigh very well brigadier you have a point and you made it well i can still wish you might have done more but you were perfectly justified in doing as you did on the basis of what i told you thank you sir brigadier james replied his tone still aggrieved i meant every word of what i told you though hesmucet thought you had the sort of chance you may never see again and you didnt take it the northerners were strong enough to stop your first tap and you didnt tap twice if you had youd be a hero today and probably an earl tomorrow may i make an observation sir joseph the birds eye asked go ahead hesmucet said though most men would have quailed at speaking too frankly by the way he said it young james had nerve even if he hadnt done everything hesmucet would have wanted of him he said sir if this was supposed to be your striking force and the one attacking the gaps farther south your holding force you might have done better to let me assail the vultures nest and the dogs path and to have sent lieutenant general george up here with his much bigger army to strike at caesar hesmucet pondered that he was not a sweettempered man but he was on the whole a just one however much he wanted to scorch brigadier james for his presumption he discovered he couldnt well gods damn it youre right he said james the birds eye blinked sir evidently that wasnt what hed expected to hear from the general commanding youre right hesmucet repeated i wish you werent but you are i sent a boy to do a mans job and i had a man ready to hand that was a mistake i hope i wont make the same one again a good general makes mistakes once a bad general keeps doing the same stupid godsdamned thing over and over thats probably something worth remembering james said so it isfor you and me both hesmucet said all right brigadieryou may go it would have been nice if we could have just swarmed into caesar and ruined joseph the gamecock right at the start of this campaign but if we cant we cant well try something else thats all saluting james the birds eye ducked his way out of the pavilion hesmucet paused thinking how the war had changed since its early days doubting george had had it right back then armies on both sides had largely marched where they would when they happened to collide with an opposing army they would fight now both marshal bart and hesmucet himself had clear goals in mind bart to hammer the army of southern parthenia till it could stand no more hammering hesmucet to do the same to the army of franklin no one in the first two years of the war could even have imagined such efforts these truly were campaigns perhaps the first such that had ever been fought in the kingdom of detina what that means is id better not bungle this one any more hesmucet muttered he stepped out of the pavilion and called for a couple of runners when the men came up he said my compliments to doubting george and fighting joseph and ask them to attend me here at their earliest convenience yes sir the runners chorused they put their heads together for a moment no doubt deciding who would go to which general then they loped away lieutenant general george got to hesmucets tent first the commanding general would have been surprised had it been the other way round george might not love me but he does love the kingdom hesmucet thought fighting joseph loves fighting joseph and nobody and nothing else your flanking move didnt quite work sir george remarked no not quite hesmucet agreed i probably should have used james the birds eye to demonstrate against the two gaps farther south and sent your bigger army through viper river gap against caesar i rather thought so at the time sir but i doubted whether i should press the point george said i know youre keeping that kind of eye on me well yes hesmucet wasnt easily nonplused but doubting george had done the job we will manage to work together though one way or another i think and im still figuring out what i can do with all the soldiers ive got here this is a large command next time ill manage my moves better fair enough sir george said i dont doubt that in the slightest fighting joseph rode up just then a procession of one hesmucet an indifferent rider had an indifferent unicorn doubting george a good rider had a fine unicorn and fighting joseph a splendid rider had the most glorious unicorn hesmucet had ever seen whiter than snow horn shod with polished silver rather than workaday iron coat and mane and tail all combed to magnificent perfection fighting joseph looked moderately magnificent himself he was a handsome ruddy man whose hair had gone silver not mere gray he looked as if he ought to be a king not so lowly a creature as a general many peopleking avram not least among thembelieved he thought he ought to be king too avram had given him command in the west anyhow the year before willing to gamble victories against the chance of a usurpation after them he hadnt got the victories duke edward of arlington not only beat but embarrassed fighting joseph at viziersville now joseph commanded a wing here in the distant east not an army in the vital west but he still thought well of himself good morning gentlemen he said as he dismounted and tied his unicorn to a tree branch he saluted with a certain reluctance as if unhappy about acknowledging any man his superior even if only in a formal sense now that we didnt break through here what are we going to try next breaking through again obviously hesmucet said fighting joseph had nerve throwing his failure in his face like that but then fighting joseph did have nerve and to spare what he didnt quite have was the soldierly talent to go with it just as you say sir fighting joseph replied i did it on the slopes of sentry peak and george here did it at proselytizers risewith a little help from thraxton the braggart of course he chuckled i expect we can manage something along those lines for you again hesmucet glared at him hed led troops himself in that fight but he hadnt taken funnel hill south of proselytizers risethe defenses there turned out to be stronger than he and marshal bart had believed to be reminded that his subordinates had done what he hadnt stung if he showed the sting though he gave fighting joseph what he wanted and so he said im sure youll do your best he pointed westward going through the army of franklin wont be so neat or so cheap as stealing a march on it would have been but we do what we have to do not always what we want to do i have to put up with you for instance not least so king avram doesnt have to do it on the other side of the green ridge mountains fighting joseph peered west too so did doubting george fighting joseph coughed once or twice before remarking those are formidable works the traitors have there i know hesmucet said they set their serfs to digging like moles if we can force them out of their trenches though the advantage swings to us you and lieutenant general george will try tomorrow at sunrise faced with a direct order fighting joseph said the only thing a soldier faced with a direct order could say yes sir when hesmucet glanced toward doubting george his secondincommand nodded and also said yes sir he added i hope well have as much magecraft as possible supporting the attack you will hesmucet promised now go ready your men the two generals saluted again and rode off toward their own encampments hesmucet called for two more runners fetch me colonel phineas and major alva he said the mages arrived together both of them aboard asses for some reason hesmucet had never been able to fathom wizards made shockingly bad unicornriders good day sir phineas said he was roundfaced and plump and bald as a turnip hed been senior mage in the army since general guildenstern commanded it he was excellent at keeping track of things but like a lot of southron sorcerers only moderately good at actual conjuration good day colonel hesmucet returned every bit as formally getting the most out of phineas involved taking him seriously or at least seeming to what can we do for you sir that was major alva his young voice cracking with eagerness he was tall and skinny with a beard still patchy in spots and with a shock of pantherblack hair that wouldnt lie flat no matter how he greased and combed it but that stuck out in all directions like the springs from a skinned sofa hed been lieutenant alva till a few months before but he was the most potent southron mage hesmucet had ever found phineas kept track of things alva did things and liked doing them we are going to have another try at viper river gap tomorrow hesmucet told him we want to take caesar away from the traitors anything you can do in the sorcerous line would be appreciated colonel phineas coughed a couple of loud formal coughs if you could have given us more notice general we might well have been able to offer you assistance of a more comprehensive nature no doubt youre right colonel hesmucet said but you will i trust understand that war is not a business where we know everything ahead of time if james the birds eye had broken into caesar a couple of days ago i wouldnt be worrying about attacking the place now would i most disorderly phineas said disapprovingly phineas was good at disapproving of things less good at approving of them alva said dont worry sir i expect i can come up with something he ignored the existence of every other mage in hesmucets army considering his strength as compared to that of the other mages hesmucet didnt blame him leaning toward the commanding general he asked what have you got in mind sir shall we try scaring the northerners out of their shoes the way we did at funnel hill or doing something to help our men move forward lets see what we can do to help our side major hesmucet answered fine as your spells were at funnel hill they didnt shift the enemy so much as i would have liked the northerners are traitors but theyre detinans too same as we are they dont scare easily right you are sir alva was an easygoing fellow if he deigned to notice you at all hesmucet took a certain amount of pride in being able to draw the wizards attention alva turned to phineas that variation of the befoggery we were talking about the other day on that scale phineas looked dubious he often did the way his face settled into the expression like a fat man sinking into a soft comfortable hassock proved as much shaking his head he went on its too much for any one man yourself included im afraid oh dont be afraid sir alva said which made phineas splutter and turn red alva blithely pushed ahead i can set it up and leave parts of it for squadrons of mages to put into operation he casually assumed himself to be worth whole squadrons by the way phineas grunted he assumed alva was worth them too but he didnt like the idea can you set it up in that fashion of course i can now alva sounded certain infuriatingly certain same principles of division of labor that go into a wellrun manufactory i create the others duplicate should be easy phineas looked appalled at that alva didnt seem to notice he turned to hesmucet do you want to know what were talking about sir no hesmucet told him i want to know what youll do and when how is your business alva beamed at him he chuckled a bit selfconsciously more than half by accident hed said the right thing rollant had several extra sheaves of crossbow quarrels clipped to his belt he was far from the only man in lieutenant griffs company to take such a precaution despite that he wasnt unduly astonished when griff singled him out dont you know thats contrary to regulations soldier you wouldnt pick on me if my hair were black the escaped serf thought aloud he said yes sir he made no move to divest himself of the extra crossbow bolts lieutenant griff didnt ask him to either the company commander had got it out of his system by complaining rollant sighed sure enough he was a lodestone for such gripes trumpets blared come on griff yelled form up nobodys going to say this company doesnt pull its weight in the regiment so far as rollant knew no one had ever said any such thing griff always needed something to be unhappy about colonel nahath the regimental commander surveyed his men were going to break into caesar boys there arent enough traitors in front of us to stop us there arent enough traitors in the whole wide world to stop us were good new eborac men and there isnt anything at all in the whole wide world that can stop us the soldiers raised a cheer lieutenant griff added remember men we got to the top of proselytizers rise if we can do that may the thunderer smite me if we cant do anything beside rollant smitty murmured oh hes right no doubt about it all we need is for the northerners to botch another spell and well just walk into this caesar place we can lick the traitors rollant said that was why hed taken king avrams silver to hit back at the liege lords whod held him down just as men with dark hair had held down his ancestors since their ancestors came ashore on the beaches of the western ocean of course we can smitty agreed we wouldnt be up here in peachtree province if we couldnt but saying the enemy is going to make another mistake and make things easy for us is just a piece of godsdamned foolishness quiet in the ranks sergeant joram growled he knew what his job was and he did it nahath spoke again were going to advance a little slower than usual because the mages have something special in mind to help us gods help us rollant muttered and smitty nodded the northerners were stronger mages than the southrons even the botch from thraxton the braggart that had panicked his own men on proselytizers rise was a botch on a scale the southrons wouldnt have tried to imitate more horns screeched along with countless other men from doubting georges army rollant and his comrades advanced on the traitors trenches in front of caesar those trenches looked like formidable worksand so no doubt they were why shouldnt they be rollant thought plenty of serfs have spent plenty of sweat on them liege lords wont dig when theyve got blonds to do it for them men in blue caps and tunics peered out of the trenches at the advancing southrons rollant waited for shouts of alarm to ring out he also waited for firepots and stones to start flying from engines and for repeating crossbows to start hosing the southrons ranks with death as he tramped forward he yanked the bowstring on his crossbow back to the locked position and set a bolt in the groove all he had to do now was raise the weapon to his shoulder and pull the trigger loading without orders went against regulations too he didnt care neither did most of the other veterans sergeant joram stalked by he had a quarrel in the groove of his crossbow too closer and closer to the enemy lines came the southrons why arent they shooting at us smitty demanded were in range gods know maybe they dont see us rollant said maybe maybe our magic really is working smitty shook his head theres got to be some kind of explanation that makes better sense than that but the northerners kept right on not shooting even after the southrons crossbow bolts started landing among them even after men started falling and crying out in pain from wounds what the hells is going on rollant heard a man in blue yell nothing but confusion in his voice and then either because some traitor mage defeated the southrons spell or because the two armies drew too close together for it to hold any more the northern men in the trenches realized there were indeed foes in front of them they cried out again this time in rage and fear those whose crossbows were loaded started shooting but they werent so ready as they might have been a northerner stuck his head up above the rampart in front of the trench so he could see to aim before the enemy soldier could shoot rollant did he missed his quarrel dug into the rampart and kicked up dirt into the traitors face he came close enough to killing the fellow though to make him duck down in a hurry instead of doing any shooting of his own frantically reloading rollant yanked back the bowstring and set a new bolt in the groove all around him other southrons were doing the same somebody right in front of him dropped a quarrel in his haste to reload instead of snatching another one from the sheaf the soldier stopped and stooped to pick up the one hed dropped clumsy fool rollant shouted doing his best not to trample the man futter you blondie the soldier said rage ripped through rollant worst of it was that he couldnt fall on the fellow and giveor try to givehim the thrashing he deserved maybe after the battle was over if they both came out alive they would have something more to say to each other with words or with fists now now the northerners were awake to their peril the real fight was with them not with the man who also fought for king avram but how are they and he different rollant wondered one obvious answer was that the trooper in a gray uniform like his own wasnt trying to kill him at the moment and the traitors were a southron only a couple of feet from rollant went down with a groan clutching at the quarrel that had sprouted in his belly litter rollant shouted litter over here he doubted if the healers would be able to save the man wounds that pierced the gut usually killed by fever if they didnt kill by bleeding he had no more time to think about that than he did about the southron who didnt love blonds he shot at the northerners again reloaded and shot once more he didnt know if any of the quarrels struck home what he did know was that his comrades were scrambling over the rampart and starting to drop down into the trenches joseph the gamecocks soldiers manned he slung his crossbow yanked out his shortsword and swarmed over the ramparts himself hed fought in the trenches before the only good thing he could say about it was that he could hit back at the foe charging the enemy when he was entrenched that was worse but this was quite bad enough men screamed and groaned and slashed at one another and shot one another and swung clubbed crossbows and wrestled and punched and kicked and bit reinforcements in blue came rushing up from the direction of caesar to try to hold the southrons back but more men in gray from doubting georges army dropped down into the trenches a crossbow bolt scored a bleeding line across the back of rollants hand half an inch lower and it might have left the hand crippled forever forward lieutenant griff shouted shrilly forward they wentfor a little while after that the enemy got as many reinforcements as they did that made the fighting even more desperate than it had been rollant was no great swordsman hed never used a sword before the war only a woodworkers tools and the shortsword was a clumsy weapon anyhow but his blade soon had blood on it king geoffrey the traitors shouted and provincial prerogative forever and to the seven hells with king avram and to the seven hells with the blonds here and there when they surged east again in a counterattack they would capture some of avrams soldiers and manhandle them back to the rear they had camps for southron prisoners just as there were camps for northern prisoners in the south but they didnt manhandle any blonds back to the rear exserfs whod taken service against their liege lords almost always ended up dead on the field when things went wrong for their side i cant be captured rollant knew that in the early days of the fighting a few blonds had been forcibly returned to serfdom that didnt happen any more the northerners hadnt needed long to realize a man whod taken up arms against them once was liable even likely to do it again as soon as he saw the chance some time in the middle of the day a lull fell over the field with both sides equally exhausted rollant had a moment to snatch a few breaths and look around he discovered smitty only a few feet away also panting and looking around to see what the attack had gained well this isnt like going at that vultures nest place rollant said we couldve kept fighting there till the last war of the gods and never broken through weve got a chance here sure enough smitty agreed more room to wiggle here that other gap we almost had to go in there single file to get at the fornicating traitors rollant pointed ahead you think well take that caesar wed better his comrade answered if we dont doubting georgell eat every one of us and without salt too youre right rollant said and forced a smile the detinans dimly recalled the days when their ancestors had been maneaters those days were long gone now and had been for centuries even before the darkhaired men crossed the western ocean and set foot in this land but the memory lingered in jokes like that so far as rollant knew none of his own forebears had ever done anything so barbaric other small things reminded rollant he wasnt quite an ordinary detinan even if he fought alongside thousands of them pointing ahead again he said who or whats a caesar he had no idea to his surprise smitty only shrugged beats me probably just a madeup name suppose youre right rollant seized the moment to plunge his sword into the nearly bloodred dirt of southeastern peachtree provincevery different from the black mud hed grown up with in the swamp country of palmetto provinceto clean it he said our magecraft did work at least pretty much so it did smitty nodded thats something i bet the traitors are mad enough to spit nails like a repeating crossbow too probably rollant cocked his own handheld crossbow fit a bolt to the groove and took a shot at motion in the trenches the northerners still held as often happened he couldnt tell whether he hit or missed that one shot seemed to be a signal to resume the fight a thirtypound stone ball from a northern catapult thudded down only a few paces away some of that bloodred dirt splashed up and hit rollant in the face a southron soldier the stone struck screamed but not for long more southrons started shooting at the enemy before long the battle blazed at full fury once more and at full fury it remained for the rest of the day try as they would the southrons didnt manage to break into caesar but rollant was sure the enemy spent men like coppers holding them out they cant go on doing that he said as the sun sank behind the town they wont have an army left if they do thats always been one thing we could do smitty said if all else fails we can grind the bastards down till theyve got nothing left only trouble with that is it grinds down an awful lot of us too i know rollant said dolefully but its pretty plain we arent any smarter than they are even with general hesmucet in charge instead of general guildenstern so wed better be tougher wouldnt you say wed better be something anyhow smitty answered the something i am right now is godsdamned tired he took his blanket from his knapsack cocooned himself in it and started to snore rollant stayed awake a good deal longer maybe that meant hed had more sleep the night before maybeand more likelyit just meant he was too keyed up after the days hard fighting to wind down in a hurry the traitors seemed very much awake too their campfires burned brightly all the way back to caesar every once in a while a bolt or a stone or a firepot would land among the southrons by all the signs they needed to be ready to fight again in the morning or perhaps in the middle of the night rollant had just dozed off when sergeant joram shook him awake for sentrygo rubbing sleep out of his eyes he stared off to the west whats going on there he asked pointing to two new blazes beyond the profusion of northern campfires gods damn me if i know joram answered maybe theyre burning what they cant use but what joseph the gamecocks men were burning dawn revealed was the pair of wooden bridges over the rubicon the river that ran west of caesar theyd kept campfires going close to the southrons but theyd had only a handful of men around them now their whole army had crossed the rubicon and was retreating toward marthasville as fast as it could go lieutenant general bell could not have been more revolted if hed faced the prospect of losing his other leg and having his other arm crippled his men tramped glumly north along with the rest of the army of franklin the only man in the whole army who seemed satisfied with what theyd done at viper river gap was joseph the gamecock we hurt them he said when bell strapped onto his unicorn rode up to remonstrate we hurt them badly but they hold the field sir bell growled but the field is not important joseph answered no field this side of marthasville is important well find another miserable little place to defend in a few days and let them squander more lives attacking it when do we attack them bell asked if we see a chance we can do that joseph said more likely though well go on defending that made bell take a swig from his jar of laudanum but not even the potent drug eased the turmoil in his mind as soon as the army stopped for the evening he began a new letter to king geoffrey may it please your majesty he began with malice aforethought knowing that what he had to say would not please the king at all i have just witnessed and been compelled by circumstances to take part in the most disgraceful and disgusting withdrawal ever recorded in the annals of warfare is that too strong bell wondered aloud he shook his big leonine head it wasnt he would have taken oath to any and all gods that it wasnt joseph the gamecock ordered this army out of its works and into retreat abandoning all parts ofpeachtreeprovince from caesar northward to the provincial border to the foe the army of franklinthe thunderer grant that it see once more the province for which it was namedwas not defeated in the fieldworks it was trying to defend caesar was not on the point of falling when the general commanding abandoned it to an evil fate he paused to ink his pen once more and to look up at the ceiling of his pavilion seeking inspiration from the gods or wherever he might find it a moment later the pen was racing across the paper again however well the army offranklin fought in the fieldworks i have seen no sign that it can fight outside of them entrenching does indeed kill soldiers spirits the sorcery is slow and exceedingly subtle but no less sure for that what to do he muttered what to do so long as the general commanding has and is knownto have your confidence your majesty we can but obey his orders and hope they will serve however unlikely that may seem but it would be disastrous and unfortunate to see this campaign come to an ignominious conclusion when you have officers who would gladly serve you for the sake of the glory they might win in the said service i have sir the honor to remain your most humble and obedient servant bell signed his name sanded the letter dry sealed it and sent it out in the same clandestine way he had with his earlier missive he didnt know what results that one had hadnone he could see yet he hoped this one would do more cowardice he muttered if its not cowardice it must be treason they are there how can we drive them away without hitting them it all seemed obvious to him it seemed so obvious he started to hitch his painful way over to joseph the gamecocks pavilion and confront him after heaving himself to his feetno to my foot he thoughthe checked himself even he could see that that would do him no good he took the bottle of laudanum from his pocket pulled the cork with his teeth and swigged as always it tasted vile as always he didnt care ahhh he said the soft sated sigh of a man returning to the bosom of his beloved he waited for the potent mix of spirits and poppy juice to work its will on him he had not long to wait calm flowed through him he no longer wanted to do anything dreadful to joseph the gamecock he recognized that that would not be a good idea if without leave he assailed the general commanding had he any hope of afterwards ascending to the command no surely it would go to a plodder like roastbeef william best to wait then and let his letters work if they would as the laudanum took its soft sure grip on his soul he floated away from some at least of the pain tormenting him and as the pain receded so did some of his anger at joseph the gamecock with enough laudanum in him bell could look at things more disinterestedly james was assuredly loyal to the kingdom if not to the king he was doing what he thought best what he thought right that doesnt mean it is right though bell rumbled laudanum might ease his mind but didnt change it he grabbed his crutches heaved himself upright and went out into the hot muggy fireflypunctuated night good evening sir major zibeon said smoothly materializing at his side and what by the gods is so good about it bell demanded did you see one chance one single solitary chance where we might have struck the enemy today no sir his aidedecamp answered and i was looking for such a chance too so was i bell said i didnt see one either if i had i would have hurled my men against the godsdamned southrons in the open field and to the seven hells with what joseph the gamecock had to say about it i have no doubt you would have sir zibeon did not sound approving weve got to hit the southrons a blow bell insisted as hed been insisting since before the campaign began how far north will we go before we dare turn and face them again all the way to marthasville not so far as that sir major zibeon said sounding as much like a good servant as a soldier from what i hear the general commanding intends to halt at the fieldworks outside fat mama hells of a name for a town bell muttered that one penetrated even laudanum then more slowly than he would have done before he was maimed and had to drug himself to hold anguish at bay he called up a map in his mind fat mama thats bad enoughits halfway to marthasville by the lion gods fangs not quite sir his aidedecamp replied and the position is quite strong with any luck at all we should be able to hold them there for some time i doubt it bell said unconsciously imitating lieutenant general george joseph will decide were too fornicating outnumbered and hell find an excuse to skedaddle again as hesmucet comes farther up into peachtree province the glideway path on which he depends for food and crossbow bolts and firepots and such grows longer and longer zibeon said he needs more and more men to guard it which leaves him with fewer and fewer men to put in in the field against us bell fixed him with a stare so cold and fierce it might indeed have come from the lion god campfirelight only gave his eyes a cold glitter that made his aidedecamp involuntarily give back a step so what bell said joseph wont care you mark my words he doesnt want to fight is whats wrong with him i think youre mistaken in that sir major zibeon said gathering himself and joseph is looking for ways to get ned of the forest to attack hesmucets supply line when ned strikes a glideway track you may be sure it is properly struck ned plays the game for keeps it is not a game bell insisted it is a war for the safety of our kingdom one we must not lose but if such as joseph remain in charge over us the war will be lost before it is well begun for we shall do no fighting in it joseph believes the war is already lost if it be a matter of man against man for the southrons have too many more men than we do major zibeon said to him our best hope is to make the southrons weary of spending their lives to subdue us i have heard joseph upon this subject more times than i care to he would i am certain make a most excellent bookkeeper bell said acid in his voice up until this time i was unaware that casting accounts had become a cardinal military virtue zibeon was an imperturbable sort of man but he winced your outspokenness may land you in difficulty sir he remarked so what bell said with a laugh what can my friends do to me that my foes havent done already he made certain the crutch under his right armpit was secure before gesturing at his ruined body did major zibeon flush in the firelight bell couldnt be sure his aidedecamp said if you offend those set above you badly enough they can remove you from your command only joseph the gamecock is set above me in all the army of franklin bell said should he dare to have the nerve to seek my removal you may rest assured i would appeal to the king would geoffrey hearken to such an appeal hed better bell thought but not even major zibeon knew of the letters he was writing to the king in nonesuch and so bell stuck to what everyone in the northern provincesand probably half the southrons tooknew king geoffrey and count joseph have been known to disagree in the past anyone who disagrees with joseph may have geoffrey on his side may i believe is the critical word zibeon said remember sir that we left detina over the question of who was and who should be at the top of the hierarchy geoffreys natural instinct is to support those who are higher against those who are lower that means joseph not you my natural instinct is to go out and smash the enemy bell retorted and joseph the gamecock has done a good thorough job of stifling it i am no bookkeeper on the battlefield regardless of what he may be when we get to fat mama no bell cut off his aidedecamp with a toss of the head i told you once and i tell you again hell find some excuse to run away from there too you mark my words and wait and see yes sir major zibeon said tonelessly if you will excuse me sir he strode off into the night lieutenant general bell grunted he didnt think hed convinced zibeon on the other hand he didnt worry about it very much his aidedecamp had gone on and on about hierarchies in the hierarchy of the northern army bell ranked far above zibeon he didnt have to worry about what the major thought unless he chose to do so unfortunately the same did not apply to joseph the gamecocks opinions joseph could do as he pleased herecould and would unless king geoffrey reined him in fat mama bell said contemptuously he turned around and stumped back into his pavilion when he lay down he couldnt sleep he took another slug of laudanum the doses he poured down would have felled a man not used to the drug would have knocked him out and might have stopped his heart but the laudanum didnt even make bell sleepy if anything it energized him so that he lay on his cot with thoughts whirling like comets through his brain not all of them would be the best thoughts he knew that he would have to look at them in the morning or whenever he turned out to be less drugged when im drugged all the time though how do i choose between the good ideas and those that arent so good he wondered he shrugged then wished he hadnt even with the unicornstunning dose of laudanum in him pain shot through his ruined left shoulder he did eventually fall asleep whether in spite of the laudanum or because of it he could not have said and as he slept he dreamt in his dream he was whole he had two legs his arm did everything an arm should do and indeed he did more than a mortal man might expect to do for he found himself flying up to the mountain beyond the sky where the gods dwelt what is your wish the lion god asked him the god had a lions head on a heros body though his hands and feet were clawed and a tail lashed from the base of his spine even facing the gods bell did not hesitate lord let me lead this host he said fervently what will you do with it if you lead it the thunderer asked go forth and fight the foe wherever i find him bell answered the two martial gods looked at each other so shall it be they said together lieutenant general bell woke up then with the sound of the gods voices ringing in his ears ringing in his soul he knew he remained a cripple for a moment for one precious moment it didnt matter the army of franklin shall be mine he whispered he hadnt asked the gods how well he would do with the army if he got it he didnt worry about it now that he was awake either iii so this is how were going to play the game eh doubting george said to hesmucet as the southron army tramped north towards a hamlet with the unlovely name of fat mama thats how it looks to me general hesmucet answered well fight somewhere joseph the gamecock will pull back and then well have to fight again hes not been making things easy for us george observed of course thats not his job is it he wont stake everything on one throw of the dice gods damn him hesmucet said we flanked him out of borders we beat him out of caesar but his armys still intact and hes still got it between us and marthasville and as he falls back he concentrates his force and we have to thin ours out to protect our supply line doubting george said thats not good if ned of the forest got athwart the glideway im doing my best to make sure that doesnt happen hesmucet said ive sent a goodsized force of unicornriders out from luxor on the great river against him with luck sam the sturgeon will whip ned even without luck hell keep him too busy to bother our supplies may it be so lieutenant general george pointed ahead what are those men doing theyre digging trenches thats what theyre doing hesmucet said george had already seen that for himself yes sir he said what i should have asked was why are they doing it were supposed to be on the march not so did you give any order for us to entrench lion god claw me if i did hesmucet answered well then george said and rode toward the soldiers who were digging in what are you men playing at he demanded in his most formal tones making us some trenches sir just in case one of the southrons replied i see that what i dont see is any traitors close by george said in case of what then since there arent any traitors close by why do you think you need the earthworks just in case sir like i said the soldier answered he flipped another spadeful of red peachtree dirt up onto what would be the parapet of the growing trench somebody saw that the northerners had been digging a couple of fields over so we thought wed better have some trenches of our own what kind of preposterous excuse are they giving general hesmucet demanded as he rode up as a matter of fact sir it doesnt sound so preposterous to me doubting george replied and then explained gods damn entrenchments hesmucet burst out gods damn them to the seven hells they take the offensive spirit away from our soldiers altogether no sir i wouldnt say that george shook his head the detinan soldier fights his war the same way he runs his farm or his shop if he invests in fighting he expects that investment to pay well these fellows are a pack of idiots for entrenching when there arent any traitors in sight hesmucet said and george couldnt very well disagree with that the general commanding raised his voice you boys had better get moving and keep moving or im going to have to find out who in the hells you are uh yes sir the soldiers said in a ragged chorus they abandoned their halfdug trenches and hurried away disgraceful hesmucet said i still dont think so sir doubting george replied they fight hard whenever we send them at the foe think of that fight by caesar a few days ago you cant ask for more than those men gave you can always ask for more hesmucet said in a steely voice that grim determination was thoughtprovoking hesmucet repeated you can always ask for more and then added sometimes asking for it makes the men give it to you a point george said a distinct point what i want to know is will we ever get to this fat mama place hesmucet grumbled in this country the gods would have to work a miracle for us to get anywhere at all i rode through it twenty years ago and it hasnt changed sincecertainly not for the better in any way that was a distinct point too swamps and pine woods and stands of shrubs and thorn bushes and saplings that had sprung up where the pines were cut down dominated the landscape the roads when there were roads were narrow and seemed to wander at random rather than actually going anywhere without the sun in the sky george would have had no idea where north lay with cries of alarm a whole company of soldiers a hundred yards ahead started running away as fast as they could go now what hesmucet growled before long one of those cries of alarm developed words or at least a word hornets if youll excuse me sir doubting george said and rode away from trouble as fast as he could he was not unduly surprised to discover general hesmucet also retreating as fast as he could persuade his unicorn to go by the power vested in me as commanding general i hereby declare those wasps traitors against king avram hesmucet declared that sounds good to me sir george said shall i order the men to arrest them and take them back to georgetown for trial before hesmucet could reply he went on or do you suppose theyre enough of a trial right here somebody yelled as he was stung more soldiers broke ranks to escape the hornets ruefully hesmucet said theyre doing more to slow us down than joseph the gamecock has so far you were the one who said it sir as long as he holds marthasville and keeps his army in the field hes doing everything false king geoffrey could ask of him hes not the same sort of fighter as duke edward but he knows his business i cant argue with you there much as i wish i could hesmucet answered he pulled out of caesar just as slick as you pleasedidnt leave so much as a wagon or an ass that wasnt too lame for us to use before too long the front of the line of march sorted itself out again but the hornets caused a traffic jam all out of proportion to the amount of harm they could have done and to the number of men they actually stung when a handful of people stopped and flabbled because of the wasps everybody else behind them had to stop and wait while the chaos subsided delay went through the whole long column of marching southrons as one could watch a devoured pig going through a big snake and then just when things finally seemed to have got back to normal the roads opened out on a little northern townone that wouldnt have existed if it werent for a crossroadscalled dareton joseph the gamecock had left a brigade of men behind there to skirmish with the southrons colonel andy doubting georges adjutant was indignant what can he hope to accomplish with that he demanded rhetorically he cant possibly hope to hold us back to hold us no not when his whole army couldnt at borders or caesar doubting george said to delay us to give him more time to settle in at fat mama farther north and make it tougher to crack thats what hes got in mind sure as im looking at those works ahead not chivalrous andy sniffed not sporting either peering at the fieldworks in front of dareton lieutenant general george was inclined to agree red earth ramparts sheltered soldiers and made catapults and repeating crossbows harder for the southrons engines to reach hell try to do us as much harm as he can and then pull back george predicted lets just mask his position and then go on andy said but it wouldnt be that easy or that cheap by the way joseph the gamecocks artificers had sited their wards theyd made sure the southrons couldnt pass on the open ground between dareton and the forest to the east without coming in range of their weapons do you know what i am going to do doubting george said a certain bleak amusement in his voice no sir andy didnt sound amused at all he sounded thoroughly indignant at joseph the gamecock i am going to get rid of a cockroach by dropping an anvil on it sir andy didnt get it when the gods were passing out imagination hed been in line for a second helping of diligence that made him an excellent adjutant and would surely have made him a disaster as a commander never mind colonel george said soothingly ill show you he began giving orders the southrons siege engines rumbled forward on their wheeled carts they started heaving stones and darts and firepots at the entrenchments in front of dareton the catapults in the fieldworks answered back as best they could but doubting george had ordered far more engines into action than joseph the gamecock had left with the defenders and george threw more men at dareton than joseph had left behind to hold the placemany many more the whole army of franklin might have held his assaulting force out of the town then again it might not have a single lonely brigade however feisty had not a chance its commander soon realized as much he left one regiment in the field to hold up the southron army for as long as it could but got the rest of his men out of the trenches and marching through dareton and on to the north here and there along the line columns of smoke rising into the sky marked burning siege engines the traitors couldnt take away with them all in all it was a minor triumph of delay glum prisoners came trudging back through the southrons lines they cursed the men whod caught them they doubly cursed every blond they saw in a gray tunic and they cursed doubting george when they saw him freeze in the seven hells some shouted at the same time as others were yelling fry in the seven hells george turned to colonel andy if half of me freezes while the other half fries on average i ought to be pretty comfortable er yes his adjutant replied and george stifled a sigh hed long since realized andy had not a dram of whimsy concealed anywhere about his person that being so why was he disappointed now because nobody likes to make a joke and have it fall flat he thought forward he shouted once more and forward the soldiers went but the stubborn defense at dareton had cost them three hours of marching time at the very least joseph the gamecocks army was surely using that time to good advantage george thought about marching his men into the night to make up for the time theyd lost he thought about thatand then dismissed the notion after one section of the army followed a looping country track through the woods that proved to double back on itself so they took their comrades in flank if theyd been northerners his force would have been in trouble as things were straightening out the traffic jam and getting everybody on the right road took almost as long as smashing through the entrenchments in front of dareton had could we do this at night george wondered he shook his head it struck him as unlikely weariness wasnt the only reason armies halted when darkness fell and so the army encamped at sunset well short of fat mama campfires sent savory smoke into the sky smoke made more savory by the meat roasting above a good many of those fires some of the meat came from cattle the army had brought along some george was sure came from local beasts that had met an untimely demise thanks to southron foragers that was against the rules of war king avram had set forth to the king the northerners remained his subjects and were not to be despoiled the reality was that the northerners hated avram and his soldiers and those soldiers returned the disfavor if they were hungry they would eat whatever they could get their hands on some commanders discouraged them doubting george looked the other way the harder the time the north had the sooner the war would endthat was how he thought of things and as always happened when southron armies penetrated into a new part of the north blonds on the run from their liege lords started coming into camp some were men alone others whole families together the army had plenty of use for laborers and washerwomen and the liege lords who had to do without the labor of their serfs would with luck contemplate the cost of rebellion against their rightful sovereign taking in blonds also had costs though george remembered the one whod murdered his wife and the officer whod been trifling with her though hed also died at the officers hands that had been a nasty business all the way around george grunted and shook his head that was a nasty business on a small scale the nasty business coming up would be much larger and much worse one way or the other this campaign and marshal barts in parthenia would say who won the war and why it had better be us george said and rode on toward the north captain gremio found the little town of fat mama remarkable in no way but its name it held a couple of thousand people taking detinans and blonds together and had a main street full of shops a few streets full of houses the local barons keep and not much else lesser nobles manor houses dominated the countryside with the serfs shacks usually close by except for the glideway path that ran through fat mama and the low hills to the east and south of the town joseph the gamecock never would have stopped there gremio was sure of that as things were his company along with the rest of colonel florizels regiment filed into trenches already waiting for them trenches joseph had had the local serfs dig ahead of time im sick of earthworks florizel grumbled im sick to death of them as a matter of fact but your excellency its a lot easier to catch your death outside of earthworks gremio said in the karlsburg circles hed frequented before the war such wordplay would have got the groan it deserved whereupon everyone would have gone about his business but florizel gave gremio a look straight out of a five lakes blizzard and then limped on down the trench gremio wondered what hed done wrong figuring that out unfortunately took but a moment you just contradicted the regimental commander he sighed back in karlsburg he wouldnt have been so foolish as to call a presiding judge a fool even if he was one he would have been especially careful not to do such a thing in fact if the presiding judge was a fool but he was a free detinan and free detinans had the privilege of saying what was on their minds now he saw that having such a privilege and using it werent necessarily one and the same from behind him someone said i thought you were funny sirand you told the truth he turned thank you sergeant thisbe he replied sometimes though the truth is the worst thing you can possibly tell thisbes eyebrows rose you say that sir you a barrister if theres no truth in the lawcourts where can we hope to find it lawcourts are for finding truth sure enough gremio said that doesnt mean its there to begin with and there are ways to tell the truth and still not tell all of it and to tell it in a way that makes you look good and the fellow youre at law against the greatest villain still unburned thats not the way it should be sir thisbe was an earnest young man much given to thought about the way things should be gremio shrugged its the way things are in a lawcourt and remember the other fellow has a barrister trying to play all the same tricks you are he waved toward the south king geoffrey wouldnt need a big army if that abandoned fool of an avram didnt have one too thisbe thought that over before finally nodding i suppose thats true sir things have to balance out dont they but there arent any judges in this fight the way there are in a court of course theres a judge gremio said thisbe gave him a quizzical look he explained the lawcourt of history will say who won its got to be either king geoffrey or king avram do you think we can still win this war sergeant thisbe asked as long as we hold on to marthasville as long as we hurt the southrons every day we can win gremio answered and then precise as a barrister corrected himself we can make king avram quit were not going to give up the fight come what may the only way the southrons can beat us is to knock us flat but if they get sick of funeral pyres and of soldiers never coming home then geoffrey will be king in the north for a long time ah thisbe nodded again and rubbed his smooth chin that explains why joseph the gamecock is making the kind of fight he is hes trying to get the southrons to sicken of the war yes i think so gremio replied as long as we can stay in the field as long as marthasville stays in our hands weve got a decent chance before thisbe could answer a sentry sang out from the south the dust is stirring i think the southron soldiers are coming gremio muttered something under his breath he hadnt expected general hesmucets men to get to fat mama quite so soon the brigade down at dareton should have held them up for quite a while he wondered what had gone wrong something surely had for the sentry was right that rising cloud of dust could only come from the feet of thousands of marching men the hooves of thousands of unicorns and asses the wheels of thousands of supply wagons and enginehauling carts even as he watched the reddish cloud on the southern horizon grew taller and thicker before too long he started making out little flashes of light within the dust cloud unicorns ironshod horns he murmured he didnt realize hed spoken aloud till thisbe nodded once more and said yes and the heads on the spears the pikemen carry watching the army general hesmucet led come forward and deploy on the flat farmland east of the hills warding fat mama was aweinspiring regiment after regiment of grayclad unicornriders pikemen and crossbowmen seemed to fill every available inch of space how can we hope to hold them back let alone beat them now thisbe seemed to be talking to himself see how many men they have theyre drawing themselves up like that on purpose to try to intimidate us gremio would not admit even to himself that he was intimidated their numbers are why the gods made field fortificationsand even more to the point why our serfs made them thisbe said thats true its really amazing what a difference earthworks make in how many men get killed or wounded gremio didnt want to think about getting killed or wounded he knew such things were possible but why dwell on them he pointed toward the southern host which had just about finished its evolutions when theyre done trying to frighten us then well see what they really have in mind nothing good sergeant thisbe predicted no doubt youre right gremio agreed if they had our good will in mind they would leave us alone and let us run our affairs as we choose thats the point of the war after all but its not quite what i meant what did you mean sir where theyll put their encampments and where theyll concentrate their men gremio replied that will tell us a good deal about how they plan to attack us or outflank us oh yes of course thisbe said which left the company commander somewhat deflated hed seen army commanders fail to pay enough attention to what the enemy was up to but his sergeant took the notion for granted did that mean sergeant thisbe ought to be leading an army gremio had his doubts but what did it say about the wits of some of the men who actually were in charge of armies and wings nothing good he feared tents sprang up like fairy rings of outsized toadstools the southrons went about the business of setting up camp with the same matteroffact competence the men of the army of franklin displayed most of them were veterans theyd encamped a great many times before they knew how to do the job thisbe said they must have a great plenty of men and money down in the south of detina they do gremio agreed more men and more money than we have by far how are we ever going to beat them then the sergeant asked we do have a couple of things going for us gremio answered for one theyre invaders here this is our kingdom and we know it and were fighting for it thats so thisbe nodded yet again what else why the other thing we have going for us is that were right of course gremio replied sergeant thisbe smiled thats bound to gain us credit with the gods sir how much good will it do down here on earth good question gremio said when i have a good answer ill let you know he peered out toward the east no chance of hitting them tonightthat seems pretty plain theyve got everything well covered they know as well as we do that we would hit them if they gave us half a chance gremio rubbed his chin or i think we would ever since this campaign started weve been letting them come to us we havent been looking for chances to go at them that doesnt seem to be joseph the gamecocks style thisbe pointed out toward the southron host with a grimynailed callused hand look at what were facing how can we possibly charge out against them theyd chew us up and spit us out if we did as many men as they have there i think youre right gremio said most of the men he led most of the officers over him would have thought the sergeant was wrong most of them reckoned lieutenant general bell the perfect northern patriot and admired him for the wounds hed taken going straight at the foe of course most of the officers over captain gremio were noblemen he hoped he had a more practical way of looking at the world time to get our men bedded down for the night thisbe observed see to it sergeant gremio said thisbe nodded gremio knew thisbe would make sure everything was as it needed to be he did give one additional order put plenty of pickets well forward after that spell the southrons used at caesar no telling what sort of sneaky things they might try we havent seen many night attacks but i dont want to be taken by surprise yes sir sergeant thisbe said ill see to it sir off he went brisk as if hed just drunk four cups of tea gremio wished he had that kind of energy himself he yawned wide enough to split his head in two here and there in the trenches men were getting cookfires going the stews the cooks would serve werent that good but they did keep belly and backbone from gaining too intimate an acquaintance after patrolling the front his company had to cover captain gremio lay down on his blanket and tried to go to sleep the night was as muggy and almost as hot as the day had been so he certainly needed no covers to hold the cold at bay but mosquitoes buzzed in invisible but hungry clouds they looked on gremio the same way he looked on the cooks stewpots he ended up wrapping himself in the blanket just to keep himself from being devoured he slept through the night undisturbed because of the good luck the southrons had had with their sorcerously aided attack on caesar hed wondered if they might try something similar here by fat mama the confusion of night would or could have aided them too but everything stayed quiet when he woke dawn was painting the eastern sky behind the southrons pink clouds floated through the air looking thicker and darker off to the west he wondered if it would rain with all the moisture in the air it seemed likely the idea of staying in the trenches as they turned to mud didnt much appeal to him but the idea of fighting outside them against that vast host of southrons seemed even less delightful hed heard lieutenant general bell was angry that joseph the gamecock wouldnt storm out to assail the enemy but he couldnt see why josephs plan made perfectly good sense to him besides he thought if it does rain everyones bowstring will be wet and that will put a better damper on the fighting than anything this side of a peace treaty he snorted as if avram would grant terms the north could stand or as if king geoffrey could accept any the south was likely to offer no this fight would have to be settled on the field that thought had hardly crossed his mind before sergeant thisbe came over to him and said sir it looks like the southrons are doing something funny in their encampment funny how gremio asked his hand sliding of itself toward the hilt of his sword are they deploying for an attack if they were if thisbe could see they were then they werent using the masking spell theyd tried in caesar the sergeant shook his head i dont think so sir what it looks like is that some of them are going away what gremio said id better come have a look for myself but when he got to a good vantage point he discovered that as usual sergeant thisbe had it right a good many southrons did look to be breaking camp and heading north excitement flowed through him theyre trying to pull the same stunt they did down at borders and caesar he breathed theyll leave some of their men behind to keep us busy here while they use the rest to try to outflank us i wonder if we can attack them now that theyve cut down the size of the host right in front of us thisbe said attacking the whole southron army gremio was convinced was madness attacking part of it so do i he said it just might work lieutenant general bell liked very little about fat mama hed made his headquarters in a fancy manor house not far outside the town and that proved a mistake the baron whod built the place had not only put in marble floors but also kept them polished to a brilliant gloss they were so very slick bells crutches didnt want to keep their grip they kept trying to fly out from under him in which case he would have gone flying too if i break my neck along with wrecking an army and losing a leg i wont be of much use to the kingdom or to myself he thought after one such narrow escape a man does need a few working parts the wing he commanded at fat mama was stationed farther north than any of the other soldiers in the army of franklin bell wondered whether joseph the gamecock had posted them there just to make him rideand sufferfor an extra mile or two he had no intention of asking joseph for the army commander was liable to tell him yes they had enough trouble getting along without that someone pounded on the door to the manor house one of major zibeons assistants went to see who it was he came back to bell and reported a messenger from count joseph sir i shall receive him of course bell said wondering what joseph the gamecock wanted to bother him about now when the messenger came in he almost tripped on the smooth smooth marble floor and had to flail his arms wildly for balance oddly that made bell feel better if a whole man could come close to breaking his neck here he had no reason to know shame for having trouble getting around what can i do for you he asked more warmth than usual in his voice count josephs compliments sir and he requests the boon of your company just as fast as you can get to him the runner replied that meant travel and travel meant more torment bell sipped from his little bottle of laudanum why he asked and warmth was only a memory sir he says he is contemplating an attack and desires your views along with those of his other wing commanders the messenger told him contemplating an attack bell said as if the young man before him had suddenly started speaking a foreign language joseph the gamecock is contemplating an attack my ears must be tricking me he dug a finger into one as if to clear out whatever was blocking them all the runner said was yes sir he is sir truly i can hardly believe it bell said curiosity was enough to outweigh pain at least for the moment you may go back and tell him i shall attend him directly the runner saluted and left bell went to the commanding generals headquarters in a buggy not on unicornback it took him a little longer but gave him time to think he kept stroking his long curly beard as the carriage bounced toward the home where joseph the gamecock had set up shop what sort of ulterior motive did joseph have for ordering an attack now of all times is he trying to discredit me bell wondered has someone let him know about my letters to king geoffrey that could be sticky he had trouble getting very excited about it without the laudanum he knew he would have been all in a swivet of course without the laudanum he would also have been in agony as things were he was merely in painand the drug laid a soft muffling cloud over whatever else he might have felt when he got to josephs headquarters he discovered leonidas the priest and roastbeef william there ahead of him they both towered over joseph the gamecock who was gesturing animatedly as they talked outside bell descended from the buggy and hitched his way over to the other generals good day joseph the gamecock said with a courtly bow good day sir bell answered what is this i hear of attack do we still recall the word we do indeed joseph said i have always said i would smite the stinking southrons if i saw the chance now i do believe they are giving it to us and i intend to use it you had better tell me more sir bell said blinking this is extremely surprising this is nothing like what ive told king geoffrey in my letters he thought what will he do if he hears of the army offranklin attacking what will he do if he hears of it attacking successfully whatever it is it will be nothing that works to my advantage i shall be delighted lieutenant general joseph the gamecock said it appears that general hesmucet is detaching some large part of his force for another move north around our flank if we wait till that part has made its move i think we can strike whats left with some hope of victory looks that way to me too roastbeef william said i am dubious about the whole proposition leonidas the priest declared i think it may be nothing but a trap designed to lure us from our entrenchments so that the enemy may fall upon us bell could have kissed the older man now he wouldnt be the only one speaking up against the whole idea i think leonidas may have a point he said ive had no reports of the southrons moving north again come to my ears you can ride out to the front line and see for yourself joseph the gamecock said in somemore than someexasperation bell you have been agitating for an attack ever since i took command of the army of franklin how is it that now that i propose one you have not the stomach for it i want to attack with some hope of victory sir bell replied i want to attack when its my idea not yours but he couldnt say that to the general commanding the general commanding by his sniff had no trouble figuring it out regardless of whether bell actually said it you have a certain amount of trouble with subordination dont you lieutenant general duke edward of arlington never thought so sir bell said stiffly duke edward of arlington gives men more leeway than most officers are in the habit of doing joseph retorted when i give you an order i expect it to be obeyed have you got that yes sir bell said holding in his rage i have failed in no obedience and that was true so far as the campaign itself went subordination now that was a different questionand joseph the gamecock didnt know how different an answer it had all right then joseph said i want all three of you to prepare your men for an attack tomorrow morning yes sir roastbeef william said he asked no questions he did as he was told joseph the gamecock would never complain about his subordination leonidas the priest turned sorrowful eyes on the general commanding i fear the lion god does not smile on this enterprise the hierophant said the omens are not good and without the gods backing where are we on our own in the world joseph the gamecock said fixing leonidas with a glare like a flying crossbow quarrel i reverence the gods holy sirdont get me wrong about that but until i hear them speak in my own ears i have to make my choices about what to do i have and i am may the lion god not smite you for your arrogance sir leonidas said i shall pray for his forbearance maybe we would do better to send out scouting forces come morning to see if the southrons really did shift some large part of their host bell said joseph threw his hands in the air by all the gods gentlemen how can i hope to attack when two of my three wing commanders think id be making a mistake to do so and then king geoffrey will blame me for not being aggressive enough you havent been aggressive enough bell thought you may try to make up for it now but you would have done better to strike at the southrons from the start i am an obedient man sir leonidas the priest said if you order me to send my soldiers forward i shall do so regardless of my own personal feelings as to the wisdom of the order no no no no joseph the gamecock shook his head if we attack we should put all our force all our spirit into it otherwise we might as well not do it at all he swung his gaze back toward bell lieutenant general yes sir bell said loudly if you make this probing attack of yours and discover the enemy before you is weak will you advance against him at all hazards yes sir of course sir bell replied all right then joseph the gamecock said go ahead and do it if the foe proves as weak as i expect put everything you have into the blow yes sir bell said for the third time if i may make so bold as to tell you sir you dont need to say that to me all right joseph said also repeating himself i know you strike hard when you strike i hadnt thought getting you to strike would be so much trouble though he pointed to roastbeef william and leonidas the priest in turn have your men ready to move too if bells attack shows the southrons to be as weak as i think they are ill want to hit them every which way at once yes sir roastbeef william said he would obey without complaining and without making anyone feel he was doing him a favor yes sir leonidas the priest echoed he wasnt happy about it and he didnt care who knew he wasnt happy bell just nodded and made his slow way back to the buggy he felt joseph the gamecocks eyes boring into him every step of the way but didnt turn around to look at the commanding general when he returned to his own smoothfloored headquarters he sent runners to the brigades under his command ordering them to ready themselves for battle whats going on sir major zibeon asked briefly bell explained this isnt the best time or place for the attack he finished but i must obey zibeon nodded it may not be so bad as you think sir he said something like enthusiasm on his usually sour face if hesmucet really has detached some large part of his force for a flanking attack we can punish the rest before the detached portion is able to come to its rescue that is also joseph the gamecocks theory bell said how it will turn out in practice remains to be seen i know youve been eager to attack sir his aidedecamp said now count joseph is giving you your chance i dont want joseph giving me anything bell thought i want to take for myself and to do it with both hands but he couldnt explain that to zibeon he didnt know where the majors ultimate loyalty lay i intend to do everything i can he said and thought he was telling the truth some of it anyhow as joseph had ordered he sent his men forward against the southrons at first light the next morning he went forward too tied onto his unicorn hed never yet ordered soldiers to advance without advancing at their head he had no intention of changing his ways because he was mutilated either major zibeon did ride at his side and that was a changebefore his wounds no one would have presumed to do any such thing as they pushed toward the main body of the southrons they overran a few pickets and sentries and scouts wearing gray a few others escaped and fled toward their encampment so far so good zibeon said yes so far lieutenant general bell sounded suspicious i only hope were not moving forward into a trap not much to trap us with sir his aidedecamp waved to show what he meant nothing but flat land except for those trees off to our left and there arent enough of them to hide anything very big may the lion god prove you right bell said piously i still think the southrons could cause us trouble if before he could go on southron unicornriders galloped forth to challenge his host which had advanced about a mile some of them shot crossbows at bells men the rest served a handful of catapults on wheeled carriages they flung a few firepots and shot long darts northerners who were hit cried out in pain bells eyes kept going to those trees on the flank i think theyve got more engines hidden away in there he said nervously wed better not go any farther or the shots from the flank will tear us to pieces sir i dont think youre right major zibeon said and even if you are we can send men over there to clear them out no my minds made up bell said were going back to camp i think hesmucets just lying in wait for us and to the seven hells with me if ill give him a victory on the cheap he shouted for his trumpeters and ordered a withdrawal joseph the gamecock had ordered a probe and hed given joseph that much he had no intention of giving the commanding general anything more colonel andy eyed the retreating northerners in some perplexity why are they falling back he asked lieutenant general george they might have done us a lot of harm if theyd kept coming if i knew i would tell you doubting george answered ill tell you this though youre not wrong we just dodged a crossbow quarrel there yes sir his adjutant agreed they came forward bold as you please and in some numbers too you wouldnt have thought they had that much zing left in em it doesnt do to count the northerners as licked too soon george said general guildenstern did that and look what it got him a command out on the eastern steppe fighting the blond savages colonel andy shuddered no thanks that isnt what i want to have happen to my career that isnt what anybody wants to have happen to his career george said its all very well when its the only game in town when were at peace everywhere else but when theres a real war to be fought youd better do everything you can to fight it isnt that the truth colonel andy said fervently he was a colonel because of the war as soon as it ended he would return to his permanent captains rankand very likely to a dusty fortress out on the steppe doubting georges own prospects were rather better he was a permanent brigadier as well as a brevet lieutenant general but the battle to get a decent post once the fight with king geoffreys men was over might well prove as fierce as any struggle in this conflict it could be worse he thought when the war was over and wonif it was to be wonthe officers whod abandoned detina and king avram for treason and grand duke geoffrey would george assumed be out of the army for good he also assumed a good many of them would go up on crosses for abandoning detina but that would be king avrams decision not his he called for a runner when one of the young messengers came up he said my compliments to general hesmucet and the northerners attack appears to have fizzled out like a candle using up the last of its tallow we can strike at the enemy here if he likes to keep joseph the gamecock from shifting forces to meet our latest flanking move repeat that back if youd be so kind yes sir the messenger said and did at doubting georges nod he hurried away hesmucet himself came riding back to george before the messenger returned the commanding general looked over the ground do you know what lieutenant general he said no sir tell me what george said gravely ill do just that hesmucet said heres what youre a lucky son of a bitch were all lucky sons of bitches if the traitors had pressed that attack you mightve been in a peck of trouble that thought did cross my mind yes sir george said but lieutenant general bell started to come at us and then seemed as though he changed his mind with his move half begun peculiar bell hesmucet said are you sure it was bell hes not in the habit of pulling back from an attack once he starts one that bastard will press ahead come hells or high water and he hits hard when he hits too it was bellno doubt about it doubting george replied the handful of prisoners we took are from regiments he commands and some of our riders saw him up on his own unicorn with the short stump hes got on that one leg hes not a man you can easily mistake for anyone else i wont say youre wrong on account of youre godsdamned well right hesmucet said even so i can hardly believe it what made him pull back youd have to ask him sir because i dont know george replied all we had in front of him was the screen of hardriding jimmys unicornriders i wish id been able to put some men and engines in amongst the trees on his flankhe pointed in the direction from which the northerners had comebut i didnt have time to move any to tell you the truth i didnt expect the traitors to come out of their works well now we know they willor they may anyhow hesmucet said well have to be more careful he made a sour face that means more entrenching gods damn it i hate it but i see no way to escape it so long as we win sir im not fussy about how george told him the commanding general nodded that is well said it is full of the generous spirit ive looked for in youand i must say ive found we may not love each other lieutenant general but we manage to work together that same thing had crossed my mind a time or two sir george stuck out his hand general hesmucet clasped it george went on and what do you require of me now that bells men have withdrawn to their trenches be ready to pursue them and to attack if you see the opportunity when they pull out of those trenches again hesmucet replied i do not think they can hold their position long not with another flanking maneuver even now aimed at getting into their rear just as you say sir doubting george saluted were going to lick these bastards is what were going to do hesmucet said false king geoffrey says he has a kingdom he may even think he has a kingdom what he has is a hollow shell and once we show that this thing he thinks he rules will shrivel up like a pricked bladder duke edward will have something to say about that too george said duke edward is a lucky son of a bitch i dont even think he knows what a lucky son of a bitch he is general hesmucet said all the battlefields over in southern parthenia are cramped together the land between georgetown and nonesuch works for him because it keeps marshal bartand whoever else commanded against the army of southern partheniafrom using our advantage in numbers to outmaneuver duke edward to hold him with part of our force and get around him with the rest fighting joseph tried that george remarked all he got for his trouble was embarrassed at viziersville i know but that was fighting joseph hesmucet made a dismissive gesture a real general who tried it would have done a hells of a lot better doubting george looked around to make sure fighting joseph was nowhere nearby he might have failed against duke edward of arlington but he remained a proud and touchy man he also remained nowhere in sight for which george was duly grateful george said marshal bart isnt trying to outmaneuver duke edward it surely doesnt look that way hesmucet agreed he fought him in the jungle not far from viziersville and then again and again hes going to head for nonesuch and to hammer duke edward flat if he stands in the way long enough as i said he hasnt got the room to maneuver that i do all very interesting and none of it quite what i expected when this springs fighting began doubting george said i thought you would be the one who banged straight ahead i might if i were facing duke edward hes fond of coming out and slugging hesmucet replied joseph the gamecock is different he takes these defensive positions and invites you to bloody your nose on them im not the only one shaping this campaign and thats worth remembering youre right sir and i hadnt thought it through george nodded respectfully to hesmucet sure enough as with bart there was more to the man than met the eye you and duke edward would add up to something different from you and joseph the gamecock hesmucet nodded thats right thats just right and joseph and bart would be different from what duke edward and bart are turning into the commanders on both sides make things what they are as a matter of fact i dont mind this game of maneuver so much as i thought i would really george raised an eyebrow whys that sir the smile hesmucet smiled was particularly nasty because it lets me move through country thats never been fought over before this far north the barons and earls and counts supposed they were safe they didnt think any southron army could ever come all the way up here now theyre seeing they were wrong theres no place in geoffreys socalled kingdom we cant reach lets see how much fights left in the traitors once they start to realize that down in their guts as if to underscore the point hed been making a couple of dozen blondsescaped serfs every one of them men women and childrencame by shepherded along by a couple of grayuniformed southron soldiers they were a couple of dozen people who wouldnt labor for their liege lords any more and who would do useful work for king avrams army doubting george nodded thoughtfully once more he said youre fighting against geoffreys whole wouldbe kingdom not just against joseph the gamecock then well of course hesmucet replied but it wasnt of course not to george it probably wouldnt have been of course to any general whod fought before this war began either wars usually aimed at defeating the enemys army not at smashing his whole kingdom flat no hesmucet and bart werent playing by the old rules fighting wont be the same after this doubting george observed i dont want there to be any more fighting in the kingdom of detina after this hesmucet said i want everybody to get the idea that it is one kingdom and it will always be one kingdom and if i have to kill everybody who doesnt get that idea or make him starve or burn down his fancy manor and take away his serfs i will do any of those things and i wont lose a single solitary minutes worth of sleep over any of it you intend to be persuasive you say georges voice was dry godsdamn right i do hesmucet replied taking his words at face value i want the traitors licked i dont want them thinking well we almost won this time maybe we ought to try again if you get into a tavern fight with a man and you knock him down youre always smart to kick him a couple of times afterwards that way he doesnt think the fight was close he bloody well knows you licked him as a younger man doubting george had found himself in a fewperhaps more than a fewtavern fights of his own the ones hed won hed mostly followed hesmucets rule the few hed lost of itself his hand rubbed his ribcage plenty of other tough young men thought the same way he remembered boots thudding home things hed tried to keep out of his memory for years hesmucet clapped him on the shoulder we are going to whip the northerners here and ill tell you why im all ears george said solemnly because marthasville ties joseph the gamecock down thats why the general commanding said he has no choice thats the place hes got to defend if he doesnt he might as well not be in the field and that means sooner or later im going to flank him once too often hell either have to give me marthasville or come out and fight either way ill have what i want gods grant it be so george said dont talk that way around major alva hesmucet told him hell give you plenty of reasons to think the gods dont much care one way or the other sort of makes you understand why they used to burn wizards every now and again he walked off whistling doubting george had no intention of talking to major alva clever young mages were useful creatures but because they had a lot of the answers they often thought and behaved as if they had them all george was a profoundly conservative man hed been too conservative to leave detina with his province and with grand duke geoffrey to his way of thinking that there had always been one kingdom was the best argument that there should always be one kingdom his belief in the gods and their potency was likewise deep and sincere he didnt care to listen to a whippersnapper who would try to unsettle that belief if he were to try too hard he would probably end up short a couple of teeth george thought id kick him when he was down too he didnt worry for a moment what a mage might do to him he called to colonel andy whod discreetly stepped out of earshot while he conferred with general hesmucet be ready to move forward at my orders or at the commanding generals he said i dont think the traitors will trouble us much more with attacks of their own not hereabouts yes sir his adjutant said and move some of our engines forward too george added if we do have to assault the enemys works well want to make this that and the other thing come down on his head yes sir andy repeated rather more enthusiastically this time dont worry colonel doubting george said as long as we keep hammering at the enemy well break him sooner or later yes sir thats what general guildenstern said too sir as you pointed out not so long ago lieutenant general george winced it wasnt quite what hed pointed out but it was pretty close ive been skewered he thought which of us is supposed to be the one who doubts things i was under the impression it was me but ill start wondering if andy keeps that up joseph the gamecock put his hands on his hips and glared from lieutenant general bell to leonidas the priest and back again which of us he asked bell is supposed to be the one who wants to slug it out with the enemy and which the one who would sooner fight positionally correct me if im wrong but i had thought you owned the former role and i the latter i will start wondering if you keep this up though i am sorry sir bell said i truly am but i do not see how we can hold our position east of fat mama if the southrons bring up their siege engines to bear on our works as they are now in the process of doing i must agree leonidas the priest said a lugubrious frown on his face must you joseph snapped leonidas nod was lugubrious too joseph rounded on roastbeef william and what about you are you also of the opinion that we need to take flight no sir roastbeef william replied if the southrons come at us i expect we can beat them back well gods be praised joseph exclaimed he did a couple of mincing mocking steps of a triumphal dance someone who hasnt got his headquarters in his hindquarters as that fool of a southron said he did a couple of years ago back in the province of parthenia sir i resent the imputation bell said resent it you dont even know what the hells it means joseph the gamecock thought sourly you were all for attack before lieutenant general he said you were for it when i was against it it gave you something to complain about in that i wasnt doing what you wanted but when i asked you for an attack what did i get excuses nothing else but did you want me to send my brave men forward to be slaughtered bell demanded the enemys siege engines on our flank would have wrecked my entire wing anyone on the spot would have seen the same by all ive heard lieutenant general you were the only one who had even the slightest hint of the presence of these perhaps mythical catapults joseph said no matter what damage you may have feared the actual damage you suffered from them was nil i fear nothing bell rumbled from most men that would have been a brag or a lie from him joseph the gamecock believed it it did not however necessarily make things better rather than worse weve already yielded the southrons too much land roastbeef william said if we have to leave fat mama they hold most of the southern half of peachtree province if we hold our ground here and are overwhelmed what then leonidas the priest returned in that case not only is the southern half of the province lost but also the army that could defend the rest joseph the gamecock felt like tearing his thinning hair how pray tell is the enemy going to overwhelm us here he said these works are as strong as a swarm of serfs could make them not strong enough bell insisted if the southrons move forward and put their catapults on our flanks theyll make us sorry we ever chose to fight here well be sorrier if we leave joseph said roastbeef william nodded his ruddy face even redder than usual but both bell and leonidas the priest solemnly shook their heads joseph felt like kicking them what am i supposed to do he cried i want to stand my ground but how can i possibly when two of my wing commanders think i would be courting disaster if i tried i was not the one who ordered us here to fat mama bell said no but you and this halfwitted hierophant were also the ones who told me i didnt dare attack the southrons and by all the signs you were wrong about that joseph the gamecock growled i am not halfwitted leonidas cried turning almost as red as roastbeef william usually was quarterwitted then joseph said with mock graciousness leonidas took it for the real thing for a moment which went a long way toward proving josephs point then the hierophant of the lion god bellowed in fresh outrage sir you did not pick a good site to defend lieutenant general bell said you would have liked it a lot better had you picked it yourself joseph said instead of answering bell drew from his pocket the little bottle of laudanum he always carried with him he pulled the cork with his teeth drank and put the bottle away again thats where he gets his brains joseph the gamecock thought at the start of the campaign hed admired bell for his courage in staying in the field even with his dreadful wounds nowadays if you feel the rigors of service in the army of franklin are excessive lieutenant general you may be sure i would be of the opinion that your retirement would in no way affect your honor he said in hopeful tones i have not the slightest intention of retiring bell replied peevishly i aim to go forth and conquer the foe do you joseph couldnt resist the gibe there he was right in front of you just waiting to be struck you advanced a mile against no opposition discovered catapults where no one else suspected them and retired forthwith to your works a less than heroic encounter if i may say so we can hold here roastbeef william said providing we have the will to do so provided joseph corrected william stiffened joseph realized he might have done better than to engage in literary criticism william was on his side even if imperfectly grammatical the wing commander had also accurately summed things upif they had the will they could hold their ground here joseph the gamecock looked from one of his subordinates to another roastbeef william had that will or at least willingness leonidas the priest what was left of bell joseph shook his head despair threatened to choke him if we leave fat mama where will we go he asked plaintively bell glowered at him where would you have gone sir he turned the title of respect into one of reproachafter the southrons flanked us out of here joseph the gamecock glared back it was unfortunately a sharp question and however much joseph hated to admit it it was a question with an answer for hed contemplated it himself we would have to move up to whole mackerel with the hills around that place it makes another good spot to try to slow the southrons and to hurt them well then leonidas the priest said as if that settled everything it didnt not so far as joseph the gamecock was concerned dont you see he said something that felt much too much like desperation in his voice by all the gods dont you see shifting our position because the enemy forces us to do it is one thing shifting our position because some of our officers have a case of the collywobbles is something else again sound strategy dictates that we pull out of fat mama before disaster befalls us here leonidas intoned as if chanting a prayer to the lion god the god might have heard him with favor he infuriated joseph sound strategy the general commanding the army of franklin exclaimed his voice breaking like a youths sound strategy what in the seven hells do you know about sound strategy sirrah you wouldnt recognize a sound strategy if it danced up and pissed on your boot that was the opinion of practically every officer whod ever tried to command leonidas the priest it was a matter on which joseph the gamecock and the nowdeparted count thraxton the braggart actually agreedone of the very few matters on which they actually agreed as neither was much in the habit of agreeing with anyone else joseph was glad to have the men leonidas had led into his army he would have been even gladder to have them had they come without the general at their head i shall pray to the lion god for your enlightenment sir leonidas said now either he will give it or he will rend you for your presumption im using my head or trying to joseph snapped he felt as if he were using it to pound it against a stone wall if thinking be impiety its no wonder you have a reputation as a pillar of the gods leonidas bowed and strode off his scarlet vestments flapping around his ankles i hope you trip and break your neck joseph the gamecock thought but his prayer went unanswered of course it goes unanswered im impious leonidas just said so that must make it true lieutenant general bell said stay in fat mama sir if you want to see your army destroyed without the slightest chance of striking back by all means stay and he hitched away too what can i do joseph demanded of roastbeef william i think we can hold here you think we can hold here but we cant hold here if those two dont think we can his remaining wing commander said which was all too likely to be true with a resigned shrug roastbeef william went on maybe theyll like things better up at whole mackerel not likely joseph the gamecock said but he tasted defeat my own wing commanders have beaten me worse than the southrons ever managed let it be as you say william well pack up shop and shift to whole mackerel maybe things will go better there he didnt believe it not for a moment and he hated drafting the orders that moved the army of franklin from as yet unchallenged works and sent it farther north yet he hated even more watching the men in blue abandon those field fortifications some of them marched off to the north others boarded glideway carpets for the trip up to whole mackerel sorcerers had dreamt for ages of making carpets that would fly anywhere at the wave of a hand and a word of command glideways were as close as theyd come carpets that would travel a few inches above the ground along very specific routes they could carry men and goods as fast as a horse galloped and they never tired joseph wished he could say the same he was very weary indeed as he rode out of fat mama for whole mackerel it wasnt so much a weariness of the body as a weariness of the spirit hed done everything he knew how to do to keep the southrons from turning or overrunning his position at fat mama and everything hed done had gone for nothing and king geoffrey will hear of this latest retreat and whom will he blame me of course joseph thought gloomily if there is ever any chance to blame me for anything his majesty is not the man to waste it he left behind a screen of unicornriders to destroy what the army of franklin couldnt take away with it and to hold off the southrons till his abandonment of fat mama was complete brigadier spinner who commanded the unicornriders was competent but uninspired he was plenty good enough for the task joseph had set him even so his presence on the field left joseph unhappy i wish ned of theforest were here instead of over by thegreatriver joseph thought unhappily i wish he were harrying hesmucets supply line a glideway ned attacks isnt any good to anyone for a long time to come one of the reasons ned was in virtual exile joseph had heard was that hed all but challenged thraxton the braggart to a duel after the battle by the river of death a good many northern men had felt like killing thraxton at one time or another few of them found the nerve to come right out and say so ned of the forest might not be a gentleman but hed never lacked for nerve joseph the gamecock looked back over his shoulder sure enough there was the buggy carrying lieutenant general bell joseph muttered something uncomplimentary bell had come with the same reputation for vigorous fighting as ned even if no one ever claimed he made much of a tactician but he wouldnt attack when joseph really needed aggression from him and he didnt think the army of franklin could have held fat mama what did that say about him hes been wounded too many times joseph thought as charitably as he could he takes too much laudanum it clouds his judgment of course leonidas the priest hadnt thought the northern army could hold at fat mama either but what did that prove joseph the gamecock let out a bitter snort of laughter nothing much and everyone knows it if leonidas thinks something cant be done that usually proves it can too late now though fat mama lay behind the army of franklin as did caesar as did borders ahead whole mackerel after that what the army of franklin was tied to marthasville and joseph knew it painfully well hesmucet could maneuver as he would joseph couldnt he had to shield the town from the southron host hesmucet had to know that as well as he did too he had to but could he i dont know he was honest enough to admit as much to himself however honest it was the admission did nothing to reassure him did king geoffrey send me here to watch me fail he wondered did he send me here in hope of finding an excuse to put me back on the shelf for good to the hells with him gods damn me if i intend to give him one iv general hesmucet eyed the pass leading through the hills northwest to whole mackerel the pass would have been a nasty place to try to force a crossing even if the traitors and their serfs hadnt had weeks to fortify it as things were as things were hesmucet shook his head and spoke two words to his wing commanders no thanks cant say im sorry sir doubting george said tackling that position would be as bad as going headon at the vultures nest and the dogs path we could use up a lot of soldiers without getting much another flanking maneuver james the birds eye asked eagerly of course the young brigadier was eager if hesmucet did try a flanking maneuver he hoped his men would again be the ones to make it fighting joseph coughed a significant cough my warriors he observed have not yet won their fair share of glory on this campaign havent done their fair share of dying do you mean george muttered hesmucet heard the gibe he didnt think fighting joseph did he said yes i intend to flank the northerners out of this position but i intend to use the whole army to do it james the birds eyes face fell hesmucet pretended not to notice he went on twenty years ago when i was a subaltern i rode from karlsburg in palmetto province to hiltonia here in peachtree and then on to bellfoundry in the province of dothan as a young soldier is supposed to do i noted the lay of the land hereabouts and i think i still recollect it tolerably well there is a place to the north of whole mackerel called fort worthless cheerful name brigadier james said with a grin believe me the place deserves it hesmucet answered they say the mosquitoes there spring from dragons on their mothers side and that theyre big enough to carry off a man i dont know about the second but having been bitten by more than a few of them i would say the first is surely true now if we can take this place we interpose ourselves between joseph the gamecock and marthasville that is what im going to try to do thats what youve been trying to do all along doubting george said my own view is we ought to just hammer the traitors fighting joseph said nothing would please me better hesmucet said but joseph the gamecock declines to send his men out of their earthworks to be hammered as long as he keeps his army intact and holds us away from marthasville he accomplishes his purpose i dont aim to let him how do we get to this fort worthless place sir james the birds eye asked how do we do it without going through whole mackerel i mean hesmucet pointed not northwest but northeast over there is a road junction called konigsburg i intend to move the army there first and then shift west over calabash creek toward fort worthless i have maps which i can show you at your leisure if youre so inclined thank you sir james replied he was eager in a war where so many had grown weary that alone made him stand out id be pleased to see them next question is how do we keep joseph the gamecock from realizing what were up to doubting george said his questions were always to the point and all the more so when most pointed but hesmucet said i have some ideas about that too he set them forth whats my part in all this fighting joseph asked when he was througha question altogether in keeping with his temperament lieutenant general george said none of that matters the plan matters i think its a good one james the birds eye said ive started sending men down some of these roads i dont think the roads know where theyre going themselves hesmucet nodded thats how i remember them even the locals get lost half the time seems like but weve got enough serfs coming in to us to keep us from getting too badly confused and most of the traitors wont have any better notion of where the roads go than we do lets get moving you still havent answered my question sir fighting joseph said what is my role in all this whatever i order it to be hesmucet snapped by now out of temper get your men moving along with everybody elses handsome face dark with anger fighting joseph stormed away hesmucet nodded to james and george saluting they left too as they did so major alva came up to hesmucet he too saluted sloppilyhe was a soldier because he needed to be in the chain of command not through any innate longing for the military life in fact hesmucet doubted hed ever seen a less military man in all his life can we go on with it sir alva asked anxiously can we please he sounded as eager as a child with a new toy in truth that was about what he was one thing king avrams army did for him it let him play with bigger fancier toys than he would ever have got his hands on in civilian life yes were going to try it hesmucet answered remember the object is to make the traitors think were slamming our way through at whole mackerel of course i remember sir alva sounded affronted that hesmucet could think he would forget anything and i probably am naive to think any such thing went through hesmucets mind whatever else this puppy is forgetful he isntespecially when he does get to use his toys alva went on funny how at caesar you wanted me to mask a real attack from the enemy where now im going to be doing just the opposite its not funnyits necessary hesmucet said if we do the same thing over and over pretty soon it wont fool the northerners any more oh right isnt that interesting alva blinked he was a very clever young man hes certainly more clever than i am at whatever he wants to turn his mind to hesmucet thought but when he hasnt turned his mind to something it just isnt there for him he can see the magic something i could never do in a thousand years but hes never thought about whys and wherefores he set his hand on alvas shoulder feeling downright grandfatherly even though he wasnt far past forty himself you tend to your business son and ill tend to mine and between us with a little luck well make geoffreys men mighty unhappy i like that sir alva said you know people really shouldnt bind other people to the land who knows how many mages and artisans and such have sweated their lives away raising indigo and rice and sugar just because they happened to be born with blond hair hesmucet grunted his own view of blonds was much less sanguine than alvas keeping detina one kingdom counts for a good deal too he said dryly oh yes that too of course alva agreed though to him it was plainly of secondary importance tomorrow morning tomorrow morning hesmucet agreed that will give the men a good start toward konigsburg all right sir alva grinned a smallboy grin altogether unsuited to a major this should be fun that evening hesmucet posted pickets well forward of his main line he didnt want the northerners to have another chance to give him a nasty surprise as theyd almost done at fat mama if lieutenant general bell hadnt pulled back for no reason hesmucet could see he might have done a good deal of damage here at whole mackerel though joseph the gamecock kept his men quiet inside their entrenchments all things considered hesmucet didnt blame him he was ensconced in a solid position as solid as the one outside borders headon assault probably wouldnt take the place if hesmucet couldnt flank the traitors out of whole mackerel theyd be there a long time joseph he knew would pay him about as much money as false king geoffrey had in his treasury to attack headon he lay down on his ironframed cot with a smile on his face sometimes the best way to confound a man was to give him exactly what he thought he wanted when morning came hesmucet put most of his soldiers on the miserable roads north that led to konigsburg colonel phineas and almost all the rest of the armys mages had the job of masking that move from the northerners phineas wasnt much of a mage himself but did have a knack for getting other mages to work together major alva by contrast had very little ability to work with anybody else but he was a hells of a mage hesmucet had less ability to work with other officers than a lot of southrons and was uneasily aware of the fact but he was a good general himself which made up for a multitude of flaws are you ready he asked alva a predawn mist still lingered over the field a bit of luck he hadnt dared hope for i sure am alva replied gaily his eyes sparkled he was indeed as ready as small boys were for a lark begin then hesmucet said and let me know when i can play my part in this little show just as you say sir alva replied and he began to chant he hadnt gone far before hesmucet could feel power start to accrete around him as layers of nacre accumulated around grit to make a pearl that same sort of power had gathered around thraxton the braggart at proselytizers rise even if hed botched his incantation in the end hesmucet had never seen any southron mage even try to control such forces almost absently alva pointed to hesmucet if the commanding general hadnt been waiting for the signal he might have missed it even as things were he needed a moment to realize the gesture wasnt part of one of the passes alva had been flinging around with what looked like reckless abandon hesmucet turned to his trumpeters and made a peremptory gesture of his own they blared out advance the handful of southron soldiers hesmucet had kept behind outside of whole mackerel stormed toward the traitors works as if expecting to overrun them with ease major alva made one last pass cried out let it be accomplished and pointed toward the northerners field fortifications and suddenly coming through that convenient mist toward the enemy were not a few soldiers but what seemed for all the world like general hesmucets entire army to hesmucet the sorcerous additions to the force looked ghostly insubstantial alva had assured him that from the front they would be indistinguishable from real soldiers except for one unfortunate detail they werent actually there and couldnt actually fight but they certainly could cause consternation and that suited the commanding general just fine if we get very very lucky they might even make the traitors panic and then the real soldiers whose numbers alva is magnifying will drive the enemy out of his trenches hesmucet thought he didnt really expect that to happen but a general was entitled to hopes no less than any other man for a few heady moments he thought those hopes would be realized the northerners were filled with consternation when they saw what looked and sounded like an enormous army bearing down on them the real soldiers and real catapults and repeating crossbows among the simulacra sent enough missiles toward the traitors works to make the whole assault seem convincing especially to startled soldiers not expecting any such thing inside the northerners fieldworks horns blared and officers and sergeants shouted in alarm a few men did flee hesmucet could see them scrambling out of the entrenchments and running back toward whole mackerel more though sent an enormous storm of crossbow bolts and stones and firepots down on the heads of the advancing southron host the soldiers who werent really there proved their worth against that vicious barrage since they didnt exist they werent likely to be killed by any merely material missiles they kept right on advancing in the face of everything the traitors could do that apparent immortality might have brought even more fear to the foe instead it ended up giving away the game the northerners realized no mere human beings could possibly have gone through such a pounding without losing a man and their mages were not to be despised indeed till hesmucet came across major alva northern mages had dominated the field counterspell alva gasped strong one he muttered charms and made desperate passes but the northerners once alerted to his magecraft savagely tore at it the advancing army of simulacra began to fade to become one with the mist out of which they were advancing and at last to disappear as soon as hesmucet saw that begin to happen he pulled back his real soldiers lest the traitors swarm forth and overwhelm them he set a handagain he felt grandfatherlyon alvas shoulder dont worry about it he told the young mage you bought us a big chunk of the morning thats as much as i was hoping for and more than i expected gods damn it i wanted everything to be perfect alva said most southron mages would have been satisfied with coming close to what their commanders wanted hesmucet realized he had something very special in the line of sorcerer here he patted alva on the shoulder again dont worry son he said dont you worry at all you did just fine come on men captain gremio called as his company of northerners tramped almost single file along a narrow winding track somewhere north of whole mackerel another position abandoned colonel florizel grumbled the regimental commander rode his unicorn the rest of the regiment captains included went on foot gremio didnt contradict the colonel not out loud but he understood joseph the gamecocks reasons for pulling out of whole mackerel again hesmucet was playing the outflanking game this country was overgrown almost jungly it was full of bugs all of which in gremios biased opinion seemed to be trying to bite him at once he slapped and scratched and swore his men were slapping and scratching and swearing too so maybe a few of the bugs did have extra time on their hands the soldiers splashed through a swampy stream check for leeches sergeant thisbe saidparasites of a sort gremio hadnt thought of coming up onto drier land men did as the sergeant said some of them cursed and made disgusted noises when they found leeches clinging to their legs too no dont just tear them off gremio told a blueclad trooper who was about to do just that the mouth stays behind when you do and the wound will go bad thats right catling thisbe agreed touch a smoldering twig to the head end of the leech then it will really let go itll burn me too the soldier said if you want to take a chance on going around with crutches like lieutenant general bell do it your way gremio said if you want to do it right do what thisbe and i tell you to do im a free detinan and my ideas are just as good as anybody elses gods damn it catling yanked the leech off his leg he poked at the wound sure enough the leechs mouth remained locked to his flesh he looked much less happy after that try a burning twig now sergeant thisbe said sometimes the mouth will still let go even after youve ripped away the rest of the leech he doesnt deserve to have the mouth come loose gremio said in considerable anger there are some people in this kingdom who think the greatest privilege the gods granted a free detinan is the privilege of making a godsdamned fool of himself whenever it strikes his fancy they do thissometimes they do it over and overand then oftentimes they expect the lawcourts to free them from their folly to the seven hells with that as far as im concerned if you insist on being a fool you bloody well ought to pay for your folly every now and again catlings a brave soldier thisbe said id rather have him hale so he can shoot at the southrons than laid up with a bad leg youre too kind and gentle for your own good gremio said thisbes cleanshaven cheeks made his flush easy to see gremio kicked at the mucky ground calling a sergeant gentle was bound to embarrass him before the men he was supposed to lead where in the seven hells are we somebody asked considering the weather and the landscape the question seemed more than usually apt precise as always gremio answered were somewhere between fort worthless and konigsburg fort worthless is one of those places that live up to their names ninetynine years and eleven months a century but this is its month to shine weve got to keep the stinking southrons from getting there till the army finishes pulling out of whole mackerel when the southrons find themselves a real wizard you know the war isnt what we expected when we started fighting it thisbe said thats so gremio agreed but a real wizard isnt always just what you want we had thraxton the braggart for instance but im just as well pleased hes gone off to nonesuch he cost us the battle of proselytizers rise he cost us that battle a couple of different ways thisbe said it wasnt just that he botched the spell though that was bad enough but he sent james of broadpath off to the southwest to attack wesleyton while the southrons in rising rock were building up their strength what sort of fool would do such a thing a sour one gremio answered hed quarreled with jameshed quarreled with everybody i thinkand so he sent him away thraxtons bad temper is why we havent got ned of the forest leading our unicornriders too well end up paying a price for that along with everything else id bet they splashed across another stream turtles and frogs sitting on rocks dove into the water and frantically swam away one luckless frog jumped almost right into a water snakes mouth the snake swam over and gulped gremio wondered uneasily if crocodiles lurked in the water too he hoped he and his men wouldnt find out the hard way how far is it up to calabash creek sir thisbe asked to the seven hells with me if i know sergeant gremio said i dont know how far weve comei dont see how anybody could know how far weve come considering how these roads all seem to bend back on themselves and i dont know how far this creek is from where we encamped for all i do know that miserable little rill we just crossed was it and were heading straight for the southrons at konigsburg wed better not be thisbe said i dont know why not gremio said one thing i am sure of is that the southrons have to be as confused about all this as we are if theyre supposed to be at konigsburg theyre probably somewhere else but were ordered to take our stand on the west bank of calabash creek and not let them advance on fort worthless sergeant thisbe sounded worried he took orders very seriously which made him unusual among free detinan men you cant tell me what to do was one of the most common phrases in any detinans mouth dont worry about it gremio said sooner or later well find them or theyll find us and then well see what happens next what he expected would happen next was for both sides to entrench as best they could in this muddy ground and then shoot crossbow quarrels at each other the landscape didnt offer room enough for big sweeping charges not only that both sides were less eager to make them than they had been earlier in the war big sweeping charges left bodies strewn all over a battlefield but rarely shifted the enemy if hed already had time to dig in colonel florizels regiment found the foe before finding calabash creek startled shouts rang out ahead of gremios company southrons traitors each side seemed equally appalled at stumbling on the other a crossbow bolt hissed past gremios head he had no idea whether his own men or the southrons had shot it forward he shouted we have to help our friends he was an officer and bore a sword instead of a crossbow when he drew it he knew a certain feeling of unreality as a barrister back in karlsburg he hadnt used a blade baron ormerod whod led the company before him had been a good man with his handswhich hadnt kept him from stopping a bolt with his chest trying to stem the northern rout behind proselytizers rise forward sergeant thisbes clear voice echoed his forward the soldiers went theyd never been shy about fightingonly the southrons numbers had kept them in their entrenchments through most of this campaign now they had or might have a good chance to meet the enemy on even terms they rushed to take it the fight was even more confused than the woodland skirmishes before the battle by the river of death the overgrowth was thicker and lusher than it had been farther south as soon as men took a few steps off the track they had to navigate as much by ear as by eye geoffrey the northerners cried the southerners yelled avram and both sides shouted freedoma good way to land anyone coming to what might be the rescue in trouble gremio almost ran right into a southron the man in gray shouted something a lot less complimentary than avram and let fly with his crossbow he couldnt have stood more than five feet from gremio but missed anyhow gremio had no time even to thank the gods for his good luck he charged at the southron expecting the man to flee instead the enemy soldier threw down the crossbow drew his shortsword and slashed at gremio with his own longer officers weapon gremio had no trouble holding off the southron but he couldnt finish him then a crossbow quarrel caught the southron in the thigh as he howled and crumpled and clutched at himself gremio lunged forward and stabbed him the southrons howl became a bubbling shriek gremio wasnt particularly proud of the victory but a victory it was forward he yelled again the southrons were storming forward themselves on this overgrown battlefield who had the most men close by was anyones guess over in parthenia thered been a fight in what people called the jungle gremio had his doubts about what kind of place that really was and whether it deserved its name here though here was jungle and no mistake suddenly without warning grayclad pikemen slammed into colonel florizels regiment in this overgrowth where crossbow bolts were much less effective than in open country the southrons with their long spears were a deadly menace avram one of them shouted bearing down on gremio avram and freedom geoffrey gremio yelled in return he chopped at the enemys spearshaft just below the head hoping to cut it off and leave the southron with nothing more than a pole but a clever southron armorer had nailed a strip of iron to the spearshaft to keep a sword from doing any such thing gremio beat the spearshaft aside and kept himself from getting spitted but that was all he could do then recklessly brave sergeant thisbe grabbed the spearshaft gremio rushed at the southron unexpectedly deprived of the use of this weapon he let go of it and ran away are you all right gremio asked thisbe sure am thisbe answered the sergeant reversed the spear then shook his head i wasnt trained on one of these boarstickers if i tried to use it id get myself killed quick you know what to do with it captain gremio shook his head not me back before the war if i wanted to kill a man id use a writ not a spear thats funny thisbe grinned then threw the pike on the ground are we winning or losing probably gremio answered which jerked another grin from the sergeant the company commander went on i wonder how many nasty little fights like this one are happening all over this part of peachtree lots i expect thisbe said the southrons and us were like a couple of blindfolded men groping for each other in a locked room gremio nodded appreciating the figure of speech but he said oh its even worse than that our left leg has bumped the other fellow but our right arm doesnt know it yet he would have gone on with his own figure but another pikeman burst out of the woods just in front of him at close quarters a pike was a demonically nasty weapon just as gremios blade had more reach than a crossbowmans shortsword so the pikeman could thrust at him without being vulnerable in return as he had with the first attacker gremio managed to beat aside the spearhead but he could do no more then thisbe picked up the dropped pike and rushed at the southron when he turned to defend himself against this new assault gremio got inside his guard and slashed his arm to the bone howling and dripping blood the soldier in gray tunic and pantaloons fled thank you kindly gremio said tipping his forage cap to thisbe seems you know what to do with a spear after all sergeant that took ballocks oh i wouldnt say that thisbe answered i would gremio said ill repeat myself in fact ballocks is what that took sergeant thisbe laughed all right sir if thats how you want to put it i dont suppose id better argue with my superior officer gremio shook his head to show that thisbe emphatically ought not to argue with him the sergeant looked around then said i dont see any more southrons not on their feet anyhow maybe weve driven them off by the gods i hope so gremio didnt see any more southrons either he plunged his sword into the soft red dirt several times to scour blood from the blade i hope so but i dont really think so theyre pushing west again and all we can do is try to hold them off as if to prove his point a racket of battle broke out somewhere not too far away gremio and thisbe twisted their heads this way and that trying to decide from which direction it was coming gremio scowled no way to tell whether were going forward or falling back even not in this undergrowth if the southrons turn up behind us weve probably lost somewhere thisbe said yes probably but not necessarily gremio could still split hairs like a barrister and still enjoyed doing it too it could just mean theyd found a track through the bushes that we didnt happen to be guarding youre right thisbe said after a brief pause for thought that wouldnt have occurred to me i dont believe but you sir seems like you think of everything admiration filled his light tenor gremios cheeks heated thanks again sergeant praise from the praiseworthy is praise indeed so people say and i see its true more southrons broke from the woods just then and the soldiers stayed too busy to talk for quite a while rollants hand strayed to the leg of his pantaloons as he sprawled on the ground during a break smitty saw the motion and shook his head dont scratch he said youll be sorry if you scratch im sorry now rollant said from between clenched teeth these godsdamned chiggers are itching me to death ive got em too his comrade said mournfully theyre worse after you scratch i found out the hard way i know it the escaped serf said they have them in palmetto province too i didnt miss em a bit after i came up to new eborac ill tell you that but i itch so much now i dont hardly care what happens later you will smitty said he was right too rollant knew as much in his head he knew as much but his leg still itched and his hands still wanted to scratch and none of that seemed to have very much to do with his head sergeant joram came up if chiggers dared afflict the exalted personage of an underofficer he gave no sign of it get moving you lugs he said we have to keep heading toward the thunderers shrine over there to the west he pointed smitty snickered loud enough for rollant to hear but not loud enough for his mirth to reach jorams ears he said thats south sergeant it is not joram growled but then he looked at the shadows tree branches were casting he coughed a couple of times well it might be a little southwest smitty didnt say anything neither did rollant for a couple of common soldiers silence seemed the better course the two men heaved themselves to their feet harder to scratch if im marching rollant thought what he wanted to do was scratch and scratch till blood ran down his leg maybe then he would feel better crows and vultures rose in flapping clouds from bodies already bloating under the hot northern sun rollant couldnt see whether the corpses wore avrams uniform or geoffreys they were just as dead either way just whats so important about this new bolt shrine smitty grumbled as the men tramped along why arent the traitors welcome to the miserable place crossroads i suppose rollant wrinkled his nose trying without much luck to clear the stench of death from his nostrils sergeant joram shook his head no thats not what it is he said fort worthless now fort worthless is a crossroads we get our hands on that place the northerners will have to go around three sides of a big square to get to any place they need to be but new bolt shrine is differenti hear some runaway serfs told our officers about the place different how sergeant smitty asked rollant was glad his companion had put the question to joram the sergeant wasnt outandout unjust to him very often because he was a blond but joram did talk to an ordinary detinan more readily than he did to an exserf its supposed to be one of those places where the blonds worked their magic back in the old days joram said its an even stronger place for sorcery now that its been reconsecrated to the thunderer of course and our magecraft can use all the help it can get uhhuh smitty nodded all right fair enough that makes pretty good sense sergeant joram gave him a mocking bow thank you so much marshal smitty im sure general hesmucetll be so glad you approve rollant would have fumed under a taunt like that rollant in fact had fumed under a good many taunts like that smitty only bowed back thank you so much sergeant i do want the general to be aware of whats going on joram snorted and went off to bother a couple of other men in the squad nicely done rollant said thank you very much marshal rollant smitty replied grandly he wouldnt be serious not when he had any other choice heading toward a place of old magic made rollant serious he had no idea what the blonds in this part of detina had done in the way of sorcery before the detinans came conquering across the western ocean the lands around karlsburg where hed grown up had been part of one little kingdom this place here another for all he knew his ancestors and the local blonds had fought all the time he was sure joram was right about one thing since new bolt shrine had been reconsecrated to the thunderer the sorcerous focus there would be stronger now than it had been before iron weapons unicorns and more powerful wizardrythose were the keys to the detinans conquest of the blonds theyd tied to the land i wonder if the traitors know what kind of a place this is he said itd be nice if they didnt smitty answered then we could just march right in and take the place away from em im always in favor of getting what i want without having to fight for it especially if the other bastards are likely to fight back right rollant saidhalf agreement half irony but geoffreys menjoseph the gamecocks mendid know what they were defending rollant got a glimpse of the new bolt shrine the thunderers lightning bolt done up in gold over the roof but a glimpse was all he got strong northern forces lay between the southrons and the shrine and they were not inclined to let themselves be dislodged general hesmucet hurled his men at them again and again the southrons ground forward but paid a dreadful price for every yard they advanced rollant hoped the traitors paid even more but knew he couldnt rely on that how can we tell when weve won one of these fights smitty asked we dont shift the bastards more than a couple of furlongs even when we do drive em out of their trenches and when we do push em that far they just find some other little knoll or overgrown patch and dig some more trenches and then theyre ready for us again half the time they dont even need to dig rollant said like as not their officers have already got serfs digging trenches they can just move into its only when the traitors go someplace where there are no trenches that they have to do any digging of their own not far away from them their comrades were busy entrenching and sergeant joram called out come on you lazy lugs you know what to do with a pick and shovel as well as anybody else get busy and do it he had at least included smitty in that lazy tag a lot of detinans reckoned all blonds lazyan irony considering how the nobles in the north piled work on their serfs rollant took his shorthandled shovel out of his pack and made the dirt fly smitty did too but he was slower about it which of them was the lazy one then rollant had his own opinion but who cared what a blond thought two days later colonel nahaths regiment fought its way up to the very outskirts of the sacred precinct of which new bolt shrine formed the heart in the face of stubborn northern resistance their attack stalled there in short order the very reason for the attack became meaningless for stones and firepots from southron siege engines reduced the shrine to smoking rubble that of course did not keep the southrons from attacking the place theyd got their orders before new bolt shrine went up in flames and the mere fact that it went up in flames didnt seem to register with the men who composed and gave those orders they sent the regiment forward again and again joseph the gamecocks men defended wreckage just as stoutheartedly as theyd tried to hold the intact new bolt shrine too at last though a fierce assault cleared them from the precinct rollant strode over tumbled stones and burnt timbers this had better be worth something he said on account of we sure paid a hells of a price for it maybe our wizards could make a godsdamned big magic and give us back some of the poor sons of bitches who died taking it smitty said if they had that kind of magic they could have found another battlefield to use it on rollant said smitty gave him an impatient look i know that you chowderhead what i meant was nothing they do here could be worth it no matter what there do i have to draw you a picture sergeant joram spoke up smitty why dont i draw a picture of you going down and finding a creek and coming back with full canteens for everybody have a heart sergeant smitty moaned joram folded massive arms across a wide chest not only did he have rank on his side he could have torn smitty in two rollant held out his water bottle to smitty cursing the farmers son took it a young fellow with a majors epaulets and a mages badge prominently pinned to his tunic came up and prowled among the ruins as avidly as a hound looking for a buried bone after a bit his eye fell on rollant you there he said yes sir rollant came to attention as you were as you were the mage gestured cant stand that nonsense bunch of foolishnessand go ahead call me a heretic where was i i dont know sir rollant said truthfully i know what it was the young mage said he looked frightfully clever like a child too smart for its own good youd be from around these parts wouldnt you no sir rollant answered no now hed surprised the wizard why not patiently rollant said sir i was born near karlsburg and i spent the last ten years before the war in new eborac city this is the first time ive ever been anywhere near this place not all blonds are the same you know any more than a detinan from new eborac is the same as one from palmetto province oh the sorcerous major said but then he nodded yes of course that does make good sense now that i think on it i was going to ask you if you knew whether these ruins had any particular sorcerous focus youre the wizard sir so youd know better than i would rollant replied people have said theres one somewhere about though otherwise why would we have fought so hard over it because as often as not people are a pack of godsdamned fools the major answered rollants jaw fell the youngster laughed never underestimate that as a possible reason people are a pack of godsdamned fools a lot of the time if the northerners werent godsdamned fools for instance would they have tried to leave detina in the first place before rollant could even try to find an answer for that the mage went on i dont feel any power here to speak of either from the old days or from the thunderer its all just so much moonshine if you want to know what i think rollant hadnt much wanted to know what he thought but a major didnt have to worry about a common soldiers opinion especially if the common soldier was a blond off the mage went leaving rollant behind scratching his head what was all that about smitty asked he was festooned with water bottles now fellow says this new bolt shrine wasnt really any place worth fighting about rollant answered oh he does does he smitty rolled his eyes why am i not surprised and how many lives have we thrown away going after it do you know who that was sergeant joram asked both rollant and smitty shook their heads joram said that was major alva thats who hes supposed to be as hot as any traitor mage ever hatchedhes the fellow who gave us such good sorcerous cover when we went into caesar then he ought to know what hes talking about smitty said that did make sense it also made rollant uncomfortable alva said there was no power lingering where the blonds had had a holy place even after the thunderer also had a shrine made on the same spot shouldnt the gods of either blonds or detinans have left more of an impress on the world than that and if they hadnt what did it mean rollant wondered if he wanted to know off to the north smoke was rising from another battlefield where southrons and traitors clashed rollant wondered if that fight was as meaningless as the one in which hed just taken part how many men were dying for nothing over there its not exactly nothing smitty said when he complained aloud whether we can make special sorcery here or not we still needed to take this place if were going to clear the traitors out of fort worthless rollant grunted thats true i suppose but still keep quiet sergeant joram said if somebody tells us to go forwards we go forwards no ifs ands or buts about it isnt that right yes sergeant rollant said resignedly up on a northern plantation joram would have made a terrific serfdriver if rollant told him that though he might take it for a compliment well then joram said as if hed proved something maybe he hadhed proved he could tell rollant what to do but rollant already knew that sometimes though a sergeant just needed to thump his chest and bellow as if he were a bull pawing the ground in a field rollant couldnt see the sense there but hed seen it was true if this new bolt shrine isnt worth anything what do we do now smitty askedbut quietly so rollant could hear and joram couldnt we go forward rollant answered we keep going forward till the traitors cant stop us any more so far he sounded like a sergeant himself but then he added and we hope some of us are still alive when that finally happens smitty walked off toward the creek for a couple of paces then reluctantly he nodded general hesmucet had trouble deciding whether or not he ought to be a happy man his soldiers had forced their way across calabash creek theyd made joseph the gamecock pull out of whole mackerel theyd cleared his men from new bolt shrine and fort worthless theyd done a lot of hard fighting in some of the most miserable terrain anywhere in detina theyd been victorious almost everywhereand what did they have to show for it less than id like gods damn it hesmucet thought no matter how harried joseph the gamecocks forces had been his army remained in being and remained between hesmucet and marthasville joseph was doing his job hesmucet peered west from the swampy wilderness hed just spent a few weeks overrunning joseph the gamecock as usual had more entrenchments waiting for him some on a little knob called cedar hill others farther west on a heavily wooded slope identified on his map as commissioner mountain it didnt look like much of a mountain to him but the traitors had some perfectly good artificers who would have studied out the ground and turned it into much more than a molehill rain started falling it had been raining for most of the month hesmucet was sick of it rain worked for joseph the gamecock and against him it slowed down his advance yes it slowed the defenders too but they didnt care they werent trying to go anywhere themselves only to keep him from getting anywhere they had a good chance of doing it too major alva he called where in the damnation has major alva gone and got himself off to here i am sir in a mages best style alva seemed to appear out of nowhere hesmucet was less impressed than he might have been in the rain he couldnt see very far anyway he came straight to the point can you make the sun come out again and dry up some of this mud sorry sir but i dont think so major alva replied why not hesmucet said irritably last fall you were able to keep things foggy and misty down around rising rock and that served us well yes sir but it would have been pretty foggy and misty regardless of what i did the bright young mage said here i would be changing things and changing them a lot because its usually pretty rainy here this time of year its a lot easier to ride the unicorn in the direction hes already going if you know what i mean hesmucet snarledwetly he did see what major alva meant but seeing it wasnt the same as liking it all right then he said what can we do to make the traitors lives miserable everyones life has been miserable lately seems to me alva observed that held more truth than hesmucet cared to admit the idea is to make the enemys lives miserable he said that and to keep him from doing it to us yes sir major alva agreed i have to tell you though sir fooling with the weather will not get you what you want this time of year in this part of the kingdom it is going to rain and any wizard who tells you anything different is either lying on purpose or else a godsdamned fool all right hesmucet said one reason he was glad to have alva around was that the mage wasnt shy about telling him what was on his mind eventually he supposed alva would learn tact but it wouldnt happen soon if you cant dry things out see if you can come up with some other way to make joseph the gamecock sorry were in the neighborhood yes sir alva saluted and went away hesmucet started to duck back into his tent before he could a scryer called his name he turned what is it theres a report from luxor sir on the great river the scryer replied sam the sturgeon has met ned of the forest in a battle ill come hesmucet said at once and hurried to the scryers tent the face looking out of the crystal ball at him belonged to brigadier andrew the smith not to brigadier sam whod got his nickname from a pair of protruding eyes and a long long nose if sam the sturgeon wasnt there to tell the tale in person hesmucet judged the news unlikely to be good and sure enough the commander of the garrison at luxor said things didnt work out as you hoped they would sir youd better tell me hesmucet said yes sir andrew the smith was a solid officer brigadier sam set out moving west through the southern part of great river province sir and he let his unicornriders get out in front of his footsoldiers ned of the forest hit him near a little place called three dee crossroads and defeated him in detailsmashed his army to hells and gone if you want to know the truth gods damn it hesmucet burst out sam the sturgeon must have had three times as many men as ned yes sir brigadier andrew said again but he didnt get em into the fight and ned did whats left of sams armyand its only bits and piecesjust came stumbling back into luxor this morning he was afraid ned was hot on his heels too to the hells with what he was afraid of hesmucet growled i sent him out to keep ned too busy to strike our supply line fat lot of good sam does holed up in luxor ned can collect men at his leisure and strike the glideway path whenever he pleases im afraid youre right sir andrew said mournfully that man ned is a demon hesmucet said there cant be peace by the great river till ned of the forest is dead as may be sir the commandant at luxor replied but the son of a bitch is still here now and in a position to make a lot of trouble we have to keep him too busy to hit the supply line hesmucet said if sam the sturgeon couldnt do the job someone else will have to right this minute brigadier looks like that someone else is you yes sir andrew the smith saidhe didnt shrink from the idea which made hesmucet happy ill do my best sir ned will probably think he could take on anybody this side of the gods right about now and that may make him careless but whether it does or whether it doesnt youre rightwe have to keep him away from your glideway line good man hesmucet told him if we had more like you wed be in better shape thank you kindly sir brigadier andrew replied what we could really use is a couple of officers like ned of the forest few southrons would have said that it was truehesmucet felt down in his belly how true it wasbut few would have had the nerve to say it when the gods made ned they shattered the mold afterwards hesmucet said which unfortunately also seemed to be true im glad we have you on our side brigadier i know youll give the son of a bitch all he wants and then some more besides i told you once ill do my best i meant it andrew said good hesmucet turned and nodded to his scryer the man broke the mystical attunement between the two crystal balls the one in front of hesmucet became no more than an inert sphere of glass andrew the smiths image vanished from it hesmucet gave himself the luxury of cursing for a minute or so but then got up to leave the scryers tent what will you do now sir the scryer asked him it wasnt really any of the mans business still hesmucet judged him unlikely to go over to the traitors with the answer he probably wouldnt even gossip by the nature of their work scryers had to be discreet and the truth wasnt all that complicated anyhow im going to keep right on hammering away at joseph the gamecock thats what hesmucet said as long as andrew or somebody keeps ned of the forest busy joseph hasnt got enough unicornriders attached to his own army to harm the glideway coming up here from rising rock especially when i keep squeezing and prodding his army so thats what im going to do you hit something long enough and hard enough and sooner or later itll break all right sir that sounds like it makes sense the scryer was a lieutenant by courtesy as most mages were officers by courtesy having officers rank let him order common soldiers around which was often convenient what he knew about sound strategy however would likely have fit inside a thimble without straining things but he was a freeborn detinan and reckoned his opinion as good as anyone elses including that of the general commanding im so glad you approve hesmucet intended it for sarcasm the scryer took it as a compliment he beamed at hesmucet as the commanding general left the tent once back in his own pavilion hesmucet summoned doubting george fighting joseph and james the birds eye he told his wing commanders what had happened to the luckless sam the sturgeon he had ned outnumbered three to one and he lost the fornicating battle fighting joseph burst out his always ruddy face darkening further with anger thats disgraceful nothing else but it certainly is and who would know better doubting george murmured a considerable silence followed at viziersville in the west fighting josephs men had outnumbered those of duke edward of arlington somewhere close to three to one but duke edwards army of southern parthenia had won a resounding victory over the southrons nonetheless fighting joseph turned red all over again this time perhaps from embarrassmentalthough from all hesmucet had seen he seemed nearly immune to that emotion at last james the birds eye broke the silence with a sensible question what do we do now sir hesmucet gave him the same sort of answer hed given the scryer well try to keep ned busy over by the great river and well keep josephs unicornriders close to home so they cant go after the glideway james gravely considered that in due course he nodded makes sense to me sir he said weve come a long way doing what weve been doing if we keep doing it and hit hard we ought to end up in marthasville before too long wed better lieutenant general george said there are grumblings down south about how long this fight is taking and how many men were spending to make it i have friends who send me the news bulletins im sure the rest of you have friends like that too what im not so sure of is whether theyre really friends bloodsucking ghouls is what they are fighting joseph said they havent the ballocks to fight themselves and so they pass their time by making the men who do fight doubt themselves its more complicated than that i fear doubting george said fighting joseph by his expression plainly didnt believe it for a moment hesmucet did he knew how weary the south was of the war against false king geoffrey and of its cost in both silver and blood victory would make that cost seem worthwhile as long as the north held marthasville as long as joseph the gamecocks army remained intact and in the field the south saw no victory if the farmers and burghers got sick of sending their sons and husbands and brothers off to die for what they saw as no good purpose king avram would have to recognize his rebellious cousin as his fellow sovereign hesmucet aimed to do everything he could to keep that from happening lets take a crack at cedar hill then he said once we drive the traitors away from it well be in position to move against commissioner mountain good enough james the birds eye said now fighting joseph agreed without hesitation whatever else you could say about the man he wasnt shy about going into a fight the only one showing any doubts was george it had better be good enough he said well just have to do our best to make it good enough when morning came hesmucet assembled his force and moved it west he expected joseph the gamecocks men to have solid entrenchments on the forward slopes of cedar hill and so they did in spite of a pounding from his siege engines their lines held firm both sides got less use not only from engines but also from crossbows than they would have in better weather an awful lot of bowstrings were wet hesmucets men slogged on cleaning out one trench after another toward midday hesmucet glanced up to one of the higher crags of cedar hill there looking down at himthere looking down at his whole hoststood half a dozen northern officers in blue they observed the men moving against them with the detachment of so many instructors at the military collegium at annasville rage ripped through hesmucet unlike those cool detached traitors he took war personally he spotted brigadier brannan doubting georges commander of siege engines whod just wrestled some of his catapults forward brannan he called and pointed up toward the knot of northerners can you smash a couple of those bastards for me brigadier brannan studied the enemy officers a long shot especially uphill he said but ive got a chance want me to try yes by the thunderers balls hesmucet exclaimed all right brannan called orders to his crew they tightened the skeins and set a thirtypound stone in the trough brannan himself squeezed the trigger the catapult bucked and jerked and clacked away flew the round stone almost faster than the eye could follow it look out joseph the gamecock shouted as the southrons catapult sent a stone flying toward the knot of officers he headed spry for a man of his years he wasted not a heartbeat taking his own advice he dove behind a boulder someone else dove on top of him other northerners scattered in all directions joseph listened for the thud of the stone slamming into muddy dirt even skipping along the ground it could be deadly dangerous hed heard of a foolish sergeant whod tried to stop a rolling catapult ball with his footand lost the foot as a result the stone smacked down alarmingly close to joseph the gamecock but the sound it made wasnt the heavy thud of rock hitting mud it was a wetter noise a solid smack that made the general commanding the army of franklin wince and curse the southrons had aimed that stone too well someone in his retinue had gone down under it let me up gods damn it joseph growled to whoever had landed on him when the officer didnt move fast enough to suit him joseph lashed out with an elbow that did the trick scrambling to his feet joseph looked around there stood roastbeef william and there were a couple of junior officers also upright and unscathed but leonidas the priest sprawled on the ground and plainly would never get up again he still twitched but that was only because his body hadnt yet realized he was dead when a thirtypound flying stone hit a man square in the chest he was unlikely to get up again blood soaked into the red dirt reddening it further leonidas blood was even redder than the crimson vestments he wore his twitching stopped joseph peered down toward the southrons and their engine wondering if they were going to send another stone his way but they seemed satisfied to have scattered his companions and him he wondered if they knew theyd hit anyone by the gods roastbeef william said staring at the smashed corpse of his fellow wing commander yes by the gods joseph the gamecock agreed the lion god will have himself a new servant up there on the mountain beyond the sky and may leonidas serve his favorite god better than he ever served king geoffrey and me another officer said i think sir we can withdraw from this spot without fear of dishonor joseph hadnt thought about that but he recognized truth when he heard it yes wed better he agreed or else they may decide to send us another present somebody grab poor leonidas legs and haul him off he deserves to go on a proper pyre they retreated farther up cedar hill the southrons down below seemed satisfied with the results of their one shot leonidas the priests body left a trail of blood as junior officers dragged him along joseph the gamecock never stopped being amazed at how much blood a mans body held what do we do now sir roastbeef william asked we do what we have to do lieutenant general joseph answered we appoint a new wing commander and we go on leonidas was a brave and pious man but we have to go on without him leonidas had also been an idiot who didnt like taking orders but joseph the gamecock didnt dwell on that not aloud when a man died you looked for the good hed had in him if with the hierophant of the lion god you had to look a bit harder than you might with someone else stop that joseph the gamecock told himself the southrons kept pounding away at cedar hill roastbeef william said im afraid were going to have to fall back to commissioner mountain sir im afraid youre right joseph said if general hesmucet cares to launch a frontal attack against us there hes welcome to try it for all of me you dont want to make things too easy for him though roastbeef william protested oh no joseph agreed i dont intend to do anything of the sort but this position can be turned id like to see hesmucet try to turn our lines along commissioner mountain and snouts stream even as he spoke rain began to fall he smiled to him right now rain was a friend id especially like to see hesmucet try one of his outflanking moves in this muck his surviving wing commander nodded if he did wed be on his flank like a tiger on an ox william had missed a point the rain hindered josephs movements no less than those of the southrons but even joseph the gamecock who picked nits as naturally as he breathed didnt correct him he didnt need to attack he needed nothing more than to hold on and to hold hesmucet out of marthasville as long as he succeeded in doing that he was living up to the responsibility with which king geoffrey had entrusted him not that geoffrey will thank me for it he thought geoffrey never thanks me for anything nothats not true hed thank me if i dried up and blew away but he was desperate enough to put me here and now he has to make the best of it he knew geoffrey wasnt happy that hed had to yield so much of southern peachtree province on the other hand duke edward of arlington and the army of southern parthenia had yielded just about all of southern parthenia to marshal bart bart was a lot closer to nonesuchand to king geoffreythan hesmucet was to marthasville to whom will you give command of leonidas wing roastbeef william asked there was a question to make even a moody man like joseph the gamecock stop brooding but for piety and courage leonidas the priest had been singularly even plurally lacking in the military virtues if his wing acquired a commanding officer who knew what he was doing joseph didnt smile that would have been disrespectful to the dead especially with leonidas still unburned and with his spirit therefore still free and vengeful whether he smiled or not though he was far from brokenhearted i think i shall appoint brigadier alexandernot james of broadpaths engines chief whos back in parthenia now but the man they call the steward he said hes a solid fellow old straight i should say so william nodded vigorous approval solid as the day is long brave industrious knows what hes doing it will make a pleasant change wont it joseph said that was unkind to the memory of the hierophant of the lion god but not too much so william added im sure lieutenant general bell will also think well of the choice its not his to make its not his to approve of joseph said testily day by day he grew less happy with bell the man carped and complained about everything yet was reluctant to strike when ordered to do so it must be the pain joseph thought hes only a shell of the man he used to be too bad because i could use that man the one i have as the officers came back up cedar hill joseph told off some ordinary soldiers he saw to take charge of leonidas body then he and his comrades went off to his headquarters he sent a runner to summon alexander the steward and another to give bell word of leonidas the priests untimely demise with a little luck the new wing commander would prove less recalcitrant than leonidas had been he could hardly prove more recalcitrant joseph thought the runner hed sent to bell returned the lieutenant generals compliments sir the fellow said and he asks if having a new wing commander means were more likely to advance against the enemy we would be more likely to advance against the enemy joseph the gamecock said icily if lieutenant general bell were in the habit of following orders uh shall i take that message back to him sir the runner asked no never mind joseph said he either knows it already or is unlikely to believe it from my lips before long another man approached him not a soldier this time but a fellow in maroon velvet tunic and pantaloons of civilian cut who wore on his head a hat that put joseph the gamecock in mind of an inverted chamber pot bowing the newcomer said your grace i have the honor to represent duke brown who is of course king geoffreys satrap for peachtree province of course joseph replied his opinion of the provincial satrap was indeed brown he gave the duke far higher marks for mouth than for brains wondering what had caused brown to send out this chap he inquired and what does his grace think i can do for him his tone suggested that whatever it might be duke brown was undoubtedly laboring under a delusion the man with the maroon pantaloons and ugly hat gave no sign of noticing that tone he said the satrap sent me here to remonstrate with you to remonstrate with me why joseph asked what have i done to him what have i done to set off the godsdamned fool now sir he feels he must protest your excessive utilization of the provinces glideway carpets duke browns man replied your constant traffic in this part of the province is having a most deleterious effect on civilian travel in peachtree province you are joking joseph the gamecock said by no means your grace the study in maroon said the satrap has received numerous complaints from nobles and commoners alike as to the adverse impact on their travel requirements the continued requisitioning of carpets for your forces has caused and feels he must respond to the citizenry i see joseph said the civilian beamed i knew you would be reasonable sir ah what is that you are writing a pass to take you through my lines so you can bring duke browns complaints directly to general hesmucet since he is the true cause of my excessive use of the glideways he is the one who should hear about the satraps concerns he has the name of a reasonable man i am sure when he hears he is bothering civilians he will turn around and march back down to the south you mock me sir duke browns man said indignantly you mock my principal as well this shall not go unnoticed and i shall not lose a moments sleep over it joseph the gamecock said i have some small hope of coping with the enemy but when the idiots alleged to be on my own side commence to move against me i find myself helpless to resist them how dare you use such a word sir the civilian said how dare you i dare because i am a soldier and it is my duty to dare joseph replied that is more than the satrap can say you will go too far if you have not already the man in maroon said biting the words off between his teeth and speaking of soldiers i will have you know that count thraxton has come to marthasville and is examining your conduct of this campaign very closelyvery closely indeed by all the gods im delighted to hear thatjust delighted joseph said thraxton the braggarts the reason the army of franklin was in the fix i found it inand now king geoffrey sends him up here to sit in judgment on me not a chance hell be prejudiced is there not half your grace i dont know what you want me to say the man in maroon sounded worriednot out of any concern for me joseph judged but because he fears hell end up in trouble with the satrap well too fornicating bad for him go tell duke brown that i am going to use the glideways as much as i need to so i can defend his province for him whether he wants me to or not joseph the gamecock snapped and if by any chance you should happen to see the ever so illustrious count thraxton thank him for me for the lovely predicament he left me in and now he looks over my campaign gods protect me from my friends had the fellow in maroon velvet lingered another moment joseph would have sped him on his way with a good solid kick in the fundament he might have realized that for he withdrew precipitately even without the added impetus of the commanding generals boot josephs stomach twinged hearing thraxton the braggart is around makes me as dyspeptic as he is thraxton had brains he also had a complete inability to get along with anyone else a trait joseph shared or to make anyone follow his lead which was not one of josephs difficulties the only exception to the general rule was that thraxton had somehow formed an intimate friendship with king geoffrey a friendship that endured through thick and thinand given thraxtons other talents or lack of same thered been much more thin than thick he has geoffreys ear he will drip poison into it joseph was as sure of that as he was of tomorrows sunrise he shrugged he couldnt do anything about it all he could do was hold the line of commissioner mountain and snouts stream as long as possible the more southrons who died trying to pry him out of his position the better the chance that the south would sicken of the war and make king avram quit it or face upheaval at home lieutenant general bell would attack the general commanding the army of franklin thought he tossed his head like a man bothered by gnats duke edward of arlington when angry would twist so he seemed to be trying to bite his own ear josephs gesture wasnt far removed from that bell would do any number of stupid things if only he had the chance my job not least is to make sure he doesnt get it count joseph sighed but how am i supposed to manage that he saw no clear answer hed seen few clear answers since the days when the northern provinces first broke away from detina he kept fighting nonetheless v once again your majesty our forces have been orderedto make an inglorious retreat lieutenant general bell wrote in yet another of his secret letters to king geoffrey once again we have taken heavy losses trying to hold a position that could not be held this time including that heroic and pious soldier leonidas the priest once again the spirits of the men suffer because they always fall back and are never permitted to advance against the foe how long your majesty can this go on bell examined that wondering if it was too strong he decided to leave it in the king needed to know what was going on up here if i dont tell him the truth who will bell thought commissioner mountain he muttered under his breath who would have imagined general hesmucet could have pushed the army of franklin back so far so fast who would have imagined joseph the gamecock would fall back so far so fast bell thought that was what it came down to disgraceful bell said again quietly he wished he could shout reaching for the bottle of laudanum he always carried he yanked out the cork and drank then he sat in his folding chair and waited for relief he needed ever larger draughts to get it and got less no matter how much he took if he looked back over his shoulder he could practically see marthasville camp rumor said count thraxton had come there to take a long look at the way joseph the gamecock was fighting the southrons bell didnt like the rumor he was the one who was supposed to be informing king geoffrey of how things were going he had no great use for thraxton the braggart the man had made a hash of the fighting by rising rock bell had been flat on his back then still recovering from the amputation of his leg he remembered the jouncing agony hed gone through in the retreat from proselytizers rise up into peachtree province thraxton had botched the battle no two ways about it but thraxton was also geoffreys friend if the king decided to remove joseph from his command would he give that command back to thraxton bell shook his leonine head that would be madness he rumbled every man jack and every officer in this army knows of thraxtons blunders the command should go elsewhere he knew exactly where the command should go hed left hints in his letters to king geoffrey maybe i should stop hinting and come right out and speak my mind he thought after all the safety of the kingdom depends on it voices outside his pavilionvoices and then one of his sentries stuck his head inside and said sir general joseph is here to see you joseph here to see me even with the gentle cloud of laudanum between himself and the world lieutenant general bell knew his superior must not spy the letter to king geoffrey he swept it out of sight beneath some other papers then nodded i am always pleased to see him that was a lie of course but a politic lie when joseph the gamecock ducked his way through the tent flap he looked more pleased with himself and with the world as a whole than was his wont let the southrons come he said yes by the gods let them come theyll bloody their noses on our line and they cant outflank it you have said this before your grace bell replied you have also proved mistaken before not this time joseph said as long as the rains keep coming general hesmucet will have a devils of a time moving men and supplies for them and weve got solid sets of entrenchments running twenty miles north up snouts stream i dont think they can do it and when shall we attack them bell inquired joseph the gamecock gave him a sour look i am in no hurry to make such an effortand if you will recall the last time i tried to persuade you to send your whole wing forward you broke out in a case of jimjams the enemy had engines on our flank to advance would have been to give him a perfect chance to massacre us bell insisted you are the only one who ever saw those enginesand that includes the southrons joseph said i was there you were not had you been there you would have seen them too but you do not seem to consider your place to be at the fore theyd called each other cowards now they both glared in perfect mutual loathing joseph the gamecock said i have been glad to discover you will at least fight on the defensive sir i find your manner offensive bell replied i had hoped to find yours offensive but no such luck joseph said still so long as we fight hard here the southrons will get no closer to marthasville and that is the point of the exercise that may be one point of the exercise sir but its not the only point bell said the other thing we have to do is drive the southrons from our land drive them back where they belongand send them off with their tails between their legs so theyll know better than to trouble us again good luck if you should ever be in the position to try lieutenant general joseph the gamecock said i dont think it can be done now not with things as they are if some miracleworker were to appear with crossbows that would shoot twice as far and ten times as fast as the usual weapons we might whip king avrams men back to their kennel but what are the odds of that without it we have to try to make the foe sicken of the war thats my view at any rate i know sir bell said sourly you never tire of stating it thats becausealthough you may find it hard to believei have officers who dont want to hear it joseph the gamecock replied im certain you of all people find that incredible heh bell said unwilling to show joseph he had the slightest idea what the general commanding was talking about now you are holding an important part of this line lieutenant general joseph told him i expect you to do just that to hold i mean if a breakthrough occurs on the stretch of line where you command you will find that i do not take the matter lightly you have already failed more often than you should shall i comment further or do i make myself plain libelously so sir bell said joseph the gamecock clicked his tongue between his teeth libel must be committed to writing as anyone of your temperament should have learned by now slander is oral and you must always remember that proof of truth is the best defense against either good day lieutenant general he left bells pavilion seeming even more pleased with himself than he had been when he came in bell muttered something decidedly slanderous by josephs standards hed done a good deal of libeling too he cared not a fig for josephs standards the only ones that mattered to him were his own taking the letter hed been working on from its place of concealment he finished it sealed it and sent it off to nonesuch in the same clandestine way as hed despatched the others sooner or later king geoffrey will have to listen he thought gods grant it wont be too late he wished he were in command of the army of franklin he would get it moving south again how could geoffrey hope to establish a kingdom when the southrons sat on half the land he claimed the army of franklin hadnt seen the province of franklin for months if i were in charge id head straight for ramblerton and set the province free for now though bell had to fight under another mans orders and joseph had warned him he was being watched bell didnt think king geoffrey would acquiesce in his dismissal but didnt care to take the chance especially not with thraxton the braggart close at hand nothing unfortunate would or could happen while thraxton was on watch grudgingly bell admitted to himself that for a defensive position the one anchored by commissioner mountain and snouts stream was solid the southrons would have a hells of a time breaking through it but joseph had already abandoned other strong defensive positions bell didnt dwell on the fact that he and poor leonidas had talked joseph into abandoning the one by fat mama he seldom dwelt on the past unless it was to his advantage after another gulp of laudanum bell seized his crutches and levered himself to his foot even with the drug working a crutch under his left arm hurt like broken glass like fire like knives the healers swore the festering in his stump had burned itself out but he could still feel that not everything was right in there he doubted it ever would be for that matter he could still feel his whole right leg though the part of it he still owned stopped not much farther down than his prong hung sometimes it was just there as real as flesh till he tried to put weight on it sometimes the part that was missing hurt even worse than the part that remained those were the bad times for even laudanum had trouble dulling the phantom pain the healers said there was no cure for that but time hed even asked the mages if there were any spells to exorcise the ghosts of absent body parts to his disappointment theyd told him no not enough onelegged wizards he thought as he made his slow way out of the pavilion if a few more sorcerers had lost limbs they would have made sure there were better measures against these phantoms but no such luck he had to endure i am a soldier he said as if someone had doubted it enduring was part of what soldiers did he hadnt expected it to be the most important part of what he did life was full of surprises some pleasant some emphatically otherwise even getting out through the tent flap wasnt so easy as it might have been ducking didnt involve just the head it involved the whole body and when the whole body was supported on one foot and on two crutches that wouldnt bend no matter what bell counted each separate escape from the tent as a minor victory getting out in the fresh air did little to refresh him it was as hot and muggy outside as it had been within gray clouds came rolling in from off the western oceanmore rain on the way he took advantage of the lull to peer east toward the southrons encampments hesmucet was an aggressive commander he pushed his men up as close to their foes as they could get it felt as if he were about to order an allout assault along the whole line lieutenant general bell nodded in grave approval if i commanded the army offranklin thats how i would lead it like a fighting man like a tiger ready to spring go straight at the enemy and knock him down of course if general hesmucet came straight at commissioner mountain he might accomplish nothing more than to knock himself down would he realize that bell didnt know his own instinct was always to test to probe to attack after all the foe might give way sir someone said at his elbow he turned his head the only part of him that would turn readily there stood major zibeon his aidedecamp asked what did joseph the gamecock want sir nothing of any consequence major bell answered he warned me to stay alert against any possible attack from the southrons theyd be fools if they tried it zibeon said he had a hard face when he smiled the smile was hard too hard and predatory heres hoping theyre fools yes heres hoping bell said and wondered if he meant it if the southrons did assail commissioner mountain he couldnt see them succeeding either did he want joseph the gamecock winning a victory for the kingdoms sake he supposed he did for his own even if joseph wins here having him lead the army offranklin cant be good for the kingdom bell thought this army would be much better off with a soldier whos not afraid to use if for some real fightinga soldier like well like me for instance major zibeon said i believe sir weve got about as fine a defensive position here as ive ever seen gods damn me to the hells if i can see how the southrons will be able to go through us or around us that was about the last thing lieutenant general bell wanted to hear he looked down his long thin nose at the aidedecamp really major he said do you think commissioner mountain is as sure to hold as proselytizers rise was zibeon started to answer him then turned red proselytizers rise of course had fallen to the southrons if it hadnt fallen general hesmucets army wouldnt have been able to move so deeply into peachtree province everyone had declared the northern position there was impregnable bell couldnt say anything about that from firsthand knowledge not when the healers had had him in their grip then at last zibeon said it wasnt the position that went awry there sir it was the sorcery and whos to say something wont go wrong here as well bell returned my view is you cannot rely on a position to save you you have to rely on the soldiers manning the position yes sir his aidedecamp said and arent our northern men the bravest in the world they were bell replied they were before they spent weeks scurrying from one set of entrenchments to the next never daring to face the enemy out in the open now major who knows zibeon pondered that then shrugged i havent convinced him bell thought but hed convinced himself that was all that really mattered rollant looked at the traitors field works on commissioner mountain with all the enthusiasm of a man with a toothache looking at a trip to the puller are they really going to send us up there he asked why not smitty said blithely we took proselytizers rise so they must think we can do anything theyd both been part of the mad climb to the top of proselytizers rise theyd been part of a smashing victory there for the life of him rollant couldnt figure out how theyd done it he had trouble seeing how they could hope to do it again too remember when all the northerners in the world came at us near the river of death while we were up on merkles hill he said we threw em back and we didnt have anything like what the traitors have waiting for us sergeant joram said that will be enough of that if were ordered to advance we will advance and thats all there is to it youve got no business trying to demoralize smitty here dont worry about it sergeant smitty said i didnt have any morals to speak of before rollant started talking at me if i want your foolishness be sure ill ask for it joram said he made a good sergeant he growled as nastily at detinans as he did at blonds and if his superiors gave an order he would see that everybody he led obeyed iteven if it does get every last one of us killed rollant thought he asked sergeant are we going to try and drive them off those hills i dont know joram said irritably nobodys given me any special orders yet thats all i can tell you and i dont think lieutenant griff knows anything either gods damn it smitty not one single solitary fornicating word i didnt say anything sergeant smitty protested he looked as innocent as a heavenly messenger if rollant hadnt been marching beside him for a couple of years the pose might have convinced him as things were he let out a snicker that almost turned into a guffaw but all the guffawing stopped not long afterwards when colonel nahath assembled the regiment and said men we are going to go up against commissioner mountain tomorrow morningnot just us mind you but most of doubting georges army were going to go up against it and were going to take it lion gods claws somebody shouted has hesmucet lost his whole mind had a serf in palmetto province yelled anything like that about a detinanany detinan not just a generalhe would have been sorry as long as he lived which probably wouldnt have been long rollant had escaped from serfdom a long time before but what detinans reckoned liberty still looked like license to him a lot of the time the regimental commander didnt even get upset he just shook his head and said no the idea is joseph the gamecock has to think this stretch of the line is too strong to be taken he wont have that many men covering it and because he wont well swarm up the side of the mountain and godsdamned well take it away from him maybe we will smitty said out of the side of his mouth maybe a lot of usll come down the mountain on our backs too that also struck rollant as pretty likely he had no say in such things though all he could do was fight hard and hope the men set over him didnt make too many idiotic mistakes so far at least general hesmucet hadnt but if he did rollant couldnt even retreat till all his comrades were falling back too he wasnt just fighting as himself he was fighting as a blond before ordinary detinans and couldnt afford to look like a coward he didnt sleep much that evening hed had too long a look at the position doubting georges army would assail when the sun came up he knew he would much sooner have defended that position but he was going to have to attack it and could only trust in the gods that things wouldnt prove so bad as they seemed when the regiment assembled the next morning smitty handed him a scrap of paper pin this on my back will you other pairs of men were going through the same ritual rollant grimaced you think itll be that bad he asked dont know smitty answered but this way if i fall up there my name and where i livell be on my body my folks can find out what happened to me and make the offerings to take me on to the next world if i get real lucky they may even ship my carcass home so my old man can light the pyre thats the kind of luck i could do without rollant said but then after a moments thought he added have you got any more paper sure do smitty said before long rollant had his name and street pinned to the back of his gray tunic too have faith men lieutenant griff said have faith and victory will be ours his voice broke a couple of times but he was very young he had some paper pinned to his uniform too how much faith has he got rollant wondered every catapult under doubting georges command started bucking and hurling then stones and firepots rained down on the traitors field works repeating crossbows sent streams of darts at the northerners making them keep their heads down horns blared all along the southrons line forward griff shouted brandishing his sword he went forward himself he mighthe didsometimes lack for sense but hed shown plenty of courage since taking over the company for captain cephas forward sergeant joram echoed rollant wondered if the underofficer had the brains to be afraid he did himself and he was up the slopes of commissioner mountain ran the men from the wing lieutenant general george commanded rollant shouted king avram and freedom as he had in every fight the words still rang true whether they could help him win a victory here was another question in spite of the battering the southron engines had given their trenches the traitors were still full of fight heads appeared in the entrenchments soldiers in blue started shooting at the advancing southrons the northerners had catapults of their own on commissioner mountain they started tearing holes in the southrons ranks had doubting george really believed the enemy wouldnt have enough men to defend this part of their line if he had he should have done a little more doubting we arent going to make it rollant said to smitty as they drew within a hundred yards of the traitors works men were going down as if scythed if hesmucet felt like feeding his whole army into this sausage machine joseph the gamecockss defenders might kill every man in it smitty didnt argue with him which convinced him he was rightsmitty always thought the regiment could do more than it really could all the farmers son said now was well weve got to keep trying a little longer echoing that lieutenant griff shouted forward again he was brave rollant suspected he was a little bit crazy too to push the advance here a few feet away the company standardbearer took a crossbow quarrel in the chest he stood there swaying for a moment then crumpled to the ground the banner gold dragon on red fell too rollant grabbed the staff before the silk of the flag could touch the ground and be deviled if that wasnt madness and not a little of it he couldnt imagine what was standardbearers were always targets a standardbearer charging straight at massed crossbows a blond standardbearer charging straight at massed crossbows its a good thing ive got my name on the back of my uniform he thought but he went forward even so holding the company banner high and he shouted a new war cry one to which hed never before felt entitled detina if he couldnt shout the kingdoms name while carrying its flag when could he crossbow bolts hissed past him some so close he could feel the breeze of their passage on his cheeks but he wasnt afraid he didnt know why but he wasnt he felt exaltednot as if they couldnt hurt him but as if it wouldnt matter if they did and if that wasnt madness he couldnt imagine what would be that mood of glorious indifference lasted till he came within perhaps twenty yards of the enemys entrenchments what broke it wasnt a bolt tearing into his flesh but rather a hand tugging on his arm and a desperate voice crying back rollant were falling back rollant looked around like a man awakening from a fever sure enough the southrons had done everything flesh and blood could do they were streaming east down the forward slope of commissioner mountain bringing their wounded with them leaving their dead behind come on smitty said urgently theyll kill both of us if you wait around here exaltation drained out of rollant like wine from a cracked cup the dregs left behind were exhaustion and terror he turned away from the enemys trenches and stumbled back toward the encampments from which theyd set out the only thing he remembered to do was hold up the flag by some accident or miracle no quarrels pierced him or smitty before they got out of range but when rollant reached up to tug at his hat he discovered one hole through the brim and one through the crown that hadnt been there before if i were a couple of inches taller he didnt want to finish that thought they arent chasing us he remarked when he and smitty had got back among their fellows why should they chase us smitty answered theyve whipped us all they want to do is hold us back and we sure arent going forward now that was a selfevident truth gods i could use something wet rollant said he noticed the banner he was carrying had several new holes in it too none in me though he thought some god or another was watching out none in me sergeant joram handed rollant a flask he took a big swig thinking it held water and almost choked to death on a mouthful of potent spirits the stuff seared its way down to his belly as he wheezed joram set a hand on his shoulder something the sergeant had never done before you did good joram said with a shrug rollant answered i hardly even knew what i was doing youve always fought well enough joram said but up there on the mountain up there you fought likelike a detinan plainly he knew no higher praise rollant wasnt delighted with the way hed put the praise he gave but didnt care to quarrel about it thanks he said and took another smaller swig from the flask this time he was ready for the flames in his throat lieutenant griff came up to him will you carry the standard again he asked a standardbearer shouldnt be a common soldier rollant answered will you make me a corporal he waited for griff to get angry but the company commander only nodded thats business he said doing business is detinan too ill go to colonel nahath with it bargain if rollant werent a blond griff would have promoted him on the spot he was sure of that but few blonds ever got any chance at all for promotion he nodded and saluted yes sir bargain lieutenant general george looked at the reports his brigade commanders had brought him turning to his adjutant he shook his head and said we lost a godsawful lot of men up there and what did it get us not bloody much bloody is the word sir colonel andy agreed close to three thousand soldiers with holes in them and we didnt hurt the traitors nearly as much thats the rub gods damn it doubting george said we can afford more losses than they can because our armys twice the size of theirs but we cant afford a lot more losses than theirs not if we dont shift em an inch and we didnt i know sir andy said how could you help knowing george thought were still where we were when we tried to takecommissionermountain not somewhere on the other side of it if wed taken it joseph would have had to retreat again and the northerners would have lost the plain behind it and hiltonia andephesus to boot colonel andy went on but general hesmucet thought it was worth a try there was no answer to that none that would have kept george properly subordinate he shifted his ground instead since it didnt work we have to figure out what to do next the rains stopped andy said thats something and so it was moving men and catapults and victuals when the roads turned into mudbottomed creeks was just this side of impossible doubting george knew that was another reason hesmucet had struck here hed already had men and supplies in place but unfortunately so had joseph the gamecock what can we do doubting george wasnt really asking his adjutant he was thinking aloud did i hear rightly that we got a foothold on the western bank of snouts stream i believe so sir andy answered well have to hang on to that george said well have to hang on to that for dear life as a matter of fact if we can do with it then the attack on commissioner mountain may turn out to have been worth something after all heres hoping colonel andy didnt sound as if he believed it george set a hand on his shoulder dont fret yourself colonel he advised youve got to remember things could be worse id much rather be here than down on merkles hill with all the traitors in the world roaring for our blood that wasnt so very long ago you know he laughed whats funny sir his adjutant asked nothing not really lieutenant general george answered andy sent him a wounded look but he didnt explain he didnt think anyone else would find it funny anyhow how could he tell andy hed managed to talk himself out of his own doubts the sun beat down on him he took off his hat and fanned himself with it doing his best to fight the muggy summer heat of peachtree province hed always thought parthenia had vile summer weatherand as a matter of fact it did but peachtree province was worse what there was of the breeze came out of the west when george inhaled he wrinkled his nose he knew what that stench came from unburned southron bodies still lying in front of the works on commissioner mountain they hadnt been able to take if the enemy wont make them a pyre he said the least they could do would be to get them under the ground bury them the way the blonds used to do with their dead before we taught em better colonel andys lip curled with distaste i dont know about that sir do you really think the gods would accept it better than leaving dead men on the field to bloat and stink wouldnt you say doubting george asked again his adjutant remained unconvinced buryings unnatural fire purifies the soul i george stopped and coughed if he said he doubted that he would find himself in a theological argument with andy he had neither the time nor the energy for any such thing besides in the general run of things he didnt doubt it if he fell in battle he wanted to be burned but even burial struck him as preferable to being ignored by everyone save the carrion birds andy looked toward the south here comes general hesmucet sir hesmucet reined his unicorn to a halt as doubting george stiffened to attention he reflected that the general commanding rode more like a tradesman than a noble then he laughed at himself again that was true but it would have counted against hesmucet much more heavily in the bloodconscious north than in the south where what a man could do mattered more than who his grandfather was this is the side you chose george thought make the best of it after descending from the unicorn and tying it to a tree hesmucet said if the weather holds well be able to do some more against the bastards thats true sir george agreed do we have a bridgehead on the west bank of snouts stream ive heard it but i want to make sure its so before i go out and celebrate its so hesmucet answered now we have to figure out how to make the most of itand how to keep the traitors from wrecking it before we can the more we press them the likelier they are to break george observed if we can slip some unicornriders over to the far side of that stream and turn them loose that might give joseph something new to think about well so it might the commanding general allowed he called for a runner then told him fetch marble bill here if were going to talk about unicornriders we might as well have their commander listening he probably would have come up with that for himself doubting george thought hes a solid general no matter how he tried to hide it even from himself not being in command hurt brigadier williammore commonly marble bill because of a pale complexion and a nearly expressionless facewas not a brilliant commander of unicornriders the traitors had a couple of those jeb the beauty who served duke edward of arlington so well in parthenia and grim ned of the forest here in the east but marble bill was a competent commander of unicornriders after some of the unfortunate officers whod led southron unicorns into battle competence was not to be despised hesmucet said doubting george here had himself a notion he didnt try to take credit for it himself as a lot of highranking officers might have done after spelling it out for marble bill he asked what do you think can we do it i dont know for certain the brigadiers voice gave away no more than his face did after a moment he went on finding out might be worthwhile though i probably ought to take my riders across snouts stream by night to keep the enemy from knowing theyre there till they start moving definitely competent george thought hesmucet said ill have major alva lay down a confusion spell for you if you like to georges surprise marble bill shook his head no thanks he said the traitors will be looking for magecraft i expect even if they cant pierce it knowing its there will put them on the alert very definitely competent doubting george thought he asked can you move a couple of regiments over tonight yes sir was all marble bill said in reply to that a lot of officersboth general guildenstern and fighting joseph leaped into georges mindwere given to boasting and bluster hearing one give a simple matteroffact answer was refreshing as if thinking of fighting joseph were enough to conjure him up he strolled over and nodded casually to hesmucet and george in turn then do it hesmucet said with the air of a man coming to a decision he turned to george and to fighting joseph ill want more soldiers from both of you to help build up the bridgehead youll have them george said imitating marble bills brevity fighting joseph by contrast struck a pose my brave men are always at your service sir and at the service of the kingdom he declared he meant it george was sure he meant it as far as fighting joseph was concerned he selflessly served detina as far as any outsider was concerned fighting joseph worried first about himself and grabbing more power and glory for himself and about everything else afterwards long afterwards it seemed painfully obvious to everyone who served with him and tried to command him im so glad to hear it hesmucet replied now tell me what to do and i shall do it fighting joseph struck another pose george fought down a strong urge to retch all right hesmucet said this is what youll do thenyoull move in support of lieutenant general georges men and you want me to do what fighting joseph demanded indignantly his ruddy face got ruddier till it almost reached the high color of roastbeef williams you want me to move in subordination to another wing commander lieutenant general george has more men and more men in the vicinity than you do hesmucet spoke in reasonable tones to me that means he should be the one with the main responsibility and you the one with the secondary responsibility fighting joseph rolled his eyes up to the heavens by the thunderers shaggy beard how many more such insults must i endure i dont see that youve endured any george told him if our positions were reversed id certainly subordinate myself to you no one understands me fighting joseph groaned as if he were an avantgarde artistor perhaps a sixyearold in a temper he stormed away from his fellow generals george wondered if spanking his backside would do any good unfortunately he had his doubts general hesmucet sighed he is brave he said and he might have been reminding himself as well as the officers with him he is brave he repeated but hes also godsdamned difficult one of these days he kicked up some dirt with his right boot as if kicking the obstreperous joseph out of the army but as doubting george knew hesmucet couldnt simply dismiss fighting joseph josephs seniority entitled him to high rank somewhere if not here then somewhere farther west hesmucet might not want him here but king avram didnt want him anywhere closer to georgetown in that contest hesmucet was bound to lose the general commanding sighed again you gentlemen know what i want from you now george if fighting joseph positively disobeys my command i want to hear about it yes sir george said if fighting joseph gave hesmucet enough spikes to crucify him the general commanding would no doubt shed nary a tear george himself wasnt enamored of working alongside fighting joseph and wouldnt have been brokenhearted to see him go either brigadier william hesmucet said and marble bill stiffened to attention hesmucet went on remember if we can get your unicornriders either through the traitors line at snouts stream or around the end of it joseph the gamecock will have to pull back that will give us hiltonia and ephesus too saluting marble bill said you know ill do everything i can sir good hesmucet nodded up till now from what the prisoners say our friend joseph the gamecock has kept morale up in the army of franklin by making his retreats out to be strategy he tells his men hes luring us deeper and deeper into peachtree to destroy us if he loses hiltonia if theres only the hoocheecoochee river between us and marthasville that story will start wearing thin i understand what you want of me sir marble bill said hesmucet looked to doubting george too and doubtless would have looked to fighting joseph were he still there doubting george nodded all right then hesmucet said dismissed he got back onto his unicorn and rode away george told colonel andy draft orders to set our regiments in motion as general hesmucet requires yes sir his adjutant replied ah sir is fighting joseph really going to support us he looked around to make sure no one but george was in earshot before adding my guess is hell support us like a commercial traveler skipping out on a farmers daughter after hes put a baby in her belly heh george said dont i wish you were wrong a fieldgrade officer approached him george nodded a greeting hello colonel nahath what can i do for you today he had a warm regard for the regimental commander back in the desperate fighting by the river of death nahaths new eboracers had fought back to back when the traitors tried a flank attack on merkles hill that came much too close to working i have a question for you lieutenant general nahath replied you have a name for being a fair man so im particularly interested in what you have to say well youve flattered me and youve intrigued me doubting george said now youd better ask your question dont you think yes sir nahath said i have a man in my regimentin lieutenant griffs companywho up on commissioner mountain took the company standard when the standardbearer was hit who brought it forward through everything the traitors could shoot at him and who was the last man to leave the field my question is should i promote him to corporal lion gods claws colonel if you promoted him to lieutenant youd get no argument from me george said why do you even feel you need to ask hes a blond sir nahath replied fellow named rollant escaped serf from palmetto province oh george kicked at the mud under his right boot every so often his being a northerner by birth would up and bite him that a blond might do such a thing had never crossed his mind he plucked at his beard as he thought at last he asked if you did promote him would the men obey him i dont know sir colonel nahath said that would be one of the things id have to find out i know i dont need your permission precisely there are other blond underofficers though not a great many but i did want your view on the matter before i acted i appreciate that doubting george plucked at his beard again at last with a sigh he said promote him colonel see what happens if he does the job well and good if not he deserves the chance to fail wouldnt you say i rather think he will but he does deserve a chance deserves the chance to fail nahath echoed thats well put sir all right then ill do it and well see how it goes seems only fair george said after all its not as if hes an officer or anything of the sort there is a blond officer you know nahath said doubting george and colonel andy both exclaimed in astonishment but the new eboracer nodded by the gods gentlemen there is hes a major among the healers in the west what will the kingdom be like if king avram turns blonds into detinans colonel andy asked it will be different george said it will be very different of that there can be no doubt but i will say this and of it there can also be no doubt detina will be one kingdom and that is how the gods intended it to be and to remain his adjutant and colonel nahath both nodded colonel florizel said a great pity leonidas the priest got killed we were lucky to have a wing commander on such good terms with the gods if you say so sir captain gremio replied he wouldnt argue with the leader of his regiment but his own view of the situation was that a wing commander with an actual functioning brain would be a pleasant novelty piety to him went only so far as a military virtue florizel gave what was probably intended for an indulgent chuckle ah you barristers he said a lot of freethinkers among you i believe in the gods your excellency gremio protested there are days i admit when i have trouble believing the gods believe in me as soon as the words were out of his mouth he knew he should have left them unsaid the first sentence was fine not even florizel could complain about that the second no he should have thought it and kept his mouth shut the gods believe the regimental commander said firmly and they have ways of showing people exactly what they believe he eyed gremio as if to say the gods were likely to believe hed made a jackass of himself at the moment he believed that too muttering excuses under his breath he walked down the trench line in theory to see how the men of his company were positioned but in fact to get away from colonel florizel after hed made good his escape he started really doing what hed pretended to do when he left florizels regiment had the bad luck to be holding the stretch of line where the southrons had forced their way across snouts stream that meant his men along with everyone else in the regiment had to stay especially alert lest the enemy come swarming at them in great numbers cautiously gremio stuck his head up above the parapet and peered east toward the southrons bridgehead a hundred yards away a southron officers head popped up above his parapet at the same time each man saw the motion from the other both men ducked a moment later feeling foolish gremio looked up again so did the southron gremio waved he despised southrons in general but had nothing against specific southrons in particular after a brief hesitation the enemy officer waved back he must feel the same about me as i feel about him gremio thought it was an odd notion more often than not southrons were simply the enemy to him how could they be human beings they were fighting him and everything he held dear every once in a while in spite of everything one of them insisted on reminding gremio of his humanity in the end though how much did that matter not a great deal if he comes at me im going to try to kill him regardless of what i think about him battlefield reality could be very simple a little farther east behind the southrons entrenchments theyd thrown a couple of bridges across snouts stream gremio didnt like that at all it meant hesmucets men could reinforce their bridgehead whenever they pleased he wondered where joseph the gamecock would find reinforcements in case the northerners needed more men in a hurry he didnt know he hoped joseph did anything unusual sir sergeant thisbe asked him nothing much he answered a southron and i were playing peekaboo with each other for a little bit you might say peekaboo thisbe echoed gremio mimed sticking his head up looking ducking down and then looking again the sergeant laughed peekaboo gremio repeated that bastard in gray was doing just the same thing all right but thisbes smile slipped do you think we can throw the southrons back across the stream no gremio said bluntly weve tried a couple of times and paid the price for it the balls in their court now were just going to have to hold them back as best we can we ought to be able to do that oh too bad thisbe said i thought the same thing myself and i was hoping you would tell me i was wrong i wish i could gremio answered he had the feeling that colonel florizel still believed they could throw the southrons back that worried him if the colonel or those above him tried to act on that belief a lot of good northern men were going to end up deadand worse yet dead for no good purpose gremio himself he knew might easily end up among their number he disapproved of that idea with all his orderly soul he was to some degree willing to die for his kingdom but only if his death would actually do the kingdom some good dying in a fight foredoomed from the start struck him as wasteful thisbe said i wish the southrons hadnt got this bridgehead so do i gremio replied we were all so pleased when we threw them back from commissioner mountain and we should have beenthat thrust would have killed us had it gone home but this bridgehead he scowled its like an ulcer or a wound that festers instead of getting better we can die from this too even if it takes longer thats how my father died thisbe said quietly he laid his leg open with an axe and it never healed up the right way no matter how the healers and the mages tried to fix it the flesh just melted off him and after a while he couldnt live any more things like that happen gremio agreed my mother and father are well gods be praised or they were last time i heard from them but i know you cant count on anything if i didnt know that beforehand this godsdamned war would have taught me plenty yes sir thisbe said if i were the southron general id either try to find a way through with those men already on this side of snouts stream or else id use them to keep us busy here while i did my mischief somewhere else sergeant you ought to be an officer gremio said with unfeigned admiration thats as neat a summingup as i could do in a lawcourt and how much do you want to bet that the people set over us havent got their thoughts together half so straight i dont know anything about that thisbe replied what i do know is i dont want to be an officer he wagged a finger at gremio i really and truly mean that sir youve got a lets promote somebody to lieutenant look in your eye and i wont take the post even if you try to give it to me gremio could hardly help believing thisbes sincerity but why he asked perplexed the company would be better for it you know as well as i do that theres a lieutenants slot open you could do the job you could do it better than anyone i can think of i dont want it thisbe declared ive got enough things to worry about being a sergeant being a lieutenant would just complicate my life to the hells and gone all i ever wanted to do was be a soldier youre not hardly a soldier when youre an officerno offense to you sir what he said held some truth officers worried more about paperwork even than sergeants while common soldiers didnt have to worry about it at all a good thing too since so many of them lacked their letters but thisbe capably handled the paperwork he had more shouldnt faze him something else lay behind his refusal but gremio couldnt see what he tried wheedling youd make more money i dont care now the sergeant was visibly getting angry i dont want it sir and thats flat all right all right gremio made a placating gesture one thing years in the lawcourts had taught him was when to back off for whatever reasons thisbe really didnt want to become an officer that puzzled gremio who was always in the habit of grabbing for whatever came his way however puzzled he was though he could see he wouldnt change the sergeants mind later that day as hed feared the southrons started bringing more mensome footsoldiers others unicornriders like the ones whod come in under cover of darkness the night beforeinto their bridgehead on the west bank of snouts stream they also started bringing catapults over the bridges spanning the stream colonel florizel ordered the regiment up to full alert the other regiments in alexander the stewards wing also put more men up on the shooting steps of their trenches can we do anything more than that sir gremio asked florizel by we he didnt mean the regiment but the army of franklin as a whole can we bring more men up to this part of the line can we bring more engines here the godsdamned southrons will pound us flat unless we can hit back he waited for colonel florizel to get angry hed long since seen the regimental commander would have preferred a different sort of man as company commander a noble a serfholder all the things gremio wasnt and wished he were but florizel sighed and said ive been screaming for that captain its done no good were stretched as thin as can be to strengthen this stretch means weakening ourselves somewhere else we have nothing to spare the southrons do gremio said i know florizel replied then the war is lost gremio thought if they can stretch us till we break and stay unbroken themselves the war is lost beyond repair he didnt want to dwell on that in fact he refused to dwell on it he said wed better weaken ourselves somewhere else sir or theyre going to tear a hole right through this stretch of line im not going to argue with you because i think youre right colonel florizel said which did little to make gremio feel any better but reinforcements did come in pulled from the far north that meant hesmucets line began to overlap that of joseph the gamecock but it couldnt be helped a rupture here and josephs line would be shattered gremio could see that the southrons could see it and for something of a wonder so could joseph the gamecock himself the storm broke a couple of days later it wasnt a real storm like the ones that had done so much to delay the southrons before and after the battle of commissioner mountain the weather while hot and muggy as usual was also bright and clear the engines hesmucets men had brought forward started pounding the northern line stones thudded home firepots burst spilling gouts of flame into the entrenchments men shrieked when those flames bit repeating crossbows sent streams of quarrels skimming low above the trenches parapets despite the storm of missiles gremio shouted up up and fight if we stay hidden the southrons will just walk right over us listen to the captain sergeant thisbe said he knows what hes talking about not least because gremio and thisbe wasted no time getting up on the shooting steps themselves their men followed them and if id stayed down in the trench they would have skulked too gremio thought this business of commanding is a curious one indeed bowstrings twanged bolts whizzed toward the oncoming southrons some of the men in gray fell others shot back gremio drew his sword and brandished it much good that will do he thought but did it anyhow a crossbow quarrel clanged off the blade he felt the impact all the way up his arm to his shoulder one of the northerners repeating crossbows began hosing darts at the southrons rushing across open ground men went down like grain before the scythe but others brave even if they did serve king avram kept coming some of them shouting avrams name and freedom leaped down into the trenches to try to force their way through and past king geoffreys soldiers in that close combat captain gremios sword was good for something the blade nicked where the bolt had hit soon had blood on it men strained and cursed and smote and screamed and bled and died and because the fight was province against province sometimes brother against brother each side understood every word its enemies said when the southrons started crying fall back captain gremio not only understood but grinned in something reasonably like triumph yes youd better fall back he yelled provincial prerogative forever by the thunderers beard sir we stopped them said sergeant thisbe who wore no beard of his own they didnt bring enough men forward gremio agreed i rather thought they would make a better fight of it thisbe panted he had a cut above one eye and another on his arm but neither seemed in the least serious im not sorry they didnt sir and thats the truth after a moment he added you handled that sword of yours mighty well thank you gremio said he wasnt used to such praise and didnt think he deserved itwhich didnt stop him from enjoying it when it came out in the open land between the northerners trenches and those of the foe a southron let out a shrieksomebodyd shot him when he went out to pick up a wounded comrade other southrons shouted shame and no fair men making pickup like men answering calls of nature were usually reckoned improper targets life isnt fair thisbe said of course not gremio answered if it were the southrons army wouldnt be twice the size of ours and no one would need barristers either he thought but he didnt say that aloud king geoffreys men celebrated their victory at the enemy bridgehead till the late afternoon that was when word came of the breakthrough the southron unicornriders had made at the far northern end of the line joseph the gamecock had been defending victory or no victory gremios company along with the rest of the northerners abandoned the trenches theyd just held and retreated to the north once more joseph the gamecock had the nerve to be proud of himself of all the disgrace and embarrassment attached to the retreat from commissioner mountain that galled lieutenant general bell more than anything else as they rode north joseph turned to him and said we havent left them anything they can use not a single solitary thing one of the cleanest escapes ever if i do say so myself huzzah bell said sourly how many more retreats can we make before we go clean past marthasville that got home joseph flushed and scowled he said i still intend to hold marthasville holding marthasville is the point of this campaign really bell raised an eyebrow i hadnt noticed that it had any point at all except perhaps giving ground in the name of the gods when do we get to fight back instead of running away lieutenant general you are grossly insubordinate joseph the gamecock snapped if i am sirbell larded the commanding generals title of respect with as much scorn as he could pack into it id say its about time somebody was now weve gone and lost hiltonia and ephesus too and how are we going to hold the line of the hoocheecoochee river against the southrons we have to hold it wouldnt you say seeing as its the last line in front of marthasville hed hoped to whip joseph into a greater anger than that which already gripped him maybe the general commanding would do something unforgivable considering how little faith king geoffrey had in joseph the gamecock it might not take much but joseph instead of igniting smiled a smile so superior it made lieutenant general bells own temper kindle how will we hold the line of the hoocheecoochee joseph echoed ill tell you how with some of the finest field works ever made thats how ive had serfs digging for weeks if youd been paying attention even a little i daresay you might have found out but that would be too much to hope for wouldnt it bell glared blackly and he had a comeback ready field works is it how many lines of field works have the southrons already turned ive lost track of just how many but there isnt one they havent turned i know that for a fact sooner or later they may push us back over the river joseph the gamecock allowed but we also have good positions on the other side how lucky for us bell said acid in his voice and what happens when the southrons flank us out of those too joseph the gamecock exhaled in exasperation they wont by the gods we can hold the line of the hoocheecoochee and we will he didnt wait for bells next contradiction but spurred his unicorn forward and away although lieutenant general bell could have ridden in pursuit of the commanding general he didnt for one thing riding fast hurt even more than riding at a regular pace for another joseph knew his opinions quite well enough already and for a third bell didnt want to give too much away if joseph the gamecock got a little more suspicious of him well how much difference would it make how much was left to save here in peachtree province did the northerners have enough of an army here to save it of course we do bell thought provided we have a man in charge whos not afraid to use it when the army started filing into the trenches covering the approaches to the hoocheecoochee and the bridges over it bell discovered to his surprise and not a little to his dismay that joseph the gamecock had known whereof he spoke the field fortifications in front of the river were formidable and wouldnt be easy to force marthasville and the vital glideway routes east that ran through it remained protected but for how much longer bell wondered what will go wrong something always has weve been retreating for two months now we cant fall back much farther because weve nowhere to fall back to while he scowled and fumed major zibeon found him a farmhouse behind the line in which he could make his headquarters his aidedecamp said sorry it isnt anything fancier sir dont worry about it bell answered help me down from this beast if youd be so kind his head buzzed with laudanum riding was hard on him zibeon undid the ties that kept him on the unicorn and steadied him while he positioned his crutches thank you kindly bell said though the pain of the crutch in his left armpit was hardly less than hed known while riding plant swing forward plant swing forward he made his way into the farmhouse the farmer had already fled north for which bell was duly grateful he didnt feel like having to be sociable a couple of serfs huts stood by the main house maybe the fellow whod lived here had been a petty baronet or maybe hed just been a yeoman whod come into the land to which the serfs were attached the huts stood dark and empty now with no naked blond children playing around them the serfs had fled too though odds were they hadnt fled north is everything to your liking sir major zibeon asked after he went inside if everything were to my liking major wed be fighting a good many miles south of this place bell answered his aidedecamp grunted and gave him a reproachful look he relented seeing as we are here this house will do well enough thank you sir zibeon said that is what i had in mindas i think you knew well enough few men were bold enough to reproach lieutenant general bell to his face joseph the gamecock did it but that hardly counted zibeon had the nerve to speak his mind because he did bell treated him with more respect than he would have otherwise well maybe i did he admitted from up in the trenches someone shouted here comes the head of the southron army out of the hills we just left we should never have left them bell muttered more to himself than to anybody else then grudgingly he spoke aloud id better go out and have a look dont you think major might be a good idea sir his aidedecamp replied zibeon softened that bell could tell what it meant in plain detinan was youd have to be an idiot if you didnt bell made his slow painful way out of the farmhouse once more and shading his eyes with the palm of his hand peered south sure enough the reddish dust hanging in the air above the hills was the sign of an army on the march through the dust came sparkles of sunlight on spearpoints and metalshod unicorn horns bell wished for more rain which would have laid the dust and slowed the southrons movements now though the sun blazed down on the army of franklin as fiercely as if the sun god were angry at the north how can we win if even the gods turn against us bell thought but he shook his big leonine head the gods surely fought for king geoffrey how could it be otherwise when theyd subjected and bound the blonds gods just as the detinans themselves had subjected the natives of this land and bound them to the soil pointing major zibeon said looks like the stinking southrons are going into line of battle they always tap at our lines thinking well run bell said its because we do run when joseph the gamecock tells us to they take us for cowards may they suffer in the seven hells for all eternity well make a few of them suffer now unless im wrong zibeon said they cant hope to shift us when were in earthworks and theyre not earthworks make men cowards bell declared he was far from the only general on either side to sing that song but sang it louder and more stridently than most if this were my army we would come out and fight we wouldnt shelter behind walls of mud the way we do now up came the southrons they shot a few bolts at the men in the trenches joseph the gamecocks men shot back a few southrons fell the rest drew back they wouldnt press home attacks against earthworks either cowards bell thought nothing but cowards major zibeons thoughts were going down a different glideway line he asked how are we going to keep the southrons from reaching the hoocheecoochee at a point beyond our lines if they manage that were in trouble there for once bell felt some sympathy with joseph the gamecock patrols of unicornriders he answered he approved of such patrols they were aggressive and anything aggressive met with his approval but zibeon said patrols of unicornriders are all very well sir but gods damn me if i think brigadier spinners the right man to lead our mounted men i wish we had ned of the forest here everyone wishes for ned of the forest bell told him theres only one of the man though and hes over by the great river spinner is capable enough the southrons can afford to get by with men who are capable enough his aidedecamp said they have room to make their mistakes good if we make a mistake theyll land on us with both feet what we need is a genuine fortrue genius of an officer leading unicornriders we only had two in all the north jeb the beauty who was over in parthenia and who i hear got killed not long ago bell broke in with a sigh its a hard war and its not getting any easier jeb the beauty whos dead zibeon agreed and ned of the forest we need him here at the point of decision not off running a sideshow in the east he and count thraxton had a row as i recall thats what got him transferred bell said i dont know all the details that wasnt long after i turned lopsided he waggled his stump a little even though it hurt if he could laugh at his own mutilations no one else would have the nerve to laugh at them zibeons bushy eyebrows climbed almost to his hairline a row you might just say so sir if what people say is true ned came out and said he would challenge thraxton except he didnt suppose thraxton was enough of a man to accept it from what bell had seen before his wound by the river of death count thraxton whatever else one said about him was a proud and touchy fellow his own eyebrows rose and the count let that go by without taking the challenge and without punishing ned of the forest he did indeed zibeon said solemnly i have seen ned of the forest in a temper sir hes not a man anyone at all would care to take lightly zibeon was a pretty hard case himself and not easily impressed if he found ned formidable formidable ned was even so how could count thraxton possibly live down the disgrace what disgrace sir the aidedecamp replied thraxton is king geoffreys friend as you must know when was the last time you heard of a kings friend who disgraced himself to the point of making people notice that bit of cynicism made bells face twist with pain which for once wasnt physical zibeon had the right of it there sure enough if geoffrey decides joseph the gamecock must gono when he decides it for he surely willwont he replace him with his friend and if he does what becomes of me he began to regret his own letters yes hed had weakening josephs position in mind but he hadnt intended to strengthen anyones but his own could he serve under count thraxton if the warrior mage returned to command everyone not just ned of the forest had trouble serving under thraxton the braggart can i write letters of a different tone bell wondered after a moments thought he shook his head too late now gods damn it all he could do now was fight as well as he could and hope joseph the gamecock wouldnt suffer some irremediable disaster while count thraxton was down here on his watching brief he would have fought hard anyhow for his prides sake and for his kingdoms sake too so he told himself at any rate but now he also had solid personal reasons zibeon said maybe this will work out all right sir we do have a good position to defend so we do bell said he couldnt afford to malign joseph he realized not even to his aidedecamp not for the time being of course i have to hope well get the chance to defend it major zibeon added how not bell asked in real obvious perplexity outflanking we were talking about this sir zibeon spoke with what sounded like exaggerated patience my godsdamned shoulder is hurting again bell mumbled and it always did but he was such a straightahead fighter hed already forgotten hesmucet didnt have to be he took a big swig of laudanum there ill think better now he declared zibeon said not a word vi captain gremio was no general gremio hadnt been a soldier at all before the war or a domainholding noblethe closest peacetime equivalenteither but like so many others hed had plenty of experience since the fighting began in karlsburg harbor more than three years before he said these are splendid works and i hope hesmucet tries to storm them hed bloody his southron nose the way he did at commissioner mountain yes sir sergeant thisbe said but even though he lost on the mountain he got that little bridgehead over snouts stream and look at how much trouble he caused with it had hesmucet not got that bridgehead the army of franklin might well have still been defending the line of the mountain and the stream gremio gave thisbe a half mocking bow very neat sergeant he said you agree with me in your first two words then proceed to show im wrong very neat indeed thisbe turned red im sorry sir i didnt mean to do that dont apologize gremio told him you got me fair and square i wish i could do so well in front of the judges a lot of the time now youre joking with me sir thisbe said i dont much care for that he was as so often almost painfully serious no such thing i meant every word of it gremio raised his hand above his head pointing to the mountain beyond the sky as he would have in a lawcourt by the thunderer i swear it all right thisbe looked back over his shoulder are we supposed to make a stand with our backs to a river if the southrons do beat us here it would go hard for us i suppose thats true gremio said but do you really think hesmucet can storm us out of this position the sergeant considered youre probably right sir you usually are from everything ive seen now gremio felt himself blushing thats kind of you sergeantkinder than i deserve i shouldnt wonder no sir thisbe said if ever theres somebody who knows whats what youre the one if i knew what was what would i be here gremio asked with a wry laugh that made thisbe laugh too but as usual his answer was thoughtful i suppose it depends on how important you think this is for the kingdom if we dont win here or at least keep the southrons from winning geoffrey wont have a kingdom gremio thought since he didnt feel like voicing words of ill omen aloud he replied when we were coming down out of the hill country towards the hoocheecoochee i could see marthasville he craned his neck cant quite do it now but i know the place is there maybe that makes this pretty important business after all i think so too sir thisbe agreed what sort of spirits are the men in gremio asked youve got stripes on your sleeves not epaulets on your shoulders that puts you closer to an ordinary man than i could ever are you all right sergeant thisbe had suffered a coughing fit and went even redder in the face than he had before im sorry sir he wheezed when he could speak at all i swallowed wrong then and almost choked most ways id say youre closer to an ordinary man than i could ever be before gremio could argue with that thisbe went on i think your ordinary soldier dislikes a sergeant more than an officer in the same sort of way that a serf is liable to dislike an overseer more than a liege lord the sergeant is the one who makes sure he does what hes told after all mm i shouldnt wonder if there was something to that gremio allowed all right sergeant youve made your point he put on a severe look as ive said i do wish youd let me offer your name for promotion no thank you sir as usual on this subject thisbes voice held not an ounce of doubt id sooner just be what i am id much sooner just be what i am i bow to your wishes gremio suited action to word the sergeant smiled and began a motion in return but arrested it before it was well begunnot quite an answering bow but something on that order gremio said its plain that once upon a time you were a fine gentleman i was not thisbe said hotly never once the very idea he sounded so irate gremio didnt ask any of the questions he might have otherwise king geoffreys army held more than a few nobles fighting as common soldiers either from sheer love of adventure or because theyd disgraced themselves and couldnt claim the rank that should have gone with their station it had occurred to gremio that his sergeant might be such a man if he was though he didnt intend to admit it and now he went off in what gremio couldnt help but recognized as a huff the company commander kicked at the brickred mud in the bottom of the trench even though he had the right to make such comments to thisbe he wished he hadnt done it he didnt want the sergeant angry at him the company wont run smoothly if he is gremio told himself but there was more to it than that he didnt want thisbe angry at him because he liked and respected him and wanted him to be as much of a friend as their different ranks would permit by the gods if i ever found a woman who suited me as well as thisbe does id marry her on the spot he muttered getting married though didnt stay on his mind for long for one thing he knew of no womenexcept perhaps a few loose oneswithin miles for another a troop of southron unicornriders trotted past the army of franklins entrenchments right on the edge of catapult range a few engineers let fly at them most of the stones and firepots went wide but one smashed a rider and his unicorn like a boot descending on a cockroach after that the southrons did a better job of keeping their distance but they had accomplished their purpose gremio saw that clearly by reminding the northern commanders they were there they kept joseph the gamecock and brigadier spinner from loosing the northern riders to harry the enemy supply line it was long stretching all the way back to rising rock and it was tenuous but none of that mattered if the northerners couldnt mount a serious attack on it and by all the signs they couldnt gremio sighed more and more these days the war was coming down to demonstrations of what the north couldnt do that was no way to win it were right though he thought a moment later he laughed at himself a man in the lawcourts might be right too how much good did that do him if the judges ruled he was wrong none whatsoever as gremio knew too well like any barrister he always thought he was right everyone once in a while some idiot panel of judges had a differentand no doubt erroneousopinion brigadier alexander the new wing commander came marching through the trenches gremio approved of that leonidas the priest had been a brave and pious man but hadnt much concerned himself with his soldiers mundane daytoday needs and concernsor perhaps he simply hadnt cared to get his fancy vestments dirty alexander strode up to gremio who stiffened to attention and saluted as you were captain the senior officer said gremio saw how hed come to be called old straighthe was tall and lean and very erect and when he spoke his words were straightforward too how in your view can we best beat back the stinking southrons what can we do that we arent doing now having twice as many men in the trenches wouldnt hurt sir gremio replied so it wouldnt brigadier alexander agreed ask for the moon as long as youre making wishes what can we do that we can do if you take my meaning he meant the question seriously gremio could see as much he gave back a serious answer sir holding them out of marthasville is about as big a victory as we can hope for wouldnt you say he waited wondering if hed misjudged alexander some officers would have taken thatwould have taken anything less than a call for an immediate counterattack on general hesmucet and a march south toward the franklin lineas defeatism but old straight nodded and said you see things clearly dont you relieved gremio said i do my best sir if we all do our best captain we have some hope of coming out of this campaign with whole skins brigadier alexander said if we dont well things wont look so good this is colonel florizels regiment is it not gremio nodded yes sir you men have put up a good record alexander said if all the companygrade officers here are up to your level captain i can see why and ill tell the same to your colonel your name is gremio sir very well carry on captain gremio the wing commander swept on down the line now and then pausing to pull his boots out of mud thicker than usual gremio doubted he would have that problem himself not for a while he would be walking on air for the rest of the day and hed won respect from his men that he hadnt had before if brigadier alexander approved of him and would say so out loud who were common soldiers to disagree they obeyed him more promptly than hed ever seen them do before hed enjoy it while it lasted for he didnt think it would last long it did suffice to bring colonel florizel over to him the regimental commander asked how did you get brigadier alexander to say such fine things about you florizel sounded half suspicious half jealous alexander evidently hadnt said any fine things about him deadpan gremio answered i told him id learned everything i know about fighting from you sir that actually did hold some truth florizel would never become a brigadier himself he was no great tactician nor to be just did he claim to be one but he was brave and he knew how to make his men like him and fight bravely for him there were plenty of worse regimental commanders in the army of franklin and some worse men in charge of brigades too and like a lot of men he was no more immune to flattery than flies were to honey he coughed and scuffed his boots in the mud and murmured well captain that was a mighty kind thing to say mighty kind indeed oh dear gremio thought he took that literally didnt he the best thing he could find to do was change the subject and so he did the new wing commander worries that we wont be able to drive the southrons back brigadier alexander had done more than worry hed been at least as gloomy about the campaign as gremio was himself but florizel was and always had been an optimist saying something that didnt suggest total victory lay right around the corner took nerve hell fight hard florizel said now and with that gremio could not disagree the colonel went on as long as were still on this side of the hoocheecoochee things arent too bad weve still got us and the river between the southrons and marthasville and weve got to keep them out of there eryes gremio did his best to keep from showing how astonished he was if the everhopeful florizel couldnt paint any brighter picture than that the army of franklin was in less than the best of shape florizel set a hand on his shoulder the gods may yet decide to smile on us even if the loss of leonidas was a heavy blow we should all try to deserve well of them to show them we deserve to be the ones they choose in this fierce and remorseless struggle i think we can do that i pray we can may it be so gremio hoped the gods would favor the north too in his glummer moments he feared nothing short of that would suffice to save geoffreys kingdom from avrams onslaught the southrons might have been a python squeezing the life out of the north an inch at a time these are very strong works florizel said the enemy will have a hells of a time trying to go through us yes sir gremio agreed what worries me though is whether he can go around us instead that would be just as bad i suppose it might but i dont think it will happen florizel said brigadier spinners patrols ride up and down the hoocheecoochee i wish we had ned of the forest here gremio said not for the first time hes a ruffian a man of no breeding earl florizel said a man of no breeding himself gremio replied hes also the best commander of unicornriders king geoffrey has whos still breathing which carries the greater weight florizel seriously thought that over at last reluctantly he nodded ned is a very fine man on the back of a unicornwhich makes him no less of a ruffian be it noted yes sir gremio said dutifully still im glad hes on our side so am i although i still wish we didnt have to resort to such tools the regimental commander said its a war sir gremio said if it werent for the fighting wed all be doing something else florizel also nodded at that but he didnt look happy about it to a detinan noble war was the normal state of affairs peace the aberration the world didnt really work that way but nobles were trained to think it did they have other things wrong with them too gremio thought from the hills above the valley of the hoocheecoochee river general hesmucet could look down on joseph the gamecocks army and spy out everything the enemy did even as he did it hesmucet relished that the northerners had looked down on his lines from their position atop commissioner mountain and he was sure that had cost him men when joseph halted the bulk of his army on the eastern bank of the hoocheecoochee hesmucet had been surprised only a very bold general or a very foolhardy one was likely to offer battle with his back to a sizable stream examining the works the northerners occupied however convinced hesmucet that joseph was neither the one nor the other he had sound defenses there earlier in the campaign hesmucet might have tried to bull his way past those defenses in the hope of breaking through and wrecking the traitors army but hed tried that at commissioner mountain and it hadnt worked that made him hesitate now so did the strength of the entrenchments in which the northerners sheltered josephs men held a line about six miles long hesmucet began sending detachments of marble bills unicornriders out beyond their lines in the hope of getting down to the river and forcing a crossing if my men get over the hoocheecoochee joseph will have to retreat in a hurry he thought hungrily then hes mine but the enemy commander could see that as well as he could blueuniformed unicornriders were numerous and fierce marble bills men came back again and again without ever reaching the banks of the hoocheecoochee anyone would think they had some idea of what weve got in mind lieutenant general george said when hesmucet cursed about the unicornriders misfortunes dyou think so fighting joseph asked hesmucet winced doubting george had been sardonic fighting joseph meant it time and again hesmucet had seen that courage and brains too often had only a nodding acquaintance it is a possibility you know george said some folk do seek to study what the foe might be up to that often saves you from nasty surprises or so they say not a bad notion by the way fighting joseph spoke the said notion plainly was entering his handsome head for the first time by his record that struck hesmucet as all too likely well keep moving thats all he said as long as we are moving something good may happen if we pull into a shell the way turtles do well never get anywhere and thats as plain as the nose on my face even as plain as the nose on mine said doubting george who owned one of formidable proportions the gods help those who help themselves fighting joseph agreed hesmucet wished he wouldnt have done so with a cliche and then wished for all the gold in the golden province far to the east while he was at it maybe james the birds eye said we could give ourselves a better chance of reaching the river with magic for a southron to rely on wizardry was out of the ordinary in this war but major alva was no ordinary southron mage not a bad notion hesmucet agreed i will take that up with our sorcerers by that he meant he would take it up with major alva and all the wing commanders understood as much the rest of the mages in the army from colonel phineas on down came close to matching the youngster only if all their efforts were added together looking from one officer to another hesmucet asked anything else anyone think we have a real chance of going through joseph the gamecocks position instead of around it nobody said anything not even fighting joseph who was much given to overcoming obstacles by charging straight at them and smashing them flat with his hard head hesmucet didnt know whether to be relieved at the show of good sense or sorry he didnt get the chance to squelch his annoying subordinate with a small shrug he said dismissed as the generals trooped away he called for a runner and told him fetch me major alva dont just tell him i want him and then leave bring him back here yourself yes sir the soldier grinned hed been one of hesmucets runners for some little while now if i dont bring him hes liable to forget to come at all isnt he hell just stand there thinking fancy thoughts he doesnt know a whole lot about subordination hesmucet agreed wryly alva knows even less about subordination than fighting joseph does he thought fighting joseph understands what hes supposed to do he just doesnt do it to alva the whole idea is bizarre that thought led to another if hes not the ultimate free detinan who in the seven hells is off went the runner he returned in due course alva in tow the mage did remember to salute when he came up to hesmucet and seemed proud of himself for remembering you wanted me uh sir he said thats right the commanding general answered he gave alva more leeway than he did to any other soldier in the army alva had earned more than any other soldier had hesmucet went on can you work out some sort of masking spell that will let marble bills unicornriders get down to the hoocheecoochee without the traitors finding out about it till too late major alva gave him a bright smile funny you should ask me that sir marble bill asked the very same thing a couple of days ago did he well good for him hesmucet said that was more initiative than the commander of unicornriders usually showed yes sir he did i gave him a cantrip i thought would serve alvas smile slipped it didnt the northerners had a counterspell that sniffed it out and beat back his column of riders ah too bad hesmucet said well they have good wizards of their own and keeping us off the hoocheecoochee is very important to them their wizards are strong but they arent all that good alva said theres a difference if there was hesmucet couldnt see it alva added whats so important about the river anyway by the gods hesmucet muttered his pet mage lived in a world so abstract things of real value meant nothing to him gently the general commanding explained its the last big barrier in front of marthasville major if we can get across joseph the gamecock will have a hells of a time keeping us out of the city oh all right the sorcerer nodded he wasnt stupidon the contrarybut was as narrowly focused as a good burning glass i suppose that means youll want me to try another masking spell then i did have that in mind yes hesmucet nodded too or anything else that will get us over the hoocheecoocheeim not fussy about how it happens alvas face tightened into the mask of concentration hesmucet had come to know well alva sometimes stayed like that hardly moving hardly even seeming to breathe for a couple of hours at a stretch this time though he came out almost at once to ask you will not want this to be a showy spell am i right showy hesmucet frowned how do you mean a showy spell is something the other side notices alva answered youll want them to notice nothing at all till the knife goes into their back not to have the slightest idea theyre being diddled isnt that how every single masking spell under the sun works hesmucet asked oh no sir major alva sounded shocked he launched into a technical disquisition in which hesmucet found himself following perhaps one word in three he did gather that some masking spells were like lamps shone in the enemys eyes while others hung an opaque curtain between the foe and what he wished to see and still others sought to be transparent he also gathered that the last sort was the hardest to bring off it would be he thought you have it right he told alva when the mage finally ran down i dont want the traitors to have any idea whats going on till its too late for them to do one fornicating thing about it ill see what i can come up with sir like a groundhog slipping back into hibernation alva returned to his trance of study there were other ways besides the sorcerous to keep the northerners from finding out what hesmucet had in mind he didnt entrench up close to the traitors positions but placed pickets well in front of his own lines the enemy wouldnt be able to see how many soldiers he had in place and how many he was using for his casts up and down the hoocheecoochee or how ready his army was to move in a hurry if somehow he managed to find a crossing joseph the gamecock has to be worried he thought he knows the hoocheecoochee is his last strong line as well as i do feints toward the river both north and south kept false king geoffreys unicornriders galloping this way and that they couldnt afford to assume that any move was a feint not here they couldnt they had to take each one seriously hesmucet won approval from one source whose opinion he valueddoubting george said this is all very fine work sir the wider we stretch the traitors the sooner theyll break glad you agree lieutenant general hesmucet told him and glad were working together as well as we are so am i sir george replied only one whod laugh if we pulled opposite ways though is geoffrey there is that hesmucets laugh held little real mirth not that such considerations have stopped a good many other officers from wrangling with one another true enough true enough were a band of brothers is what we areand brothers fight like cats and dogs dont we just hesmucet eyed his secondincommand if you were in joseph the gamecocks boots what would you do about what hes doing george said i dont know what else he could do not with an army barely half the size of ours hes managed to make a nuisance of himself hasnt he yes hesmucet admitted what he could hardly deny gods damn it though we need marthasville king avram needs it the whole kingdom needs it to show were winning the war we go forward doubting george said one lurch at a time we do go forward and marshal bart has duke edward of arlington and the army of southern parthenia pushed a lot farther north in parthenia than they really want to be so he does hesmucet said though the latest i hear is that earl early the jubilant has managed to get loose and come south for an attack on georgetown dyou think he can take the place george asked i doubt it hesmucet answered and his wing commander smiled hesmucet went on have you seen the works around georgetown lieutenant general they make the ones joseph the gamecock has thrown up here look like sand castles by comparison king avram set his artificers to work as soon as the war against geoffrey began and i dont believe theyve slowed down from that day to this no doubt youre right sir but if all the soldiers are up in parthenia with marshal bart doubting georges voice trailed away the best fortress in the world isnt worth a counterfeit copper without some men inside it avram can fill the forts up with clerks from all the georgetown offices and hold off earl early till marshal bart has time to bring some real fighting men down from his own lines hesmucet said with those works even clerks with crossbows would do for a little while heres hoping it doesnt come to that george said and then thoughtfully i wonder what sort of works joseph the gamecock has waiting for us outside of marthasville itself well find out i hope hesmucet smiled a wolfish smile and once we cross the hoocheecoochee all the glideways to the east to dothan and the great river fall into our hands even if we cant break into the city yet thats true i hadnt thought of it quite so but thats true george said and false king geoffrey wont be very happy about it either hesmucet clasped both hands to his breast in false and exaggerated sympathy george laughed out loud too bad my hearts just breaking hesmucet said in syrupy tones george laughed again louder and harder if we do cross the hoocheecoochee he said poor geoffreys going to have kittens so he will hesmucet agreed i told you once what geoffrey calls a kingdom is nothing but two armies and a lot of wind and air once we get over the river well show all of detina how empty the north is may it be so i think it will be so george said well make it so hesmucet said once were over the river joseph the gamecock wont be able to keep us from making it so only trouble is were not over the river yet george said i think alva can let us get men down to it even if we cant manage any other way hesmucet replied and once we reach it well cross it our artificers can throw a bridge over it in a hurry thenhe grinnedwe see what happens next corporal rollant lieutenant griff called yes sir rollant said proudly he was sure he felt better about being promoted to the lowest grade of underofficer than bart did about rising from general to marshal for a blond to get stripes on his sleeve in king avrams army to gain the privilege of giving orders to free detinans take up the standard corporal griff said yes sir rollant repeated even more proudly than before the companys flag and its heavy pole seemed to weigh nothing at all as he lifted them from their stand the soldiers saluted the standard as if worshiping a god and so they are he realized this flag means detina to them and they reverence the kingdom as much as the lion god or the thunderer his mouth quirked up in what wasnt really a grin no matter what it looked like they certainly wouldnt risk their lives to free blonds from theirfrom ourbondage to the land he thought avram hadnt much wanted to fight the northerners over serfdom hed chosen war only when geoffrey tried to set up his own kingdom in the north horns blared form up lieutenant griff screamed the company he led hurried to obey rollant started to go to his own place next to smitty and sergeant joram hed taken that place ever since accepting king avrams silver on enlisting but it wasnt his any more now he belonged at the van of the company so he could use the standard to signal which way the men should go the honor was not unmixed for one thing standardbearers by the nature of their job made prominent targets if the last fellow who carried the flag hadnt got shot on commissioner mountain rollant wouldnt have had it now and for another he felt eyes on him as he took his place alongside griff and the company trumpeter not all of his comrades were happy to see a blond promoted above them too bad rollant thought if theyd wanted to save the standard one of them could have done it himself voice cracking as it often did lieutenant griff said men our companyand colonel nahaths regiment as a wholehave the distinction of probing up towards the hoocheecoochee this is a privilege granted only a few regiments of footsoldiers the unicornriders are doing much more of it but lieutenant general george knows what we can do hes seen us fight by the gods hes fought alongside us on merkles hill by the river of death well show him we deserve this chance hes giving us wont we yes sir the men roared rollant shouted as loud as anybody else he had to for appearances sake but that didnt mean he was excited about getting the chance to try to approach the hoocheecoochee he knew what lieutenant griff meant no matter what the young officer actually said what griff meant was what were going to try probably wont work but it does have a fair chance of getting a lot of us killed he looked toward smitty the farmers son caught his glance shrugged ever so slightly and raised an eyebrow as if to say what can you do smitty had been through a lot he had no more trouble uncovering griffs hidden meaning than rollant did once griff stood aside colonel nahath harangued the whole regiment his speech was smoother and more polished than griffs but amounted to the same thing rollant felt like shrugging too but couldnt not standing out there in front of everybody nahath had got his orders and was having to make the best of them rollant hoped there was a best to be made after the regimental commander stepped back the horns blared again forward lieutenant griff shouted along with all the other men in charge of companies forward his own company went forward rollant went at his head the day was hot and muggy at this season of the year any day in the north of detina was likely to be hot and muggy flies buzzed and bit with the flagstaff in his hands rollant couldnt slap them away so readily as he had had before his new rank and station had some difficulties he hadnt thought about with so much heat and moisture something close to a jungle grew down toward the southern bank of the hoocheecoochee only a few roads ran through the undergrowth hoofprints and unicorn turds warned that the traitors patrolled them regularly rollant wouldnt have wanted to meet unicornriders in such cramped surroundings a squirrel chittered in the branches overhead scolding the marching soldiers a jewelbird glittering green with a ruby head buzzed around rollant and then flew off toward the north the standardbearer turned to lieutenant griff and said sir where i come from wed reckon that was good luck we havent got that superstition in new eborac griff said rollant bristled he didnt think of it as a superstition but then griff softened the comment we havent got that many jewelbirds either too far south and the winters are too cold i know rollant nodded i miss em he didnt miss many things about palmetto province jewelbirds though had never done him any harm back around the serfs huts some people would hang a bowl of molasses and water up at the top of a pole to get them to come and feed there what for griff asked to catch them no sir rollant heard the shock in his own voice catch a jewelbird thatd be about the worst kind of bad luck there is we just liked to have em around on account of theyre pretty we couldnt have much that was pretty but i never heard of a liege lord who minded us drawing jewelbirds to our hutsdidnt cost anything except for the little bit of molasses griff tramped on for a while rollant wondered if hed talked too much or too openly smitty wouldnt have minded his remarks neither would sergeant joram but then the company commander said when you first got to new eborac corporal you must have felt as if youd fallen into some whole new world the biggest city in detina cant be anything like an estate outside karlsburg that was far and away the most perceptive comment rollant had ever heard lieutenant griff make youre right sir the escaped serf said are you ever right when i first came down south i thought i would go clean out of my mind so many people and all of em packed together like olives in a jar but i got used to it and do you know what the best part was i know what it would have been for me griff replied what was it for you nobody could tell me what to do rollant said at once i was on my own id starve if i didnt work hard things werent easy especially at first but i was working for myself not for my godsdamned liege lord when somebody gave me silver i got to keep all of it thats pretty fine again griff marched on for several silent steps again rollant wondered if hed gone too far but the young lieutenant said no wonder youve got stripes on your tunic sleeve and our flag in your hands you sound just like any other free detinan i am just like any other free detinan rollant thought but that was true only in certain ways one way it was untrue was in the eyes of a great many free detinans from south as well as north rollant would have guessed griff to be among that number but he seemed to be mistaken there on trudged the regiment where are the traitors rollant wondered id have thought theydve pitched into us by now lieutenant griffs leer might have come from smitty do you really want them around corporal want them hells no sir but what you want and what you get are two different beasts any serf learned that in a hurry generally about as fast as he learned to walk or talk soldiers got the same lesson but at an older age i wish this country would open out a bit lieutenant griff said that would help us figure out just where we are unless im altogether daft we cant be too far from the hoocheecoochee if it does open out somebody will see us rollant said i dont think i want that a point griff allowed a distinct point i do wish we had better maps though they would tell us a good deal about where we are too now rollant nodded without reservation he tremendously admired maps there was something sorcerous about the way they made paper correspond to landscape by what hed overheard army mages saying there was something sorcerous about them many were made by using the law of similarity and sorcery between map and landscape could also help guide soldiers something crackled in the undergrowth to the side of the road lieutenant griff snatched out his sword what in the hells was that he said his voice breaking like a youths an animali hope rollant took a couple of sidling steps away from the company commander griff carried a sword but he wasnt practiced with it southron officers unlike their counterparts in the traitors armies for the most part werent nobles whod learned swordplay from birth they carried their weapons as much for show as for fightingsome though not griff also bore crossbows with which they were actually dangerous it had better be an animal griff said still brandishing the blade in a way that made rollant nervous if its a godsdamned northern son of a bitch hell bring every traitor in the world down on us rollant wished he could have argued with that but the lieutenant was obviously right the standardbearers head swiveled this way and that an ambush could do gruesome things to the company to the whole regiment and i dont even need a shoot me sign rollant thought im carrying the flag of course theyll try to shoot me he wondered whether getting promoted in exchange for making himself such a prominent target was as good a bargain as hed thought at the time yes becoming a corporal was a great honor for a blond but could he enjoy the honor with a crossbow quarrel through his brisket not likely no yells of alarm rang out from the company ahead nor roaring cries from northern soldiers no bowstrings thrummed no triggers clicked no one yelled false king geoffreys name or shouted provincial prerogative forever except for chirping birds and scolding squirrels the woods remained quiet the only sounds of men were those of footfalls on dirt lieutenant griff sheathed his sword once more must have been a beast after all he said with no small relief yes sir rollant sounded relieved too not least because he no longer ran the risk of being spitted on that long sharp blade a crossbowmans shortsword hung on his own left hip he was no swordsman either hed fought a real swordsmanfought his own liege lord baron ormerod in factin the skirmishes before the battle by the river of death he counted himself lucky to have escaped with his life a commotion came from up ahead and a confused babble of voices it didnt sound like trouble but griff got out his sword again the sense of the cry tore back through the regiment what people were yelling was the river the river the river rollant took up the cry too the river he surged north he wanted to see the hoocheecoochee with his own eyes there it was slowflowing brown perhaps a furlong wide or a little more was it too far south to have crocodiles in it rollant didnt know he also didnt stick a foot into the water not wanting to find out the hard way how do we get across smitty asked hed pushed up with rollant some of us could swim it i supposeif theres nothing in there waiting to get fed i mean i was just thinking the same thing rollant answered i dont know i dont think so but i dont know for certain wouldnt want to find out by getting munched smitty said colonel nahath had some very definite ideas on what to do now that theyd got down to the hoocheecoochee he sent a runner off to the southeast to let doubting george know hed done it and then issued a series of crisp commands form a defensive perimeter men were at the river were going to hold the crossing dig in set up your trenches and breastworks if the traitors want us theyll have to pay for us shouldnt we try to cross the river sir somebody asked we willas soon as the artificers throw a bridge over it the regimental commander said thats what theyre for and when they dohe rubbed his hands together in anticipationwhen they do boys its my considered opinion that weve got joseph the gamecock and the army of franklin good and cornholed what do you think of that rollant whooped and cheered and held the company standard in the crook of his elbow so he could clap his hands the soldiers were making enough noise to draw every traitor for half a mile around but no northerners seemed close enough to hear nahath sent off another messenger in case something happened to the first dirt flew as rollant dug and dug inside of an hour a formidable defensive position took shape all around him let em come now somebody said rollant shook his head he wanted reinforcements to get here first he wasnt afraid of fighting but he wanted to do it on his armys best terms if he possibly could hammers thudded on planks piledrivers drove treetrunks into the muddy bottom of the hoocheecoochee river doubting george watched the bridge snake toward the northern bank only a few yards to go now and the northerners still didnt seem to realize the southron army was about to cross turning to colonel nahath george said your regiments just taken a long step toward winning this war for us good the man from new eborac said anybody wants to know what i think this godsdamned wars already gone on too long and cost too much the sooner we get it over and done with the better off everybody will be cant argue with a single word of that colonel and i dont intend to try george said he peered toward the north bank of the river i wish those engineers would hurry how long can our luck hold back at general hesmucets headquarters clever major alva was probably gnashing his teeth right now the southrons had found a way to go over the hoocheecoochee even without his masking spell no sooner were the words out of georges mouth than an artificer came pelting back across the bridge and said sir its finished would you like to be the first man to cross to the far bank doubting george would have liked nothing better but the northern courtesy with which hed been raised made him shake his head colonel nahath deserves the honor he replied without him it wouldnt be possible thank you sir nahath said youre a gentleman go on george said with a smile more or less sincere go on and be quick before i change my mind i wouldnt blame you if you did colonel nahath said but that didnt stop him from hurrying across the bridge his bootheels thudding on the planks as soon as he got to the end of the timbers he leaped high in the air and came down with both feet on the ground on the north bank of the hoocheecoochee he turned and waved to doubting george after waving back the lieutenant general hurried across the bridge himself hed given nahath the privilege of going first but that didnt mean he despised going second the ground under his feet on the far bank of the river felt no different from that on the side hed just left it felt no different but it was and he knew it so did nahath lets push on toward marthasville sir he said we will with a grin george added or did you mean just the two of us im ready nahath grinned too by the way his narrow face had to twist to accommodate the expression it didnt alight there very often he waved toward the city doesnt look like theres anybody in the way right now to stop us he was right about that but only for a little while some of those sons of bitches in blue would turn upthey always do so well have to bring some company along thats all doubting george waved once more this time back toward the southern bank of the hoocheecoochee colonel nahaths regiment of men from new eborac had earned the right to cross first but a great many other regiments were lined up behind them now once this force got over the river joseph the gamecock would have a hells of a time throwing it back on came the new eborac regiment each company with its standard fluttering at its head one of the standardbearers made george blink he turned to nahath excuse me colonel but did i just see a blond carrying a flag yes sir you did nahath answered thats corporal rollant who earned the spot for himself on commissioner mountain you may remember i brought the question of promoting him to you before i went ahead with it you said he deserved the chance to fail but he hasnt failed yet with his memory jogged doubting george nodded i do recall now thanks he still makes a strange sight though this war has shown us a great many strange sights sir colonel nahath said i think wed better get used to it because the kingdom wont get any less strange in the peace thats coming youre likely right colonel george shook his head no as a matter of fact youre certainly right but im a northern man myself you know and i have to tell you that some things strike me as very strange the first time i see them you asked if rollant was a good fighting man a good soldier nahath replied i told you he was and i meant it he hasnt had much trouble since he got promotedless than i expected if he were an ordinary detinan instead of a blond hed surely be a sergeant by now and he might well be an officer contemplating the blond corporal was quite enough for doubting george at the moment being a conservative had led him to radicalism a step he hadnt planned on taking blonds freed from the land blonds promoted to underofficer blonds who might eventually get promoted further still as he did whenever such notions disturbed him he thought id sooner have that than thekingdom ofdetina torn to pieces it was true were it anything but true he would have been fighting for geoffrey not avram but sometimes as now it was also cold cold comfort he left a solid garrison to protect the bridge then ordered the rest of his force forward toward marthasville as long as he was doing he didnt have to brood and the chief city of peachtree province lay only a few miles away george knew the northerners had a ring of forts around marthasville and entrenchments between those forts but how many men did they have to put into the entrenchments as long as the army of franklin remained on the east bank of the curving hoocheecoochee not many his army didnt meet its first traitors in arms till it had been marching for most of an hour then a couple of unicornriders rode right up to the head of his columnand were promptly captured they were indignant about it when their captors brought them before doubting george one of them demanded what are you sons of bitches doing here youre supposed to be on the other side of the river life is full of surprises george said it isnt fair the second unicornrider said we wouldntve come right on up to you godsdamned bastards if wed known you were southrons you ought to let us go im sure youd do the same for a couple of our men george said the northern unicornriders didnt have the crust to claim they would and to make that convincing george gestured to the men in charge of them take them away and send them south yes sir the grinning guards said they led their glum prisoners back toward the new bridge across the hoocheecoochee an hour or so after that real fighting began geoffreys men turned out to have more than a couple of unicornriders in the neighborhood a squadron galloped through the fields that ran by the road on which the southrons were marching they shot at the men in gray and then galloped off out of range some of doubting georges men shot back one enemy rider tumbled off his mount while a couple of footsoldiers in gray howled when quarrels struck them another couple of squadrons of blueclad men on unicorns got in front of the marching column and tried to stop it by sheer brute force they had a battery of engines with them and flung darts at the southrons from a range longer than that from which georges men could shoot back at them they were very bravea lot of northern soldiers werebut it didnt do them much good george ordered his leading regiments to shift from column into line they swept forward the ends of their line lapped around the unicornriders on either side the northerners had to retreat in a hurry to keep from being surrounded they tried to set up for another stand half a mile farther north but the southrons made them fall back again before theyd shot more than a couple of darts by the time the sun set georges force was almost halfway to marthasville he had a solidly garrisoned supply line leading back to the bridge over the hoocheecoochee and ordered his men to entrench around the camp they made once that was done he told his scryer now put me through to general hesmucet yes sir the scryer said and got out his crystal ball george had already sent a runner back to the commanding general but hadnt spoken with him till now before long hesmucets face appeared in the crystal ball congratulations lieutenant general he said heartily youve stolen a march on joseph the gamecockand youve stolen one on major alva too that did occur to me yes george said with a smile hows he taking it hes disappointed hesmucet answered he was shaping what would have been a really magnificent masking spell and now we dont need it hell just have to learn to live with itpart of growing up you might say yes sir doubting george hadnt thought hesmucet would be angry with him for moving before the planned moment but was glad to be proved right hesmucet put success above method as any good soldier did george said were over the last barrier in front of marthasville now so we are the general commanding agreed and it will be interesting to see what joseph the gamecock does about it he cant very well stay on that side of the river george said if he does we take the city and we smash up his army were liable to do all that even if he pulls back hesmucet replied youve put him in a very nasty position very nasty indeed congratulations lieutenant general thank you sir george said i was wondering what in the hells i would do if i were joseph the gamecock by all the gods ive got no good answers id sure rather be where i am than where he is dont blame you a bit hesmucet said but hes kept his force in being he can still hurt youhe can still hurt all of usif he gets the chance we cant afford to be careless not now not ever doubting george said no not ever hesmucet leaned forward so that he seemed about to step out of the crystal ball and sit down beside george can i tell you a little secret sir youre the one whos in charge here george answered only you know whether you can or notor maybe i ought to say whether you should or not well im going to gods damn it hesmucet bared his teeth in a fierce grin im glad youre the one who found the way over the hoocheecoochee and not say fighting joseph i cant imagine why sir george said deadpan both officers laughed doubting george had no trouble imagining how puffedup and full of himself fighting joseph would have been had he got across the river ahead of every other southron officer he would have started agitating for command over the whole force and would have slandered general hesmucet lieutenant general george and brigadier james the birds eye to anyone who would listen to make sure people listened fighting joseph would have pounded a drum and played a trumpet too what are your plans for tomorrow hesmucet asked sir unless you order me to do something else im going to push on toward marthasville george replied the deeper into joseph the gamecocks rear i get the harder the time hell have doing anything about me thats good hesmucet said thats very good its just what id do in your spot he grinned it made him look surprisingly boyish and if that doesnt prove its good i dont know what would anything else no sir doubting george said all right then general hesmucet nodded to someone george couldnt see his scryer for the crystal ball suddenly became just a ball of glass george got up stretched and nodded he knew what he was supposed to do he knew what he had to do and he thought he could do it for a soldier that was a good feeling but george didnt have such a good feeling the next morning the northerners still had no footsoldiers on this side of the hoocheecoochee to oppose his armys progress but enough unicornriders were in the neighborhood to make real nuisances of themselves they swarmed round the southron footsoldiers like the blond nomads on the steppes far to the east of the great river now and then darting in to shoot flurries of crossbow quarrels at them disciplined volleys from his men knocked a good many traitors out of the saddle and knocked over a good many unicorns as well the white beasts were beautiful seeing them fall and hearing them scream as they were wounded made george wince hardened veteran though he was but the northerners knew they had to slow his men and they did by that time a scryer with a crystal ball or a swiftriding messenger had surely got word back to joseph the gamecock that the southrons were over the hoocheecoochee and threatening as theyd threatened so many times farther south to finish the job of outflanking him cutting him off from marthasville and destroying him it hadnt happened yet this time though doubting george thought this time we just may manage it keep pelting those unicornriders with your bolts he called to his men if we can get ahead of the traitors but brigadier spinners unicornriders understood what he wanted as well as he did himself spinner wasnt ned of the forest a man fighting him didnt always have to look out for an unexpected stroke from a startling direction what false king geoffreys commander of unicornriders did here was unsubtle and obvious that didnt make it ineffective every time georges men had to stop and fight made him fume and curse gods damn it he growled theyre liable to get away again joseph the gamecock couldnt have been more disgusted if hed been pickled in bile hed known the southrons would sooner or later find a way around his position on the east bank of the hoocheecoochee but the report that doubting george had crossed the river still infuriated him for he hadnt expected it to happen nearly as soon as this for a couple of hours after the first word came in that his right flank had been turned hed done his best to believe it was a mistake a scout seeing what he feared he would see regardless of whether or not it was really there but no such luck men in gray really had crossed the river and he would have to respond or see the army of franklin smashed between hammer and anvil men in blue fell back to the western bank of the river marching over the foot bridges his miles of field fortifications had protected glideway carpets transported siege engines and other essentials over yet another bridge the retreat went as smoothly as such things could why not joseph thought bitterly weve had practice falling back when the last man and the last glideway carpet had come over the river joseph turned to his mages and spoke in harsh tones all right gods damn it now make sure the southrons cant follow hard on our heels yes sir the mages chorused and began to incant the bridge over which the glideway carpets had passed was the first to feel their sorcery flames licked along the timbers supporting it with a rending crash it fell into the hoocheecoochee the spell made the timbers keep burning till they were altogether consumed even though they were wet the foot bridges went next their timbers burned as thoroughly as had those of the glideway bridge those timbers rested on stone piers the magic shook the piers back to their constituent stones and scattered those along the bottom of the river that seems to have worked well enough joseph said grudgingly yes sir one of the mages replied the enemy wont be able to use the bridges and hell be hard pressed to get across the river at all hes already across the river gods damn him joseph the gamecock snapped do you think wed be doing this if he werent what i meant sir was joseph cut off the mage if hed had sword in hand he might have used that too i dont care what you meant why didnt any of you wonderful wizards warn me this was about to happen we arent infallible sir the sorcerer said stiffly really i never would have noticed joseph the gamecock said the wizard winced and turned away mounting his unicorn joseph rode up toward the head of the army of franklin a few men snarled at him as he went by he didnt blame them they were free detinans speaking their mind had he been in their place he would have snarled at the commanding general too another unicorn came up alongside of his after he reached the front of the column he made himself turn his head when he saw whod joined him he breathed a silent sigh of relief it was roastbeef william not lieutenant general bell instead of carping at him for retreating again william only asked what are we going to do now sir what weve been doing all along try to hold the southrons out of marthasville joseph answered what hasnt change why hasnt changed how he cursed under his breath how just got harder yes sir roastbeef william said the hoocheecoochee was the last real line we had defending the city i havent given up hope joseph said stubbornly i dont intend to either marthasville has a solid set of forts around it and theres high ground north of goober creek the southrons will have to cross the creek before they attack the city when they do i intend to hit them in the flank itll be the first decent chance ive had to attack since fat mama and i dont intend to let bell take this one away from me roastbeef william stroked his beard a bold plan sirno doubt of that but have we got enough men to put garrisons into the forts around marthasville and to attack the southrons at the same time they outnumber us badly as things are you neednt remind me of that joseph the gamecock said bitterly i think the southrons sow dragons teeth and reap soldiers the way the mad cuss did in the legend but i dont intend to use the army of franklin to hold the forts what then sir william asked raising bushy eyebrows shall we sow dragons teeth of our own or make unicornriders of ghosts and shadows satrap brown commands a militia joseph said the son of a bitch doesnt like me any too bloody well and i mislike him too but i still have the power to impress those men directly into king geoffreys service theyve spent the whole stinking war looking precious in their pretty uniforms and scratching their backsides now its time to find out if they can fight even a little bit roastbeef william looked dubious he looked so very dubious he might have practiced the expression in front of a glass id hate to put them into the line against hesmucets men the southrons are good soldiers gods damn them and theyre veterans theyd go through raw militiamen like a good dose of castor oil i dont intend to put them into the line only into the forts around marthasville joseph the gamecock answered if im going to offer the southrons any kind of resistance at all lieutenant general somebody besides my soldiers has to fill those places yes sir roastbeef william still didnt sound convinced that worried joseph william after all was the man whod written the tactical manual both sides used in this war if he didnt think well of josephs plan it was likely flawed almost pleading joseph said ive got to try something if i dont the southrons will just walk into marthasville we cant have that no we cant william agreed who would have thought three years ago that things could grow so desperate anyone with an ounce of sense might have joseph thought we knew from the start how badly the southrons outweigh us but we were wild to hold on to our provincial prerogatives and so we didnt stop to count the cost when we followed geoffrey and rebelled against king avram were counting the cost now though with every stride his unicorn took marthasville grew nearer it wasnt a great city not compared to new eborac in the south or to old capet here in the north but joseph had been in the field a long time in the field or in small towns marthasvilles hostels and shops and temples made it look very grand indeed a center of civilization in the middle of nowhere hed seen too much nowhere lately he was sick of it he was sick of the whole war had someone given him the chance to go off and sit on the sidelinespromising of course that everything would go well in his absencehe would gladly have taken it the trouble was no one could make promises like that joseph had been trained as a soldier as long as his kingdom needed him his sword remained at its service and if that doesnt make me a loyal northern man gods only know what would ive had nothing but insults and disrespect from king geoffrey theyre all ill ever get as long as he is king but ill put up with them for my kingdom and for my province if i were a private man though id cut the liver out of that godsdamned son of a bitch as often happened a good dose of lese majesty made him feel better he looked back over his shoulder at the men he commanded they knew things werent going any too well no one but an idiot could think that seeing the southrons on this side of the hoocheecoochee was good news still they seemed in good enough spirits if he needed fighting from them he would get all he needed and if i had as many of them as hesmucet has southrons this would be a different war but that reflection wasnt what made joseph the gamecock look straight ahead once more it also wasnt what made him urge his unicorn up to a slightly faster pace along with all his marching men hed spied lieutenant general bell tied onto his unicorn coming up at a trot short of making his own mount gallop joseph couldnt escape bell well your grace his wing commander rumbled what are we going to do now this skedaddle is a disgrace nothing else but a disgrace i say would you sooner have stood your ground with the enemy behind us as well as in front joseph the gamecock demanded nobody would have got back to marthasville in that case they should never have got over the river in the first place bell declared i quite agree joseph said bell blinked well then his voice trailed off unfortunately joseph the gamecock said we have to deal with what did happen not with what should have happened we should have attacked the stinking southrons outside of fat mama but one of our wing commanders saw ghosts in the bushes and got a cold foot and so the attack did not go in now see here sir bell began he being the wing commander in question oh shut up joseph told him when we go into position behind goober creek and when i see what we can do against hesmucet i may decide i want to listen to you again till then no what we can do against hesmucet bell jeered you wont do anything but retreat by the gods sir its all you ever do joseph the gamecock set a hand on the hilt of his sword gentlemen please roastbeef william said edging his unicorn between josephs and bells when we quarrel who gains king avram no one else there is some truth in what you say lieutenant general joseph said somebut not enough not enough indeed bell said we need a man in charge of this army not someone who takes to his heels whenever the enemy comes near they both started reaching for weapons again you were the one who wouldnt go forward when i needed you joseph shouted gentlemen roastbeef william said again i really must insist that you remember we are all on the same side if certain people would act like it joseph the gamecock said yes indeed if only they would lieutenant general bell broke in they glared at each other we must all serve the north william said we can settle our differences once victory is ours until then we have to work together i serve the north by the gods joseph said in fact i daresay my service to the north is more pure more disinterested than that of any other man in the army the kingdom always comes first for me not least because i he broke off because i despise the king might be truein fact certainly was truebut would gain him no points in this argument because i was one of the first men out of detinas old army and into this new one he finished lamely we need a fighter at the head of our force a true battler bell said then wed show the southrons what our army can do and if this army gets that kind of battlerjoseph the gamecock looked hard at bellwhat the southrons will show him is that they have too many men and too many engines to be driven off as easily as he thinks how would you know bell retorted youve only gone backwards you dont know what we can do if we can go forwards yes i do joseph said we can throw the war away if you go forward against a host bigger than your own thats what you do duke edward of arlington would not agree bell sniffed i know duke edward sir we have our differences but i will say that duke edward is a friend of mine joseph the gamecock fixed his unruly wing commander with a steady scornful stare and i will also say one other thing you lieutenant general are no duke edward that got home bell quailed and went red under his swarthy skin using his good arm he jerked his unicorns head away and rode off at something not far from a gallop joseph watched him go with considerable satisfaction roastbeef william looked less happy that wont do us any good sir he said by the lion gods fangs it did me a lot of good joseph said im entitled to vent my spleen now and again too he set a hand on his abdomen he wasnt quite sure whereabouts in there his spleen resided but he was sure it had been well and truly vented somewhere not far ahead lay goober creek if he could get the satrap to use his militiamen in the forts around marthasville that would free up the whole army of franklin to strike at the invaders hesmucet had come a long way hed had a lot of men killed or wounded and was using a lot of them to guard the glideway line back to rising rock that kept his army fed and supplied i can do him quite an injury joseph the gamecock thought i can and by the gods i will vii having crossed the hoocheecoochee rollant had hoped for a sudden triumphant descent on marthasville hed pictured southrons marching through the city in a grand and glorious procession as theyd done in rising rock at the end of the previous summer but what hed pictured didnt happen the traitors army remained between that of general hesmucet and marthasville whenever the southrons sent scouts to probe at the enemys defenses they got a warm reception we ought to be doing more he told smitty one morning as the two of them heated tea over a campfire nothing i can do about itim just an ordinary fellow ordinary as they come smitty answered but now that youre a high and mighty corporal you could probably stroll right up to doubting george or general hesmucet and tell em whats on your mind theyd hop to it i bet its a good thing i already know youre a chucklehead rollant said if i didnt id figure you were trying to get me into trouble youre a blond smitty said how much more trouble do you need and is that water boiling yet rollant looked into the saucepan he was holding over the flames not quite he said and then you know theres a lot of people id want to belt if they went on and on about how im a blond sorry your corporalship sir smitty said his mocking style as often happened making it hard for rollant to tell how serious he was i take it all back youre righthaving yellow hairs no trouble at all for you gods damn it i didnt mean that rollant wondered if hed ever had a day in his whole life go by where being a blond wasnt a trouble in one way or another he didnt think so what i was trying to say was you mostly dont give me trouble on account of what i am if you talk about it i dont mind so much oh smitty thought that over then grinned you say the sweetest things darling he blew rollant a kiss but i bet you tell them to all the detinans that left rollants cheeks hotter than the water which had begun to boil he took the saucepan away from the flames and poured its contents first into smittys mug and then into his own both had ground tea leaves and sugar waiting for the hot water stirring the tea gave rollant an excuse not to do anything else for the next minute or two at last he asked how did you get to be such a nuisance i work hard at it smitty said not without pride just ask my father and my mother and my two older sisters and my older brother if my other older brother was still alive you could ask him too he held up a hasty hand i didnt have anything to do with him dying though it was the coughing fever rollant gallantly tried to get back to talking about what he wanted to talk about we ought to push the traitors harder if they go all the way back into marthasville we ought to lay siege to em if they dont we ought to make em stand and fight instead of sneaking away again didnt your mama ever rap you on the knuckles for being an impatient little brat smitty said were just now getting the whole army not just part of doubting georges wing over the hoocheecoochee joseph the gamecock wrecked all the bridges weve especially got to get one for glideway carpets across the river once that happens i expect we may fight a bit i suppose so rollant said but the more time we spend getting ready the more time the traitors have to dig more trenches of their own whenever we come at the ones theyve dug in they make us pay for it he also ground his teeth when he thought of blond serfs doing the digging for the northern soldiers thats part of the game smitty answered the idea is to get around the bastards flanks and hit em where they arent dug in or else to make them try to hit us when we are dug in instead it would be nice rollant said wistfully it doesnt seem to happen very often though does it he swigged at his tea it would have been better with some spirits poured into it but pried his eyes open even as things were sergeant joram happened to be walking by he glowered down at rollant are you suggesting corporal that the traitors have better officers than we do would he ask me a question like that if i werent a blond such thoughts were never far from rollants mind he looked up at joram and nodded sometimes sergeant otherwise we wouldve licked em already dont you suppose and sometimes were better than they are but not often enough gods damn it he waited for joram to burst like a flung firepot and spill flames everywhere but the sergeant only grunted and kept walking smitty whistled you got away with it he said and i know why its not because joram loves blonds any too well rollant said no of course not smitty agreed as if the idea that anyoneanyone detinan that iscould love blonds too well was too ridiculous to contemplate and so it probably was the farmers son went on you got away with it on account of youre a corporal now if an ordinary soldierme for instancesaid something like that old joramd run over him like a herd of unicorns on account of youre a corporal now all his life rollant had been on the outside looking in as far as status was concerned being born blond would do that in the kingdom of detina joining king avrams army hadnt improved things much a blond who was also a common soldier was at the bottom of two different hierarchies but now he was off the bottom of one of them he had stripes on his sleeve he was the only blond in the whole regiment who did had joram given him the same courtesy he would have given a detinan corporal a corporal whose skin was respectably swarthy whose hair was respectably black by the gods maybe he did rollant said softly no maybes about it smitty declared youre a corporal so youve got it easy you get to tell people to cut firewood and fill canteens you dont have to do it yourself and you dont get the heat people like me do youd have to really make a botch of things to get chewed out maybe rollant said but he wasnt entirely convinced if he made a mistake he suspectedno he was as sure as made no differencehe would lose his rank and become a common soldier again faster than a detinan committing the same blunder standardbearer lieutenant griff called get the flag were going to move out in a few minutes coming sir rollant scrambled to his feet poured the last of the tea down his throat and hurried over to the companys banner he saluted it and put a pinch of earth at the base of the staff as he picked it up it wasnt quite an object of veneration in its own right but it wasnt far removed from being one who could tell for certain after all what was divine and what wasnt having gone through the ritual he took hold of the flag carrying it made him feel stronger and braver than he really was of course carrying it also made him a target were that not true he wouldnt have gained the job since thats the way things work id better be as strong and brave as i can colonel nahaths regimentand several othersstarted moving north a few minutes later the traitors had fled back of goober creek a miserable little stream about halfway between the hoocheecoochee river and marthasville itself joseph the gamecocks men also had unicornriders and raiders afoot still loose in the region between the hoocheecoochee and goober creek they would snipe at general hesmucets men whenever they got a chance the southrons column advanced with scouts on both wings rollant knew that was so but couldnt have proved it himself he couldnt see the front of the column or the rear and he couldnt see very far off to the sides that was partly because nahaths regiment was in the middle of the long file of men in gray and partly because of the choking clouds of red dust the men in front of him had already kicked up the dust got in his eyes it got in his nose and made him sneeze it got in his mouth leaving his teeth and tongue coated in grit it turned his tunic and pantaloons a color halfway between rust and blood it turned his skin the same shade except where rills of sweat ran through and showed what color he was supposed to be lieutenant griff looked as much like a man made of red dust as did rollant when he spat his spittle was brickred he was sweating even harder than rollant but was pretty red under the sweat too lion gods tail tuft its hot he said how does anybody stand this horrible weather year after year sir when i first came down to new eborac from palmetto province i thought id freeze to death every winter rollant answered its all what youre used to i expect hed done harder work than marching in hotter stickier weather than this karlsburg took a back seat to nobody for dreadful summers godsdamned bugs griff slapped at himself but did nothing except raise a puff of dust from his tunic this is a horrible place looks like pretty good farming country to me sir you dont mind my saying so rollant had had to learn how to contradict detinans as a serf in palmetto province he never would have dared do any such thing as a carpenter in new eborac city he had to if he didnt everyone would have cheated him unmercifully even in the army a good many detinans didnt want to hear a blond telling them they were wrong griff took it pretty well he said youd have to have a leather hide and iron muscles to do a proper job of working it maybe rollant hid a grimace his blond ancestors hadnt known about iron theyd used the softer bronze instead detinan swords and armor and ironheaded quarrels along with detinan unicorns and detinan magecraft had cast down the blond kingdoms of the north even now some blonds had a superstitious reverence for iron rollant didnt not in the top part of his mind but he still knew what the strong metal had done to his folk just then lightning smote from a clear blue sky striking the head of the column distant screams came back to rollants ears lieutenant griff cursed theyre playing the thunderers game he growled and where were our mages asleep or else with their thumbs up their arses northern wizards still had the edge on their southron counterparts although king avrams sorcerers were at last gaining the northerners had always had a need for mankilling magic they had to hold their serfs in subjection southron mages helped manufactories make more that didnt prepare them to meet lightnings another crash of thunder as if the detinan god were indeed pounding mortals here below more screams rose from the southrons these louder and closer if the traitors strike us again rollant thought nervously the next bolt would hit right about here he looked up toward the heavens but saw only sun and sky mages made lightning from nothing just putting one foot in front of the other and marching on wasnt easy rollant made himself do it and made himself hold the standard extra high well done corporal lieutenant griff called they cant make us afraid if we dont let them rollant was afraid if griff wasnt rollant thought something had to be wrong with him im not showing it he thought maybe hes just not showing it either men lived behind masks no one wanted to admit he was a coward even to himself and so soldiers who would sooner have run away went into battle without a murmur when the next lightning bolt crashed down rollant did flinch he couldnt help himself he noticed lieutenant griff drawing into himself too which helped make him feel better this bolt didnt land in the roadway and on the southron soldiers it came down wide to the right and raised a great cloud of dust and fountain of earth in a roadside field well well griff said with a certain sardonic glee the mages on our side really arent all asleep who would have thought it more thunderbolts smote the advancing column almost all of them after the first pair missed but one or two more did strike home the southrons who werent killed outright cried their misery to the uncaring sky healers ran over to them to do what they could the trouble as rollant knew only too well was that healers couldnt do very much a wounded man was only a little more likely to die without treatment as he was after the healers got their hands on him rollant wished he hadnt thought of that he wished he hadnt had to think of that then he marched past some of the men one of those first two levinbolts had struck the smell of charred meat was thick in the air had that been meat of a different sort his mouth might have watered as things were his stomach heaved he had to fight a lonely battle to keep from puking not all the men the sorcerous lightning had struck were dead a healer gave a dreadfully burned fellow laudanum killing pain healers could do even if they also often killed patients not far ahead lay marthasville rollant couldnt see it now not with all the dust in the air but he had seen it and it remained distinct in his minds eye even if invisible to those of his body he knew what it meant a real victory over the traitors a burning brand tossed onto the funeral pyre of their hopes let us into marthasville he thought and how can the north call itself a kingdom but the southrons werent there yet theyd crossed the hoocheecoochee the last great natural barrier before the city still joseph the gamecocks army remained in front of them and as rollant had seen remained full of fight nothing in this war had come easy up till now rollant didnt suppose anything would be easy from here on out either lieutenant general george said well sir things may be starting to run our way at last he spoke with some bemusement there had been more than a few times when hed wondered if he would ever be able to say such a thing hesmucet nodded the lovely thing about finally being over the hoocheecoochee is that we dont even have to attack marthasville to make king geoffrey pitch a fit i hadnt thought about that when we set out on this campaign but its true doubting george admitted well nobody could see just how things would go when we set out hesmucet said generously but here we are and we can cause the northerners almost as much trouble by cutting off their glideway traffic toward the east as we can by taking marthasville away from them and if they shift men to try to stop us how can they keep on covering the city to the hells with me if i know doubting george clapped his hands congratulations sir youve wrapped up the whole campaign and tied a fancy ribbon around it hesmucet laughed wouldnt it be fine if things were as easy in the field as they are when we talk about them i could wish that were so but i know well enough that it isnt im glad to hear it george said and meant every word generals who build castles in the air commonly have them knocked down around their ears thats what happened to guildenstern by the river of death he was so sure the northerners were running away from us he didnt take the precautions he should have on the off chance he was wrong i dont envy his fate hesmucet said who would george replied going out to the steppes to fight the blond savages is hard duty any time but its ten times as hard when weve got ourselves a real war here when the real war here was over a lot of men with brevet ranks of brigadier and even lieutenant general would go back to being captains theyd go back to chasing fleabitten blond savages too most of the time that was what the detinan army did georges own permanent rank was brigadier he wouldnt have to spend endless years trotting across the steppe on unicornback hed done plenty of that before this war he wouldnt be sorry not to do it again though sitting behind a desk in georgetown and drafting reports no one would ever read also struck him as imperfectly attractive hesmucets thoughts had gone along a different glideway if you ask me he said were going to have to kill off all the blond nomads on the steppe were stronger than they are we cant do anything useful with them and theyre too stupid and too stubborn to know when theyre beaten once we empty the steppe of them we can fill the land with good detinan farmers wholl do something useful with it with a smile doubting george said youre solving all the kingdoms problems this morning arent you sir gods damn it thats what a commanding general is for hesmucet declared to georges relief he was also smiling a commanding general who took such boasts seriously was a disaster waiting to happen as the unhappy guildenstern could attest hesmucet went on ill want you to move your wing north and east lieutenant general to put it in position to harry the glideway lines leading east yes sir george said shall i set them in motion right away or do i have some time to prepare first you have a few days hesmucet replied im still getting all my ducks in a row now that everybodys on this side of the hoocheecoochee i dont want anything to go wrong on account of my carelessness general guildenstern would never have said anything like that if you worry about it sir its not likely to happen doubting george said tell me when you need me to be ready to move and i will be i know hesmucet said i can rely on you he nodded touched a forefinger to the front brim of his gray felt hat in what wasnt quite a salute and walked away doubting george stared after him it wasnt that the commanding general was wrong george knew he would try to do exactly what hesmucet required of him but in a lot of armies on both sides in this war that would have been a very strange thing plenty of wing commanders were at their superiors throats wanting to lead armies themselves some of them went so far as to disobey and undercut army commanders regardless of what that did to campaigns fighting joseph would undercut hesmucet in a heartbeat george thought in half a heartbeat so why not me the answer to that was obvious because were winning by doing what were doing with hesmucet in command fighting joseph wouldnt care about that i do he called colonel andy and said were going to be moving north and east before long to cut the glideway links with the eastern part of what geoffrey calls his kingdom draft the necessary orders for the move for my approval yes sir his adjutant said so theres not going to be any direct attack on marthasville then not right away anyhow george answered general hesmucet feels we can do the traitors about as much harm by cutting these links as we could by taking the city i think hes right parthenia draws men and food from the east and duke edwards army will suffer because those supplies cant come through i hope thats so sir andy said it still seems strange to me though to have come all this way to marthasville and then not to try to take the place oh i dont doubt that we will try to take it doubting george said but we can do this more easilyand once weve done it joseph the gamecock will have to respond in one way or another maybe well be able to meet his army outside of its entrenchments that would give us a better chance of licking it once for all yes sir his adjutant said again what shall i make the effective date of these orders when will we be moving out i dont know precisely because general hesmucet didnt know precisely george replied do you think we can be ready to move in three days time i certainly do sir colonel andy said all right thenmake that the effective date george said im pretty sure we wont have to move sooner and if we arent ordered out till later we can just delay day by day as necessary yes sir andy repeated that makes good sense im sorry colonel george told him ill try not to let it happen again colonel andy opened his mouth closed it and shook his head he walked off without saying anything george smiled at his retreating back he knew his occasional fits of whimsy not only perplexed but also alarmed his adjutant as befitted an aide andy was nothing if not serious george was serious when he had to be and when he felt like it there were times when he didntand being a general he could get away with indulging himself now and again raiders from the northern forces still operated on this side of goober creek snipers with powerful crossbowsnot the quickcocking kind most footsoldiers carried but bigger heavier weapons that used either a crank or a foot pedal to draw the bow and that shot correspondingly farther than an ordinary crossbowtook a steady toll on his men and brigadier spinners unicornriders did their best to disrupt the flow of supplies from rising rock up to general hesmucets army they didnt have an easy time of it hesmucet had assembled what was without a doubt the best set of military artificers doubting george had ever seen when joseph the gamecock retreated over the hoocheecoochee river hed naturally knocked down all the bridges spanning the stream including the one that had carried glideway carpets counting its approaches that one was three hundred yards long and thirty yards high at its highest point over the hoocheecoochee hesmucets artificerswith some help from colonel phineas sorcerershad taken four and a half days to recreate the span and all the timber they used was live trees when they started the job against men of such talents even the most diligent destroyers had their work cut out for them and the southrons kept brigadier spinners unicornriders too busy to let them attack the glideway line up to rising rock as diligently as they would have liked ned of the forest might have done better doubting george like every other southron general had developed a fearful respect for the untutored almost unlettered northern commander of unicornriders but ned was off by the great river and he was too busy to turn his ferocious attention to that lonely glideway line snaking up from the south contemplating that george said do you know colonel im vain enough to think i can stand up against anybody as a tactician i should hope so sir andy replied youve earned the right george nodded i expect i have but i will say this as well general hesmucet is the best strategist ive ever seen and i take my hat off to him for it taking himself literally he doffed his gray chapeau his adjutant frowned how do you mean sir he goes on throwing enough distractions at ned of the forest over in the east to keep ned from coming this way and playing merry hells with our glideway george said thats a long reach of thought well what if it is colonel andy said im sure it would have come to you too im not doubting george said not by any means maybe that means marshal bart did the right thing in making hesmucet commander here in the east and not me he thought and grimaced what a depressing notion sir andy said just remember this if it werent for you this army wouldnt be here today this army probably wouldnt be anywhere at all today because the traitors would have smashed it to pieces by the river of death oh i think the men i was in charge of then had a little something to do with that too doubting george said dryly general guildenstern was in charge of good men too and they ran back towards rising rock just as fast as they could go andy said that wasnt fair count thraxton had ensorceled guildenstern so that he gave precisely the wrong order at precisely the wrong time it was one of the very few times in the whole war that thraxton the braggarts sorcery had done what he wanted it to do lieutenant general george knew as much he smiled anyhow remembering a colleagues embarrassment went a long way toward cheering him up andy went on and this wing of the army has done more hard fighting since we came north than any of the others it is the biggest wing you know even so his adjutant insisted and its the biggest wing because youre the best commander general hesmucet has doubting george considered the competition james the birds eye was a comer no doubt about it but hadnt had nearly georges experience leading large numbers of men fighting joseph george shook his head he didnt want to consider fighting joseph all right maybe i am the best commander general hesmucet has he thought but that doesnt mean im better than hesmucet himself and thats what i want to be he brought his thoughts back to the essential business of winning the war standing outside his pavilion he could see marthasville he could all but reach out and touch marthasville we just have to stretch things out he murmured sir colonel andy said joseph the gamecock hasnt got enough men george said if we make him do too many things at once he wont be able to manage all of them may you finally be right sir andy said weve been saying since the start of the campaign that if we did this that or the other thing joseph the gamecocks army would break to pieces like a pot made of clay weve been saying it and saying it but it hasnt happened yet well well lieutenant general george eyed his adjutant in surprise and here im the fellow with the reputation for doubting ive earned it too i must say have you caught the disease from me my dear colonel in this cursed northern heat a man can catch any disease under the sun colonel andy replied the healers mostly dont know how to cure them either why shouldnt i catch doubt along with everything else ill tell you why george replied because this time we really are going to lick the traitors right out of their boots thats why one of the things that has made this campaign so hard is that joseph the gamecock has always had room to maneuver room to retreat he doesnt any more not if he wants to hold on to marthasville all the chances for maneuvering work for us now i told you sir may it work out as you say colonel andy still looked glum but what do you want to bet that something will keep us from making the move to the northeast that general hesmucet has ordered from us i cant imagine what that would be george said i cant imagine what it would be either his adjutant said but weve already seen a lot of unimaginable things in this campaign what are a few more george would have been happier had he had a ready answer for that but he didnt and he knew it joseph the gamecock eyed his wing commanders gentlemen the thing we need most in all the world right now it seems to me is room to maneuver another fancy way to talk about retreat lieutenant general bell muttered joseph didnt think he was supposed to hear but he did here though bell wasnt the only discontented officer he had roastbeef william clucked and said sir i dont see how we can get room to maneuver without moving away from marthasville and holding marthasville is the point of the exercise we can hold marthasville with duke browns militiamen joseph said the satraps men are starting to come into the forts around the city hesmucet has real soldiers with him roastbeef william said glumly theyll go through raw militiamen quick as boiled asparagus feeling about ready to burst from frustration joseph rounded on his third and newest wing commander and demanded how say you brigadier alexander i want to strike the enemy a blow as we all do old straight replied but i dont want to uncover marthasville to do it my opinion is we would do best to fight close to the city but staying close to marthasville with our whole force means the southrons can maneuver as they please while were trapped here joseph protested they can swing all the way around the city and surround us by the gods and in doing so they will weaken themselves and we can attack bell said i am looking for the chance to attack joseph the gamecock said holding the city with the militia will give us that chance what does king geoffrey think of this plan william asked it appalls him lieutenant general bell replied how do you know that joseph inquired instead of answering bell took a swig of laudanum joseph the gamecock went on i still think we can bring it off and i still think it would be good for our strategic position if we did and so gentlemen i want you to be prepared to move north and west of marthasville whenever i give the order it is another retreat bell groaned i knew it by the thunderers prong sir youre abandoning marthasville to the tender mercies of hesmucet and his stinking southrons i dont care to be a part of any such maneuver i think its extremely illadvisedand thats the best thing i can say about it with all respect sir roastbeef william told joseph i must say that in this instance i agree with lieutenant general bell hed never said anything like that before hearing it from him infuriated joseph eyes and voice deadly cold he demanded are you refusing my orders lieutenant general i thought you of all people understood subordination i do sir i refuse you nothing roastbeef william said unhappily but i do not refuse you my opinion either and my opinion is and remains that we would do better to fight around marthasville very well joseph the gamecock said it wasnt very well it was nowhere close to very well but roastbeef william had indeed spoken respectfully and it was indeed part of a subordinates duty to give his superior his unvarnished views fuming still joseph rounded on alexander the steward will you follow me without carping brigadier certainly sir if you require it old straight replied i would be lying though if i said i liked your plan well what else can we do joseph the gamecock asked aiming the question as much at malicious fate as at his wing commanders if we stay here and let hesmucet maneuver as he pleases we are liable to lose not just marthasville but the whole army of franklin we need to attack bell insisted you keep saying that like a parrot trained to do it in the hope of getting a sunflower seed joseph said as bell glared at him he went on well pretty poll i have news for you when the enemys army is twice the size of your own you had better have a godsdamned strong position before you go and bite him on the leg if you dont attack what point to having an army at all bell asked have you ever heard of defending joseph the gamecock said indeed sir bell nodded you have defended peachtree province so well the whole southern half of it no longer needs to be defended at all if youd thrown the army away as you always seem to want to do we wouldnt still hold marthasville joseph said you always think we will lose if we attack bell retorted if we attack and win we hurl the southrons back and we go forward trueif joseph the gamecock agreed long odds though when were so outnumbered thats what you keep refusing to see theyre only southrons bell said contemptuously we can lick as many of them as we need to lick it isnt so roastbeef william said i must tell you lieutenant general that is not so they are detinans too we have the advantage over them perhaps but not to the degree you imply if it were so joseph added we could have won this war a long time ago it lacks a good deal of being won right now or else ive been living a nightmare for the past three years and more if we have the advantage over them why are we running away bell asked by the gods you hardheaded jackass we are not running away joseph the gamecock ground out were looking for room to maneuver weve been looking for room to maneuver ever since borders bell said when you had it you didnt use it now that you havent got it any more you want it that is uncalled for roastbeef william said this whole campaign such as it is is uncalled for lieutenant general bell said you have obstructed me every step of the way joseph said furiously if this army is having difficulties they are at least halfat least half sirof your making for you to blame me now is like is like i dont know what its like but i know its vile if the stone that smashed your leg had smashed your miserable rock of a head in its place this army would be better off today sir that is also uncalled for william said and alexander the steward nodded i see joseph said its fine for him to insult me and revile me but im a wicked monster if i pay him back in the same coin ah yes yes indeed that makes perfect sense something close to desperation in his voice roastbeef william said quarrels only help the enemy sir they can afford them because they outnumber us we can afford nothing at all joseph was too angry to be placated so easily oh of course we can just ask him he pointed to bell we can afford to charge right out and attack the southrons and five minutes later theyll all be skedaddling for the highlow river just as fast as they can wont it be wonderful bell had faced a lot of nasty weapons in this war but he didnt stand up to sarcasm very well thats not what i said he protested his voice breaking like a youths no eh joseph said it must be what you meant though unless we win a victory like that whats the point of attacking hesmucet at all you deliberately twist all my words bell said you deliberately twist all my deeds joseph the gamecock answered bell started to say something but joseph forestalled him get out of my sight you make me sick sir alexander the steward began but joseph had no patience for old straight either and you he said king geoffrey gave me this command to save his kingdom by the thunderers brass balls im going to do it tooas long as nobody gets in my way i am sick to death of people telling me what i can do and what i cant i command here and my orders shall be obeyed or ill know the reason why have you got that yes sir brigadier alexander said you would sooner do it your way than do it right if i understand you correctly maybe hed thought he would shame joseph the gamecock maybe he would have too at another time not now now joseph just nodded thats exactly right brigadier im going to do it my way and ill take my chances you are dismissed he nodded to roastbeef william you too he could get rid of his wing commanders but that didnt bring him the satisfaction he craved hed hardly got back to the house he was using for a headquarters before a sentry stuck his head in to say sir count thraxton has ridden down from marthasville hed speak to you if you would count thraxton joseph said what does he want im sure i dont know sir the sentry answered will you see him or shall i send him away ill see him joseph had no more desire to see thraxton than he did some demon from one of the seven hells as a matter of fact there had been times during the war when hed wondered if the braggart was a demon from one of the seven hells but he couldnt send the man away not when thraxton served as king geoffreys eyes and ears in peachtree province count thraxton the sentry announced in a loud voice holding open the farmhouse door your grace joseph the gamecock murmured bowing to the general whod commanded the army of franklin before him your grace thraxton the braggart replied returning the bow thraxton was tall and lean and sallow with a face as mournful as a bloodhounds though much bonier a grizzled beard covered hollow cheeks sad eyes peered out from beneath a bramble patch of eyebrows if hed ever been happy in all his days he hadnt bothered telling his face about it joseph waved him to a chair sit down your grace please he didnt like having thraxton looming over him like a bad omen the braggart folded up one section at a time as he sat joseph stayed on his feet pacing back and forth as he asked what can i do for you today general i have come to tell you sir that king geoffrey is not pleased with your plan to man the forts around marthasville with satrap browns militiamen and to move the army of franklin away from the city thraxton replied im sorry to hear that joseph the gamecock said why does he object to it his majestys view if i may speak frankly thraxton waited for joseph to nod joseph refused to give him the satisfaction thraxton coughed a couple of timeswet almost consumptive coughsand went on his majesty is concerned that you intend to retreat away from marthasville and to leave the place undefended against the southrons that is insupportable both politically and militarily in the first place hes wrong and in the second place hes wrong joseph said if i put my own men in the forts how can i possibly hope to attack the southrons with my own force and nothing more i can defend but i cant hope to attack king geoffrey is less certain of this than you are thraxton declared well bully for him joseph said acidly im here and hes over in bloody nonesuch which of us is likely to know better what this army is good for and what it isnt do you suppose his majesty has other sources of information besides yourself thraxtons tone was opaque oracular someones been telling tales out of school was what the braggart had to mean as soon as the words were out of thraxtons mouth joseph the gamecock could make a pretty good guess who that someone was too gods damn lieutenant general bell to the nastiest hell there is he growled i dont know what youre talking about count thraxton said which was a lie and a lie made all the more annoying because it was so obvious oh ill just bet you dont joseph said thraxtons narrow shoulders went up and down in a shrug he had to be dead to shamehe didnt even care if he got caught out its beside the point in any case he said here is the point will you take his majestys advice on how to defend marthasville or will you not did he set me over the army of franklin or is he in command of it himself joseph asked you command the army thraxton the braggart answered and a twist of his thin lips showed how much he wished he still commanded it himself you command the army but geoffrey rules the kingdom fine joseph the gamecock said let him rule the kingdom then and i promise not to tell him how to do itso long as he doesnt tell me how to command the army seems a fair enough bargain to me count thraxtons lips got even thinner and even paler joseph hadnt thought they could i doubt king geoffrey will care for the joke your grace thraxton said in frigid tones i wasnt joking joseph said what a pity count thraxton replied lieutenant general bell had just taken a long grateful gulp of laudanum when his aidedecamp stuck his head into his farmhouse headquarters bell was anything but glad to see major zibeon hed gone too long without the drug since his quarrel with joseph the gamecock his nerves were jangling not only from the agony of his wounds but from craving for the potent tonic that salved him his voice had a bark in it as he demanded what now sir count thraxton would speak with you zibeon replied thraxton bell said and the junior officer nodded part of bell wished hed waited a little longer to take the laudanum if he was going to talk with king geoffreys friendto say nothing of the kings snoop here in peachtree provincehe should have had wits as clear as he could make them but no help for that now clear wits or not he had to see thraxton send him in good day lieutenant general thraxton said his tone and expression suggesting that all good days were no more than figments of other mens imaginations i have just come from speaking with count joseph his voice got even chillier no mean feat good day your grace bell said is he ever going to use this army of ours or is he just going to keep running with it ah thraxton leaned forward markedly so you would fight the southrons then if the army of franklin were in your hands i sure would sir bells wits were clear enough to leave him with no doubts on that score we could whip those sons of bitches if the men only had the chance to do it you think so do you thraxton said sir im sure of it bell replied this is what i had hoped to hear from joseph the gamecock thraxton the braggart said it is what king geoffrey has been hoping to hear from joseph through this whole campaign he has not heard it i did not hear it that being so i am authorized to remove count joseph from his command here and bell could say no more than that and even the one word came out as a breathy whisper and thraxton continued sourly to offer the said command to you lieutenant general should you prove willing to accept it for a moment bell thought the laudanum had taken effect all at once instead of gradually as it usually did then he realized joy could bring a feeling as intense as distillate of poppy juice your grace he said you and his majesty honor me far beyond my deserts we had better not count thraxton answered the kingdom needs you to go forward and beat the southrons we cannot afford delaywe have had altogether too much of delayand we cannot afford defeat you may rely on me and on my brave men sir bell said i do lieutenant general the kingdom does thraxton the braggart replied it is late in the day i know to make this change but king geoffrey decided it must be made he sends you his wishes for good fortune and for a fresh start in driving the noxious foe from our soil when he said fresh start he hesitated as if the words tasted bad and when he said them bell saw why he himself had the command and thraxton did not thraxton had already failed with the army of franklin hed proved he did not have good fortune maybe bell would show he did for the kingdom sir i will go forward bell declared have you yet told joseph the gamecock he is removed thraxton shook his head i have not i wanted to be certain you would accept the command before announcing the change i am glad to accept proud to accept bell said truly this is a great day he could feel the laudanum now as it worked its familiar magic building a wall between his mind and spirits and the ravaged body that had to serve them but even though the laudanum usually dulled his feelings as well as his feeling joy still blazed in his heart an enormous bonfire of delight may it be so count thraxton didnt sound as if he believed it he didnt sound as if he believed anything hes old and worn out bell thought king geoffrey is right to leave him on the sidelines the braggart went on now that you have accepted your new post shall we give count joseph the news a certain gloating anticipation suffused his voice he doesnt like joseph the gamecock either bell realized nobody likes joseph the gamecock king geoffrey surely doesnt but then nobody save king geoffrey liked count thraxton either yes lets bell hitched his slow way out of the farmhouse thraxton held the door wide for him thanks bell said my pleasure thraxton replied though his voice suggested that whatever he knew of pleasure came by hearsay major zibeon bell called when his aidedecamp appeared he said fetch my unicorn if youd be so kind i have a call to pay on joseph the gamecock zibeons eyebrows rose is it that kind of call sir it is indeed that kind of call bell answered jubilantly by the gods major the southrons have seen the backs of the army of franklin for the last time congratulations sir his aidedecamp said may everything turn out as well as we hope a worthy prayer bell said may the gods hear it zibeon hurried away he returned in short order with bells unicorn even with laudanum coursing through bell mounting was a painful business having his aidedecamp strap him to the beast so he could stay in the saddle was also a humiliation of sorts but count thraxton said your courage does you credit and lieutenant general bell felt better dismounting from the unicorn in front of joseph the gamecocks headquarters was harder than getting aboard had been but bell managed before he and count thraxton could go in count joseph came out he was half a head shorter than either of the men coming to call on him but in such a transport of fury that he seemed to tower over them you son of a bitch you son of a bitch bastard he snarled at thraxton gods damn you to the hells and gone youre here to take my job away arent you your grace king geoffrey has authorized me to relieve you of command of the army of franklin thraxton replied after discussing the matter with him at length i am utilizing that authorization whos in command joseph asked you gods help the kingdom if thats so you won one battle your whole stinking career and you futtered that one away afterwards count thraxtons sallow face darkened with anger your successor will be lieutenant general bell here joseph the gamecock pointed a finger at bell i know what youre going to do i know just what youre going to do youre going to take this army and throw it right at the southrons its about time someone got some use out of it wouldnt you say bell returned the men will enjoy going forward instead of back i know the other thing youre going to do too joseph said youre going to throw this army away you cant lick hesmucet by slugging toe to toe with him you havent got the men for it if i dont come out and fight marthasville will fall bell said the kingdom cant have that and the kingdom wont have it either i can drive the southrons back and i will do it thraxton the braggart nodded approval this is the spirit on account of which king geoffrey chose the brilliant bell as your successor your grace he told joseph if he wants spirits let him go to a tavern joseph the gamecock snapped shall i give you a formal written order to turn command of this army over to lieutenant general bell thraxton asked dont bother wasting the time youve told me i believe you joseph said gods help our kingdombut if the gods were paying any attention to us they wouldnt have let that idiot of a geoffrey put this idiot of a bell in charge of whats been a perfectly good army up till now in spite of the laudanum coursing through him bell glared at joseph now see here sir oh shut up joseph told him you cant help being an idiot youre a brave man and you think thats all there is to being a general you make a firstrate brigade commander because then someone with a working brain points you at the enemy and turns you loose of course you try to smash everything thats right in front of you but for maneuver and coordination and sniffing out what the foe intends he shook his head you havent a clue and you havent a prayer you are dismissed from this encampment general bell said through clenched teeth if i see you around my army after today i will kill you on sight joseph the gamecock bowed always the man of simpleand simplemindedsolutions you need not fear believe me i want to stay around here no more than you want me in these parts do you suppose i want to stay close by while you take the army i built back up after thraxton here ruined it and go out and wreck it again im going up to dicon to wait and see if geoffrey ever decides he needs to pull me off the shelf again he turned his back and strode into the farmhouse slamming the door behind him graceless lout count thraxton muttered hes retreating again thats all bell looked around at the great expanses of tents so this is my army now is it it is indeed thraxton replied if i may make a suggestion your first order of business should be naming a wing commander to take your own place bell didnt want anyone making suggestions now that the army of franklin belonged to him but he had to admit that thraxtons made sense after a little thoughthe would be giving the orders now so who obeyed them didnt matter so much to himhe said brigadier benjamin should do the job well enough there are a couple of officers by that name in this army count thraxton remarked which of them did you have in mind benjamin the heated ham folks call him on account of what a bad actor he was in the plays at the military collegium at annasville bell answered hes served under me through this whole campaign and done right well do you know him i do thraxtons face froze always doleful he now looked as if his entire family were being massacred in front of his eyes the gentleman in question and i have been known to disagree since thraxton the braggart had been known to disagree with everyone whod ever had anything to do with himwith the sole and vital exception of king geoffreybell didnt take that too much to heart ill make the appointment anyhow i think he said hes brave and hes steady and hell follow orders you are the commander you must have the subordinates who suit you now thraxton looked as if his wife were being ravished before getting the coup de grace but he didnt say no and that was all that really mattered to bell bowing the braggart went on now that we have effected the change i shall withdraw you know what his majesty expects of you gods grant that you deliver it thank you sir bell said he dipped his head instead of bowing on two crutches and one leg the latter was too awkward and painful to contemplate as count thraxton mounted his unicorn bell looked around and called runners sir they hurried up and saluted as they came to attention before him you he pointed at one fetch me roastbeef william and you he pointed to a second get me alexander the steward and you this to a third order benjamin the heated ham to report here at once yes sir the three men hed chosen saluted again and hurried away when he called they came when he pointed they went the power was as heady as laudanum once his wing commanders had all come to the headquarters formerly belonging to joseph the gamecock bell spoke without preamble gentlemen king geoffrey has removed count joseph from command over the army of franklin and set me in his place congratulations sir roastbeef william said he was a reliable old war unicorn and would serve well under whoever commanded him congratulations indeed alexander the steward echoed old straight was reliable too however much bell disliked joseph hed picked a fine replacement for the late unlucky leonidas the priest as my first act in command bell went on i am pleased to appoint brigadier benjamin here to take my place as wing commander thank you very much sir benjamin murmured ill do my best to live up to your bold example he still had a tendency to overact since he was flattering bell the new commander of the army of franklin didnt take it amiss as if on cue roastbeef william asked and what will your second act in command be sir bell gave a oneword answer attack general hesmucet eyed the northern prisoner a thin dirty man in ragged blue tunic and pantaloons this had better be the truth from you he growled if youre lying youll end up wishing for the seven hells before you go to em so help me gods the prisoner said its like i told that other southron bastardjoseph the gamecocks out and bells in sure as im standing here well well hesmucet whistled softly thats big news if its true he turned to the southrons who had charge of the prisoner keep him by himself hang on to him if he turns out to be telling the truth well let him loose if hes lying he slashed his thumb across his throat yes sir the guards chorused one of them gave the prisoner a shove come on you you heard the general later that day a man who still favored king avram and a united detina sneaked out of marthasville and past the traitors lines he not only brought the same news as the prisoner but had a paper to prove it hesmucet read joseph the gamecocks farewell order to the army of franklin and that of lieutenant general bell on assuming command well well hesmucet said again and nodded to his spy thanks very much this is worth a good deal to me the man eyed him i thought youd be more excited about the news who me no i dont get very excited hesmucet answereda great thumping lie if ever there was one but he didnt want to discourage the northerner from bringing more news either if he got it ill pay you twentyin silver that made the fellows eyes glowreal money was in short supply in king geoffreys dominions which were trying to get by with printed paper and were watching prices soar up and up as a result hesmucet scribbled a note on a scrap of paper take this to the paymaster and hell see to it thank you kindly sir courtly as most northerners the spy bowed before going on his way hesmucet touched a forefinger to the brim of his hat in reply calling for runners he ordered them to summon his wing commanders to his headquarters when they got there he waved the paper at them and said geoffreys sacked joseph the gamecock and put bell in his place i doubted even geoffrey would be such a fool lieutenant general george said fighting joseph beamed at the prospect of no longer moving against his namesake now maybe the traitors wont scuttle from one line of trenches to the next he said i want to come to grips with them the last time you came to grips with them it was at viziersville and duke edward tore you to pieces hesmucet thought he glanced toward his youngest wing commander you were at annasville with bell werent you brigadier yes sir james the birds eye replied i think fighting josephs right this time that made fighting joseph preen as hesmucet had known it would james went on bell is courageous in the extreme no one could ever doubt that if he werent doubting george said he wouldnt keep leaving pieces of himself on one battlefield or another eryes james coughed then went on hes also as bold as you please bold to the point of rashness hesmucet grunted that matches what ive heard about the man myself so what do you think it means that false king geoffreys removed joseph the gamecock and put bell in charge of the traitors army a fight the three wing commanders might have been singing in a chorus i agree hesmucet said joseph sparred with us and held us off and stalled as best he could and weve made it up to marthasville anyhow unless i miss my guess altogether geoffrey thinks bell can drive us away proves hes a fool george said we need to warn all our brigade commanders to be ready for anything the traitors may throw at us hesmucet said fighting joseph struck a pose we can lick them for the sake of the army for the sake of the kingdom we shall lick them of course well lick them hesmucet said if bell thinks he can dislodge us hes foolish or desperate or both but he has a better chance if he catches us by surprise and so the warnings will go out he gave his unruly wing commander a hard stare i trust you dont object oh no sir you go right ahead fighting josephs invincible selfregard armored him against sarcasm anything else gentlemen general hesmucet asked no one said anything hesmucet nodded all right then youre dismissedand do spread the word to your brigade commanders brigadier james please stay a bit if youd be so kind certainly sir james the birds eye replied what have you got in mind lets take a look at the map and ill show you hesmucet answered he drew his sword to point at the large map spread out on a table youre already on our left wing farther north and farther west than any of our other formations yes sir james grinned i like to be at the edge of thingsthe cutting edge of things you might say he set a hand on the hilt of his own sword hesmucet smiled too i know thats why ive used your wing so often to flank the traitors out of their positions i want you to make whats more or less another flanking move over to your left again so that you seize the glideway coming into marthasville from julia do you think you can do it i expect i can sir the young wing commander answered only problem i see with the move is that its liable to open a gap between my men and fighting josephs do we want to do that when the northerners have a new commander whos going to be looking for a chance to attack hells yes we do hesmucet answered without the least hesitation the faster bell comes out of his trenches and fights if thats what he intends to do the happier ill be ill give him bait if hes fool enough to take it ah james the birds eye nodded fair enough sir he eyed the map again then said there is one other drawback to this you know oh certainly i see it too hesmucet said he can concentrate his men wherever he does decide to attack which makes him stronger there than we are yes sir thats what i meant james said thought so hesmucet said but the other side of that coin is hes weakening himself along every other part of his line and he wont be the only one doing the attacking well keep him busy i promise you good sir i expected as much james the birds eye grinned which made him look even younger than he really was he was tall and handsome and brave too hesmucet not far past forty himself felt positively decrepit when he considered his dashing wing commander whatever they do sir well deal with them james promised thats what were here for hesmucet said they had their chance after the battle by the river of death they had it and they bungled it now its our turnand by the gods i dont think they can stop us after james the birds eye had left hesmucet went out of his headquarters and stared north toward marthasville he could see the city clearly he could also see the traitors lines that still despite everything held his men away from the town at which theyd aimed for so long how much more could bell stretch his smaller army he would have to do something to counter james the birds eyes next outflanking move james expected bell to attack and james knew him better than any other southron generalor at least better than any other under hesmucets command everyone else agreed with the young wing commander too come ahead hesmucet murmured eagerly you come right on ahead if bell obliged him he wouldnt complain no he wouldnt complain at all he snapped his fingers and called for a runner wouldnt do to make a stupid mistake like that he thought dont want to let the traitors have an easier time than they ought to when the runner returned he brought colonel phineas puffing in his wake phineas saluted reporting as ordered sir the armys senior mage said he took off his hat and used it to fan his round bald head good to see you colonel hesmucet said ive just got word that joseph the gamecock has been replaced by lieutenant general bell at the head of the army of franklin by the gods phineas exclaimed are you certain sir its in a marthasville paper i cant be much more certain than that hesmucet answered if i had really good mages working for me they would have let me know before i found out from a prisoner or a spy he thought perhaps that was unfair the northerners wizards would have been doing everything they could to keep news from leaking out but only alva could have hoped to penetrate whatever deceptions they were spreading and alva hadnt thought to look phineas said this will probably change the way the campaign is going doesnt bell have a name for being a more ah aggressive fighter than joseph thats exactly why i called you here colonel hesmucet said pleased to see even so much wit from phineas everyones best guess is that there will be an enemy attack and soon i suspect the traitors will try to hit us with their magecraft as well as with their soldiers that does seem very likely yes sir phineas agreed i want you to have all your mages on alert too to be ready to beat back such assaults hesmucet said i have confidence in our crossbowmen and pikemen and unicornriders and i have confidence in the wizards with us sourly colonel phineas said you have confidence in major alva you mean the rest of us are just here to watch him that was in large measure true even so hesmucet shook his head phineas and the other southron wizards did have some use and disheartening them would make that less true the commanding general said major alva will be busy but so will the rest of you to fetch and carry for him yes phineas was sour all right hesmucet shook his head by no means colonel major alva is best at striking back against the traitors the rest of you will keep them from striking at us he is sword you are shield we need both hmm phineas considered that very well sir you may rest assured that all of usand i mean all will do everything in our power for the kingdom thank you hesmucet said phineas feathers remained ruffled but perhaps not so much now hesmucet waved toward the north we can see marthasville from where we stand we had better not let it slip through our fingers now i could hardly disagree with that sir phineas bowed stiffly we shall give you what you require to the best of our ability cant ask for more than that hesmucet clapped the tubby wizard on the shoulder let all the men who share your art learn what i want of them yes sir phineas said well do everything we can sir i know that ive known that all along hesmucet clapped the mage on the back again hard enough to stagger him this time without alva it wouldnt be enough hesmucet thought when we didnt have alva the traitors wizards always got the drop on us well no more by the gods phineas made more promises that he and his sorcerous colleagues might or might not prove able to live up to hesmucet made more polite protestations that he didnt really mean at last with what seemed like relief phineas decamped with what hesmucet knew to be relief he watched the wizard waddle away he looked toward marthasville once more one thing at a time he thought let james the birds eye get a solid stranglehold on the glideway line to julia then ill send doubting george over goober creek if we can lick the northerners there we ought to be able to bring our engines up close enough to start flinging stones and firepots into marthasville itself he didnt want the fight for the city to come down to a siege he wanted to storm in and take the place away from the army of franklin he was by nature almost as much an attacker as lieutenant general bell over on the other side and joseph the gamecocks delaying campaign had left him badly frustrated but what he wanted most of all was marthasville how he got it didnt really matter if he had to starve the traitors into yielding he would do that he wasnt sorry to see joseph the gamecock go joseph had been like one skilled swordsman holding off two as he retreated down a long narrow corridor he hadnt let them get past him not even once to do so would have been fatal now bell would try to come up the corridor against the same two swordsmen or so everyone assumed let him come hesmucet murmured again he wasnt a particularly pious man nor one to send up prayers to the gods at any excuse the gods hed always reckoned would do as they pleased and let people pick up the pieces as best they could this time though the general commanding doffed his hat and looked up to the mountain beyond the sky please thunderer please lion god let him come he got no immediate answer to his petition hed expected none no detinan had seen a heavenly choir in years even so looking north once more he doubted he would have long to wait before finding out whether the gods were listening viii colonel florizel was almost beside himself with excitement now we get to hit back the regimental commander burbled now we get to drive the godsdamned southrons out of our kingdom once for all well your excellency we certainly get to try captain gremio answered bell is a man who knows what fightings all about florizel said well hit the southrons a lick the likes of which the world has never seen the likes of he was fond of that phrase gremio had heard it before from him hed never figured out what if anything it meant he did know he was worried they still have more men than we do sir we hurt them more when we made them come at us it wont be so easy when we go at them im afraid if youre afraid captain you may stay behind florizel snapped ill send you back to karlsburg if you like the way king geoffrey sent joseph the gamecock down to dicon joseph was afraid to face the southronsthats as plain as the nose on my face gremios ears felt on fire sir you ought to know im not afraid to advance ive always gone forward as boldly as anyone and who can say that i havent very well earl florizel said i cannot deny that by the way he sounded he wished he could but i am going to keep my eye on you young fellow you may rest assured of that a man who grumbles too much is not likely to have his heart in the fighting youll see sir gremio said grimly if florizel was going to watch everything he did he would have to fight as if his life didnt matter at all to him and fighting that way he was much more likely to lose it he knew that too well weour regiment and brigadier alexanders whole winghave the honor of holding the left florizel said as the southrons come north over goober creek were going to drive them back into the stream youll have the chance to make good on what you say captain dismissed fuming gremio saluted and walked off he sat down on a boulder took out a whetstone and began honing his sword he wanted the edge as sharp as he could make it every little bit helped is the attack on sir sergeant thisbe asked that made gremio look up oh yes its on he answered we get to swarm out of our trenches and drive the southrons back so says colonel florizel which means it should be easy dont you think i dont know sir thisbe said wed better try something though dont you suppose before the southrons surround marthasville altogether that had no good answer gremio wished it did he said well do the best we can thats all lets get the men formed up shall we i want this company to make everyone who watches it proud well do that sir thisbe promised how can we help it when weve got you leading us gremios ears got as hot as they had when florizel scorned him but for an altogether different reason before he could find anything to say the regimental trumpeters blew assembly he knew what he had to say then and so did sergeant thisbe they had the company in place before any of the others had formed ranks colonel florizel didnt look impressed florizel gremio was convinced wouldnt look impressed at anything this side of his heroic death his hand dropped to the hilt of that newly sharpened sword he might have to oblige the colonel when the rest of the regiment had assembled florizel struck a pose and said boys with bell leading us were going to chase the godsdamned southrons all the way back to franklin isnt that right yes the deep fierce roar stunned gremios ears the men were ready to go forward that was plain whether they could everyone would find out soon enough were going to catch the bastards crossing goober creek florizel went on old straights wingthats oursand roastbeef williams wingll hit em together and by the gods were going to break em wait for the brigades trumpeters to blow then go forward and dont slow down for anything have you got that yes the men roared again thats all ive got to say then florizel said and stood down it wasnt a speech that would have done much in the lawcourts in the field it was firstrate the soldiers cheered and waved their crossbows in the air gremio dutifully cheered too he drew his sword and waved it sunlight glittered off the edge a few minutes later trumpets blew advance forward gremio shouted well lick them he didnt know if they could he was sure they would give it a hells of a try out of the trenches one of his men said cheerfully as they swarmed up the sandbagged steps that led to the open country between the lines outside marthasville and goober creek gremio waved his sword again urging his soldiers on he wasnt so happy to have left the fieldworks himself but he had his orders and he had to obey them looking to the right he saw the assembled warriors from brigadier alexanders wing and that of roastbeef william all advancing together so many men in blue tunics and pantaloons storming toward the enemy at the same time did go a long way towards inspiriting him how could king avrams men hope to throw them back when he looked ahead he got a piece of his answer the southrons were already well over goober creek and coming north toward marthasville through the dust their advance raised he saw rank on rank of soldiers in gray his comrades might have the spirits the southrons as usual had the numbers but those numbers might not do them so much good this time several rills ran south from marthasville into goober creek the valleys theyd carved in the red land wouldnt be easy to cross if one group of southrons got in trouble their comrades to the right and left wouldnt easily be able to reinforce them maybe lieutenant general bell hadnt picked too bad a time to advance after all lets let them hear us gremio shouted his men loosed the roaring northern battle cry that might have come straight from the throat of the lion god himself that cry was often worth brigades in battle the southrons owned no real answer for it nor had they ever king avram the enemy yelled freedom some few of the southron soldiers had yellow hair and beards escaped serfs most of them gremio hated to see blonds in gray uniformshated it not only because it argued against everything the north held dear but also because those escaped serfs fought with special ferocity knowing they were likelier to die on the field than be taken prisoner men from both sides raised crossbows to their shoulders and started shooting as so often happened they opened the exchange of missiles before coming into range bolts thudded into the ground in front of gremio and his company but then the first northern man howled when a quarrel pierced him and the first southron crumpled as if all his bones had turned to water before long men on both sides fell like autumn leaves as southrons and northerners volleyed away at one another men reloaded as fast as they could as if one more bolt in the air would slay the last enemy in front of them and let their side storm forward but for every southron who toppled another strode forward to take his place and start shooting at gremio and his comrades lightning smashed down out of a clear sky he hoped it would clear the southrons in front of him but the bolts hit ground where no enemy soldiers stood or else smote goober creek and raised clouds of muddy steam gremio cursed after more than three years of war the southrons were at last becoming able to match the mages on his own side onward colonel florizel yelled brandishing his own blade he looked around to see what his captainsand most especially captain gremiowere doing onward gremio cried louder still he ran toward the southrons this is a good way to get killed he thought but his men came after him this is a good way to get all of us killed a quarrel hummed past his ear and struck a man behind him with an unmistakable meaty thunk the fellow didnt even cry out he must have died while hardly knowing what had happened to him there were worse ways to go gremio had seen too many of them and then quite suddenly it wasnt a fight of crossbow quarrels any more it was pikes and shortswords and men cursing and shoutingand screaming as they were hurt too gremio beat aside the gleaming iron head of a pike before the fellow who carried the heavy spear could draw back for a second thrust gremio leaped forward and lunged his point pierced flesh the pikeman howled staring down and seeing steel inside him stabbing stabbing gremio yanked back the blade the point was bloody that wound he knew was likely deep enough to kill if not by making the southron bleed out then from the festering sure to follow but the fellow wasnt dead yet and wouldnt die right away he managed another thrust at gremio who had to skip back smartly to keep from being spitted only then did the southrons knees slowly buckle forward gremio shouted well push the bastards into goober creek he did his best to roar as if the lion god were speaking through his body ferocityperhaps desperation wasnt too strong a wordpropelled the northerners into and then through their foes some southrons fell back toward the creek others simply fell and would not rise again for a few heady minutes gremio thought his comrades might indeed throw the enemy back into the stream and work a great slaughter on him there but the southrons had too many men those who ran away rallied when they met fresh unpanicked troopers coming up from the south and the reinforcements poured a couple of withering volleys of bolts into the oncoming northerners a good many of king geoffreys men had slung or thrown aside their crossbows to fight with shortswords instead they couldnt match the southrons quarrel for quarrel as they had before forward gremio cried yet again and rushed toward the new and dreadfully steady southron line the enemy mightlikely wouldkill him but colonel florizel couldnt complain he was a coward the things we do for pride he thought sourly brandishing bloodbedaubed blade he looked back over his shoulder his men kept on following such of them as remained on their feet sergeant thisbe trotted along only a few paces behind him gremio didnt know whether to be proud about that or sad youre not just getting yourself killed for no purpose but all the best men in the company shoot a southron officer yelled another volley tore into the men in blue gremio heard the shrieks behind him he looked back again what seemed like half the men who had still been on their feet were down sergeant thisbe waved urgently sir we cant do it he called weve got to try gremio answered which meant im going to die before i retreat without orders that was very likely a kind of madness of its own but it was a madness most men on a battlefield shared without such a madness anyone put in danger of his life would simply run away and how could kings and generals hope to fight their wars like that but before shouting forward again gremio looked around for colonel florizel if the regimental commander had already fallen gremio got some of his discretion back he knew what he would do with it too for thisbe was right the attackers lacked the numbers to go any farther forward florizel waved a sword bloodier than gremios whatever the earls flaws cowardice was not among them good fighting he bawled if you say so your excellency gremio answered then florizel scowled not at him but at the southrons gods damn it i dont think we can shift them the regimental commander said the attack had jolted the southrons but no more what are your orders sir he called to florizel a man of sense seeing no hope the attack could succeed would have ordered his men back earl florizel said lets give it one more try on the off chance i might be wrong he waved his sword again i hate to pull back from such a fine fray that stuck gremio as madness but what point to saying so what he did say was the only thing that would have satisfied the colonel forward forward he went with such men as were still able to go with him two more deadly volleys from the southrons broke the charge before it came to hand to hand gremio looked for florizel wondering if one of those crossbow quarrels had stretched him dead in the dirt somehow the regimental commander still stood but only a forlorn corporals guard stood with him sir they wont leave a one of us alive if we stay here much longer sergeant thisbe said urgently if florizel orders me to die here then die here i shall gremio answered thisbe was more practical than that as sergeants had a way of being if he stayed it was only because gremio did another species of madness without a doubt at last even florizel saw it was hopeless he ordered the men back toward the works from which theyd erupted those who could obeyed lieutenant general bell scowled at his wing commanders roastbeef william and alexander the steward gave back the exhausted stares of men who had seen too much fighting that day bell didnt care how battleweary they looked he cared about nothing except the results of that fight you failed me he growled your men failed me sir we did everything we could brigadier alexander said thats the truththe whole truth and nothing but roastbeef william agreed the southrons were there in numbers too great for us to move them we tried we did everything we could everything we knew how to do you failed me bell repeated your men have turned craven on account of cowering too long in trenches they didnt they wouldnt push the attack with the spirit required to destroy the enemy sir that is not true william said they fought as bravely as any men could fightlook how many dead and wounded we left on the field if they had fought bravely enough we would have won bell said we should have won we didnt win what have you got to say for yourselves sir if youre going to attack an army thats bigger than your own youve got to know the odds arent on your side old straight said but i had to attack king geoffrey insisted on it thats why joseph the gamecock isnt commanding any more bell said the misfortune that had befallen his army couldnt possibly have been his fault the soldiers just didnt put enough into it otherwise they would have won do you want to throw away the whole army then william asked no i want to drive back the southrons we have to drive back the southrons bell said if we dont they can cut the glideways to marthasville one by one till they hold the town in the palm of their hand theyre already doing it brigadier alexander said that move to extend their left flank means theyre sitting on the glideway path to julia well get no more supplies from the west then we have to drive them back bell declared its as simple as that saying its as simple as that roastbeef william remarked doing something about it wont be so easy im afraid when you sent us south against doubting george you didnt leave benjamin the heated ham very many men he may be able to hold back james the birds eyebut on the other hand he may not he surely hasnt got the numbers he needs to attack bell took the laudanum bottle from his tunic pocket and raised it to his lips maybe the drug would shield him from things he didnt care to contemplate resentment in his voice he said hesmucet has no trouble attacking wherever he pleases patiently william answered hesmucet has more men than we do sir its in the nature of things that he can do a good deal we cant brigadier alexander added the one thing wrong with attacks is that theyre expensive even when they succeedand a lot more expensive when they fail gods damn it i didnt send you out there to fail bell said he studied the map we have to strike a blow against their left we have to that will free up the glideway line and were holding marthasville on account of those lines an attack would be splendid if we had the men to do it roastbeef william said but whence will you conjure them up sir if we cant do what wed like to do well do what we have to do bell replied you pull your men out of the fieldworks south of town lieutenant general march them north and west through marthasville till they outflank the end of the southrons line which iswhich has to beunguarded up in the air attack at dawn roll them up and send them back in the direction from which they came as easy as that sir william said tonelessly as easy as that bell agreed taking no notice of the way the wing commander sounded it will be a famous victory sir william said my men fought their hearts out today the ones who arent hurt are weary to the bone send them marching all through the night and you wont get the best from them come morning i certainly will because i have to bell replied the kingdom requires it are you telling me it cant be done do you want me to have to tell king geoffrey it couldnt be done nooo roastbeef william said drawing the word out as long as he could i dont say it cant be done but i do say the odds are steep against it it must be done bell said i order you to try it once we hit the southrons in the flank theyre bound to fold up and brigadier benjamin will give you all the support he possibly can what am i supposed to be doing during all this alexander the steward asked hold the southrons away from marthasville if doubting george tries to come up from the south bell answered in those trenches you can do that i hope i can do that old straight replied i dont have a whole lot of men left myself you know what with one thing and another we all have to do everything we can bells gaze swung back toward roastbeef william sunrise hit them hard roll them up the kingdom is counting on it the veteran wing commander let out a long sad sigh at last after waiting much too long for proper subordination he nodded yes sir he said somehow contriving to make obedience sound like reproof well beat them bell said weve got to well do our best roastbeef william said and now sir if youll excuse me he sketched a salute to bell and left the headquarters alexander the steward said if im going to hold the southfacing fortifications with the men of my wing alone sir id better get back there and spread them out as best i can he too gave bell a salute and departed and that left the new commanding general for the army of franklin alone in the farmhouse with nothing but the haze of laudanum between him and the knowledge that his first attack had failed hed hoped to throw the southrons back into goober creek instead his own men were back in the fieldworks from which theyd set out so boldly that morningthose who could come back to the works at any rate the knowledge of his failure hurt even more than his ruined arm and his missing leg and the drug did less to ease that pain we have to beat them bell repeated no one was there to hear him now or to contradict him it felt as if saying it were plenty to make it so he laughed bitterly if only battles were so easy he drank more laudanum to help him sleep even so he woke up in the middle of the night at first he thought the noise he heard was rain pounding on the roof he wouldnt have minded that it would have made moving harder for hesmucet and the southrons but what he heard wasnt the patter of rain it was the patter of feet roastbeef williams men tramping past by moonlight to take their positions for the mornings attack against james the birds eye and the southrons left good old william bell thought drowsily he may not think im righthe doesnt think im rightbut hell follow orders anyway and follow them as well as he knows how i wish all my officers were so reliable he fell back to sleep with a smile on his face even before sunrise the distant racket of battle woke him bowstrings snapping firepots bursting men screaming and cursing for all they were worth that racket was the sweetest music bell knew when he cursed it was in frustration because his wounds no longer let him take the field hed never felt more like a man than when risking his life and taking those of his foes his injuries had robbed him of that forever those injuries clamored for his notice too he reached out with his good hand and grabbed the laudanum bottle which sat on a table next to his bed yanking the cork with his teeth he swigged before long the fire in his shoulder and in his stump would ease even before it did though someone pounded on the farmhouse door just a minute bell shouted getting out of bed wasnt easy he had to position his crutches and then lever himself upright he didnt bother putting on his one boot but hitched across the dirt floor on the crutches and his bare foot he unlatched the door and eyed the runner waiting there well he demanded were driving em sir the runner told him were driving em like hells pushing em back like nobodys business ah bell said that felt as good as the laudanum now beginning to glide through his veins give me the details havent got a whole lot of em sir the soldier answered i expect youll hear more later on but i know for a fact theres places where were shooting at the godsdamned southrons from the front and the back at the same time thats good bell said which would do for an understatement till a bigger one came along thats very good if we can drive them to destruction the entire campaign looks different hope so sir the runner said plenty of good fightingill tell you that he saluted and hurried away bell wished he were at the head of the wing attacking the southrons not roastbeef william nothing made him feel more truly alive than roaring like a lion and flinging himself at the enemy when his sword bit feeling steel pierce foes flesh had a satisfaction even feeling his own lance pierce a womans flesh couldnt match he muttered a curse under his breath with all the laudanum he drank his lance didnt stand and charge the way it had before he got hurt either that made him remember that attackers as well as defenders could get hurt he forgot that whenever he could attacks went in if they went in properly they carried everything before them so hed made himself believe it had alwayswell almost alwaysworked for duke edward of arlington and the army of southern parthenia it had worked for earl james of broadpath here in the east at the river of death it had worked there even if that fight cost bell his leg that it had worked in those places and for those commanders because the said generals picked their spots and timing with care never entered bells mind to him such things were of scant importance coming to grips with the southrons and hammering themthat was what really mattered his hand fell to the hilt of his sword he cursed again for him nowadays it wasit had to bea purely ceremonial weapon he still wanted to kill southrons but anything that moved faster than a tortoise was safe from him he couldnt even duel if his honor was affronted who would fight a cripple another messenger galloped up on unicornback the man dismounted and hurried to the farmhouse were still pushing em hard sir he said when bell opened the door for him godsdamned sons of bitches are digging like moles though every time we drive em another furlong or two bastards run up another set of earthworks and make us charge em theyre usually good for a couple volleys before we reach em and clear em out too makes the job expensive but were doing it of course we are bell said heartily well lick them right out of their boots once we do that we can count the cost joseph the gamecock that old cheeseparer had counted the cost before he tried to buy his battles and so hed never spent the men winning them would have taken bell didnt care if he bankrupted himself winning the first everything after that would just have to take care of itself keep hitting them he told the messenger thats the order weve got to keep hitting them no matter what yes sir the fellow said and went back to his unicorn at the run clods of rustcolored dirt flew up from under the white beasts hooves as it galloped away all lieutenant general bell could do was wait for messengers to bring him news of what was happening to the northwest if roastbeef william didnt throw the southrons back from the glideway leading to julia bell shook his head he wouldnt think about that he refused to think about that as morning wore away and afternoon came on the news the messengers brought was less and less anything bell wanted to hear the southrons had stiffened were hitting em with everything we got sir one man said but we aint got enough maybe if we wasnt so worn from marching all night to get to where we needed to be at so as we could hit em at all but theres a lot of them bastards and they dont want to move but they have to bell exclaimed as if he could push the southrons off the glideway with his one good arm with a mournful shrug the messenger went his way bell stared off to the northwest men marching and countermarching had raised a great cloud of dust by which he could tell where the fighting was taking place but not try as he would how it was going he drummed the fingers of his good hand against his crutch and waited for another messenger to bring more news before long one did even as he rode up he shouted in excitement lieutenant general bell lieutenant general bell what is it bell barked whats the word weve killed james the birds eye sir the messenger exclaimed the southrons wing commanders dead as shoe leather gods damn the son of a bitch to the seven hells what general hesmucet stared at the messenger in dismay james the birds eye dead i dont believe it im afraid its true sir the southron unicornrider said gods damn those traitor sons of bitches to the seven hells but they shot him right off his unicorn while he was riding toward the thick of the fighting that sounds like him that sounds just like him in fact hesmucet shook his head in dull wonder but dead thats dreadful he cant even be thirtyfive hes he was strong and brave and handsome and everybody likeslikedhim he was a noble man and im sure king avram would have made him a nobleman had he lived what are the gods thinking of to let him die so young im afraid i dont know how to answer that sir the messenger replied hesmucet didnt know how to answer it either he knew what major alva would have said that the gods paid much less attention to earthly affairs than people were in the habit of thinking hesmucet didnt like to hear such things but when an officer who had everything to live for stopped a crossbow quarrel he couldnt help wondering whether alva had a point the rider pointed back towards a unicorndrawn ambulance coming down from the northwest sir i dont know for a fact but i believe thats his body in there seeing the ambulance made hope rise in hesmucet maybe hes not dead maybe hes only wounded the commanding general said the messenger shook his head but hesmucet shouted for a healer as soon as the ambulance stopped a couple of men removed james the birds eyes body from it one look told hesmucet the young wing commander would never rise again hesmucet had seen enough corpses the past three years and more to have no doubt when he saw another the healer stooped beside james then looked up at the general commanding through the heart sir im afraid he said it would have been over very fast if thats any consolation not fornicating much hesmucet snapped and then as he had to he thought about the battle still unfolding whos in command now on the left he demanded of the messenger baron logan the black sir the man replied were holding pretty wellyou dont need to worry about that hesmucet only grunted baron logan had turned out to make a pretty good soldier but hesmucet didnt like the idea of having him as a wing commander he wasnt a professional warrior but a noble from king avrams home province whod got himself a brigadiership in exchange for loudly and publicly backing the king and recruiting soldiers the southron army in hesmucets view had too many officers like that he couldnt do anything about it right this minute but he intended to when he could another messenger came galloping up baron logans compliments sir and he wants you to know the traitors are stopped he expects to start driving them back any time now thats good news hesmucet said and meant it give him my compliments in return and tell him the northerners deserve every single thing that happens to them yes sir the messenger didnt even waste time saluting he set spurs to his unicorn the beast snorted angrily as he forced its head around and urged it back to a full gallop to deliver hesmucets reply the commanding general called for a messenger of his own when the man came up to him he said give my regards to lieutenant general george and ask him if its possible with the traitors so heavily engaged in the northwest for him to go straight through their defenses to the south of marthasville and into the city give me that back so im sure you have it straight after repeating the message the runner hurried away when he returned he said lieutenant general george says hes already probed the line south of marthasville sir he says its too strong to break through like that all right hesmucet wondered if it was really all right and how hard doubting george really had poked at bells line there george was as stalwart a warrior as the gods had made when fighting on the defensive but to hesmucets way of thinking lacked the push the drive of a good attacker thats why marshal bart made me commander here in the east he thought ive come this far another few miles and ill have done a big part of what he wanted of me he scowled in the direction of marthasville the traitors had hung on to the place altogether too long as far as he was concerned it didnt fall that day by the time the sun set james the birds eyes menno logan the blacks nowhad indeed driven bells blueclad warriors back into the lines from which theyd started their attack a messenger said the enemy must have lost twice as many men as we did too he threw away a lot of soldiers then hesmucet said musingly add those in with all the men he lost yesterday and with his having fewer than we do to begin with and how many has he got left im sorry sir but i couldnt begin to tell you the messenger replied never mind the general commanding told him i didnt expect you to know but i wonder if my wing commanders do with the fighting having died down he summoned doubting george logan the black and with a mental sigh fighting joseph to his headquarters to talk things over logan proved to be younger than hed rememberedhardly older than james the birds eye in factwith a ruddy face fierce eyes and a piratical black mustache yes sir they hurt us he said frankly we didnt really expect another strong sally not when they were thrown back with loss yesterday it was worrisome out there for a while when they came close to turning our flank but we were steady and we made them pay for coming out of their works so youve already reported your excellency hesmucet replied im glad to learn you did so well doubting george said taking it all in all they must have left a third of their men on the field the last two days and they didnt have that many to begin with he might not have been aggressive enough to suit hesmucet but hed done sums in his head too and the answer he reached wasnt far different from the one that had formed in the commanding generals mind hesmucet said its only a matter of time now i think youre right sir george said nodding now we can push to the east of marthasville or to the west go up north of the place on either side just as we choose and bell wont be able to stop us the most he can do with what he has left as i see it is sit tight and stand siege if he does that hes mine and so is his whole fornicating army hesmucet said ill take it clean off the board the same as marshal bart took camphorville on the great river and its defending host last year i dont believe bell will do that logan the black said hes a swinger a puncher hell keep trying to hit us for as long as he can good hesmucet said the more he wastes his force the sooner he wont be able to strike with it at all i always worried about joseph the gamecock he held his men in if id made a mistake against him he kept the wherewithal to make me pay for it but bell bells thrown away as many good men the past two days as joseph did during the whole campaign from borders all the way up to here his subordinates nodded not even fighting joseph could disagree with that george said bells a firstrate man to command a brigade point him at the foe turn him loose and hell hit hard but put him in command of an army of an army trying to hold off a bigger army i dont know what false king geoffrey was drinking when he thought of that but i hope they serve him more of it logan the black nodded well said our foes mistakes go a long way toward making this an easy fight for us they cant afford to make mistakes not any more doubting george agreed we have the luxury of greater strength which lets us make our errors good he dipped his head to hesmucet not that weve made many on this campaign for which i thank you hesmucet replied if george said a thing like that he had to mean it which made the compliment doubly pleasing hesmucet went on now there is one other bit of business that wants doing brigadier logan i am grateful for how well you fought james wing but i do not intend that you keep command of it and why not if i fought it well logan demanded he was a proud man and he had done his duty and more than his duty hesmucet would have to handle him carefully he said my main reason brigadier is that you are not a professional meaning you no disrespect but i find it easier to deal with men who have been through annasville as i have plenty of them on both sides of this war have proved themselves to be idiots logan said tartly true enough your excellency but you could also say the same for officers who havent been through the military collegium hesmucet replied i am pleased to have you as a brigade or division commander as a wing commander im sorry brigadier but no not permanently however proud he was logan took it like a man its your army general you will have your way here if you think im going to tell you im happy about it youre mistaken and now sir if youll excuse me saluting he spun on his heel and strode out of the headquarters you did the right thing sir fighting joseph said approval from him was the last thing hesmucet wanted striking a pose fighting joseph went on now you can consolidate your forces an army of only two wingsled by your two senior commanderswould surely be more efficient than one of three and it would double the size of the force you command which is what youve got in mind hesmucet thought aloud he said i find myself reasonably satisfied with the command arrangements as they exist at present do you indeed sir do you indeed from fighting josephs tone hesmucet might have expressed a fondness for scratching his backside in public or eating with his fingers more scornfully still fighting joseph said and who could possibly replace james the birds eye who but me he all but shouted if you must know i had in mind brigadier oliver hesmucet replied now fighting joseph frankly stared oliver you must be joking sir i hope youre joking oliver the blondlover oliver the godsdrunk oliver with his right arm gone lion gods twitching tail itd be like putting a cross between bell and leonidas the priest in charge of a wing no hesmucet shook his head olivers pious but he knows soldiering as well as he knows the gods and hes not brash and rash the way bell is he thinks before he moves i agree doubting george said before the war i thought oliver was a horrible windbag and i wished he would quit blathering on about loosing the blonds from the soil but that is king avrams policy now so we all needs must follow it and brigadier oliver is a more than capable soldier as the commanding general said giving that wing to such an untried manand a junior untried manis an outrage when senior officers are available fighting joseph insisted not only an outrage but also a gross injustice im sorry general but i dont agree hesmucet said brigadier oliver will have that wing disgraceful fighting joseph drew himself up to his full height which was perhaps an inch less than hesmucets in a voice like thunder he said if that is your final decision i cannot abide the insult and must offer my resignation from king avrams service and from this his host without a doubt he thought hesmucet would find him indispensable and would knuckle under to that threat without a doubt he had never so badly misjudged a situationwhich with viziersville on his record was saying a great deal hesmucet had all he could do not to chortle with glee lieutenant general george you are my witness he said fighting joseph has tendered his resignation yes sir doubting george agreed i heard him do it and you shall also be my witness that i accept the said resignation effective immediately hesmucet went on yes sir george repeated i will so testify at need fighting joseph first looked as if he didnt believe his ears then as if he didnt want to howhow dare you he spluttered how do you think you can manage this army without me i expect ill manage hesmucet answered and since youve resigned its not your concern anyway a good evening to you general i trust you will make a splendid success of yourself in civilian life still looking as if hed been hit in the head with a rock fighting joseph having fought for the last time stumbled out of hesmucets headquarters hesmucet found a jar of spirits and poured a mug for himself and one for doubting george though hed lost james the birds eye his men had held bells and he was rid of fighting joseph he wondered which of those would prove the bigger victory bell had his chance lieutenant general george told his brigadiers he had it and he couldnt do anything with it now its our turn by the gods and well see how well he likes that thats right absalom the bear rumbled the big man went on the traitors have played games with us for too long i dont believe theyve got the men to play games any more weve got brigadier oliver pushing up to our left george said now hesmucet is going to stretch this wing up toward the right toward the glideway link with dothan province and the one with northern peachtree province once weve got those in our hands too hows lieutenant general bell going to feed marthasville thats simple sir brigadier brannan said doubting georges commander of siege engines paid close attention to logistics his handsome face twisted into a thoroughly nasty grin he wont those bastards will starve and then well clean em out absalom shook his head no i dont think thats how itll happen when we move against the glideway lines to dothan and to the north of peachtree province bell will have to come out against us to try to knock us away then well lick him and what can he do after that not fornicating much i think you may be right doubting george said bell isnt the sort of man whos going to let himself be shut up in a place and stand siege what he wants to do is get out there and attack look how much good it did him these past couple of days brannan said of course hell want to go out and try it again george shrugged hell just think he had bad luck or that his soldiers let him down attacking is what he knows how to do its all he knows how to do if you send a carpenter out to try fixing something of course hes going to hammer nails into it even if its a blanket with a rip and not a board at all let bell come absalom said let him come and well pound nails into him well pound nails into the boards of his funeral pyre doubting george said the beauty of our position now is we dont have to try to break into marthasville we can do the traitors every bit as much harm by stretching out past them and when we do they have to come out against us and attack our fieldworks we dont have to try to break through theirs i like that absalom the bear said weve had to go up against too many of their earthworks it might as well be their turn for a while and ill tell you something else the men will like it too thats a fact brannan agreed if youre trying to fix wool or rock or water a hammers not the right tool for the job were the ones with the tools for the job now george said lets get moving and do it some of brigadier john the listers men will fill in on our left as we shift brannan smiled good old ducky hes reliable by the thunderers prong that he is doubting george didnt doubt it in the slightest when fighting joseph resigned because hesmucet had named brigadier oliver commander of james the birds eyes wing rather than giving it to him that had given the general commanding one more slot to fill john the listeroften called by the nickname brannan had given himwas a thoroughly capable officer one who did what needed doing without demanding praise before during and afterwards with him on his flank george felt much happier than he would have with fighting joseph there georges wing started sliding around to the right to the east of marthasville the next morning hed wondered if bell would try to strike him a blow at once but the northern soldiers stayed in their entrenchments only a few unicornriders in blue dogged the southron troops doubting george sent his own unicornriders forward and drove them away theyre only trying to see what were up to absalom the bear said they cant stop us i know that doubting george replied i dont care i dont want them seeing anything either it might cause us trouble later on as his wing advanced though he wondered whether anything would cause the southrons in peachtree province trouble ever again hesmucet had had the right of it but for joseph the gamecocks army and duke edwards over in parthenia king geoffrey had little left with which to hold his kingdom together and now that bell had taken the army once josephs and smashed it up little remained to hold back the men in gray as they advanced oh every now and then squadrons of unicornriders or peachtree province militiamen would skirmish with georges vanguard sometimes the northerners would have the numbers to slow down georges men for a little while but all he had to do was send reinforcements forward and the traitors would melt away theyd spent a couple of months skillfully contesting every inch of ground from borders all the way up to marthasville this ground to the east of marthasville was as important as any in all of peachtree province but king geoffrey had not the men to keep hesmucet from taking it seeing as much amused absalom the bearas much as anything could amuse lieutenant general georges grim brigadier geoffrey wanted bell to get out there and fight absalom said he got out there and he did itand now by the gods geoffrey has to wish hed left joseph the gamecock in command i doubt that george said which made absalom chuckle the wing commander went on i dont think false king geoffrey wants joseph to have anything to do with anything the only reason he gave him this command in the first place was that he didnt have anybody else to fix the mess thraxton the braggart left behind no doubt youre right sir absalom said now whos going to fix the mess bells left behind i dont think anyone can george replied if he stays in the city well flank him out or starve him out and if he comes forth again well give him another set of lumps and drive him back he hasnt got the men to push us not after hes gone and thrown so many of them away theres always magic absalom said doubting george wished the brigadier hadnt said that sorcery was the one place where the traitors still enjoyed some advantage over king avrams forces but even that edge was shrinking george said by what the northerners have shown on this campaign we can stand up to whatever they throw at us heres hoping youre right absalom the bear answered george nodded a unicornrider came back from the vanguard reined in and waited to be recognized when doubting george nodded again this time toward him he said sir weve taken some prisoners do you want to help question them dont mind if i do the wing commander replied lead the way yes sir the messenger rode to what looked like the farm of a prosperous yeoman or a small baron even before george walked into the farmhouse he could hear cursingat the same time highly fluent and slightly mushy at his raised eyebrows the messenger explained one of the fellows we caught is this militiaman must be fiftyfive sixty years old hes got false choppersor he did on account of he just broke em thats how come he sounds the way he does i see george said he sounds like the fellow i ought to question dont you think whatever you say sir the messenger replied if if was up to me id knock him over the head and shut him up for good oh i dont know doubting george replied he sounds like he might be fun to listen to for a while he walked into the farmhouse the northern prisoner gave him a baleful stare and demanded who in the hellsbecause of his broken false teeth it came out as hellsh are you i am lieutenant general george commander of this wing of king avrams army george said gravely do i understand you to be a mite discouraged with the northern cause discouraged the prisoner shouted discouraged he spat on the rammedearth floor that for the fornicating northern cause i curse the northern cause every fornicating piece of it i curse king geoffrey and his ministers and his satraps and public men clean down to the lowest pothouse politico who advocates his cause i curse the whole fornicating army of franklin from joseph the gamecock and bell the bloody butcher down to the mangiest most miserable jackass i curse its downsittings and its uprisings i curse its movements marches battles and sieges i curse all its paraphernalia its catapults and its crossbows i curse its banners bugles and drums and i curse the whole godsdamned institution of serfdom which brought about this miserable fornicating war by then the fellows guards had tears of laughter running down their cheeks doubting george held his face straight which was one of the hardest things hed ever done you are a man of strong opinions sir he remarked i know whats what i know eggs is eggs i know pigs is pigs the prisoner said and i know weve got pigs in charge of us curse em all curse em and make bacon of em too dare i ask your view of my side in this conflict george inquired futter you southrons too the northern man said at once you bastards are winning the war by magic and wheres the fair fight in that by magic george said in surprise your side is the one credited with the stronger sorcerers unicorn dung the prisoner exclaimed stinks like it too our wizards brag you ever hear tell of thraxton the braggart we brag but your buggers really do things we arent the ones who keep miles and miles of glideway tunnel in our back pantaloon pockets way you bastards do glideway tunnel doubting george had never imagined that as something a wizard might keep handy in a pocket but it made perfect sense to the prisoner we go after your glideways how else can you fix em so godsdamned fast without you having tunnel right there ready to go and stick it through a hill ought to stick it up bells backside is where it ought to go he went back to cursing this time aiming his venom at the new commander of the army of franklin but hed been dead serious about the tunnels doubting george could tell as much if only such a thing were possible it would have been a good idea when the latest string of blasphemies slowed george asked how did you happen to get caught i got stuck in the mud gods damn it the prisoner answered he wiped at his forehead with a forearm that dislodged the wig he was wearing he didnt realize it had gone awry and looked even more absurd and bedraggled than he had a moment before would you say youre representative of the soldiers going into geoffreys militia these days george asked why shouldnt i be the northern returned you see anything wrong with me you saying theres something wrong with me he looked comically indignant no not at all doubting george said soothingly eyeing the young strong guards he contrasted them to their captive king avrams dominions still had plentiful reserves of men false king geoffrey on the other hand was trying to wring a few last drops of water from a dry fleece what are you southron bastards going to do with me the prisoner asked not much george told him well feed you a mealgods know you look like you could use oneand then well ship you south to a prisoners camp youll wait there till youre properly exchanged for a southron your side has captured or till the war ends whichever comes first cant be over too soon the prisoner declared mushily i want to get back to my life is what i want to do dont we all doubting george said if geoffrey hadnt let palmetto province start calling him king gods damn geoffrey devils fry him for breakfast and roast him for supper the prisoner said and he was off again on another wild string of curses george decided he didnt need to hear any more he hadnt really learned anything from the prisoner save that the man had a remarkably foul mouth or so he thought till he went outside and considered the matter for a little while true the fellow with the broken false teeth and the wig askew hadnt told him anything about where the northern armies were how many men they had or what they intended to do but did that mean hed told him nothing after a little more thought doubting george shook his head that a scrawny old man had been hauled into the militia at all said something about the straits the north was in that he hated the man who called himself his king and the commanders set over him said something too and if grand duke geoffrey could have heard what it said he would have shivered no matter how oppressively hot the weather in nonesuch was at this season of the year he will hear george murmured to himself well make him hear and i doubt it will take very long roastbeef william was not a happy man his wing had fought its heart out trying to push the southrons back into goober creek then the weary men had marched all night before trying to dislodge hesmucets left from the glideway line leading to julia they hadnt quite managed either feat but the number of dead and wounded theyd left on the field told how hard theyd tried it told roastbeef william at any rate he couldnt see that the soldiers effort and suffering meant that much to lieutenant general bell who was glaring at him like the angry lion he resembled i dont care how hard they tried bell said furiously i care that they failed sir if you set out to do the impossible you shouldnt be surprised when you fall short william said impossible no such thing bell declared if only your men had pressed their second attack they would have rolled up the stinking southrons and thrown them back in disorder sir roastbeef william resisted the impulse to pick up his chair and break it over the commanding generals head sir wed fought a battle the day before wed marched fifteen miles at night with bad guides to get to where we could deliver that second attack and then after the way we fought you complain because we didnt do enough for shame sir for shame the plan was good if the plan was good but didnt succeed that must be the fault of the men who went to carry it out bell said sighing william said sir the plan was less good than you think if you attack soldiers in entrenchments when yours are not you had better have more men than they do not fewer they waited for us to get close and then they shot us down like partridges you cannot blame our defeats on the brave soldiers who serve us youre wiser in hindsight than you were in foresight bell said for you didnt protest these orders when i gave them that held some truth more than roastbeef william cared to think about he hadnt opposed bells first attack the one that had failed to push the southrons back over goober creek casting about for some means to defend himself he said i did warn you the men you sent to attack james the birds eye would be too weary to give their best oh what a hero you are bell jeered in defeat he was proving as badtempered and sarcastic as joseph the gamecock or thraxton the braggart ever had criticizing it seemed had proved easier than commanding camp rumor said joseph before departing had warned that that would be so however prickly joseph was hed always known a hawk from a handsaw bell roastbeef william wasnt so sure about bell he wasnt so sure about himself either maybe i should have protested harderprotested at least somewhenbell sent us south just after he took command he thought mournfully no certainly i should have protested he knew why he hadnt joseph the gamecock had been sacked because he wouldnt attack bell had been installed because he would king geoffrey had wanted attacks against the southrons how could an officer mindful of that oppose them well the army of franklin or what was left of it had found the answer to that opposing attacks that failed that might well have been foredoomed looked like great wisdom in hindsight with so many men lost with the southrons not driven away despite those dreadful losses to the northern force how were they going to hold on to marthasville roastbeef william had been a soldier and a teacher of soldiers for a long time that notwithstanding he had no idea before he could find a way to put any of that into words a runner came into the house bell was using as army headquartersthe house joseph had used before being sacked sir he began and then catching sight of william along with the general commanding fell silent say on bell told him say your say roastbeef william may be a fool but he is no traitor to the northern cause sir that wasnt the messenger it was roastbeef william himself but he shook his head what point in quarreling further when bell called him a fool what he meant was he disagrees with me yes sir the messenger said to bell the news is that the godsdamned southrons are moving against the glideway line running north out of marthasville the line to dicon and the rest of the north of this province theyve already overrun the line to dothan theyre marching on jonestown about fifteen miles north of the city sir moving on that line in a long loop from out of the east thats the last line into marthasville we still hold sir roastbeef william said if the southrons seize it were as near surrounded as makes no difference i know that bell spoke in an abstracted voice as if from far away the pupils of his eyes were very small william had seen that before when heroic doses of laudanum had had their way with the commanding general another runner dashed in he stood on no ceremony whatever saying lieutenant general bell sir the southrons are starting to fling firepots and stones into marthasville sir what are we going to do theyve moved their engines up close enough to reach the town have they roastbeef william said the second runner nodded one thing at a time bell said more to himself than to anyone else after a moment he gathered himself and turned to william you go with your wing and massacre the southrons by jonestown if theyre bombarding marthasville they cant have sent that many men north crush them hold on to the glideway line leading north and as opportunity offers push east toward the one to dothan yes sir william saluted the order struck him as reasonablemore than reasonable in fact holding the glideway lines coming out of marthasville was the main reason for holding the city itself of course it would have done more good had the army of franklin still controlled the lines leading toward julia and toward nonesuch but those were gone cut by the southrons no reinforcements or supplies would go to parthenia along them without the line to dothan and the one to northern peachtree province though no reinforcements ormore vitalsupplies would get into marthasville hesmucet could sit down and starve the city into submission if he didnt prefer to knock it flat instead bell had the same thought at the same time hesmucet uses us barbarously to throw stones and fire into a city still full of noncombatants he said sir i would agree roastbeef william replied but if he will do it it may work to his advantage and i see no way for us to make him stop it barbarous bell repeated shameless and barbarous his eyes hardly seemed to have any pupils at all i shall drive them away from marthasville if i see even the smallest chance of doing so yes sir roastbeef william said and then because he couldnt help himself sir please do be careful weve already lost a lot of men how many more can we afford to throw away if we triumph the men are not thrown away no matter how much laudanum bell had taken he still sounded angry joseph the gamecock would not see that which is why i command if we triumph yes sir william said weve hit the southrons two hard blows and havent triumphed yet we need to be able to defend ourselves too against the cursed numbers they enjoy this time we cannot fail we must not fail bell said we have to win by the city and we have to win up by jonestown you tend to the second and i will take care of the first you may rely on it i do sir roastbeef william said i have to he strode out of bells headquarters before the general commanding could respond to that getting out of there also kept him from thinking about how he meant it which was probably just as well go north to jonestown drive the southrons away from it dont let them seize the glideway line to dicon reclaim the one to dothan put like that it sounded easy bell put it no other way turning those broad commands into reality was up to roastbeef william so were all the myriad details of putting his wing of the army of franklin into motion details mattered littlehardly mattered at allto bell roastbeef william found himself unhappier than ever that joseph the gamecock was gone joseph had cared about details joseph had cared so much about leaves and branches and bark in fact that he sometimes had trouble remembering there were trees let alone a forest to williams way of thinking that was a lesser failing than barely noticing the forest because one was gazing at the kingdom of which it formed a part but no one cared about his way of thinking king geoffrey had proved that if he decided he had to sack joseph why didnt he put me in charge william feared he knew the answer its not just that i have no breedingneither does bell but hes a herohis missing pieces prove it all i am is a man who can get the job done and now i have toagain work with pen and paper saved him a lot of trouble by the time he called in his brigade commanders he had at his fingertips the details lieutenant general bell hadnt bothered with he gave them out crisply and cleanly how many men have the southrons got somebody asked that i dont know roastbeef william admitted unhappily but i must be of the opinion that their force is not overlarge how could it be when theyre operating fifteen miles north of marthasville at the same time as theyre keeping the assault against the city in progress no one argued with him had the southrons not had a large host they wouldnt have been able to operate in two such widely separated places at the same time at all as far as william was concerned marthasville itself remained the most important target this business of jonestown was bound to be a distraction a harassment nothing more once hed dealt with it he could bring his wing back up to the city to aid in the defense any more questions he asked hearing none he nodded very well gentlemen you know whats required of you i expect you will all do your duty and all do it handsomely dismissed we move in the morning some of the soldiers boarded carpets and went north up the glideway others moved by road not enough carpets remained in marthasville to transport his entire wing he sent the men who would have to march up to jonestown off ahead of those who would ride on the carpets they would travel more slowly and he wanted his entire force such as it was to get there at the same time bell wouldnt think of such a thing went through his mind as he mounted his own unicorn and rode off at the head of a column of marchers if some got there before the rest he would throw in an attack with what he had and hope the latecomers could support it no wonder were in the state were in again he wished the whole army might have been his the only answer to that was a shrug of his broad shoulders what he wished didnt matter what king geoffrey wished did so the gods had made it that was what the priests said at any rate roastbeef william couldnt help thinking the gods had made some extraordinarily sloppy arrangements for the north he peered he saw no great clouds of smoke rising into the hot muggy air either the southrons hadnt yet got to jonestown or no one was in the way to slow them down he hoped for the former and feared the latter when he reached jonestown he found with some considerable relief that his hope was fulfilled the southrons werent there yet but when he sent scouts eastward probing toward the glideway that led to dothan and away toward the great river those scouts promptly came back bloodied a whole great plenty of them bastards in gray was how one of them put it roastbeef william thought about pushing on regardless lieutenant general bell would have he was sure of that to the hells with lieutenant general bell he thought my orders dont require me to push on this instant and i dont intend to if hesmucet and his wing commanders want me let them come here and try to get me dig in men he called lets make sure we have a safe place before we go gallivanting around the landscape by the way his soldiers fell to with spade and pick they were relieved to get an order like that they knew the value of earthworks even if the general commanding the army of franklin had yet to figure it out a trooper with several scars said now we got a nest if we see our chance we can fly out or we can make those other bastards try and break in thats right roastbeef william said thats just exactly right as long as the numbers are anywhere close to even we can keep the southrons off the glideway line and out of jonestown a tiny alarm bell rang inside his mind he knew only too well how many men his wing had lost during the fighting south and then west of marthasville he didnt know how many the southrons had lost only that they hadnt suffered proportionately and he knew theyd had more men to begin with and enjoyed a steady stream of reinforcements i wish i had the wherewithal general hesmucet does he thought enviously people would reckon me a great soldier too but he couldnt have that sort of wherewithal which he also knew only too well he had to make a few tired men into the equivalent of a host of fresh ones earthworks helped and if he saw the chance he would strike out from them strike toward the glideway line leading east to dothan and beyond maybe well get it back he thought maybe things will go just right they have before every once in a while but when a man had to count on it roastbeef william grimaced when a man had to count on it his kingdom was in trouble ix corporal rollant lieutenant griff called yes sir rollant answered saluting take up the standard corporal for were moving out soon griff said yes sir rollant repeated after offering the ritual gestures of respect to the companys banner he lifted the staff from where it had been thrust into the ground the night before the companycolonel nahaths whole regimentwas part of general hesmucets great wheeling move against the glideway lines north of marthasville southron soldiers had already overrun the line leading east to dothan southron mages were now busy putting that line out of commission so that the traitors could get no use from it even if they took it back but rollant didnt think false king geoffreys men would be able to do anything of the sort the northerners hadnt been able to do much to slow down the great wheel if they couldnt manage that how would they make the southrons retreat jonestown coming up smitty said around a yawn he didnt seem ready for another days march jonestown rollant snapped his fingers thats the name of the place it went clean out of my head if we grab that one too the traitors wont have any glideways into marthasville will they nary a one smitty agreed but i hear tell there are already northerners around the place so were going to have to fight our way in thats the truth sergeant joram said ive talked with pickets who bumped up against them theyre from roastbeef williams wing but nobody knows how many of em are in the town doesnt matter how many there are smitty said cheerfully well lick em a year earlier a boast like that would have struck rollant as madness now he found himself nodding he thought they could clean up a whole wing from the army of franklin too come on come on come on lieutenant griff shouted time to get moving we cant sit around here all day smitty sighed hes right gods dammit itd be nice if we could though wouldnt it rollant hurried forward to take his place at the head of the company ill be the one they shoot at first he thought thats what standardbearers are for thats why they made me a corporal they hadnt gone far before splashing through a little stream that never came up past their knees rollant enjoyed the cool water soaking his trousers but did call out a warning hed made before check yourselves for leeches if you know whats good for you the country wasnt very swampy but in this part of detina you never could tell and sure enough a couple of men made disgusted noises whos got fire one of them said they had learned not just to yank off the bloodsuckers but to touch them with a glowing coal and make them let go someone had a firesafe and got a tiny blaze going from the glowing punk he carried in it the smoldering tip of a twig got rid of the pests the company pressed on how far to this jonestown place sir rollant asked lieutenant griff not far the young company commander replied four or five miles rollant nodded thanks youre welcome griff answered a courtesy he never would have given rollant the year before he walked along for a few paces then said do you know corporal youre not what i expected he evidently meant it as a compliment rollant said thank you sir youre welcome griff said again when we gave you your corporals stripescolonel nahath and i i mean and lieutenant general george toowe didnt think you would be able to keep them we expected there would be quarrels and men refusing to obey you but that hasnt happened i wonder why maybe they see i can do the job sir rollant said he hadnt imagined theyd talked with doubting george before deciding they could promote him maybe griff didnt sound convinced i see that youre doing it mind you but convincing ordinary detinans of anything they dont feel like believing is like herding tigers he was without a doubt right about that no one knew better than blonds how stubborn detinans could be rollant thought for a while then suggested maybe they see the stripes on my sleeve and not the man wearing the uniform tunic that could be griff allowed weve come a long way toward turning all our men into real professional soldiers and one mark of the professional is respect for his underofficers dont you worry about it sir rollant said im sure they call me a godsdamned blond son of a bitch whenever my backs turned and what do you think about that the lieutenant asked rollant shrugged sir if you think i never cussed an underofficer i have to tell you youd better think again not many soldiers who never have i suppose griff said and then in an altogether different tone hello whats this this was men in blue tunics and pantaloons spread thinly across a field northern pickets they cried out in alarm as they caught sight of the southrons several of them raised crossbows to their shoulders and started shooting thwuck one of the bolts a frighteningly good shot tore through the silk of the company standard forward griff shouted if they wont go by themselves we just have to chase them away rollant held the standard on high and waved it back and forth as he advanced it told the men where the company was supposed to go and lifted their spirits that was why both southrons and traitors had standardbearers making themselves conspicuous was why both sides had to change standardbearers so often avram rollant shouted avram and freedom more than most he knew what freedom meant more crossbow bolts whistled past him someone behind him let out a shriek he couldnt even look to see who it was he could only go forward waving the standard he ran clumsily his head down watching where he put his feet if he fell from stepping in a hole and the standard went down his companys spirits would sag no less than if he got shot he couldnt do much about getting shot he could or at least he might avoid imitating a jackass with the staggers the northerners didnt put up much of a fight in their shoes being so badly outnumbered he wouldnt have been ashamed to run away either a few of them turned and loosed hasty shots over their shoulders a couple of those struck home too but more traitors fell rollant watched dust puff from the back of one running mans blue tunic as a quarrel hit him the northerner threw his arms wide his crossbow flew surprisingly far to one side as he let it go he ran on for a couple of staggering steps then fell on his face he was still thrashing feebly when rollant pounded past him beyond another belt of trees the enemy had earthworks waiting the surviving pickets dove into them more traitors appeared on the shooting steps they gave avrams onrushing men a couple of crisp thoroughly professional volleys bell might have spent his men like coppers but the ones he had left still knew their business they knew it so well in fact that they knocked the southrons back on their heels and more men who had dashed forward suddenly dashed back stand lieutenant griff shouted his voice breaking in fury and humiliation stand gods damn you youve been through worse he was rightthey had at that particular moment though they werent much inclined to listen to him rollant had seen that before too theyd come up against the traitors trenches too soon too unexpectedly what they could have taken in stride had they been ready for it caught them by surprise and threw them into panic and so they fled it wasnt griffs company alone that made rollant feel a little better as he too fell back out of crossbow range from the northerners position all the southrons who came up against them recoiled the same way officers up and down the line screamed stand and hold fast you stupid cowardly sons of bitches and other such endearments and none of them did the least bit of good what saved the day oddly enough were the traitors themselves seeing the southrons taken with panic they swarmed out of their trenches and pursued roaring like lions all the while come on rollant shouted we can lick em now theyre up above ground same as we are he wasnt so vain as to imagine his voice turned the tide by itself that would have taken a man like fighting joseph now fighting no more he heard plenty of officers and underofficers and ordinary soldiers shouting the same thing in different words but his was one of the voices raised and by one of those chances the thunderer and the lion god might have understood but no mortal did the southrons threw off their fear as quickly as it had seized them they turned around and started plying the northern men with bolts pikemen tramped toward the foe in solid ranks and the traitors who had been storming forward as if this were the field by the river of death hesitated and then abruptly turned to flight themselves now their officers howled in dismay what had been a bid for revenge against the defeats theyd suffered closer to marthasville a few days before turned into another disaster now the northerners had attacked with all their old verve but hadnt been able to sustain it and when fear took them it seized them even harder than it had laid hold of the southrons stand hold shoot back gods damn you the traitors officers howled they might as well have told the hoocheecoochee river to quit flowing they could give all the orders they liked but the men in blue paid them no attention having decided they couldnt win the fight against the southrons they seemed to have decided all hope was lost and stampeded back toward jonestown whooping with glee the southrons pursued rollant ran right past a lieutenant from the army of franklin who was still shouting curses after his departed soldiers afterwards the blond wondered whether his comrades had captured the traitor or simply slain him he never found out so great was the northerners fear they made no serious stand in the trench lines their serfs had dug a few of them paused turned and shot and the oncoming southrons but most simply kept going escape was all they had in mind as they pelted back toward the hamlet of jonestown by the lion gods sacred eyeteeth lieutenant griff said in dazed tones i do believe we may bag them all may it be so sir rollant said he waved the standard again and again cheers answered him the southrons had no war cry to match the northern roar that cry put fear in the heart of any man who heard it but the shouts that burst from the throats of doubting georges men as they watched the enemy flee before them were ferocious enough for all ordinary use when the traitors reached the outskirts of jonestown they did manage a rally of sorts rollant soon saw why they were fighting to hold the southrons away from the glideway carpets that were even then carrying men in blue south out of the battle and back toward marthasville where are our catapults rollant shouted most of the heavy engines of course were back by marthasville too knocking the city down around the ears of its inhabitants and defenders but some lighter ones had come north with the crossbowmen and pikemen now they had a target about which the men who served them could usually but dream land a few firepots on those fleeing carpets and no small part of the army of franklins strength would go up in smoke those would be men roasting on the carpets of course rollant did his best not to think about that as long as they were only targets in his mind he wouldnt have to dwell on what their torment meant by reckoning him and his kind only serfs theyd played the identical game for centuries when the catapults did arrive though they pelted the rear guard in jonestown not the departing carpets most of which were out of range by then the traitors had engines of their own in the town and showed no hesitation about bombarding the southrons after rollant saw a soldier from his regiment turned to a running burning shrieking torch he stopped worrying about the rights and wrongs of war he was in it and beating down the enemy came before everything else doubting georges men didnt quite manage to bag all the traitors the rear guard fought skillfully and stubbornly and managed to withdraw south toward marthasville in good order they did know their business no doubt of that the war would have been much easier were they ignorant somehow even the partial failure seemed not to matter so much weve got the glideway rollant said as the sun set in blood ahead of him we didnt finish the traitors army that was smitty sounding as indignant as if he were marshal bart do you know what rollant said smitty shook his head no what your corporalship with all the answers sir rollant snorted youre impossible but ill tell you what anyhow were getting to where it doesnt matter whether we did or not weve got the glideway linethe lines i should say the rest will take care of itself behind captain gremio more firepots crashed into marthasville he could hear their hateful bursts the breeze was out of the west too so he could smell the smoke from the burning city he would have thought that by this time nothing much inside marthasville would burn he would have thought that but he would have been wrong every day the southrons started fresh fires they werent just heaving firepots into the city either a rending crash told of a great stone striking home a soldier from his company said there goes somebodys house to hells and gone the fellow was bound to be right when one of those heavy stones came down on something whatever it hit broke and if you dont believe me ask whats left of leonidas the priest gremio thought with funeralpyre humor he was tempted to use the joke out loud before he could colonel florizel called come on men move up the attack will go in in a few minutes he chuckled to himself go in is right isnt it when were trying to take the sweet ones shrine away from the southrons may she give them all a dose of the clap he extended the middle finger of his right hand in the usual detinan invocation of the goddess of love a lot of troopers imitated the gesture so did gremio be ready we have to be strong and fierce in the field sergeant thisbe spoke as if florizel hadnt if we dont lick the southrons here this army is in a lot of trouble we can do it thats right gremio said we canand weve got to if we can take away the sweet ones shrine and the high ground around it we cut off the wing thats grabbed our glideway lines east to dothan and up to the northern part of this province then we can break the stranglehold theyre putting on us and on marthasville his sword was loose in its sheath he went forward toward the shrine as if sure of victory in his heart he was anything but the army of franklin had lost south of marthasville it had lost west of marthasville what was left of roastbeef williams wing had come scurrying back to marthasville from jonestown in the north with its tail between its legs and now lieutenant general bell was ordering this attack east of the city why not gremio thought acidulously weve failed in the other three directions i supposebells trying for a clean sweep that wasnt fair gremio knew as much he was past caring he wished bell had remained a wing commander he was up to that job army commander on the face of things that seemed beyond himas far beyond him as mount panamgam home of the gods was beyond the sky colonel florizel still thought the sun god shone on bell day and night as far as florizel was concerned fighting was all that mattered whether you won or lost seemed much less important to him gremio had seen too much combat in the lawcourts and on the field to have much sympathy for that point of view pikemen formed up in front of the northern crossbowmen horns blared along with the rest of the officers in the attack gremio shouted forward he waved his sword he wouldnt lead his men anywhere he wouldnt go himself thats the spirit colonel florizel said and he brandished his own blade a moment later he turned to bawl something at another of his captains he wasnt keeping a special eye on gremio any more i did my best to get myself killed when we fought by goober creek gremio thought i didnt quite manage it but i did persuade florizel im no cowardfor a while anyhow no one had spoken about exactly where in front of the sweet ones temple the southrons had their lines gremio concluded that was because no one knew he wasnt surprised the whole war on both sides had gone like that with armies blundering past each other and into each other as if their commanders were blind men maybe they are it would explain some of the madness ive seen better than anything else i can think of old straights wing didnt blunder past the southrons it blundered straight into them discovering where they were by having a volley of crossbow quarrels tear into it at close range screams rose from the northerners but so did their roaring war cry forward gremio shouted now weve found the sons of bitches so lets go get em and for what seemed like the first time in this campaign the northerners had magecraft working for them thunderbolts crashed down on the southrons entrenchments dragons and other phantasms appeared in the sky gremio was a modern welleducated man he knew they couldnt hurt him and so they couldnt but if an ignorant farmers son believed the beasts could devour him or flame him his superstitious belief gave them the power to do just that roaring their throats raw the northerners swarmed down into the enemys trenches a lot of southrons there were already dead or hurt from the magecraft some of the ones who remained threw away their crossbows and shortswords and surrendered but others stubborn as if they were good northern men fought on despite long odds a crossbow bolt hissed past gremios ear as he jumped into the forwardmost trench his sword spitted the southron whod shot at him the man in gray howled and reeled back keep moving gods damn you gremio called to his men this isnt the fight we need weve got to get through these trenches and seize the shrine and the high ground around it if we cant manage that whatever we do here doesnt matter sometimes the soldiers did need reminding of such things to a lot of them as to florizel fighting was an end in itself not a means that struck gremio as madness but he knew it to be true even so onward he yelled again and looked along the trench to make sure the troopers could go on not far away sergeant thisbe battled a southron who had a better idea than most of his fellows about what to do with a shortsword gremio ran to thisbes aid the southron cared no more than any other soldier for the notion of fighting two foes at once he turned and fled thank you captain thisbe said youre welcome i know youd do the same for me gremio answered now weve got to get moving if we can drive them back from the shrine weve really done something out of the trenches and east once more pushed the northerners but they ran into another line of entrenchments only a furlong or so past the one theyd just cleared crossing the open ground cost them a lot of good men killed and wounded this time too the lightnings mostly missed when they struck at the southrons fieldworks little by little the enemys magic was coming up close to the level of that of king geoffreys wizards colonel florizel pointed with his sword at the trenches ahead charge he cried if sorcery wouldnt do the job crossbow quarrels and shortswords and pikes would have to still roaring like lions the northern men surged toward the second line of trenches theyd enjoyed the defenders advantage through most of the fights from borders up to marthasville no more now the southrons waited for them to come waited and took a heavy toll while they were in the open i cant go back gremio thought everyone in the regimenteveryone in the armywill reckon me a coward if i do and so he went forward in spite of the bolts that zipped past him and tugged at the fabric of his baggy pantaloons all around him men fell when he reached the second line of trenches he leaped down into it with a roar that was more than half a cry of despair more fierce fighting in the trenches slowed the northerners advance by the time the last southrons were down or fled gremio had a cut on his arm and another above his eye blood made tears run down his face he blinked constantly trying to clear his sight when he saw how few men he had left he wished his vision were blurrier so they would seem to be more well fought boys colonel florizel boomed they cant hold us back when we aim to go forward by the gods to gremios amazement the northerners raised a ragged cheer they were ready to do whatever their officers demanded of them and if every now and again those officers should happen to ask the impossible gremio knew the answer there hed seen it sometimes the men would give it to them others they died like flies proving it an impossibility after all form up dress your ranks florizel called when they struggled out of the southrons second line of fieldworks the regimental commander waited till the lines were neat enough to suit him then nodded in fussy satisfaction very good men nowforward forward they went once more after another couple of furlongs though they came upon a third line of entrenchments like the first two this one was full of southron soldiers they started volleying away at the northerners as soon as gremio and his comrades came into range and they had catapults to support them firepots flew through the air splashing flames over grassand men we cant take that position sir sergeant thisbe said urgently i dont think we can get into that trench im sure we wont come out again gremio was sure of the same thing but he was sure of something else too if the colonel orders me forward sergeant forward i shall go weve got to take the sweet ones shrine or die trying to the seven hells with the sweet one thisbe said shes a stinking lying bitch shell laugh when we die thats all it cant be helped sergeant gremio thought thisbe was right but he couldnt do anything about it he looked toward colonel florizel it was up to the regimental commander now to his dismay florizel was looking at him too do you want me to say we should go back sir gremio wondered to the hells with me if i will you wont get the chance to call me craven but florizel said its no good is it captain i am at your command sir gremio answered florizel shook his head its no good he repeated going forward into the teeth of their defenses would be murder nothing less shall i make you do duty as my barrister before the gods colonel i will obey any order you choose to give me gremio said and i promise you sir my men will follow me but its no good captain the regimental commander sounded like an old and broken man its no godsdamned good no good at all wed just get ourselves killed and we wouldnt shift the stinking southrons even an inch gremio had reached the same conclusion if florizel could see it it had to be correct he said sir the decision is yours florizel looked at himlooked through him i know what youre thinking youre thinking id reckon you a coward if you advised me to fall back he shook his head ive seen you fight i know better now you may not be a nobleman but youve got a pair of ballocks hanging from you for which i thank you punctiliously polite gremio bowed to his superior officer that might have saved his life for a crossbow quarrel whistled by over his head he shivered a little as he straightened i do not believe we have any hope of taking the position in front of us either nor do i see how we can seize the sweet ones shrine and the surrounding high ground in that case wed best save ourselves for the next fight wouldnt you say florizel asked there surely will be another fight colonel gremio replied and then try as he would couldnt help letting some acid out after all weve only failed to beat a bigger army four times in a row now bell will surely think thats an accident and send us out to try again when bell assumed command colonel florizel had been ecstatic i should have remembered that gremio thought but florizel only sighed and shrugged and said it hasnt quite worked has it maybe hell decide it wont work but even if we dont go after these bastards theyll come after us sure as hells he raised his voice to a full battlefield bellow trumpeters blow retreat the mournful notes rang out in their trenches the southrons raised a cheer the horn calls of both armies were the same and why not gremio thought it was all one army not so long ago florizels wasnt the only regiment falling back a couple of units tried last assaults against the southrons works which only got more men shot and burned to no purpose then they too withdrew toward the line from which theyd begun lieutenant general bell wont be very happy when he gets word of what happened here florizel predicted too bad gremio said im not very happy about it either his wounds were minor but they still stung with a shrug he went on of course nobody cares what i think florizel only growled and scowled and shook his head he didnt care what anybody thought not right then but sergeant thisbe said that isnt true sir thank you gremio said and felt better about retreating than he had doubting george stood atop the parapet in front of the earthworks the northerners had held between goober creek and marthasville these days bells army held a line just outside marthasvilles southern outskirts lieutenant general george was more than a little amazed the traitors still held the city bell was stubborner than hed thought general hesmucet was making bell pay for his stubbornness too from where george stood he had a fine view of the southrons siege engines lobbing destruction into marthasville pillars of smoke rose here and there in the besieged city even as he watched another fire started brigadier brannan came walking along what had been the traitors line the siegeengine specialist looked pleased with himself he looked even more pleased with the way things were going good morning sir he said beaming at doubting george now we get to see what our toys can do well i thought we already had a pretty fair notion of that george replied now lieutenant general bell gets to see what our toys can do and well find out how he likes it yes sir thats more or less what i meant sir brannan said getting besieged cant be much fun when weve got the power to burn the place where hes sheltering down around his ears i wouldnt think so anyhow george said and its not even as if marthasville had a strong central keep by the gods the towns only a generation old and nobody ever bothered building one here no one ever saw the need brannan said no little scorn in his voice for men who hadnt looked far enough ahead no one thought there would be a war between the provinces or that we would come so far if there were a keep wouldnt do bell much good anyhow doubting george observed even if he managed to stay inside it wed still squeeze the life out of marthasvillewed seize the glideways and wed wreck the manufactories thats right sir brigadier brannan nodded and grinned if bell wants to go out in a blaze of glory were giving him the chance as if to underscore his words yet another big fire broke out in marthasville if you were bell george said what would you do to get yourself out of the mess youd got yourself into brannans grin got wider you mean besides wish like hells geoffreyd never ever chosen me commander of the army of franklin george smiled too yes besides that by now hes seen he cant force us back from the city hes tried four times hes thrown away what has to be the third part of his army and he hasnt moved us a foot i expect hes finally drawing the right conclusions from that eh a blind man would by the gods sir a dead man would brannan answered of course whether bell would remains an open question naughty brigadierdistinctly naughty george said if he cant force us away from here what can he do i see two possibilities magic is one brannan said magic is always one where the northerners are concerned doubting george agreed the other is turning his unicornriders loose and wrecking the glideway line that comes up from rising rock and keeps us in food and firepots and such congratulations sir brigadier brannan said george raised a questioning eyebrow brannan explained i think youve just spelled out the meaning of what they call a theoretical possibility a theoretical possibility is one that might happen but wont george said sort of on the order of false king geoffreys turning out to be an honest man brannan guffawed george hadnt been joking or not very much he nourished a fine flourishing resentment against king avrams cousin for confiscating his estates in parthenia after he chose a united detina over the call of his province of course king avram had confiscated duke edward of arlingtons estates when edward chose parthenia over a united detina but george was on avrams side so he didnt fuss about that besides it wasnt his land but when general hesmucet summoned his wing commanders for a conference he wasnt quite so cheerful bells turned his unicornriders loose gods damn him he said theyre going to see how hungry they can make us well it could be worse sir john the lister said hes still got brigadier spinner in charge of his riders doesnt he thats right hesmucet gestured to his new wing commander i know what youre going to say duckyto the seven hells with me if i dont youre going to say itd be a lot worse if ned of the forest had charge of the traitors unicorns yes sir that is what i was going to say john agreed will you tell me im wrong not for a minute hesmucet said not even for half a minute what im going to tell you is im godsdamned glad youve got charge of that wing now and not fighting joseph any more hes a brave man and id never say anything less as far as that goes but hes a firstclass son of a bitch too and he never did bother learning much about the traitors commanders here in the east by his record he never bothered learning much about their commanders in the west either doubting george remarked i didnt say that hesmucet grinned i may have thought it as loud as i could but gods damn it to the hells i didnt say it sir that was brigadier oliver the late james the birds eyes successor sir must you take the names of the gods in vain quite so much he was earnest he was polite even plaintive he was properly subordinate by all the signs he even succeeded in embarrassing the commanding general that impressed george who hadnt been sure such a thing was possible after coughing a couple of times hesmucet said well brigadier i will try to do better ive had a ready tongue for a lot of years now though so i dont promise ill be perfect nor anywhere close the gods do admire effort sir brigadier oliver said as if the thunderer or perhaps the sweet one had come down from mount panamgam beyond the sky to whisper as much in his ear no god had ever come down and whispered in doubting georges ear given a choice he would have picked the sweet one for such a duty but men seldom got such choices and often got in trouble when they did resolutely pushing his mind away from what the love goddess whispers might be like he asked what are we going to do if spinners running loose what do you expect me to do hesmucet replied ill send marble bill out to keep spinners riders off our glideway line it was indeed the obvious answer john the lister pointed out what george hesitated to bills not the best commander of unicorns ever born no but neither is spinner so it evens out hesmucet said a point doubting george said after a little thought sure enough that is a point the bland fighting the bland you might say you might hesmucet said with a groan as for me i feel the same way about such things as brigadier oliver feels about taking the name of the gods in vain sir oliver said you dont have a religious duty to punish those who make foolish jokes no eh hesmucet rumbled well gods bless it i ought to have such a duty every righteous man ought to have such a duty he glowered at george dont you agree lieutenant general well sir actually i am more inclined toward mercy george replied my notion is the gods make note of everything they say i expect they can deal with these matters in their own good time hmm hesmucet gave him a severe look why do i suspect youre saying that because youre the culprit here i havent the faintest idea sir doubting george repliedblandly i assure you id do the same for anyone else of course you assure me of that hesmucet said you assure me of all manner of nonsensical things and godsdamned lies he sounded so pugnacious brigadier oliver spoke up again sir you would be welladvised to show mercy to those who disagree with you not to revile them no where hesmucet had sounded fierce while teasing george now he really was george could tell the difference hesmucet pointed north toward marthasville saying what i aim to do with those who disagree with meand who disagree with king avram gods bless himis whip them right out of their boots he walked over and set a hand on doubting georges shoulder and thats why i put up with this son of a bitch in spite of his foolishness put him in the field against the traitors and hes a tiger next to that nothing else matters not even a little bit oliver bowed he was a fussily precise man as stern with himself as he was with everyone else very well sir he said on that i cannot presume to disagree with you turning he bowed to george as well this i must say i find strange for in our days at annasville i reckoned the distinguished general likelier to fight on the other side than on ours george had reckoned oliver an officious prig he hadnt been shy about letting the world know what he reckoned either he said brigadier we still disagree about what ought to happen to the serfs in this kingdom but we agree wholeheartedly that detina is a kingdom not two or three or six kingdoms and that outweighs the rest indeed it does oliver said indeed it does i rejoice that the gods have put a sufficiency of truth into your heart sir even if not its very fullest measure the measure that would make you recognize all of mankind regardless of outer seeming as your brethren he still preaches too godsdamned much doubting george thought but hes a pretty fair soldier himself even so aloud he said i dont want to recognize all of mankind as my brethren if i did id miss watching pretty girls and that would be a shame hesmucet chuckled john the lister laughed out loud oliver clicked his tongue between his teeth and looked pained oh dear george thought he doesnt approve of watching pretty girls either well too bad for him perhaps finding it a good time to change the subject john the lister asked general hesmucet sir do i understand correctly that we dont intend to try storming marthasville not right now anyhow the commanding general answered we might take iti think we would take it but i also think a direct assault would be expensive and the mourning boxes in the papers down south are long enough already lets see how bell likes having the place torn down around his ears without his being able to do anything about it lets see how he likes that after false king geoffrey charged him to hold the town too doubting george added that did cross my mind yes hesmucet said i wouldnt want to have dear geoffrey screaming at me right now but then you lieutenant general would know more about such things than i do wouldnt you not much sir george replied i knew i would serve a united detina as soon as palmetto province pulled out geoffrey confiscated my lands as soon as parthenia went with it and i declined to join him to the seven hells with him but only from a distance its been years since i last saw him face to face may the next time we see him be when he meets the headsman hesmucet took a flask from his belt yanked out the cork raised the flask high and drank that done he loudly smacked his lips and passed it to doubting george general guildenstern had been in the habit of carrying a flask on his belt too hed also been in the habit of getting drunk from it bart now bart had sternly stayed dry for hed been known to wet himself to the drowning point george had seen hesmucet drink but hed never seen him anywhere close to drunk he drank too in the same mostly moderate way he took the flask and swigged sweet fire ahh he said wiping his mouth on his sleeve peachtree province peach brandy what could be better thank you kindly sir john the lister said when george offered him the flask he took a pull and gave it to brigadier oliver the onearmed man shook his head no thank you i have never drunk spirituous liquors i do not believe it to be virtuous why not doubting george asked genuinely curious i can see not drinking on account of you dont want to get drunk but why not enjoy it if youre a man who can hold it we are enough like beasts as things stand sir oliver said such drink only brings us closer to them im not worried about getting close to the beasts george said what i want to do is get close to marthasville he hesmucet and john the lister all laughed and all swigged again brigadier oliver also laughed politely but stuck to water smoke was a stench in lieutenant general bells nostrils every firepot that burst and spread new flames in the streets of marthasville seemed a personal reproach he went through even more laudanum than he would have on account of his wounds it didnt do much to blur his sense of guilt but it did do something sir major zibeon said and then again louder sir eh bell came out of the laudanum haze what is it major sir theres a delegation of citizens whod like to speak to you for a few minutes waiting outside his aidedecamp replied citizens bell echoed irritably what in the hells do a pack of citizens know not bloody much thats what zibeon didnt say anything he only waited bell scowled what do they want do they want me to surrender to that bastard of a hesmucet i wont do it what would king geoffrey do to me if i did geoffrey was much less happy with him now than on naming him commander of the army of franklin gods damn it i did what he wanted bell thought petulantly i went out there and i fought i did all i could i almost won joseph the gamecock couldnt have done any better im sure of that nearly sure zibeon shook his head no they dont want surrender but they are looking for some sort of relief any sort of relief from the infernal bombardment the southrons are making us take what would they have me do bell demanded zibeons dour face got no lighter sir i dont know he answered shrugging to find that out youd have to talk to them oh very well bell said sourly he wanted to talk to civilians about as much as he wanted to lose his other leg but sometimes there was no help for a situation his repeated attacks against hesmucets army had shown him that that he might not have made those attacks never ever occurred to him who are these sons of bitches anyhow he asked not bothering to keep his voice down one is called jim the ball sir the other is jim of the crew zibeon replied they are both merchants of some considerable wealth with a martyred sigh bell yielded to necessity very well major you may send them in and we shall see what sort of wisdom they offer he rolled his eyes to show how little he expected one look told him how jim the ball had got his name the man was nearly spherical and his tunic and pantaloons contained enough material for a couple of tents jim of the crew by contrast was tall and slim and muscularthe crew to which he belonged was probably that of a river galley he bowed to bell jim the ball might have done the same but he was so round bell had trouble being sure good day gentlemen bell said wishing he were somewhere elsepreferably at the head of a victorious army halfway down to the border with franklin what can i do for you today sir jim the ball said the southrons aredestroying marthasvilleone pieceat a time he was so very fat he had to pause and sip air every few words we want you to let them know how barbarous it is to pound a city to pieces with civilians still in it jim of the crew added he could speak a whole sentence without needing several breaths to finish it why do you suppose general hesmucet would pay the least attention to such a plea bell asked why do youthink he wouldnt jim the ball replied again putting a caesura in his sentence you said it for yourself sir he is a barbarous man bell said what by the gods have we got to lose jim of the crew said if we go to him under flag of truce and he sends us away were no worse off than we were but if he says yes we save whats still standing anyhow bell plucked at his beard a letter cost him nothing these fellows were right about that and complaining to hesmucet might make him look better in the eyes of the world the north could trumpet about hesmucets cruelty and iniquity if he kept on pounding marthasville after being begged to stop the world outside detinathe kingdoms on the far side of the western oceanhad been trying to pretend the north didnt exist no one recognized geoffrey as a sovereign among sovereigns it was humiliating it was infuriating and the north could do not a thing about it pointing at the two merchants bell asked if i draft this missive would you be willing to carry it through the lines to hesmucet they looked at each other then both nodded several of jim the balls chins wobbled at the motion yes sir he said wed be happy to sir jim of the crew agreed very well then bell said return here in two days time and we shall see what we shall see yes sir thank you sir jim the ball said well be here if we havent been burned to charcoal well be here jim of the crew added if the southrons havent attacked well be here they wont attack bell spoke with great conviction how do you know that jim of the crew asked pressing harder on the commander of the army of franklin than he had any business doing but bell answered how do i know sir ill tell you how because theyre a pack of cowards if they werent a pack of cowards afraid of showing themselves outside of entrenchments they would already have attacked marthasville they wouldnt do what theyre doing to its defenseless civilian population he thought hed impressed the two civilians but as they were leaving jim of the crew turned to jim the ball and said if the stinking southrons are such great cowards how come they whipped us every time we tried to go after em around this city beats me jim the ball said thats what i saidtheyve beaten us jim of the crew told him theyve beaten us like a godsdamned drum i dont care whos king over us any more as long as all these fornicating armies go straight to the seven hells and gone lieutenant general bell almost shouted for his provost guards to arrest jim of the crew as a traitor to king geoffrey but then he shook his head sending the merchant and his chum across the lines to general hesmucet struck him as a worse punishment with any luck at all the southrons would miss their flag of truce and fill them full of crossbow quarrels and it couldnt happen to a more deserving pair he thought maliciously still the idea of writing a formal letter of complaint to hesmucet had an undeniable appeal major zibeon bell called sir his aidedecamp said if hed heard the scathing remarks from the two civilians he didnt show it fetch me pen and paper if you please yes sir zibeon replied do you really think general hesmucet will heed your request sir i havent the faintest idea bell said but were no worse off for finding out are we no sir major zibeon admitted even writing came hard for bell most men wrote with one hand and steadied the paper with the other bells left arm was only a dead weight his left hand useless and inert he had to put a large stone at the top of the sheet zibeon found for him he gnawed at his luxuriant mustache as he groped for words permit me to say sir he wrote that the unprecedented measures you have taken against this city transcend in studied and ingenious cruelty all acts ever brought to my attention in the long and dark history of war in the names of the gods of humanity i protest believing that you will find that you are depriving of their homes and firesides the wives and children of a brave people this calculated cruelty can only redound to the disgrace of the sovereign whom you serve and to your own give over while yet you may i am general very respectfully your obedient servant bell lieutenant general he signed his name with a flourish and sanded the letter dry then he used wax and his signet to seal it he thought of summoning jim the ball and jim of the crew to take it at once but didnt after jim of the crews gibe he almost hoped a firepot burst on the merchants roof before the appointed day roastbeef william came to see him that left him imperfectly delighted with the world he would almost rather have seen the two merchants again but william was a wing commander and so not easy to ignore what can i do for you lieutenant general bell asked after the older man had made his bows well sir i was wondering what sort of plan you had for getting us out of the fix were in roastbeef william replied i have sent forth brigadier spinners unicornriders as you know to strike against general hesmucets supply line bell said that he was reduced to such small strokes galled him that even such small strokes hadnt done all he wanted galled him even more roastbeef william knew what spinner had done tooand more important what he hadnt supplies are still coming through to the enemy he remarked i know that bell said testily his arm and his leg hurt more than usual he longed for laudanum but what would you have me do do you suppose we can make another sally and drive the godsdamned southrons back from marthasville he leaned forward eagerly awaiting williams reply if the wing commander thought another attack might succeed he would order it he hadnt lost the desire to hit back at the southrons only most of the means if roastbeef william reckoned those available but william shook his head no sir we havent really got the men to stand siege any more let alone strike out that was why i came to see you say on bell said ominously you know as well as i do sir that the southrons are extending their lines north of the city towards the west william said if they keep moving theyll have us altogether surrounded before long and then unless we can break through their lines they wont just have marthasville theyll have the army of franklin too that was all too likely to be true lieutenant general bell liked it no better for its truthliked it less if anything he scowled at william who stared stolidly back and what would you recommend then he asked in an icy voice if we cant hold the city sir dont you think wed better save the army the wing commander said we can get away at need before hesmucet finishes his ring around marthasville before i say but not afterwards i cant abandon the city bell said what would king geoffrey do to me if i lost the city what would he do to you if you lost the city and the army too roastbeef william asked in return i cant pull out yet bell said im uh conferring with hesmucet trying to get him to keep from burning marthasville with the civilians still in it are you william raised a bushy eyebrow i hadnt supposed you cared much about the civilians hereabouts till jim the ball and jim of the crew came to him bell hadnt cared much about the local civilians but with such indignation as he could muster he said of course i do if it werent for civilians king geoffrey wouldnt have a kingdom now would he of course not roastbeef william replied im not saying youre wrong sir only that you surprised me do you think theres any chance hesmucet will listen to you i dont know bell said but he will look like the villain he is if he doesnt so there may be some hope for it well there may be something to that william said by the lion gods twitching tail tuft i hope there isfor the folk of marthasville if for no other reason bell bristled he knew what that had to mean you dont believe we can hold this city he said in accusing tones i wish we could the wing commander said think so no in my view as i told you our choice is between losing the city and losing the city and the armythis in spite of anything hesmucet may say or do in aid of your letter it may buy us a few days time which is all to the good but it will do no more joseph the gamecock was dismissed from command of this army for voicing opinions less gloomy than those bell growled joseph had less reason for pessimism for he had more men with whom to work roastbeef william replied he tipped his hat good day sir only after the older man was gone did bell realize hed been given the glove cursing he yanked out his bottle of laudanum and took a long swig after a little while he felt better general hesmucet swung his head from jim the ball to jim of the crew and back again jim the ball fascinated him he didnt think hed ever seen a fatter man the two merchants from marthasville nervously looked back yes you can give me bells letter he said i do respect a flag of truce gentlemeni wont eat you and if i did decide to order the two of you butchered jim the ball could subsist my whole army for a couple of weeks jim of the crew as it happened had the letter he handed it to hesmucet here you are sir thank you kindly hesmucet unsealed the letter and flattened it out in his hands ah good he said lieutenant general bell writes in a tolerably large script i wont have to fish out my spectacles to read this no indeed people seem to write smaller every godsdamned year but not today he went through the letter in a hurry then rolled it up again and set it on the light folding table he was using for a desk isis therea reply sir jim the ball asked his speech oddly punctuated by breaths yes there is but ill give it in writing properly it goes to bell himself and not to either of you hesmucet answered im going to send you to refresh yourselves while i draft it if you dont mind jim of the crew simply nodded jim the ball looked eager hesmucet shook his head the one who needs refreshments least wants them most isnt that the way of the world he sat down behind the folding table got out some paper and inked a pen to lieutenant general bell commanding the army offranklin he wrote general i have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of this date at the hands of jim the ball and jim of the crew concerning my armys bombardment of marthasville you style my measures unprecedented and appeal to the dark history for a parallel as an act of studied and ingenious cruelty it is not unprecedented nor is it necessary to appeal to the dark history of war when recent modern examples are so handy you yourself burned dwellinghouses along your parapet you defended marthasville on a line so close to town that every firepot and many crossbow quarrels from our line of investment that overshot their mark went into the habitations of women and children roastbeef william did the same at jonestown i challenge any fair man to judge which of us has the heart of pity for the families of a brave people in the name of commonsense i ask you not to appeal to the just gods in such a sacrilegious manner you and your faction in the midst of peace and prosperity have plunged a kingdom into wardark and cruel waryou who dared and badgered us to battle insulted our flag and seized our arsenals and forts you made prisoners of war of the very garrisons sent to protect your people against wild blond tribes long before any overt act was committed by the to you hated government of king avram if we must be enemies let us be men and fight it out as we propose to do and not deal in such hypocritical appeals to gods and humanity the gods will judge in due time i am very respectfully your obedient servant hesmucet general commanding well he muttered as he sealed the letter if that doesnt make the son of a bitch have a spasm gods damn me to the hells if i know what would he called for a runner and said fetch back those two fellows from marthasville ive got their answer ready for em yes sir the young soldier in gray hurried off when the two northern merchants returned jim the ball was still gnawing on a fried chicken drumstick speaking with his mouth full he said thank youfor the hospitalityyouve shownto a couple of menfrom theother side youre welcome hesmucet handed him the letter take this back to lieutenant general bell if youd be so kind youll have an escort to the front and your flag of truce should get you through to your own side can you give us the gist of it in case it gets wet or meets some other accident jim of the crew asked certainly hesmucet said the gist of it is no but i do write it down much fancier than that jim the ball tossed aside the bare chicken bone jim of the crew nodded he seemed to have a good deal more wit than his comrade and namesake maybe that was just because he displayed less appetite a man who gave in to his belly as jim the ball did often gave the impression true or false of lacking any other interests when the two merchants had left hesmucet read over bells letter again he shook his head in amusement the man had to be an optimist to think he would get hesmucet to change his course the only way northern commanders had got him to change his course was to beat him on the battlefield and that hadnt happened very often that evening he showed doubting george the letter his secondincommand went through it then remarked hes trying to make you look bad in the eyes of the world i think i dont care how i look in the eyes of the world hesmucet checked himself i dont care how i look in the eyes of the world so long as i look like the man who just took marthasville i understand sir i agree with you george replied a soldier wont usually worry about the war of words till he sees its the only war he has the faintest hope of winning thats well put thats very well put in fact hesmucet said thank you kindly doubting george said bells thrown away so many soldiers words are about what he has left i expect you answered him the way he deserves sir i hope so hesmucet summarized his own letter george nodded thats good thats very good indeed with any luck at all hell have an apoplexy and then theyll need a new commander he thought about that then shook his head no i hope he doesnt have that apoplexy let him stay in command hes done us a lot of good i think so too hesmucet said he had to be a fool to try to slug it out with us he did it anyhowand proved how foolish it was only a matter of time now george said hesmucet nodded but discontentedly weve taken too long already gods damn it down in the south they want a victory we need to give them one were doing all right george insisted marshal bart has duke edward of arlington penned up in pierreville north of nonesuch and weve got bell pretty well trapped here they arent going to get loose and cause trouble the way they did last year and the year before you know that and i know that but do the fat burghers sitting on their backsides down in the south know that hesmucet said nonesuch hasnt fallen and marthasville hasnt fallen either if those fat burghers get sick of the war false king geoffrey may end up a real king after all we need to take that town in front of us that will give the whole south a sign we really are winning the war it wont be long doubting george said again would bell have written a letter like that if he didnt feel the pinch well maybe not hesmucet said i hope he wouldnt anyway but i still want marthasville he got his answer from lieutenant general bell two days later again delivered by jim the ball and jim of the crew he sent them off to eat which would at least keep jim the ball happy unsealing the letter he read general i have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the day previous had you not sought to justify yourself therein i would have been willing to believe that while the interests of the king of detina in your opinion compelled you to an act of barbarous cruelty you regretted the necessity and we would have dropped the subject but you have indulged in statements which i feel compelled to notice you are unfortunate in your attempt to find a justification for this act of cruelty either in the defense of jonestown by roastbeef william or of marthasville by myself if there was any fault in either case it was your own in not giving notice especially in the case of marthasville of your purpose to bombard the town which is usual in war among civilized kingdoms i have too good an opinion founded both upon observation and experience of the skill of your catapult men to credit the insinuation that they for several weeks unintentionally shot too high for my modest field works and slaughtered women and children by accident and want of skill finally you came into our country with your army avowedly for the purpose of subjugating free detinan men women and children and not only intend to rule over them but you make blonds your allies and desire to place over us an inferior race which we have raised from barbarism to its present position which is the highest ever attained by that race in all time you say let us fight it out like men to this my reply isfor myself and i believe for all the true men aye and women and children in my kingdomwe will fight you to the death better to die a thousand deaths than submit to live under you or your king or his blond allies respectfully your obedient servant bell lieutenant general hesmucet read through that again and then chuckled grimly well i struck a nerve there all right gods damn me if i didnt he said and set bells letter aside the northern commander could complain all he chose but he couldnt stop the southrons from doing what needed doing and that was what counted the commanding general called for a runner what do you need sir the messenger asked i want you to send an alert to the scryers for the soldiers in the forwardmost entrenchments hesmucet answered warn them that the traitors are liable to try to sally against them today bell may have lost his temper yes sir ill pass it along directly the runner said uh sir how do you know that if you dont mind my asking why lieutenant general bell told me so of course hesmucet answered deadpan the runner started to accept that then turned and stared hesmucet waved him on he went away shaking his head hesmucet laughed softly the things i do to keep my air of mystery he thought what he did next was summon major alva what can i do for you the young mage asked hesmucet folded his arms across his chest and waited belatedly alva turned red uh sir he added he still didnt remember to salute hesmucet would have been merciless with most men who stayed so ignorant of military courtesy the license he allowed major alva measured how much the mage impressed him i want you to do your best to learn if the traitors are planning any great magical stroke against us hesmucet said well ill try alva answered hesmucets arms remained across his chest he drummed his fingers on his sleeves ill try sir alva said you do understand though that their spells may cloak whatever theyre up to wont that cloaking tell you something in and of itself hesmucet asked it may sir little by little alva got the idea it may but it may not too one of the things wizards do is they make cloaking spells that dont cloak anything people who run into those spells have to probe them because they may be hiding something important i am familiar with the idea of deception yes hesmucet said oh good major alvas tone plainly implied that a lot of the officers he dealt with werent when do you want this magecraft performed sir immediately hesmucet told him sooner would be nice how could i perform it sooner than immediately alva blinked then sent hesmucet an accusing stare officers who werent perfectly literalminded seemed outside his ken too be thankful youre not working for doubting george hesmucet said hed drive you straight around the bend he would why is that sir alva asked never mind hesmucet answered if im standing here explaining you cant go to work immediately and thats what i want you to do yes sir alva said resignedly i cant perform the spells immediately you know they will take some time yes yes hesmucet said i do understand that if it werent for time everything would happen at once and wed all be very confused major alva gave him a curious look but the wizard decided not to ask any questions which was a wise decision he did salute on leaving that was wise too and he hurried away which was also a good idea when he came backnot quite immediately but close enough to keep hesmucet from complaininghe wore a troubled expression the masking spells are extraordinarily deep extraordinarily thick he complained im not sure i got through all of them i dont like the sound of that hesmucet said what are they hiding im not sure alva answered im not sure theyre hiding anything but im not sure theyre not either what are we supposed to be doing about that hesmucet asked i dont know sir alva replied youre the commanding general hesmucet grunted after some thought he said all we can do is go on if they throw sorcery at us well do our best to throw it back and well lick them any which way by the gods we will x firepots kept bursting inside marthasville spreading destruction farther with each passing day north of the city southron soldiers began moving toward the west and south aiming at completing the ring around it with all the glideways leading into the place in southron hands only wagons could bring in victuals through the narrowing gap in the enemys lines roastbeef william knew all too well that wagons could not keep the army of franklin fed no matter how badly its numbers had shrunk because of the recent string of lost battles when he said as much to bell the general commanding gave him a cold stare if your men had held at jonestown lieutenant general we would still hold a glideway with which to bring in necessities bell said i am sorry sir roastbeef william did his best to hold on to his temper with my little force i was a boy trying to do a mans job we must have been outnumbered three or four to one no one could have held against those odds so you say now bell snapped what it looks like to me is that your soldiers were too afraid to come out of their entrenchments and give the southrons a proper fight that did it you may criticize me all you please william said but sooner than criticizing the courage of my menwho are i remind you also your menyou would do better to look in the mirror you were the one who sent me north to jonestown sure the southrons would have only a small force in the neighborhood your judgment there proved as wrong as most of your other judgments since taking command of this army sir lieutenant general bell flushed you are insubordinate and you are incompetent but if roastbeef william said that he would be insubordinate a dogged sense of duty kept him from doing anything likely to get him removed from command of his wing though escape from the army of franklin looked more inviting with every passing day without false modesty he was sure whoever replaced him would do worse he didnt know how much he could help the army in its present agony but he didnt want to hurt it he said i told you several days ago that i did not think we could hold marthasville nothing has happened since to make me change my mind did your correspondence with general hesmucet bear any fruit bell flushed again none whatsoever he growled he does not fear the gods he is blind to shame he has proved himself a liar of the purest ray serene he will not do what i wanted him to do that was what bell had to mean roastbeef william had no great trouble making the translation that being so sir whats now to be done he asked bells head went back and forth back and forth like that of a caged animal i dont know gods damn it i just dont know the comparison to a caged animal unfortunately was all too apt will you lose marthasville sir or will you lose marthasville and your army william inquired thats the only choice you have left i cant leave marthasville bell moaned i dont dare leave marthasville what will king geoffrey say if i do what will the king say if you dont william returned what will he say if youre trapped here with your army go away bell said this is not a choice i have to make on the instant and i do not intend to yes sir roastbeef william replied polite again but dont take too longthere i beg you on bended knee if the manacles close around us i dont think we can break free of them go away bell said again and william went men marched to and fro through the streets of marthasville roastbeef william looked on the activity as he would have looked on the thrashings of a man about to die of smallpox they seemed dramatic but in fact meant nothing the man would die the city would fall william didnt know when and he didnt know how not yet of the thing itself he had no doubts whatever he rode back to his own headquarters which he kept as far from that of lieutenant general bell as he could he still hadnt forgiven bell for sending him up to jonestown without enough men to do the job required of him bell had thought he could not only hold the southrons but drive them back but hesmucets army had proved larger and stronger than bell imagined i was the one who had to pay the price for his mistake roastbeef william thought as he dismounted from his unicorn i had to pay for it and i got blamed for it otherwise he would have had to blame himself and its plain hes not very good at that a couple of wizards in long blue robes came out of the house william was using and hurried up the street in the direction from which hed come where away so fast william called after them one of the mages condescended to turn around he answered lieutenant general bell has summoned us sir he aims to strike yet another blow against the godsdamned southrons does he roastbeef william said the wizard nodded then hustled off down the street william started to hurl another question after him then decided not to bother here for once he completely approved of whatever bell tried to do the southrons had too many men too many engines to make charging into battle against them a good bet bell had needed four stinging defeats to see as much but roastbeef william was glad he finally had in magecraft though where the balance of power lay wasnt nearly so obvious maybe well get some good out of this william thought it would be nice if we got some good somewhere we havent seen much lately all he could do was send orders to his men to keep them alert in case the southrons in front of them tried to storm marthasville he wasnt sure they could hold back the southrons but he did intend to try four lost battles he grumbled though no one was listening even after hed been driven out of jonestown bell had struck at the southrons again this time east of marthasville that hadnt worked either roastbeef william shook his head bell seemed to have a hard time learning some lessons william braced himself for lightnings and thunderbolts and dragons in the air and all the rest of the extravagant wizardry northern mages had at their disposal he didnt know whether wizardry could win the day hereabouts he did know nothing else was likely to not for king geoffreys cause when darkness fell at noon the next day hope surged in roastbeef william when lightnings crackled through the darkness he sent up prayers to the lion god and the thunderer when the earth trembled beneath his feet he cried out for joy certain the sorcerers had found ways to do what lieutenant general bell could not but the southrons didnt flee their lines in wild disorder they didnt flee at all the lightnings crackled but few smote the shaking earth didnt shake their trenches to pieces and entomb the enemy soldiers in them and the darkness that had fallen at noon lifted by half past one when the mages attached to roastbeef williams wing returned from the headquarters of the general commanding they were in a sad state they all looked thinner than they had on going off to serve lieutenant general bell their robes were limp and stained with sweat the sharp reek of fear filled williams nostrils in the name of the gods what happened he demanded we were beaten one of the wizards replied in a hollow voice his eyes were wide and staring as if hed seen things men were not meant to see the southrons beat us at sorcery what is the the world coming to when such a disaster can come to pass i dont know william was also troubled if soldiers hadnt beaten back king avrams armies and if magic also looked like failing what remained for the north not much the words tolled like mourning bells inside roastbeef williams mind he asked what do we do now what can we do now sir i dont know the mage said i havent any idea all i know is i want to go to bed and sleep for a year if youll excuse me sir he staggered off not really caring whether william excused him or not william knew he should have gone to see bell again to plan the next move for the army of franklin he knew but he couldnt bring himself to do it he might have been someone hesitating to enter a sickroom that held a loved one who would die soonsuch images kept cropping up in his mind duty called yes but sometimes even duty did no good what could he say now that hadnt already been said bell knew what shape the army was in would he choose to let it perish even if he didnt how could he hope to save marthasville as far as william could see none of those questions had answers he cared to contemplate what do we do what can we do wait for the death burn the body and then try to pick up the pieces that was all he saw ahead two days later the only thing that had changed was that the southrons were several miles closer to drawing their ring around marthasville roastbeef william had trouble caring even about that he was sunk in such gloom when major zibeon came to his headquarters and said lieutenant general bell requests your presence at once sir he does eh roastbeef william eyed bells aidedecamp with more than a little curiosity what does he need me for in such a tearing hurry i couldnt presume to say sir zibeon replied no william doubted that and doubting wished doubting george had chosen geoffrey over avram any aidedecamp worth his boots had a pretty good idea of what his principal was thinking well ill come and find out thanks zibeon said as if roastbeef william were doing him a favor rather than obeying an order william scratched his head bells dour aidedecamp rarely wasted politeness on anyone but the commanding general and sometimes not on him but zibeon went on ride with me if you care to sir i dont mind if i do roastbeef william gave zibeon a quizzical look are you feeling all right no zibeon said and said not another word till they got to bells headquarters then he unbent enough to add youll see what roastbeef william saw was that lieutenant general bell was smiling he wondered how much laudanum bell had had he would have thought that enough to make bell happy would also have been enough to stop bells heart but the commanding general said good day william i am convinced we finally have the southrons where we want them sir roastbeef william said in real astonishment bell nodded just so they think to trap us here by the gods i shant allow it we shall break out from this prison in which they seek to contain us and then strike with all our strength at the glideway linethe single glideway linethat keeps them fed and supplied what can they do when they start to starve run back to franklin with their tails between their legs thats what that is a most ambitious plan sir william said at last but it will work bell said claws of the lion god it will work if we can hit them one good lick slowly roastbeef william nodded bell wasnt thinking about abandoning marthasville he was thinking about attacking the enemy as long as he thought about the attack the abandonment wouldnt bother him under other circumstances that would have horrified roastbeef william as things were it left him more pleased than otherwise if the army of franklin didnt get out of marthasville before long it wouldnt be able to get out of marthasville and so with another nod william said i think you have a good plan there sir we should commence without delay see to it then bell saidhe wasnt and never would be any sort of military administrator draft the necessary orders for my signature yes sir william said resignedly i should have expected this he thought i suppose youll want to destroy whatever supplies we cant take with us indeed bell said which meant he hadnt thought of that for himself take care of all the details thats why i rely on you yes sir thank you so much sir but then roastbeef william shook his head dont put his back up hes doing what needs doing if too much of the work falls on your shoulders then it does thats all were going to make hesmucet wish he never came so far up into peachtree province bell declared hell rue the daysee if he doesnt and the general commanding had some chance of being right william could see as much see it very clearly the odds were still long but they were better than they would be if the army of franklin stayed here in marthasville and waited for doom to fall on it give me pen and paper sir roastbeef william said ill get to work on those orders right now lieutenant general bell laughed thats the man i knew i had the godsdamned southrons will be sorry yet heres hoping youre right sir william said wheres that paper i want to make sure this is done the way it ought to be gremio touched a torch to a pile of crates as they began to burn he said i wonder whats in these wait a while and see what they smell like sergeant thisbe suggested no time gremio said weve got a lot more burning to do and do you know what else its more fun than i thought it would be fun i dont know about that thisbe said what i do know is weve got to do this or else the southrons will march into marthasville and use everything we couldnt take with us me im just glad were getting out of marthasville captain gremio said i thought wed stay penned up here till the southrons took us he paused to set another fire sounds like lieutenant general bells got himself another idea thisbe started a new fire too he looked at the incendiary madness all around as gremio was doing between the southrons and us there wont be a whole lot of marthasville left after all this is done good gremio said which made the sergeant send him a startled look he explained better we dont leave hesmucet anything much to get his hands on something to that sir i suppose thisbe said but its hard its mighty hard on the people who live here to the seven hells with the people who live here gremio thought callously he couldnt see that the folk of peachtree province or satrap brown had done anywhere near enough to help the army of franklin defend this vital town but he didnt say that out loud hed seen that sergeant thisbe was more inclined to give people the benefit of the doubt than he was himself unless he was paid to do so come on you men colonel florizel boomed to the regiment as a whole if were going to deny the enemy these goods lets not shillyshally around lets make a fire the foe will remember to the end of his days something like wonder in his voice thisbe said the colonels having a good time well why not said gremio who was having a good time himself doesnt this take you back to the days when you were a boy starting fires and raising hells for the sport of it i hadnt thought of it like that thisbe admitted youre too responsible now thats why gremio said youre far and away the best sergeant ive ever known if youd let me put you up for a sir i dont want a promotion thisbe said firmly and gremio had to give it up again his long thin face lit by the hellsish glare of burning supplies brigadier alexander the steward stalked among the men of his wing hurry it up there old straight called to the soldiers set the fires and then form up to move out of marthasville weve still got a hells of a lot of fighting ahead of us alexanders tone went further to reassure captain gremio than any of the orders lieutenant general bell had given lately those orders as florizel had read them out seemed an odd mixture of defiance and desperation gremio had trouble figuring out whom bell was defying the enemy or the gods themselves the cause for the desperation however seemed obvious enough douse torches colonel florizel shouted form up instead of dousing his torch gremio threw it onto a fire already burning sergeant thisbes joined it a moment later officer and underofficer grinned at each other gremio called my companyform up get moving thisbe echoed you know what needs doing do it and dont make a fuss about it as the sun rose the army of franklin marched out of marthasville to the northwest the only gap remaining in the line the southrons were throwing around the city gremio didnt know how many men general hesmucet had close by that worried him but the southrons evidently doubted they had enough for a successful attack on bells army for it escaped without incident seeing land that hadnt been fought over was something of a relief pretty good country colonel florizel allowed not so nice as around karlsburg back in palmetto province but pretty good even so yes sir gremio nodded but do you see how many of the serfs huts are standing empty most of the blonds have run off to the southrons gods damn them and gods damn that wretch of a king avram florizel said how are the lords around these parts going to make a crop now they probably wont gremio answered but i dont think hesmucet cares do you do i care florizel saidwhether sardonic or obtuse gremio couldnt tell godsdamned right i care this is my kingdom of course i care what happens to it its that son of a bitch of a hesmucet who doesnt care yes sir gremio said resignedly he looked back over his shoulder at the great columns of smoke still rising from marthasville either a few soldiers remained behind setting still more fires or the ones already set had spread from abandoned supplies to the city itself gremio wondered how hard the southrons would try to put those fires out not very unless he missed his guess where do you suppose well go sir sergeant thisbe asked after theyd marched for a while south i suppose gremio replied i dont know just when but id think were going to have to do that if we strike at hesmucets glideway line maybe his army will starve and break up that would be a splendid victory thisbe said so it would gremio didnt tell the sergeant he found it unlikely he found any hope of victory unlikely saying as much would have discouraged those who might be more optimistic though and so he held back the men had enough trouble keeping their spirits up as things were well before noon southron unicornriders began dogging the army of franklin they didnt attack they just hung close gremio waited for the aggressive bell to order his own riders to drive them away those orders didnt come what does that mean he wondered did bell think his unicornriders couldnt drive back the southrons or was he so desperate to get away from marthasville that he didnt want to waste time fighting whichever the answer gremio didnt think it boded well for his force when he cautiously remarked on that florizel said i doubt the southrons will bother us much for a little while theyll be too busy with marthasville dont you think gremio clicked his tongue between his teeth considering you could well be right sir he said weve given em a present the regimental commander said theyll take it why wouldnt they its sitting there for em all sweet and juicy as a blond wench with her legs open and losing it hurts us gremio added colonel florizel nodded and losing it hurts us he agreed wed better cut their army off from its supplies or geoffreys badly wounded you dont usually talk like that sir gremio said and the last time i talked like that you came as near as near can be to calling me a coward i had to try to get myself killed to make you change your mind im not blind florizel answered i know we needed to hold marthasville i know we didnt do it im not stupid either no matter what a highfalutin barrister might think sir ive never said anything of the sort gremio insisted i know you didnt i never said you did florizel told him i said what you were thinking and i wasnt wrong was i he used words as precisely as if he were a barrister himself gremio said i dont know what youre talking about sir youve led this regiment well and ive never thought otherwise that was the truth too even if it wasnt altogether responsive you wouldnt be breathing if you had run your mouth florizel replied gremio looked for an answer to that found none and decided it might have been just as well as hed expected the army of franklin swung back toward the southeast the direction of the glideway line that kept general hesmucet and the southrons fed the army of franklin was for the time being making do without a glideway line the countryside was rich and fertile and the soldiers had no trouble keeping themselves fed juices sizzled as a fowla fowl that had probably belonged to a loyal northern farmercooked over a fire turning the stick that spitted the bird sergeant thisbe said if we can feed ourselves off the country here why cant the southrons do the same gremio started to give that a flip answer but stopped with the words unspoken good question he said after a pause the only thing i can think of is there are a lot more of them than there are of us of course they also have a proper baggage train and we dont we burned ours in marthasville thisbe said we can move faster without it gremio put the best face on things he could yes and we can start starving faster too but thisbe lifted the fowl from the flames he blew on it then drew his knife from its sheath and started carving handing gremio a leg he said you fancy the dark meat dont you right now i fancy anything thatll keep my stomach from bumping up against the notches on my backbone gremio answered he ate the hot flesh savoring the grease from the skin somebody else had a pot full of turnips boiling over another fire gremio got a tin plate piled high with them he ate and ate then blissfully thumped his belly do you know what sergeant no sir what thisbe spoke with his mouth full he was still demolishing his plateload those turnips needed salt gremio declared youre right thisbe agreed but im still better with em than i would be without em cant quarrel with that gremio said cant quarrel with anything not any more he yawned cant do anything much right now except roll over and go to sleep he wrapped himself in his blanketmuch more to hold mosquitoes at bay than to keep him warmand did just that when the army started marching again the next morning it kept on going southeast without a baggage train to delay it it did move faster than the southron force general hesmucet didnt seem much interested in pursuit anyhow maybe marthasville was enough to satisfy him gremio hoped so hed had enough fighting against long odds to suit him for a whilefor the next hundred years come to that bell passed well south of marthasville on his way east gremio knew at once when the army of franklin returned to land that had seen war already this campaigning season how long would the swath of war the gouge of the lion gods claws scar peachtree province if not for generations he would have been astonished he was astonished when bell passed over the glideway line with no more than a few hasty spells from the sorcerers whats the point of that he asked anyone who would listen to him even southrons can put things to rights in a hurry but colonel florizel for once had an answer that satisfied him i hear were heading east into dothan to rest and refit and then well come back and hit the southrons a proper lick gods know we could use rest and refit gremio said and the regimental commander nodded gremio asked will we get any reinforcements we could use them too they could use them to replace the men lieutenant general bell had thrown away in one futile attack after another gremio saw no point to saying that but he thought it very loudly florizel only shook his head no reinforcements ive heard about captain if wed had more men handy dont you suppose they would have come into marthasville a long time ago youre probably right gremio admitted but the southrons keep getting fresh men whenever they need them it would be nice if we didnt have to depend on the soldiers who started the war that was an exaggeration but not an enormous one florizels answering grimace showed a broken front tooth that tooth hadnt been broken when the war was new gremio would have taken oath on it little by little the fighting wore the men down in all sorts of ways here though marching was easy hesmucet mounted no real chase of the army of franklin maybe marthasville had been his target all along or maybe maybe he doesnt think we can hurt him any more gremio said once the battered army entered the province of dothan if he doesnt hell get himself a nasty surprise sergeant thisbe declared weve still got teeth by the gods gremio nodded man for man northern soldiers remained at least as formidable as their southron counterparts teeth as thisbe had said but how strong were the jaws that held those teeth the more gremio thought about the state of the army of franklin the closer he came to despair corporal take up the company standard lieutenant griff commanded yes sir rollant said and he did pride swelled in him till he felt about to float away like an inflated pigs bladder the more he thought about the state of general hesmucets army about how far theyd come and how much theyd done the more he imagined he was on the point of floating away that must have shown on his face for smitty grinning asked him you happy your corporalship sir oh just a little rollant answered yes just a little form up for parade griff called to his men i dont want anybody missing a step not a single step when we go through town today marthasville is ours and fairly won as general hesmucet said in his order of the day and i want those traitor bastards to know we arent just good enough to lick emwe can be fancier than they are too rollant nodded vigorously he wanted to show up to show off before the people who had once bound him to the land treat me like a cow with hands will you youll see horns blared griff started shouting again colonel nahaths order carried farther forwardmarch forward rollant went holding the gold dragon on red high the standard fluttered in the breeze griff nodded thats good thats very good corporal let the folk of marthasville see the kingdoms true flag theyve looked at the reversed banner too long rollant shook the standard to display the dragon better still he wanted the detinans in marthasville to get a good look at itand at him he strutted he swaggered he displayed the stripes on his left arm as best he could so the people whod called themselves liege lords would see what a blond could do when he got the chance marching through rising rock the summer before had been enjoyable marching through marthasville lieutenant griff chose that moment to ask him almost the same question smitty had having a good time corporal rollant looked around lining this main street were hundreds more likely thousands of glumlooking detinans women children and men with beards gray or white the younger men were in false king geoffreys army every single spectator seemed to be looking straight at him he knew that was an illusion but even so sir i feel about ready to quit this world altogether he said griff laughed out loud and slapped him on the shoulder i dont blame you a bit it must be pretty fine getting to spit in these northerners eyes as a matter of fact sir it is rollant looked at griff with more respect than he was in the habit of giving the company commander griff was too young for his job and too weedy besides but he was plenty brave enough and every now and then proved he wasnt stupid either his remark showed more understanding of the way blonds thought than rollant would have looked to see from any detinan northerner or southron and then the band struck up the battle psalm on the kingdom rollant forgot about griff as he forgot about everything but that fierce triumphant music no one had ever accused him of singing well no one ever would but he was loud and enthusiastic past that what really mattered if the haughty detinans of marthasville didnt care for the way he sounded too bad for them not many blonds were watching the southron soldiers tramp past most of them he guessed had already fled their liege lords and the land to which they were supposed to be bound but the few whod stayed behind were wildly excited now a pretty woman seeing rollants golden hair and beard blew him a kiss and twitched her hips in a way that could mean only one thing lieutenant griff noticed her too you find her once we go into bivouac corporal and you wont sleep alone tonight ive got a wife sir rollant said uncomfortably hed been away from norina a long time now and missed hermissed any womanno less than any other man blond or detinan would have done shes a long way off griff said i couldnt do that sir i wouldnt do that rollant said if i did that to her why wouldnt she do it to me griff gave him a curious look i wouldnt have expected you to take your oaths so seriously why because im a blond sir rollant could have said a great deal more than that but not without being insubordinate well let me put it like this griff answered i know plenty of detinans who dont turn down whatever they can get and they dont care a curse about whether theyre married or not there are people like that rollant agreed captain cephas whod commanded the company before griff had been a man like that now he was dead along with the blond woman whod been his lover and her blond husband rollant didnt care to bring up cephas he did say the fun they have doesnt usually make up for the trouble they cause thats what i think anyhow maybe youre right griff said but not everybody thinks about trouble before he thinks about getting it in he didnt mention captain cephas either but rollant would have been surprised if he werent thinking about him too rollant took a look at marthasville itself not at the detinans still living in it i can see why bell finally left this place he said hardly enough left of it to defend are you sorry the company commander asked sorry me no sir rollant answered but ill tell you something even with marthasville all smashed up the way it is the detinans are still living a lot better than they ever let their serfs live from what ive seen in the countryside corporal id say youre probably right griff told him rollant blinked again he wouldnt have bet griff noticed anything unmilitary in the countryside at last the regiment tramped out of marthasville hereabouts people reckoned it a big city before escaping from his liege lords estate in palmetto province rollant would have thought it one too after ten years of living in new eborac he shook his head as far as he was concerned marthasville was nothing but an overgrown town we camp here griff told him pointing to a meadow next to a stand of pines all right sir rollant said any particular place you want me to plant the standard griff pointed to a tiny swell of ground how about right there rollant shrugged it seemed as good a place as any other he stabbed the butt end of the flagpole into the brickredalmost bloodreddirt that done he took up a pinch of earth and sprinkled it at the base of the pole griff nodded approval you know all the rituals sure enough even though youre a blond that had to be lurking behind his words that lurked behind so many detinans thoughts whenever they dealt with blonds rollant knew it would keep on lurking in detinans thoughts for as long as he lived maybe by the time his children were grown detinans would be able to accept blonds as people like any others and maybe they wouldnt too colonel nahath came up to the standard and spoke to griff were going to act as provost guards in marthasville keep the men from tearing the place up too much and keep them from squabbling with the locals im sending companies in on rotation yours will go in there tonight yes sir griff said the only thing a junior officer could say at an order from a senior uh sir a question when nahath nodded griff asked what about rollant here and the other blonds ive got nahath plucked at his beard but not for long theyre soldiers he said they can do a soldiers job if they cant do a soldiers job they shouldnt wear the uniform he eyed rollant what do you say to that corporal ill do my best sir rollant answered of course some of the traitors wont be used to doing what a filthy stinking blond serf tells them to a point colonel nahath said do you think you can persuade them rollants smile was large and predatory sir i look forward to it nahath and griff both laughed the regimental commander said try to leave them breathing once theyre persuaded oh i suppose so sir rollant said which made the two detinan officers laugh again rollant asked may i pick a partner sir at the serious question the colonel and lieutenant looked at each other well thats probably not a bad notion you should have someone you can trust at your back nahath said rollant gave him a grateful nod at least nahath recognized he couldnt trust all detinans at his back why me smitty asked as they walked back toward marthasville together what did i do to you saved my neck a few times rollant answered maybe youll do it again after you hauled me off to go patrolling smitty shook his head not godsdamned likely pal i could be asleep right now thanks smitty youre a true friend rollant thoughthe was almost surethe farmers son from outside new eborac city was joking smitty cracked wise about anything and everything but a bit of doubt still lingered would smitty have said the same sorts of things had sergeant joram plucked him into duty knowing smitty he likely would rollant thought and relaxed a bit marthasville looked bigger when he came into it as part of a twoman patrol and without an army at his back torches blazed in front of every surviving business eateries and taverns and brothels looked to be thriving with long lines of men in gray snaking forward in front of the latter the women inside those places were almost sure to be blonds rollant shook his head and did his best not to think about that a detinan in civilian clothes stared at him and smitty you think youre a soldier butterhair he asked rollant his accent proclaimed him a local no rollant answered i know im a soldier ive been through the war and thats a hells of a lot more than you can say even by the torchlight he saw the northerner flush you ought to be unicornwhipped talking to your betters like that get lost traitor if you dont get lost youll be sorry that wasnt rollant it was smitty the northerner swore at him godsdamned son of a bitch youre the traitora traitor to the detinan race youd better get lost smitty said or well run you in id like to see you try the northern man said rollant didnt need a second invitation he jerked his shortsword from its scabbard smittys came free too come along or youll be sorry rollant said he took a step toward the man from marthasville not till the fellows hands writhed in his first pass did rollant realize he might have made a mistake not till his own feet seemed to freeze to the dirt of the street did he realize he might have made a very bad mistake laughing the local said if youre going to net a dragon you had best think on where youll find a net to hold him smitty seemed stuck too he howled curses laughing still the manthe magefrom marthasville drew a knife and advanced on them in king avrams name let us go rollant exclaimed and he could move again the mage hadnt let him go or smitty either when they did move the fellows jaw dropped he tried his enchantment once more it did him no good he tried to flee but rollant and smitty were younger and faster rollant brought him down with a ferocious flying tackle cut the bastards throat smitty urged hes dangerous rollant shook his head well hogtie him and give him to the provost marshal he said practicing magic against us theyll make him wish wed cut his throat he and smitty bound the northerner hand and foot threw his knife in the gutter and hauled him away after theyd handed him over to higher authority smitty said you called on king avram and that freed us from the spell i thought the same thing rollant said what do you suppose it means it means king avram gods bless him has a powerful name thats what smitty said that powerful rollant asked well i wouldnt have thought so either smitty said but you saw what happened same as i did that stinking wizard had us in trouble rollant shivered the wizard had had them in a lot of trouble smitty went on then you spoke the kings name and we were all right again good thing too yes a very good thing rollant agreed now we know king avram is someone very special indeed he frowned that didnt get his meaning across so well as he would have liked he tried again we knew it before but now we know it his frown got deeper that still wasnt right or maybe it was smitty said we know it in our bellies you mean yes rollant said gratefully and knowing it in his belly he got through the rest of the patrol without trouble by then he wanted a chance to use avrams name again as he went back to camp though he decided he might have been lucky not to get one jim the haystack the burgomaster of marthasville stared nervously at general hesmucet you cant mean that he said of course i can hesmucet said watching with a certain fascination the ugly wig that probably gave jim his nickname i am in the habit of meaning what i say i usually do and this is no exception but you cant burn marthasville jim the haystack wailed that dreadful wig seemed about ready to topple over sideways in his discomfiture he looked like a man who needed to run to the latrine none of that mattered to hesmucet i not only can sir i intend to he said i cannot stay here not while lieutenant general bell is running around loose and making a nuisance of himself if i left the place intact you traitors would go on getting use from it i cant have that not when ive come all the way up from franklin to take it away from you and so ill give it to the fire i know your mind and time are constantly occupied with the duties of your command jim the haystack said wig nodding above his forehead but it might be that you have not considered this subject in all its awful consequences i believe i have hesmucet said as if he hadnt spoken the burgomaster went on on more reflection you i hope would not make the people of marthasville an exception to all mankind for i know of no such instance ever having occurredsurely never in detinaand what has this helpless people done that they should be driven from their homes to wander strangers and outcasts and exiles i solemnly petition you to reconsider this order or modify it and suffer this unfortunate people to remain at home and enjoy what little means they have very pretty sir but no hesmucet shook his head i give full credit to your statements of the distress that will be occasioned and yet shall not revoke my orders in the names of the gods why jim the haystack howled because they were not designed to meet the humanities of the case but to prepare for future struggles hesmucet answered we must have peace not only at marthasville but in all detina to stop war we must defeat the traitor armies which are arrayed against the laws and the rightful king he is not the rightful king jim the haystack said he is a lowdown thief well that is your opinion i have a different one hesmucet told him now that war comes home to you you feel very different war is cruelty and you cannot refine it and those who brought war into our kingdom deserve all the curses and maledictions a people can pour out but you cannot have peace and a division of our kingdom you have the soldiers here jim the haystack said bitterly so you will do as pleases you best but i still think it is barbarous truly barbarous to send the whole of the population of marthasville off to fend for itself as best it may i believe you i appreciate that you are sincere and that burning this town will work a hardship on the people who live here hesmucet replied but winning the war comes first i also doubt that earlier in the war you lost any sleep or shed a single tear when the armies that follow false king geoffrey made loyal civiliansmen women and childrenflee them barefoot and in rags down in franklin and cloviston jim the haystack looked at him as if hed suddenly started speaking gibberish no the burgomaster cared for nothing but his own people and his own side that didnt surprise general hesmucet but it did sadden him jim only said have you no mercy have you no compassion none not when theres a war to be won hesmucet said and that sir is about all the time i have to give you you have made your views very plain now let me make one thing very plain to you if any men of marthasville attempt to interfere with my soldiers in the performance of their duties i will show exactly how little mercy i have if you think being dispossessed works a hardship on your population opposing me will work a much greater one do you understand perfectly the burgomaster replied you are saying you not only are a barbarian but are proud to be one hesmucet stared at him unblinking jim the haystack flinched he said i will take your words to the honest citizens of the town i govern take my words to the sons of bitches too hesmucet said i expect theyre the ones who really need to hear them good day sir wig still nodding shakily above his brow jim the haystack departed once he was gone hesmucet allowed himself the luxury of a chuckle he called for a runner and asked him to summon doubting george he was still chuckling when his secondincommand arrived whats so funny sir george asked the arrogance of some of these northern men who think they can turn me from my course even after their army has lost battle after battle hesmucet answered he explained what the burgomaster of marthasville had tried to talk him into or rather out of doing doubting george shook his head some people dont understand the way the world is put together he said sadly of course you could say the whole north doesnt understand the way the world works if it did it never would have tried to leave detina youre right about that hesmucet said were bigger than they are and stronger than they are and were beating them down that burgomaster didnt care what his sides soldiers did farther south and he never expected to see us come this far north what geoffrey calls his kingdom has a miserable scrawny body but a head full of fire george said plenty of fine officers to lead the men but they have a hard time keeping them in food and shoes and clothes i like the figure hesmucet said we southrons weve had a big strong body with a head full of rocks but the north will never be anything but scrawny no matter how fiery its head gets and our head can get a little fire of its own just so george agreed you and marshal bart have gone a long way towards proving that youve whipped the army of franklin and barts got the army of southern parthenia penned up north of nonesuch only trouble here is bell doesnt know hes whipped gods damn him hesmucet said he keeps wanting to make trouble people who want to make trouble find themselves in it more often than not george observed i dont think bell will be different from any of the rest i intend to go after him hesmucet said he thinks he can give us fits by cutting the glideway link from rising rock i dont think he can do it for long but even if he does what difference will it make his godsdamned armys living off the countryside now does he think we cant do the same if he does hes a fool doubting george said of course nothing much hes done in this campaign would make me believe hes not a fool im going ahead with things just as planned hesmucet said we chase the people out of marthasville we burn the place we leave a garrison behind to hold the ruins and keep the traitors from getting any more glideway carpets through and then we go after the army of franklin sounds good to me sir george said the only people to whom it didnt sound good were the inhabitants of marthasville their opinions mattered not at all to general hesmucet they cursed and reviled him as his provost guards routed them from their homes you may stay if you like he said cheerfully youll go up in smoke but you may stay i wont stop you but i sure as hells will burn you they cursed him harder than ever after that but not a one of them stayed to burn with the city hed expected nothing different the stink of smoke still lingered in the air from the time when bells men had fired whatever they couldnt bring with them i bet the traitors had a roaring good time burning things hesmucet told one incendiary but well have a better one on account of this whole stinking town goes up now go up marthasville did hesmucets soldiers spread cooking oil and whale oil all through the city before starting their blazes that made the fires flare up even hotter and brighter when the men did set them hesmucet took off his hat and fanned his face with it but the heat still made drops of sweat run down his cheeks not far from him a northern woman cried out in despair traa ive got to get back to traa oh shut up you stupid bitch said the handsome man with jughandle ears next to her the southrons burned that place weeks ago you go to the hells thert the butler the woman said furiously ill build it up again you see if i dont frankly my dear i dont give a thert answered and then howled because she kicked him in the shin move along both of you a provost guard shouted move along right now he was a blond not only that hesmucet saw he was a corporal if the northern man noticed that he wouldnt like it at all but he seemed more interested in quarreling with the woman than in arguing with the provost guard as the flames took hold and spread the provost guards stopped having to order people to abandon the burning marthasville no one could stay in or close to those flames and hope to live hesmucet no coward had to retreat himself he watched the fires from a distance of several hundred yards not far from him an artist sketched the scene hesmucet nodded approval you get it down just the way it looks he said i want people to remember this for the next hundred and fifty years thats what im doing sir the artist said let people see what they get for rebelling against the rightful king good hesmucet said people should see such things they should know what treason costs if the gods be kind well never have to fight another war like this in all the history of the kingdom thats what im hoping for sir the artist said youve certainly set the scene for me i will say that no indeed hesmucet shook his head the men who followed false king geoffrey into betrayal set this scene for you if not for them marthasville would still be a thriving northern town yes sir the artist nodded vigorously instead theyve gotthis he held up the sketch so hesmucet could get a good look at it the flames from the burning city gave the commanding general plenty of light good job he said godsdamned good job let it be a warning to those who talk of treason and rebellion we ought to be fighting out on the eastern steppes driving back the blond savages whove caused us so much trouble over the years thats what we ought to be doing not squabbling amongst ourselves geoffreys treason has cost us yearsyears i tell youin which we could have been bringing this whole great land under detinan rule cant turn blonds into serfs any more the artist said perhaps incautiously but general hesmucet in an expansive mood shrugged instead of snarling those savages wouldnt make good serfs anyway he said they dont bend the way the blonds in the kingdoms of the northeast did hundreds of years ago they break instead theyre brave men i dont deny itthey might almost be detinans as far as that goes but we will break them and sweep them off the land and use it for our own purposes he might almost have been talking of breaking so many untamed unicorns the artist nodded again and returned to his work id better do the same hesmucet thought he shouted for his unicorn when hed swung up onto the beast he rode rapidly up toward the head of his army every few hundred yards the marching men in gray tunics and pantaloons would raise a cheer each time they did hesmucet took off his hat and waved it every cheer made him feel as good as if hed just had a strong slug of spirits are we going to lick these stinking northern sons of bitches he called to the men as he took his place at the fore yes sir the soldiers shouted and raised another cheer are we going to make them sorry they ever tried to pull out of detina yes sir the yells came louder than ever are we going to make them wish godsdamned geoffreys father had pulled out of his mother yes sir this time bawdy laughter mixed with the soldiers replies all right then hesmucet said we are the meanest toughest bunch of soldiers the kingdom of detina has ever seen we have licked the traitors and were going to go right on licking them and there isnt one single godsdamned thing they can do about it and what do you think of that by their yells and whoops the men liked the idea hesmucet liked it too but there was one thing the northerners might do and he knew it if they did cut the supply line back to rising rock and keep it cut his life would get harder have to make sure they dont keep it cut then he thought and hoped he could manage that horns blared all through the camp of the army of franklin forward colonel florizel shouted forward captain gremio echoed forward the men of his company florizels regiment and the whole army of franklin went west out of dothan and back into peachtree province once more lieutenant general bell had grit if nothing else and a few days to rest and recuperate a few days away from the hells marthasville had become did wonders for the army by the way they marched the men once more believed they could lick any number of southrons on the face of the earth gremio wasnt so sure they were right but now they werent pinned in the city now they could pick where along hesmucets tenuous supply line they attacked the supply line surely had more weaknesses than the army did it had better have more weaknesses than the southron army did gremio thought if it doesnt we wont be able to hurt it and if we cant hurt it weand geoffreys kingdomare in a lot of trouble sergeant thisbe tramped along beside gremio never complaining always competent catching the company commanders eye on him he nodded and said well give it our best shot sir i know we will gremio answered thats what we have to do uh one of the things we have to do he amended remembering one of the other things the army of franklin had to do these days he raised his voice to a shout foragers out to the flanks move move move move the men did many of them with grins on their faces the army of franklin had no formal supply train not any more the southrons had closed all the glideway lines into marthasville and east of the city those were few and far between if the army was to survive it had to live off the countryside the men had done that plenty of times in enemyheld territory less often in land nominally ruled by king geoffrey but necessity made a stronger law than any of the ones gremio had argued in the lawcourts the soldiers took what they needed and worried not at all about it a good thing this is rich country thisbe remarked as the foragers went ascrounging wed be hungry if it werent true enough gremio said good for usbut its also good for the southrons even if we do cut them off from their base of supply they may well be able to live off the country too i worry about that do you really think they can forage as well as we can sir thisbe asked gremio laughed id have to doubt that he admitted weve got the best collection of thieves left uncrucified running around loose in this army theyll nab anything that isnt nailed down and theyll try to pry up the nails if it is im proud of them by the gods where exactly are we headed for thisbe said with another laugha sardonic one this timegremio answered what you think they tell me anything he raised his voice again this time to call to colonel florizel sir where are we going back to whole mackerel from what i hear florizel replied from unicornback the southrons have a supply base there if we take it away from them we live high on the hog for a while and they dont sounds good to me gremio imagined plundering a southron supply base his mouth watered at the thought of it but food wouldnt be the only thing there he thought of shoes and pantaloons and medicines and all the other things that kept an army going and that were in sadly short supply in the north a farmer wailed as foragers took his livestock you bastards are nothing but a pack of brigands he wailed might as well have the godsdamned southrons here instead you will be compensated for your loss gremio said he pulled a scrap of paper and a pencil from a pantaloon pocket let me have your name and what was taken from you i will write you a receipt a receipt a godsdamned receipt the farmer shouted who in the hells is going to pay me for whatevers wrote on a stinking receipt every use of the word seemed filled with greater scorn king geoffreys government will sir after the war is won gremio answered snatching the paper form his hand the farmer tore it to shreds and flung those shreds to the breeze bugger king geoffreys government with a pine cone he cried the sonofabitching things gonna be as dead as shoe leather when the wars over why in the hells didnt i get southrons stealing from me their receiptsd be worth something later on i reckon be careful how you speak gremio said coldly you tread close to treason futter you too pal the farmer said i talk like a free detinan on account of i godsdamned well am one if you dont like it too bad you think weve got a chance of winning against king avrams bastards you got to be crazy if you do and you dont look like no crazy man to me he stormed off still cursing captain gremio stared after him he didnt think he was a crazy man and he didnt think it likely king geoffreys men could beat king avrams after more than three years of war that seemed a very forlorn hope indeed why go on fighting then he wondered he shrugged the army of franklin wasnt beaten yet as long as lieutenant general bell could still strike the encroaching southrons the northern cause wasnt lost we have to keep trying gremio thought as long as we keep trying something good may happen if we give up it surely wont was that reason enough gremio shrugged again he didnt know he did know some detachments of provost marshals were crucifying deserters that was another good reason to stay on general hesmucets men had unicornriders patrolling well east of the glideway line gremio got only a glimpse of them as they rode off to the west to let the main body of southrons know theyd spotted the army of franklin he sighed i wish we could have taken whole mackerel by surprise when the southrons came at it they came at it from out of the east and now were doing the same thing sergeant thisbe said thats strange i hadnt thought about it like that but youre right gremio said one thing the foraging wont be so good from here on out the southrons will have been there before us well just have to run them out of the place and take away all the food theyve stored up in town he made it sound very easy if fighting the southrons were easy though bell would have done better all through this campaign of course hesmucet had always had the advantage of numbers he wouldnt here gremio didnt know how big the garrison at whole mackerel was but it couldnt hope to match the whole army of franklin the rest of hesmucets army would still be up near marthasville that meant wed better move fast gremio said we have to take the town before they can reinforce it that makes good sense sir sergeant thisbe agreed it might have made good sense to them it didnt seem to have crossed bells mind he paused to camp for the night about five miles outside of whole mackerel we ought to keep going gremio said discontentedly im pleased to see your spirit colonel florizel told him still and all though well do better going in fresh and well rested true sir gremio said but the southrons will have all night to get ready for us and that wont help our attack you really are bolder than you were florizel said you cant attack by yourself though gremio didnt think he was any bolder than hed ever been he was just quibbling over tactics as he often did when he complained because he thought bell was charging ahead when he shouldnt florizel reckoned him a coward hed been right then but it hadnt done any good now he thought bell was hanging back when he ought to go on that made the regimental commander happier but it also wouldnt change anything else maybe i ought to keep my mouth shut gremio thought for a detinan and especially for a detinan barrister that was a very strange notion indeed horns blared before daybreak the next morning ordering the northern army into line of battle well do the best we can and well strike the enemy a strong blow for king geoffrey gremio told his men they raised a cheer and well steal all the good food and the crossbow quarrels the stinking southrons have fetched up here to whole mackerel from rising rock sergeant thisbe added well eat like nobles and well shoot like weve got repeating crossbows the soldiers in blue cheered louder for thisbe than they had for gremio well said sergeant gremio told him you got a better rein on what makes them go than i did thank you very much sir thisbe said trying to put in a little extra thats all you did splendidly gremio said you should speak up more often before thisbe could answer the horns screamed again this time ordering the army of franklin forward against the southrons entrenchments in front of whole mackerel they tried ours and didnt like them very well gremio thought why should we have an easier time with theirs some of the entrenchments the northerners would be assailing were the ones their serfs had dug a few months earlier now king avrams grayclad soldiers held them and those men in gray seemed no more inclined to give them up than the army of franklin had been earlier in the year only a piddly little garrison in front of us boys colonel florizel boomed theyll run like rabbits the godsdamned sons of bitches roaring as if possessed by the lion god the northerners swarmed toward the easternmost trenches even before they came into range firepots and stones flew through the air repeating crossbows began their harsh clackclackclack no the southrons werent about to give up and go away but florizel had been right yes the southrons had men in their forward trenches and engines behind them but they didnt have very many men or very many engines lieutenant general bells men pelted them with bolts and stones and firepots of their own before long the southrons fell back towards whole mackerel the artificers in charge of their engines hitching those to teams of unicorns and hauling them away to keep them from being captured forward gremio called weve got to keep pushing them not let them rally keep moving when they came to the southrons second line of trenches another storm of missiles greeted them looking ahead gremio saw that the enemys main lines of defense didnt guard the town of whole mackerel itself but rather the nearby supply depot sure enough they knew what bell wanted roaring and shouting the army of franklin bore down on those works now the southrons had no room for retreat not unless they wanted to give up what their foes so desperately needed to take they had to fight they had toand they did they had a great many more engines in amongst these fieldworks than theyd used farther forward stones and firepots and darts took a heavy toll on the northerners the southrons whooped and cheered to watch their foes fall keep moving men gremio shouted again look there on that parapetthats got to be their commander if we can kill him maybe well suck the spirit out of them that wasnt sporting it wasnt chivalrous a man of noble blood probably never would have said anything so crude none of that stopped gremio from thinking hed had a good idea there his men did too so did the crews of a nearby battery of engines they started aiming at the blackhaired officer waving a sword too a moment later he clapped a hand to his cheek and tumbled off the parapet gremio and everyone close by raised a cheer forward he yelled now lets see how tough those bastards are he soon found out how tough their commander was the man reappeared inside of a couple of minutes he was even easier to spot than he had been beforea bloody bandage covered half his face gremio could hear his shouts through the din of battle we can whip these bastards who the hells do they think they are coming around to bother honest people give em a good kick in the arse and throw em back and the southrons obeyed they fought with a stubborn stolid courage different from the incandescent northern variety but no less effective for that some of their outer entrenchments fell to the army of franklin but only after they were filled with dead men wearing tunics and pantaloons both blue and gray and the northerners didnt come close to overrunning the supply depot though they fought all day towards evening bell ordered a withdrawal colonel florizel put the best face on things he could well boys well hit em another lick tomorrow and then well whip em for sure what if the southrons send up reinforcements by then gremio asked florizel started to say something harsh but checked himself no you were all for forging ahead he reminded himself in that case captain we dont have such an easy time of it satisfied gremio nodded though that wasnt the word he would have used xi lieutenant general bell glowered at his scryer youre sure you intercepted the southrons message as sure as im standing here before you sir the scryer answered they might as well have been talking right into my crystal ball instead of brigadier murray the coarse talking to general hesmucet murray he said i am short of a cheekbone and one ear but am able to whip all hells yet and hesmucet he answered hold the fort i am coming he was up near commissioner mountain then sir so i reckon he could come pretty godsdamned quick to the hells with him bell said furiously he could hear the moans of the wounded in his encampment here he knew he wouldnt be able to rouse his army to another attack before morning and also knew morning was all too likely to be too late whole mackerel had held laudanum he thought and took a swig the pain in his ruined arm and missing leg diminished he could even look at the pain in his spirit with more detachment which was really why hed gulped down the drug but that pain wouldnt die not altogether hed needed a win over the southrons and yet again he hadnt got it anything else sir the scryer asked no lieutenant general bell answered just pick up your crystal ball and get the hells out of here the scryer did major zibeon came into bells tent a moment later you put a flea in his ear bells dour aidedecamp remarked what did he have to say that the stinking southrons are on their way here bell answered weve wounded the commander here at whole mackerel but he thinks he can hold out till hesmucet arrives hes likely right especially if hesmucet marches his men through the night zibeon said which was exactly what bell didnt want to hear his own description of the words that had passed between murray the coarse and hesmucet made them seem bloodless businesslike the scryers version hadnt been like that both southron officers had sounded more than confident that worried bell as nothing else had zibeon grimaced then asked can we face the whole southron army no bell answered no gods damn it we cant he hated nothing more than admitting that king geoffrey had put him in command of the army of franklin to whip the southrons and to hold marthasville he hadnt managed either he didnt like having to confront his limits and those of his army what do we do then sir his aidedecamp asked we fall back bell answeredstrange and unnatural words to find in his mouth they tasted bad too but he saw the need for them we fall back and we try to hit that godsdamned glideway line somewhere else to his surprise major zibeon nodded not bad sir he said judiciously even if we dont wreck it how much can hesmucet do if hes chasing us over the landscape where weve already fought and hell have to chase us too on account of this army is still too big to ignore bell didnt care for the sound of that still zibeon might as well have said this is whats left after you went and made a hash of things but he nodded because tone aside his aidedecamp had the essence of his plan down thats right major if hesmucet is such a great hero lets see him catch us when we dont feel like getting caught zibeon chuckled the southrons wont like that futter the southrons bell exclaimed if they think im going to dry up and blow away because they squeezed me out of marthasville they can think again theyll have to work to drag us down i think thats good sir i think thats very good major zibeon said if the gods favor us we may even be able to sneak back into marthasville again that would be very fine bell started to perk up but then slumped again it would be very fine i mean but theres not much left of marthasville any more place isnt worth having not for anybody and gods damn hesmucet for that too along with everything else they will i have no doubt of it zibeon spoke with great conviction but wed better do something to him in this world too draft the order for our move to the south then lieutenant general bell said if he wants us hell have to pin us down and do you know what major i dont think the southrons can do it yes sir his aidedecamp said and no sir i dont dont think they can pin us down either when morning came a reddust haze in the north warned that the southrons were approaching fast grunting and cursing and half blind with pain in spite of a new dose of laudanum bell clambered aboard his unicorn major zibeon made him fast to the animal like a man lashing a sack of lentils to an ass back and then just before he was about to lead the army south he had an idea calling the mages together he asked them can you make the southrons think weve gone east instead they looked at each other sadfaced men in blue robes some afoot others riding asses the next mage bell saw aboard a unicorn would be the first he could manage without one leg and with only one working arm as for them he shrugged which also hurt they could work magicwhen things went well at last one of them said i think we can sirfor a while anyway sooner or later though theyll realize theyve been following a will o the wisp buy us as much time as you can bell said the mages nodded mournfully bell did lead the army of franklin south then he kept looking back over his good shoulder to see how close the southrons were getting looking back wasnt easy not when the dust of thousands of marching feet obscured his view after a while though he did spy what looked to be just as much dust rising from the east he hoped the mages would remember to mask the dust his army was actually making he almost sent a rider back to remind them to be sure of that but at the last minute checked himself mages had their pride too a unicornrider from his own rear guard came trotting up to him saluting the man said sir looks like the stinking southrons have swung off to the east they arent coming right after us anyways good bell said something had gone right then he made a noise halfway between a sigh and a groan not too many things had gone right for the army of franklin lately to be relieved because the enemys pursuit had been drawn off was pitiful was the word that sprang to mind another rider approached him he eyed roastbeef william with more suspicion than he had the courier roastbeef william hungered for his command just as hed hungered for it when joseph the gamecock had it was william writing letters to king geoffrey hed better not be bell thought what now he growled his voice rough and edgy i was going to ask you the same question sir his wing commander replied i understand we cant hope to hold our position with so many southrons coming after us but where do we go from here someplace with good foraging from which we can strike a blow at the glideway up from rising rock or at a detachment of southrons if they give us the chance bell answered there had been a time when the army of franklin could have stood up to the whole southron hostbefore it lost four expensive battles in a row outside marthasville bell tried not to dwell on that sooner or later the whole southron army will come after us william said later bell told him and explained what the mages were doing roastbeef williams big head bobbed up and down thats good sir but it wont last forever and the southrons are hard to fool the same way twice weve bought some time now bell had never been a man to look to the far future it would take care of itself the problem right at hand always seemed more important without solving it he couldnt get to the far future anyhow do you think the southrons are after us with their whole force william asked seemed that way gods damn them bell said let them come they arent going to accomplish anything that way not unless they crush us roastbeef william said but then almost reluctantly he nodded again were lighter and quicker than they are no doubt even so bell said any man who knows me knows i hate retreat to the very marrow of my bonesbut there are times when it is needful and this is one of those times yes sir roastbeef william said and then muttered something under his breath what was that lieutenant general bell asked sharply nothing sir his wing commander answered bell glared at him william looked back stolid and innocent bell couldnt press any more what he thought hed heard was thats what joseph the gamecock kept saying it wasnt quite insubordination but it came close as far as bell could see the two cases were as different as chalk and cheese retreat seemed josephs natural state he fell back because he dared not face the foe or so bell was convinced he himself on the other hand moved away from the southrons only because they so dreadfully outnumbered him they hadnt outnumbered joseph to anywhere near the same extent why the southrons now outnumbered the army of franklin so much more than they had when joseph the gamecock commanded it was something bell stubbornly refused to contemplate as bell and the army of franklin moved south and east the general commanding had no trouble telling where general hesmucets army had gone earlier in the summer and where the land had not seen the redhot rake of war earthworks and field fortifications scarred the ground where hesmucets men had moved one wheatfield had entrenchments in three sides of a square dug through the middle of it what the farmer would be able to do about that bell couldnt imagine farmhouses were burnt barns and serfs huts razed of livestock and blonds in the region where hesmucets men had gone bell saw next to none half a mile away from the southrons path cows and sheep and unicorns grazed though he still noted hardly any blonds bastards he muttered not knowing himself whether he meant hesmucets men or the serfs who fled to them a little before noon one of his wizards came up to him and said im sorry sir but their sorcerers just penetrated our spell of deception well gods damn them to the seven hells bell said but it scarcely counted as an outburst hed expected that news for a couple of hours he gave the mage a grudging nod you did the best you could why thank you sir the man sounded not only relieved but astonished he must have looked for a firepot to come down on his head bell condescended to explain you bought us more time that i thought you would weve got away clean now ah the mage nodded with luck in wisdom he gave bell a salute that would have disgusted any sergeant ever born happy to be of service sir he saluted again even more disreputably than before and went off to rejoin his comrades in wizardry i take it back bell thought i do know one mage who rides a unicornthraxton the braggart the lines furrowing his brow for once had nothing to do with pain thraxton was a mighty sorcerer no doubt about itand the army of franklin would have ended up better off if hed never cast a single spell no doubt about that either if a man is an ass who cares whether he rides a unicorn what would thraxton have done with the army of franklin had king geoffrey given it back to him instead of to bell something unfortunatebell was sure of that again what hed done to the army of franklin himself never crossed his mind the men let me down he was sure of it well smash up the glideway line well cut hesmucet off from all his supplies bell thought well see how much the soft southrons like living off the land well see how well they fight when theyre hungry and short of everything the way we always are he had visions of hesmucets men stumbling across the plains of peachtree province with hollow eyes and bony fingers moaning for a crust of bread on the other side of the western ocean great king kermits army had all but come to pieces when it had to retreat from pahzbull in the middle of a hellsish winter that was more than fifty years ago now but people still told stories about it liking the vision in his own mind bell offered it to his aidedecamp major zibeon chewed it over then said that would be very nice sirnow which gods are going to supply the sorbian winter here in peachtree province bells ears heated zibeon had been polite in calling him a fool but hed called him a fool nonetheless we can still whip them bell growled i hope youre right i even think youre right sir zibeon said but i dont see southron soldiers starving in the snow not hereabouts what precisely do you see major bells tone was certainly cold enough for a sorbian winter right now i see that weve stolen a march on the enemy zibeon replied i see that wed better take advantage of it too and not even lieutenant general bell could argue with him there rollant sprawled down by a campfire with a groan im sick of marching he said i dont like it even when were going where were supposed to when it turns out we spent the first half of the day going in the wrong godsdamned direction i dont fancy that a bit smitty was every bit as worn as he was but managed a weary grin you go tell that to general hesmucet rollant he said hes bound to listen to you right after all youre not just anybody youre a corporal and youre an idiot rollant said smitty gave an extravagant wave of the hand as if accepting praise far beyond his deserts sergeant joram tramped past get water rollant he said before rollant had been promoted that would have meant his going down to the closest creek with the squads water bottles but now that he was an underofficer he got to tell other soldiers to go instead but picked a couple who hadnt had the duty for a little while gleb you and josh take care of it josh groaned as he got to his feet but didnt argue gleb said i dont want to do it you had me do it a few days ago yes and its your turn again rollant said weve been through everybody else in the squad since then go on get moving gleb shook his head hells of a note when a blond thinks he can tell a real detinan what to do ice and fire ran through rollant he hadnt had much of that troubleless than hed expectedtill now maybe he could head it off here tapping the stripes on his sleeve he said it isnt a blond telling you what to do gleb its a corporal telling you now go fill our water bottles no gleb said he can put you on report gleb one of the other soldiers said go on he can kiss my arse thats what he can do godsdamned yellowhaired son of a bitch gleb said and stayed where he was rollant did think about reporting him but there was authority and then there was authority he sighed he might have known this day was coming lieutenant griff and colonel nahath had expected it sooner well it was here now he put down his crossbow unbuckled his sword belt and laid the shortsword by the bow get up gleb he said my my the detinan said as he got to his feet he also undid his sword belt think youre hot stuff dont you on account of you got yourself promoted well ill tell you something blond boythat doesnt mean a thing to me you talk too much rollants heart thudded in his chest he didnt know if he could take gleb if he couldnt he doubted hed ever be able to give another order again but he surely wouldnt be able to if he let the detinan get away with disobeying hed hoped gleb would surge forward without any thought at all no such luckthe soldier advanced cautiously eyes wary arms outstretched rollant threw a looping left gleb ducked under it and laughed scornfully he dug a fist into rollants ribs oof rollant said and took a couple of stumbling steps backward gleb laughed youre not so fornicating tough are you im going to like stomping the shit out of you you bet the right rollant threw was even wilder than the left had been and it served its purpose to persuade gleb rollant had no real stomach for a standup fight with a nasty chuckle gleb closed on him rollant slid a foot behind the detinan and pushed hard gleb let out a startled squawk but as he was falling he grabbed rollant and pulled him down too everything till then had gone just as rollant planned it after that the fight stopped having a plan it was punch and gouge and kick and knee and elbow glebs teeth snapped shut an inch away from rollants ear he didnt know whether that was because the detinan was trying to bite him or because hed just landed a good one to the pit of glebs stomach he couldnt stop and ask either gleb hit him in the side of the head he saw stars but the detinan howled and clutched at his own right hand rollant landed a blizzard of punches and brought his knee up between glebs legs gleb let out a bubbling shriek rollant scrambled to his feet and kicked the detinan several times had enough he got out through bruised lips gleb nodded rollant kicked him again maybe hard enough to break a rib or two maybe not he didnt want gleb thinking hed almost won and trying for another installment something like that was on glebs mind wasnt for your godsdamned hard head he mumbled that got him another kick once more rollant didnt know if hed broken the other mans ribs but he didnt think hed missed by much if he hadnt he stood over gleb breathing hard get up he growled gleb stared at him out of one eye the other was swollen shut get up you son of a bitch rollant repeated youre godsdamned well going to get your arse down to the creek and fill our water bottles he waited if gleb said he couldnt hed be even sorrier than he was already slowly the detinan struggled to his feet and started collecting water bottles yes corporal he said mushily as he headed for the stream with josh whod waited to see what happened when he spat he spat red so did rollant he ran his tongue over his teeth he didnt think hed broken any that was something he looked at the other soldiers in his squad nobody said anything he gestured go on get back to setting up camp its finished they all but fell over one another as they scrambled to obey later that evening sergeant joram came by looked at rollant did a double take and looked again by the gods what happened to you nothing rollant answered as a toddler might after breaking a vase joram snorted nothing eh i see that was it the kind of nothing id guess first time out rollant only shrugged which hurt the sergeant tried another question what happened to the other fellow nothing rollant said again but he couldnt help adding maybe a little more nothing than happened to me that a fact joram said rollant nodded that also hurt joram grunted well too bad for him and good for you he decide he didnt like the color of your hair i dont know what youre talking about sergeant rollant said joram made as if to clap him on the shoulder then thought better of it all right he said sounds like you took care of it and thats what counts when rollant called for men to put more wood on the fire or for any of the other small chores that needed doing they kept on springing to obey maybe i should have fights more often then he shook his head which also hurt hed come too close to losing this one now if the gods were kind he wouldnt have to have any more id sooner fight the traitors anyhow once not long before he lay down and went to sleep he caught gleb looking at him the detinans gaze flinched away when rollants met it gleb rollant was happy to see looked a good deal worse for wear than he did himself and by the way gleb kept nursing that finger he might really have broken it against rollants head rollant felt not the least bit sorry for him lieutenant griff didnt notice either rollant or gleb till morning as joram had the night before he gaped at rollants battered features with whom did you fight corporal he asked me sir i walked into a tree rollant said woodenly you look like you walked into a grinding mill griff said and then shouted companyform up the men obeyed griff stalked among them till he came to gleb and whats your excuse soldier he demanded his high thin voice getting higher with suspicion i fell down sir gleb answered which was true though hed had help from rollant griff studied him now that his bruises had had time to appear he looked ghastly i suppose i do too rollant thought griff said if you fall down again youll be very sorry do you understand me im already sorry sir gleb mumbled youll be even sorrier so will anyone else who tries falling down that particular way lieutenant griff was growing up he made the threat sound much more convincing than he could have when he first took over the company rollant paid his ritual respects to the company standard and took the flagpole from the ground leaning the pole against his shoulder meant leaning it against a bruise gods damn you gleb he thought as the regiment started after the army of franklin what do you think of this whole business corporal griff asked him me sir rollant said i think itd be a good thing if we took the real path the traitors are using instead of letting their mages trick us again i think so too but that isnt what i was talking about the company commander said dont toy with me i wont stand for it sorry sir said rollant who was anything but sorry reluctantly he went on i wish it hadnt happened thats all i hope it wont happen again not likely not the way gleb looks griff said rollant was moderatelymore than moderatelygrateful that lieutenant griff said nothing about the way he looked himself he said sir the only way i wouldve lost that fight was if he killed me i couldnt afford to griff nodded i understand how you might feel that way did he rollant had as many doubts as doubting george griff was a detinan how could he knew how desperate a blond might get in a kingdom where everything was stacked against him simplehe couldnt if he thought he could he was imagining things still and all though corporal if you have cases of insubordination you should bring them before me just as i would bring them before colonel nahath griff said yes sir rollant said resignedly no the lieutenant didnt understand gleb hadnt been insubordinate because he didnt want to obey a corporal hed been insubordinate because he didnt want to obey a blond which wasnt the same thing at all the man inside the uniform had been more important than the stripes on the tunics sleeve a corporal could appeal to the armys disciplinary mechanism without losing face a blond rollant shook his head hed had to fight that battle by himself now that hed fought and won it maybe he wouldnt have to do it again hed proved his point or so he hoped shouts rose from up ahead rollant peered through the dust the men in front of him had kicked up but he could not see much whats going on griff called along with a good many other officers back in the middle of the army the answer took a while to reach griff at last somebody said our unicornriders are skirmishing with the traitors up at the front of the force its nothing really it couldnt have been anything much or they would have got orders to deploy from column into line of battle rollant was as well pleased to keep marching even if it was through land where hed fought earlier in the summer sir he asked what happens if the northerners do wreck our glideway line not much griff answered for one thing this country is a foragers dream and for another weve got awfully good at repairing whatever damage they can do and almost as fast as they can do it so dont worry your head about that all right siri wont rollant said maybe griff was patronizing him saying that as a blond he was too ignorantor perhaps just too stupidto understand grand strategy at another time a time when his bruises didnt hurt so much he might have been offended now he just shrugged offended or not quarreling with his company commander didnt pay before long horn calls did summon the army to form line of battle rollant waved the company standard overhead so his comrades could go into line behind him one more chance for the traitors to shoot me he thought but he wore a corporals stripes and drew a corporals pay precisely because he gave them that chance whenever his regiment went into action then the horns rang out again returning the force to column for marching thats good smitty said thats very good somebody up theres really clever could you do better rollant asked brash as any detinan smitty answered i couldnt do a hells of a lot worse could i detinans always thought they could handle anything sometimes they were right sometimesmore often from everything rollant had seenwrong but they never lacked for confidence i wonder what happened up ahead rollant said what do you want to bet they ran away from us smitty said i wouldnt touch that rollant said ive got better things to do with my silver than giving it to you since when smitty said name two its not even like you sit around throwing dice all night long or spend it on loose women ive got a wife rollant said stiffly as he had to griff in marthasville hasnt stopped a lot of people i know of from general guildenstern on down smitty chuckled fondly hed screw anything that moved he would all i want to do is go home again and be with the woman i belong with rollant said in fact that wasnt quite true what he wanted to do but i havent done it he thought and then gods i hope this war ends soon roastbeef william saluted lieutenant general bell reporting as ordered sir he said bell returned the salute his right arm still worked it was one of the few pieces of him that did including his brain william thought sourly but king geoffrey had named bell to command the army of franklin and so williamwho prided himself on being known as old reliablewas dutybound to obey him no matter how much i want to do somethinganythingelse bell said i am going to use your wing as our rear guard to hold off the godsdamned southrons as we move south yes sir roastbeef william said resignedly i hope you bear in mind the pounding we took at jonestown i do bell said all parts of the army suffered heavily around marthasville as im sure you know and whose fault is that william wondered he thought of joseph the gamecock whod gone into retirement up in dicon what was joseph saying about geoffrey and bell and about the way the army had been handled since his own departure nothing goodwilliam was sure of that of course considering everything that had happened since nothing good deserved to be said you will i presume perform the duties required of you bell asked an edge to his voice yes sir william said of course i will sir i hope we dont need to do a whole lot of fighting though bell sneered havent got the stomach for it havent got the men for it roastbeef william said sir he turned on his heel and strode out of the farmhouse bell was using for his headquarters by the gods he thought for a couple of coppers id he shook his head such thoughts about a superior officer would only land him in trouble ive got to get away from this army enough is enough too much in fact he shook his head again trying to clear it as if im not in trouble already as if the whole army isnt in trouble already to the hells with me if i know whatbells doing rear guard where are we going what will we do when we get there he had no real answers he didnt think bell had real answers either except letting hesmucet chase after him for as long as the southron commander would the sun was setting but enough light remained to let roastbeef william take a long look to the north no sign of hesmucets force at the moment maybe the army of franklin could keep on outrunning the southrons but how much good would that do overall not a great deal as far as william could see halt an alert sentry called advance and be recognized im lieutenant general william william said moving slowly to keep from alarming the man and perhaps ending up with a crossbow quarrel between the ribs do you recognize me uh yes sir the sentry said sorry sir dont be roastbeef william said you should stay alert well yes sir the man said but i shouldnt come close to putting a hole in one of our generals either that wouldnt be so good if you think im going to quarrel with you soldier youd better think again william said and the sentry laughed william wasnt so sure it was funny for one thing both sides had lost officers because their own men had shot them for another he couldnt escape the nagging feeling that the army of franklin might be improved if a couple of its officers suffered such accidents thoughts like that bordered on mutiny they were not the sort of ideas that should have been going through the mind of a man known as old reliable roastbeef william couldnt drive them out of his head even so if that wasnt a telling measure of the state to which the army of franklin had fallen he couldnt imagine what would be maybe i should start writing letters anywhere would be better than here where will we be going now sir the sentry asked south for the army as a whole william answered my wing will serve as rear guard can the southrons catch up to us the sentry sounded interested and curious not anxious and afraid that only shows he doesnt understand the state were in roastbeef william thought as wing commander he himself understood it altogether too well if only king geoffrey had put me in joseph the gamecocks place once he decided he couldnt stand leaving joseph in command by all the gods and goddesses i couldnt have done worse thanbell did but bell looked like the lion god and fought like a tiger always hitting the enemy with everything he had in geoffreys eyes those attributes counted for more than reliability and so i kept right on being a wing commander and so we lost a third of the army and we lost marthasville and we took a couple of long steps toward losing the war well lick em wont we sir the sentry sounded as if he had no doubt of it were doing everything we can william answered if we can get astride the glideway line and cut it the southrons may yet come to grief well do it the sentry said and more than a little to roastbeef williams surprise they did do it a couple of days later a few miles south of fat mama the army of franklin swarmed athwart the glideway line william formed up his men facing north to hold off hesmucets southrons while mages disrupted the delicate spells without which glideway carpets would have done just as well in somebodys parlor with no sign of the southrons anywhere close by roastbeef william rode back perhaps a quarter of a mile to watch the wizards at work the men in blue robes looked as weary as the soldiers guarding them almost roastbeef william wished thraxton the braggart were back with the army almost it wasnt so much that thraxton like bell had led the army of franklin into disasters that thraxton was so godsdamned disagreeable while doing it counted for more hed proved that being a powerful mage wasnt the same as being a successful oneproved it over and over in fact the wizards chanted and made their passes and danced back and forth across the glideway line they looked a lot like a holiday gathering at the sweet ones shrine as soon as that thought crossed williams mind he wished it hadnt he had to fight the giggles for the rest of the incantation a line on the groundpresumably the one tracing the path of the glideway linebegan to glow red the mages chanted harder than ever and the glow got brighter and brighter before long william was squinting at it through halfshut eyes even then tears ran down his cheeks till at last he turned away with a sound as sharp and fierce as a bursting firepot the spell ended the assembled wizards cried out in triumph roastbeef william turned back the glideway line wasnt glowing any more but the air still quivered above it showing the heat the mages had released well done william clapped his hands that should hold up the southrons a good long while wouldnt you say i hope so one of the mages answered answered roastbeef william coughed uhi hope so sir the mage amended we killed the glideway power dead as shoe leather sure as hells we did his colleagues nodded well then the next time hesmucets men try to use the line theyll get a nasty surprise william said or am i misunderstanding something no sir youre right about that the wizard said question is though how long does it take em to repair what we just did how long would it take you roastbeef william asked before answering the man in the blue robe and his comrades put their heads together at last he said wed probably be held up for a week easy we did a proper job here we did thats not bad roastbeef william said it was almost as much as hed hoped for which considering the way the war had been going lately came close to a miracle straight from the gods but now the wizard coughed uh sir youve got to remember the southrons are better than we are at this kind of sorcery same as were better than they are at battle magic roastbeef william cursed softly the fellow was bound to be right everything william had seen in the war pointed that way he said all right then ill ask a different question how long do you think the southrons will need to fix what you just did to the glideway line the sorcerers huddled again when they broke apart the fellow who did the talking said a couple of days if were lucky a couple of hours if were not a couple of days a couple of hours roastbeef william clapped a hand to his forehead in astonished dismay and disbelief and it would stop you for a week i knew we were behind them in that sort of sorcery thunderers prong thoughi never imagined we were so far behind sorry sir the wizard said thats how it is in that case william plucked at his beard in that case lets see what we can do about it being the commander of the rear guard he was supposed to hang back and resist the southrons anyhow he posted a regiment in the pine woods near the glideway line with some very specific orders he stayed behind himself too he wasnt willing to order the men to try anything he wouldnt do himself he told the colonel if this doesnt work out the way we want it to well just pull back im not out for us to get stuck with an attack that hasnt got a chance of working no eh the colonel said youd better not tell bell that or else hell throw you out of this godsdamned army roastbeef william cleared his throat im going to pretend i didnt hear that go ahead the colonel told him wont make any difference one way or the other you can hear or not bell wont as william had with the mage he cleared his throat again the colonel refused to be cowed he said im a free detinan sir and ill godsdamned well say what i please somebody ought to dont you think you can say it colonel william answered you can say it but that wont do you any good lieutenant general bell will command this army and weve had enough dissension already dont you think oh hells yes the regimental commander said weve had all the dissension anybody could need what we havent had though is a general who knows what the devils hes doing he shook his head no i take that back we did have one but king geoffrey gave him the sack he liked joseph the gamecock did he william thought only proves he didnt know him very well hardly anybody who knew joseph very well liked him but that was neither here nor there aloud roastbeef william said lets worry about the southrons shall we and not about who did what in our own army yes sir the colonel said if everybody thought the way you do wed have a lot better chance of whipping those bastards and thats a fact he didnt think that way himself hed proved as much with his own factionalism he didnt even notice roastbeef william didnt waste time trying to correct him either he just made sure the northerners were as well positioned as they could be after that he had nothing to do but wait the southrons didnt show up till close to noon the next day by then the northern officers were having all they could do holding their men in place the soldiers of the army of franklin would fight like wildcats sometimes though they showed little more discipline than wildcats southron mages wore gray robes other than that by looks there was little to choose between them and their northern opposite numbers they rode asses as the northern wizards did even at a distance they had the air of men who werent always sure what was going on around them that put roastbeef william in mind of northern wizards too they didnt need long to discover where the northerners had wreaked sorcerous havoc on the glideway line as soon as they found it they set to work repairing the damage watching them roastbeef william believed they wouldnt take long to set it right they showed a matteroffact competence often missing in battle they did that is till the badtempered colonel sent his men roaring forward roar they did as if the lion god had emerged from those pine woods the southrons hadnt been such fools as to let their wizards go to work alonewilliam thought wizards had no business doing anything alonebut theyd detailed only a couple of platoons of soldiers to guard them and a couple of platoons werent nearly enough volleys of crossbow quarrels knocked over some of the southron defenders and some of the mages even from the woods roastbeef william heard the other wizards cry out in alarm and despair some turned to flee which resulted in a couple of them being shot in the back one with more presence of mind than his friends managed to call down two lightning bolts on the northerners before he too fell in a few minutes it was all over neither william nor the colonel wanted to linger and face the full wrath of hesmucets army they pulled back to the north with a small neat victory in hand the troops were in high spirits victories even small ones were hard to come by lately roastbeef william wished he shared their delight part of him did but only a small part the rest the rest wanted nothing so much as escape from an army where even small victories were hard to come by doubting george shrugged well sir what happened was they snookered us nobody expected theyd be laying for our wizards but they were and they made us pay pay too much general hesmucet told him much too much we cant bring these things off perfectly all the time but george knew hesmucet was right i wont let it happen again sir all right i cant ask for more than that from you and i know you mean a promise like that when you make it the commanding general said the next question is whats bell got in mind with his peregrinations all over southern peachtree making us go hungry id say doubting george replied hes been after the glideway like a hungry hound after a beefsteak but hes doing well enough without anything youd call a supply line hesmucet burst out is he really so stupid as to think we cant do likewise by the gods lieutenant general i could march my whole army across peachtree province to veldt by the western ocean and i wouldnt go hungry and the godsdamned traitors couldnt even slow me down if i set out to do it for a moment george thought he was exaggerating for effect then he took another longer mental look at the question slowly he nodded i do believe youre right sir im sure as can be that im right gods damn it hesmucet said with an arrogance that would either land him in serious troubleas it had general guildensternor make him a great soldier either way it was an arrogance george knew he lacked himself hesmucet went on as a matter of fact ive started talking by crystal ball with marshal bart and king avram about doing exactly that doubting georges bushy eyebrows flew up have you hesmucet had managed to do it without starting rumors flying all through the armyno mean feat george wondered what sort of dire threats hed used to keep the scryers quiet whatever they were theyd worked i have indeed hesmucet said i dont think im going to be able to bring bell to battle doesnt look that way anyhow hes willing enough to raid and to strike at the glideway line but he hasnt got the stomachor the menfor a standup fight any more weve finally persuaded him of that he never was much of a scholar at annasville so im not surprised he took too long to learn george said he went a long way toward losing the traitors the war before he finally got the idea that breaks my heart hesmucet said i doubt it george said and they both laughed but hesmucet soon sobered besides the only other thing i might do is keep chasing bell over this ground and i dont see much point to that not when we fought over it earlier in the yearand not when im unlikely to catch up with him as i said before i see your point sir but i have a question of my own george said hesmucet waved a hand inviting him to ask it he did if you go marching through peachtree to the western ocean what will the army of franklin do you mean without our dogging its tracks hesmucet said and doubting george nodded the commanding general gave a splendid shrug do you know what lieutenant general frankly i dont give a damn i dont think it can hurt king avrams cause enough to be worth worrying about suppose it strikes down into franklin george said suppose it attacks ramblerton or goes past the provincial capital down into cloviston or even as far as the highlow river general hesmucet shrugged again bells welcome to try my opinionmy strong opinionis that he cant pull it off whats barts opinion sir or the kings they arent so sure i can pull it off hesmucet answered to the hells with me if i know why not though lion gods fangs george except for the army of franklin what do the northerners have in the way of fighting men hereabouts none to speak of and you know it as well as i do but bart and king avram arent out here in the field they cant see it for themselves not with their minds eyes he had a point when satrap brown called out the peachtree militia he hadnt been able to put very many men in false king geoffreys service even so if you do head toward veldt and the western ocean youre cutting yourself loose from your supply line no glideway back to rising rock any more so what hesmucet retorted i keep telling anyone wholl listen bells already living off the countryside do you really think well starve to death if we march to the western ocean starve no sir george answered i just think i think id come up with a different plan sir is what i think youre a more cautious man than i am hesmucet observed to georges surprise and relief it seemed only an observation nothing morenot a slur on his courage which it easily might have been the commanding general continued nobody can top you when it comes to making a stand and fighting on the defensive ive seen that and ive seen why they call you the rock in the river of death you deserve all the praise you got there but for going after the enemy and sticking your claws in him there lieutenant general i think i have the edge on you youre probably right sir george said in the same dispassionate tones hesmucet had used between the two of us we make a pretty fair general dont we hesmucet laughed out loud not too bad by the gods not too bad he scratched his chin his short bristly beard rasped under his fingernails if i do get leave to strike out for the western ocean i may leave you behind now doubting george didnt try to hold back his disappointment what have i done to deserve something like that he demanded i told you youre a good defensive fighter hesmucet replied if i go west i may send you back into franklin to make sure bell doesnt run wild down there thats your privilege of course as the general commanding george said woodenly i will serve the kingdom as best i can wherever you place me i know you will hesmucet said thats why im thinking of doing it but gods damn it i want to be in at the death george burst out i know i know i do understand that believe me hesmucet sounded sympathetic but he also sounded unlikely to change his mind if i go west ill need to leave someone behind i can rely on absolutely from where im sitting now thats you it is if you look at it the right way a compliment thats what the priest of the lion god told the courtesan after he shot his seed too soon doubting george replied he may have thought so but she surely didnt chuckling hesmucet said youve always got a story dont you every now and again anyhow if he trotted out the wry jokes george didnt have to show how sorely he was hurt hed never been badly wounded if he were he suspected he would use his wit the same way he wondered how much good it would do it did less than he wanted here this may all be moonshine remember hesmucet said marshal bart and the king are less happy about the notion than i am they may just order me to keep after bell with my whole army no matter how useless that looks to me i told you sir i will do as you require george said im not fighting joseph to stomp off in a huff because i dont get my own way he reminds me of a threeyearold throwing a fit because his mother took away his toy a lot of truth in that by the gods easy and friendly hesmucet came over and patted him on the shoulder youre a good man george youve had some nasty jobs and not the ones you would have taken if youd had your druthers and youve done fine with every godsdamned one of them and now heres one more and im perfectly confident youll do fine with it too he walked out of georges pavilion proud and cocky and in command go ahead george heres some more garbage youre so good at cleaning it up i know youll do fine cleaning up this lot too that was what hesmucet meant and he could say it and doubting george had to take it for he was a lordly exalted general and george only a lowly lieutenant general bart could have picked me to command this army knowing that gnawed at george he could have but he didnt and so hesmucet gets to march to gloryif he doesnt make a mess of things and let the traitors win glory instead and what do i get i get to stay behind and clean up another mess if there is a mess maybe i get to stay behind at ramblerton and twiddle my thumbs wouldnt that be exciting he left the pavilion himself and stared south somewhere up ahead there bell was flitting ahead like a will o the wisp drawing king avrams army after him keeping it from doing what it should be doing hesmucet was right about that sure as sure he was but his being right took away none of the hurt i want the glory i want the people cheering me over in king geoffreys army people called roastbeef william old reliable he hadnt got the job he wanted either not when geoffrey fired joseph the gamecock the rock in the river of death it sounded fancier than old reliable but what did it mean the same godsdamned thing colonel andy came up to him sir he began what the hells dyou want doubting george snarled taking out his frustrations on his adjutant andy stiffened a very minor noblea mere baronethe had more than minor pride pardon me for existing sir he said icily ill think about it georges voice remained gruff but then he relented im sorry colonel im truly sorry it had nothing to do with you it did not sound that way andy observed i know i am sorry george said and explained the visit hed just had from hesmucet he goes off to have adventures and leaves you behind andy said when he was done i dont blame you a bit for being upset sir his adjutant was fiercely loyal george knew hed tried his best not to deserve such loyalty i do apologize he said again i had no business barking at you never mind sir never mind colonel andy replied can you do anything to get him to change his mind i doubt it doubting george said if i wore his boots i daresay id do the same thing and leave it up to some other sorry son of a bitch to handle whatever else needed handling but im the sorry son of a bitch in question and i suppose thats why i barked terrible just terrible andy stroked his beard did he tell you what forces you would have no but i can make a good guess whatever he doesnt want and whatever i can scrape up george answered terrible just terrible andy repeated we have to keep this from happening only thing i can think of that would do it would be to beat bell up herebeat him and take his army off the board altogether george replied i dont believe its likely though why not with his plump cheeks and angry expression colonel andy resembled nothing so much as an indignant chipmunk weve licked the army of franklin whenever it would give us battle thats why not doubting george replied i dont think bell has any intention of giving us another crack at him i think hell keep on running and hope we keep on chasing him cowardly son of a bitch his adjutant said with a distinct sniff no not bell george shook his head you can call bell a great many things but hes no coward hes finally figured out that one traitor isnt worth two southron men thats all and that what the northern bards have to say about it doesnt mean a thing it took him a lot longer than it should have but hes got it now andy sniffed again hes pretty stupid this time george nodded he is pretty stupid brave and deadlyand stupid hes like a hawk on somebodys wrist point it at prey and it will go out and kill but ask it to figure things out for itself no only geoffrey did andy said only geoffrey did doubting george agreed of course geoffrey is pretty stupid too if anyone wants to know what i think he had a perfectly good general in charge of his army here and sacked him for no good reason he wanted a general who would go out there and fight colonel andy said be careful what you wantyou may get it george said before he put his fighting general in there he still had marthasville and the army of franklin was still a real army now bells running around trying to make a pest of himself with what he has left and there isnt enough left of marthasville to talk about brilliant change of command wasnt it just fornicating brilliant andy smiled somehow i dont think youre too sorry about that who me doubting george said rain poured down out of a leaden sky surprisingly cold rain that soaked rollant and the standard he bore and turned the red clay of southern peachtree province into red glue he slogged on one step after another pulling each foot out of the mud in turn and then setting it down again every so often he stepped off the road to scrape muck off his boots with some grass or a shrub the southron armys asses and unicorns couldnt do that not only did they struggle more than the footsoldiers they also chewed up the road worse one stretch was almost like soup i wish they wouldnt send the beasts and wagons down the same road we use not in this weather rollant grumbled wish for the moon while youre at it smitty said thanks friend you always know how to make me feel better smitty grinned water dripped off the brim of his hatand off the end of his beaky nose your wish is my command your corporalship sir as a matter of fact your command is my command id command you to stop your nonsense but i know better than to waste my breath rollant said only proves youre married id say you know i am rollant pointed at smitty and i know youre not so what do you know about it just watching my ma and pa smitty answered but theyve been together thirty years now without killing each other so i expect theyre doing something right rollant had trouble arguing with that a few minutes later traffic on the road didnt merely slow it stalled altogether what the hells is going on here rollant demanded irately and he was far from the only one as he stood there the mud tried to suck him down into its cold wet slimy maw lieutenant griff sent a man forward to see if he could discover what had gone wrong the fellow sensibly trotted along on the grass by the side of the road not in the roadway itself he came back by the same route theres wagons up ahead stuck in what looks like a bog sir he reported to griff its so deep i wouldnt be surprised if there were crocodiles in it well why arent people going around griff asked a lot of em are trying to haul out the wagons the soldier replied they arent having much luck though what are we supposed to do in the meantime sergeant joram asked stand here in the mud and drown it must have been doing its best to pull him under too before long a southron captain who was so muddy he might have been dipped in rustcolored paint ordered griffs company forward you men can lend a hand on the ropes he said that was when rollant found out what underofficers rank was really worth as corporal and standardbearer he stood around with lieutenant griff and sergeant joram and the other men with stripes on their sleeves the common soldiers sloshed down into the bogand the messenger had described it accuratelyseized the long ropes fastened to the front end of the lead wagon and pulled like men possessed ive still got just as much chance of getting killed as anybody else he thought more chance than most because i bear the standard but the rest of a corporals job looks a lot better than a common soldiers try as they would the mudstreaked men in gray couldnt shift the wagon then a mage on an ass muddy all the way to the belly rode up the captain whod summoned griffs company recognized him thats colonel albertus he said hes called the great thought gods know why he raised his voice colonel albertus can you help us sir albertus reined in most of the time rollant judged he would have been an impressive man with a long pointed gray beard a long pointed nose and piercing black eyes at the moment he resembled nothing so much as a drowned billy goat his voice was deep and resonant i shall do what i can sounds more like a circus mountebank than a proper wizard sergeant joram said behind his hand well lets see what he can do rollant answered and the sergeant nodded colonel albertus fixed the lead wagon with those piercing eyes and began to chant he made pass after pass his fingers writhing like so many serpents the wagon began to twitch and shake after a moment it tried to rise but was held in place by the sucking power of the mud albertus paused for a moment to curse then incanted harder than ever by the gods maybe the old bastard can bring it off after all joram said i hope so rollant said with a horrible squelching noise the wagon did pull itself free of the encumbering mud the weary soldiers whod been trying to get it out raised a cheerwhich cut off abruptly when instead of stopping just above the bog the wagon continued to rise till its dripping mucky wheels were a good ten feet off the ground the men on the ropes whod been closest to the wagon started to rise into the air too till they let go and fell back into the mud some of them squawked some cursed some did both at once rollant didnt blame those last albertus the socalled great had produced a sorcery more successful than it might have been and as with a lot of sorceries this one proving more successful than it might have been was at best useless and at worst a help to the enemy well colonel what in the hells are you going to do now demanded the captain whod summoned albertus so much for respecting a superior officer rollant thought but wizards were officers by courtesy to let them order common soldiers around real fighting men as hed seen before disdained them albertus gave the wagon a distinctly walleyed stare the stare he sent the contemptuous captain was something else again rollant was glad it wasnt aimed his way a poisonous snake might have aimed that sort of look at its prey the instant before it struck i shall endeavor to repair matters the mage said in a voice as coldblooded as a serpent if he put the captain in fear that worthy hid it very well you can endeavor all you godsdamned well please he snarled you wouldnt have to if youd done it right the first time and if you splendid soldiers had done everything right the first time this cursed war would have been over year before last colonel albertus retorted the captain sputtered and fumed but he kept quiet because the wizard had spoken selfevident truth albertus smile didnt show fangs but it might as well have turning back to the wagon albertus began another spell this one sounded less imperious more cautious than the one hed used before its results seemed less dramatic too rollant approved of that high drama and trouble were intimately associated in his mind when colonel albertus called out a word of power and pointed at the uncannily floating wagon it seemed more a request than a command and the request got results too where the earlier command had only caused a new and more spectacular problem little by little the wagon drifted down till its wheels rested on the air a few inches above the mud from which it had been rescued albertus gave the captain of footsoldiers an icy bow now your men should be able to push and pull the wagon to drier ground he said go ahead and try it boys the captain called cautiously some of the soldiers took hold of the ropes and began to pull even more cautiously others got behind the wagon and pushed they all let out a cheer when it moved forward far more readily than it had while stuck in the mud thank you very much sir the captain told colonel albertus but he couldnt resist getting in another dig now do you suppose you can get the rest of em out of the muck without sending em halfway up to mt panamgam the mage aimed a harried look his way i shall bend every effort to that purpose his efforts could have used a bit more bending his first spell with the second wagon failed to get it out of the mud the captain let out a loud scornful snort colonel albertus kept on incanting when at last the wagon did emerge it rose only two or three feet into the air the men could push and pull it forward without much trouble albertus spells went better still on the third and fourth wagons hed learned what needed doing by then and he did it those wagons came out on the first try and rose only a foot or so above the surface of the mud not even the captain could complain all he said was appreciate it colonel yes well im sure youre welcome albertus the great said he scrambled aboard his ass as if hed never mounted it before and rode off down the road by the time colonel nahaths regiment made camp rollant felt about ready to drop his men had a hells of a time starting fires even though the rain had eased off by then wet fuel and wet tinder made things difficult at last the squad got a couple of smoky blazes going wish we had a mage along now rollant grumbled hed have set us up in a hurry either that or hed have burned down half the godsdamned province trying smitty said rollant nodded mages could bungle things sure enough and often did he sat down on the wet ground his tunic and pantaloons were already soaked a little more water made no difference to his surprise the trooper named gleb sat down next to him glebs face still showed the marks of their fight he supposed his own did too did gleb want another try if he did rollant was ready to give him one but all gleb said was ask you something corporal you can ask rollant said roughly i dont promise to answer gleb nodded all right thats fair enough he still hesitated rollant gestured impatiently as if to say come on words spurted from gleb in a rush how was it you were able to lick me when we tangled to rollant the answer to that was plain as the sun in the sky how i didnt dare lose thats how by glebs frown that made less sense to him than it did to rollant of course hed never been a blond he proved that by continuing but how could you beat me i mean youre uh not a proper detinan and i am as patiently as he could rollant said youve seen me fight the traitors havent you gleb nodded again well yes i did that all right didnt i rollant asked gleb nodded once more in some exasperation rollant said those bastards are detinans arent they if i can fight them why the hells cant i fight you i dont know glebs broad shoulders went up and down in a shrug theyre the enemy youre supposed to fight them rollant tapped the stripes on his sleeve you know i almost had to get myself killed before theyd put these on me dont you this time glebs nod came much more slowly rollant persisted and you know why too dont you on account of im a blond thats why you know all about that the trooper muttered something rollant couldnt make out what it was just as well he thought then gleb said it wasnt like i thought it would be im trying to tell you why gods damn it rollant snapped i had to work so hard to get these stripes i dont want to lose them if you licked me i likely wouldve lost them and so you would have had to kill me to make me quit is that plain enough for you oh gleb said maybe he got it maybe he didnt rollant didnt much care one way or the other as long as the detinan took his orders and gave him no trouble what gleb thought didnt matter to him he wondered how much gleb actually did think not much unless he missed his guess that didnt matter either not unless his stupidity endangered the men around himor it led him to something like picking a fight with a corporal who also happened to be a blond but i dont happen to be a blond rollant thought i am a blond i happen to be a corporal thats how detinans see it anyway how detinans saw it though didnt matter so much to him not any more regardless of how even detinans in king avrams army with him looked at the world and at him certain facts no one could deny here he sat wet and miserable in the middle of an invading army in the middle of peachtree province he wore a gray tunic and pantaloons like everybody elses he got paid like everybody else too and that hed come here with weapons to hand ready to kill any detinans who didnt agree with his comrades and him went a long way toward proving how much had changed since he was first grudgingly allowed to fight after the war everybodys likely to try to forget blonds did some of the fighting for king avram he thought thats the sort of thing ordinary detinans wont want to remember they can go back to thinking were just blonds if they forget well we cant let that happen gleb he said looks like were a little short on firewood chop some more he waited to see what the soldier would do all right corporal gleb replied and went off to obey the order slowly rollant nodded to himself sure as hells some things had changed xii what the hells is bell playing at general hesmucet demanded going over the reports the scouts brought in about the army of franklins movements if he keeps going in this direction hell be all the way down to caesar by the time hes through thats where this campaign started near enough doubting george perched on a stool in the farmhouse hesmucet was using for a headquarters hesmucet wondered how many farmhouses hed used for temporary headquarters since the war began he couldnt have guessed not even to the nearest dozen when the war finally ended if it ever did he intended to stay away from farmhouses from then on george said one thing bells doing hes making you dance to his tune instead of the other way round you imposed your will on joseph the gamecock you havent done that with bellif you leave marthasville out of the bargain of course oh of course hesmucet said dryly no one would want to talk about marthasville at all bell didnt care one way or the other what the devils happened to it thats not what i meant sir or not exactly doubting george said whatever hed meant he had a point or at least a good part of one as long as the southrons kept chasing lieutenant general bell and the army of franklin all over southern peachtree province hesmucet couldnt do what he really wanted to make the north regret ever starting a war against king avram if i can march to thewesternocean that will prove geoffreys king over nothing but air and brags he thought i can do it i know i can he sighed turning into a hero would be a lot easier if the bastards on the other side cooperated a little more im sure youre right sir doubting george replied one thing though im reasonably sure they feel the same way about you thats something hesmucet agreed its less than id like but youre right it is something after his secondincommand left he summoned major alva and asked him can you divine what bell has in mind trying next i can do my best the bright young mage said how good my best will prove depends on how well bell is warded and how firm his plans are in his own mind if he doesnt know what hes going to do i cant very well pick it out of his brain now can i uh sir what brain hesmucet said scornfully the next sign of having one in actual working order that bell shows will be the first major alva smiled thats funny sir i like it i like it a lot glad to amuse you hesmucet told him now can you manage this wizardry as i say sir i can certainly try the requisite spells alva replied i dont know how much ill learn from them till i do get on with it then hesmucet said report back to me after whatever happens happens yes sir alva saluted and hurried away only after the mage had gone did hesmucet realize he hadnt had to correct him on military deportment even once little by little alva was learning if he kept learning he might eventually turn into a civilized human being and perhaps even into a tolerable soldier hesmucet wouldnt have imagined either one of those as the remotest possibility a few months before alva came back late the following day well hesmucet barked well sir the wards werent so well established as i thought they might be and bell is sure about what he wants to do next the brash young mage said im not surprised they didnt bother warding him hesmucet said they must have figured no one would want to look into such an empty head alvas laugh was deliciously scandalized the general commanding went on all rightyou were able to look around inside the emptiness what did you find he intends to strike at caesar sir the wizard replied he hesitated then risked a question uh is that good news or bad depends hesmucet answered if we can get there with our whole force before he hits the place its good news for us and bad news for him if we cant it might be the other way roundand hes ahead of us alva nodded yes that would seem to make sense what do we do if we cant get there ahead of him tell the garrison commander to fight like a mad bastard till we can come up hesmucet said murray the coarse did it and he can too hes got a good natural position to defend joseph the gamecock used it to good advantage against us now its our turn can we do it i aim to find out hesmucet answered commanding the southron garrison was a colonel named clark the seamster when hesmucet got in touch with him by crystal ball he said your news is no surprise to me sir ive just had one of bells men come in under flag of truce demanding our surrender ive seen notes i liked better oh hesmucet said what does it say here ill read it for you colonel clark paused to set spectacles on his nose then took a sheet of paper from his breast pocket here we go sir i demand the immediate and unconditional surrender of the post and garrison under your command and should this be acceded to all detinan officers and men will be paroled in a few days if the place is carried by assault no prisoners will be taken he looked up at hesmucet over the tops of the spectacles perhaps i should remind you sir that i have a couple of regiments of blond troops under my command you need to know were still a couple of days away hesmucet said what did you tell him one moment sir and ill read you a copy of my answer clark the seamster found another paper here i wrote your communication of this date just received which is true i got it less than an hour ago in reply i have to state that i am somewhat surprised at the concluding sentence to the effect that if this place is carried by assault no prisoners will be taken in my opinion i can hold this post if you want it come and take it you told bell that hesmucet said in astonished but delighted disbelief i sure as hells did colonel clark answered i can hold the son of a bitch off and im not about to put men under my command in danger of being murdered or seized and sent back to their old liege lords theyll fight like madmen to keep that from happening and you can count on it good for you colonel i admire your spirit now i rely on you to make it good hesmucet clapped his hands he didnt share clarks confidence in the fighting ability of blonds he remained of the opinion that few of them made good soldiers but he couldnt help applauding the bravado the garrison commander had shown ill do my best sir clark said i just wonder if the onelegged marvel will even have the nerve to put in a real attack on caesar when he tried one at whole mackerel he got his nose bloodied for him well actually murray the coarse was the one who came away from that fight with a bloody face but i take your point hesmucet said hang on for two days no matter what he does to you and then well be there i swear it by all the gods ill do it sir you can count on me clark the seamster said i do colonel hesmucet nodded to the scryer colonel clarks image vanished from the crystal ball hesmucet left the scryers tent and shouted for a runner yes sir one of his bright young men said go fetch me marble bill hesmucet snapped yes sir the runner saluted and hurried off to find the commander of unicornriders he brought him back even sooner than general hesmucet had hoped pride in his voice he said here you are sir thank you hesmucet turned to marble bill can you get a couple of regiments of riders into caesar by tomorrow afternoon marble bill frowned without resistance from the enemy i could obviously it depends on how much wed have to fight through on the way so i cant really give you a certain answer hesmucet drummed his fingers on the right thigh of his pantaloons that wasnt the sort of reply hed wanted to hear in a couple of sentences marble bill had shown why he was an indifferent commander of unicornriders fortunately brigadier spinner on the traitors side was no better and marble bill seemed the best officer hesmucet had but best wasnt the same as good and hesmucet knew that only too well what do you think he asked against what youre likely to run into along the way can you get there if you give the order sir ill do my best marble bill replied that wasnt what hesmucet wanted to hear either he wanted to hear yes sir that failing he wanted to hear if i cant find a way ill make a new one those godsdamned traitors cant stop me but marble bill was what he had to work with go try do everything you can hesmucet told him yes sir the commander of unicornriders answered youll be doing the trapped garrison an enormous favor if you succeed hesmucet said hoping to build a fire under him it didnt work marble bill remained cool i told you sir ill do my best he saluted and took his leave having given his orders hesmucet could only wait to see what became of them he muttered in frustration here he was in command of the greatest army in the east but every bit as dependent on time to show what lay ahead as any other soldier he wished it were otherwise but in his years hed wished for all sorts of things that hadnt come true he got back in touch with colonel clark theyre prodding us sir clark said but they arent putting all their force into it i dont think either that or theyve got less force to put than i thought they did well if they arent hitting you with all theyve got what in the hells are they doing hesmucet demanded clark the seamster sent him an exasperated look sir i can hold caesar or else i can throw scouts out all over the landscape to the hells with me if i see how i can do both at once with the little force ive got here i daresay youre right hesmucet admitted but i wish you were wrong will i get help clark asked ive sent out unicornriders under marble bill hesmucet said if everything goes well theyll be there tomorrow i know ill have footsoldiers there the day after i already told you that yes sir you did colonel clark said im sure the footsoldiers will come ill believe the unicornriders when i see em another man with confidence in marble bill hesmucet thought but then in one way or another unicornriders had been disappointing king avrams armies ever since the war was new why should this campaign prove any different from so many of the earlier ones because ill scream and fuss till my commanders do it right hesmucet thought he hadnt quite managed that yet hed got to the point where the unicornridersunless they had the misfortune to bump up against ned of the forestdidnt go too egregiously wrong too often but that still wasnt the same as turning them into a weapon to match the one that had done the traitors so much good before long he found out what that part of the army of franklin not attacking caesar was up to wrecking more glideway line clark the seamster did have some scouts out and reported northern mages working as much destructive magic as they could the news alarmed hesmucet much less than it would have a couple of months before let them do what they want he said well either repair it or we wont worry about it were more or less living off the country now he did curse lieutenant general bell for pulling him down here to southern peachtree province again his full mind his full heart werent on this pursuit he had to remind himself to take it seriously he kept looking away looking away looking away toward veldt and the western ocean if i can get there this war is as good as wonpeachtreeprovince helps feed parthenia if i burn my way across this province duke edward and the army ofsouthern parthenia will get pretty hungry pretty fast its not just a matter of doing things herewhat i do here affects the whole godsdamned war marshal bart had been the first one to realize that hed brought king avram with him and hesmucet as well the sovereign and his two chief commanders saw the war as a single entity with all the parts connected hesmucet didnt think any northerner looked at it the same way he was sure false king geoffrey didnt duke edward after a little thought hesmucet shook his head duke edward was a brilliant commander but he fought battles not campaigns being so embattled he couldnt afford to look at a wider canvas turn me loose then hesmucet thought let me move against the traitors let me march throughpeachtreeprovince ill peel it right down to the ground and lets see the north keep fighting after that theyll remember my name here a hundred years from now the rest of detina may not remember so well but that wont matter for it will be one detina roastbeef william watched the army of franklins mages destroying the glideway line south of caesar he watched unicornriders posted around the mages to warn of any sudden southron onslaught a good raid he thought this is what the army offranklin has been reduced to were raiders now no more we couldnt have done worse with me in command we might have done better he sighed they hadnt wanted himneither thraxton the braggart nor king geoffrey im old reliable im good enough to lead a wing but not an army they put a hero in to lead the army and oh hasnt he done a splendid job i wonder what hell try next bitter roastbeef william asked himself why shouldnt i be bitter if anybodys earned the right im the man the ironic thing was that little by little lieutenant general bell had started to learn william had expected him to throw the whole army at caesar but he hadnt when the southron commanding the garrison cast defiance in his face hed skirmished against the soldiers there and then gone after the glideway hed got a rude surprise trying to overrun the little force up at whole mackerel and he didnt care to get two such surprises if hed learned that lesson after his first failed attack outside marthasville the army of franklin might still hold the place roastbeef william sighed if pigs had wings everyone would carry umbrellas a courier rode up and spoke with one of the unicornriders on guard duty the rider pointed toward william the courier came over to him at a trot reining in the fellow said lieutenant general bells compliments sir and you are requested to report to his headquarters immediately bell hasnt been in the habit of giving me compliments lately even those of ordinary courtesy william thought but the man remained in command of the army of franklin or of what was left of it ill come of course he said his own unicorn was tethered not far away he swung up into the saddle and followed the courier back to a farmhouse that offered no visible virtues past a roof and four walls those modest attributes were not to be despised not in a countryside that had seen as much fighting as this one dismounting roastbeef william strode into the farmhouse there sat lieutenant general bell putting away the little bottle of laudanum that let him deal with the pain of his woundsand that might have robbed him of some of the rather poor wits he owned no help for that either though william saluted and said reporting as ordered sir ah yes lieutenant general bell straightened grimacing as he did so and returned the salute ive just received a despatch from nonesuch concerning you he glowered at william from under bushy brows you did not tell me you had sent a request to be detached from service to this army ive been delighted serving here roastbeef william thought its a rare privilege taking orders from a man junior to me in time served in rank and watching him butcher what was a fine fighting force if he said any of that aloud he would be screaming before he was through at least i have the sense to know as much what he did say were two perfectly safe words yes sir well whether you told me or not your request has been approved bell said you will be transferred out of the command of the army of franklin oh gods be praised roastbeef william thought saying that to the man who held the command in the army of franklin could only cause trouble he didnt want trouble not when he was escaping he asked where is my new assignment sir anywhere but here oh gods be praised indeed here is the order bell found a sheet of paper and thrust it at him i wish you the best of luck in your new post roastbeef william took the sheet let me see that sir if i may the script was as ornate as one would expect from the royal chancery the prose style was ornate too william waded through flowery compliments and endless subordinate clauses till he got to the meat you are requested and required to repair immediately to the vicinity of veldt the scribe wrote there to organize defenses against general hesmucets anticipated westward movement you are to oppose him as far forward as you can and to continue to oppose him with all resources at your disposal william looked up at bell youve read this oh yes the general commanding replied it says im supposed to oppose the southrons with all the resources at my disposal william said when i get to veldt what sort of resources will i have at my disposal lieutenant general bell started to shrug winced and cursed softly under his breath i havent the slightest idea whatever garrisons in the citadel there i suppose and however many militiamen you can persuade satrap brown to turn loose and arm that was what roastbeef william had been afraid of im supposed to take up a collection of miserable odds and sods then and stop hesmucet with them seems to be what the order says wouldnt you agree so it is william said heavily but how in the hells am i supposed to do that when the whole army of franklin couldnt manage it not my responsibility bell said roastbeef william wanted to kick him he went on im sure youll do your best yes sir of course sir william said in a hollow voice but what will you and the army of franklin be doing in the meantime youre the best protection peachtree province has these past several weeks ive done my best to drive general hesmucet mad bell replied if hes chasing the army of franklin all over the landscape he cant very well march west against you can he well no sir william admitted but suppose he stops chasing you and goes on his merry way bell looked mysterious which inclined roastbeef william toward violence against his person once more then he said i probably shouldnt tell you this since youre going away but they do call you old reliable and i think youve earned the name after that sort of buildup william expected to be disappointed by whatever he said but he turned out to have made a mistake there for bell declared ned of the forest is bringing his unicornriders west to rejoin the army of franklin is he william exclaimed bells leonine head solemnly nodded william said that is good news sir neds a fine officer even if he can be a bit touchy he couldnt get along with thraxton the braggart is what you mean bell said of course nobody gets along with thraxton you didnt think that when he put you in command here william thoughtwhich didnt mean bell was wrong with a sigh the departing officer said i wish things here would have turned out better so do i bell replied if anyone is mad enough to believe i wanted to leave marthasville to the tender mercies of the southrons do you know lieutenant general when they paraded through the city they had the godsdamned gall to use a blond as one of their standardbearersand not just a blond mind you but a blond underofficer of all the impossible things blonds in king avrams army have fought better than detinans ever imagined they could roastbeef william said its no wonder some officers in this kingdomin this armyhave begun to wonder if we shouldnt put crossbows in their hands and see what they can do for us bell sneered i heard about brigadier patrick the cleavers memorial to king geoffrey i couldnt very well keep from hearing about it when i was flat on my back after i lost my leg look what happened to patrick he was ordered not to talk about it and hes been passed over for promotion every time a new command came open no thanks lieutenant generali want no part of arming blonds if we can get enough detinan soldiers well and good sir william said if not and if blonds can fightshouldnt we get some use out of them seeing that our enemies do arming blonds destroys everything being a detinan means bell said yes sir roastbeef william agreed he had no great love for blondsexcept perhaps for some of their prettier women but he couldnt help adding losing the war destroys everything being a detinan means too if arming blonds would keep that from happening now we could worry about everything else later i dont think its a good idea king geoffrey doesnt think its a good idea either bell said you may not care about my views lieutenant general but those of the king will prevail he was right of course he was right about geoffreys suppression of patrick the cleavers memorial he was right about patricks failure to get promoted of course patrick the cleaver probably didnt altogether understand what being a detinan meant he wasnt a northerner born but had crossed the western ocean from the sapphire isle himself as a young man to him blonds might seem like people not like naturalborn serfs if a few brigades of wellarmed blond crossbowmen and pikemen were waiting for me at veldt id be a lot happier going therei could do something against hesmucet in that case william thought but then he frowned or could i could i trust them not to shoot me in the back and go over to the southrons if we did use them wed have to promise to treat them like detinans once they left the army he mused cows will fly before we arm blonds bell said dont waste your time thinking about it and he was bound to be right about that too roastbeef william saluted if you will excuse me sir i have a lot to think about before i take over my new command of course youre dismissed lieutenant general bell said and i wish you the best of fortune in the west thank you sir william said the best fortune i can think of would be for the southrons not to come west at me if tearing up the glideway line will keep that from happening im all for it i think it will bell said after all the grand marshals army was nothing but a starving band of fugitives on the retreat from pahzbull fifty years ago they got in but most of them didnt come out again i dont see any reason why the same thing cant happen to general hesmucet and his men yes sir roastbeef william said what went through his mind while he got out the polite words was oh if i werent leaving id tell him to his face what an idiot he is the sorbian army didnt ruin the grand marshal and his host when he marched west the sorbian winter did thekingdom ofsorb has the worst winters in the worldpeachtreeprovince has some of the mildest winters in the world where are the blizzards to wreck hesmucets army if you have one up your sleeve youd better pull it out pretty godsdamned soon again good luck to you and i hope the southrons stay far away bell said thank you sir william replied so do i may i ask you something he waited for the general commanding to nod then put his question now that im leaving are you going to name patrick the cleaver wing commander in my place bell didnt hesitate for a moment no hes a good fighting soldier and brave as they come but i dont think he makes a suitable wing commander besides even if i thought he did even if i proposed it king geoffrey would never approve the appointment weve already talked about the cleavers memorial the king doesnt forget something like that he was bound to be right he didnt have much of a sense for politics in the broader meaning of the word but a shrewd understanding of the way the kings mind worked went a long way toward making up for the lack roastbeef william also noticed one other irony bells description of patrick the cleaver might have been a description of himself of course bell had been given command of not just a wing but an army and having got high command hed proceeded to prove he wasnt suitable for it well thats king geoffreys worry now william thought he wantedbell in command and he got him and everything that went with him i wonder when hell take joseph the gamecock off the shelf again and see if he can repair the damage william left the farmhouse he swung up into the saddle of his unicorn to ride away from the army of franklin as he booted the beast into motion he felt as if he were escaping a sinking ship but he shook his head a moment later the only way to escape the sinking ship he feared would be to flee king geoffreys kingdom altogether the clouds gathering over the north looked very black indeed i cant run away roastbeef william thought im a soldier my duty is to fight for my king and my kingdom to fight as long as i can and as hard as i can i may losei likely will losebut i have to try he rode off to the west to do what he could to hold back the building storm captain gremio sipped from a tin cup of what the cooks called tea he made a horrible face even with plenty of honey slopped into it it was bitter enough to pucker his mouth gods thats vile he said sergeant thisbe sitting crosslegged on the ground beside him took a cautious sip of his own he nodded couldnt be much worse whatever roots theyre using theyd better use some different ones the next time why are you drinking more of it sir the company commander put his free hand on the left side of his chest why because no matter how foul it tastes its making my heart beat faster and my eyes open up thats why maybe the cooks know something after all thisbe took another more experimental sip then nodded again i suppose youre right its still nasty though if it wakes me up and gets me going i dont much care how nasty it is gremio drained the cup i suppose the blonds drank tea from roots like these all the time back in the old days im sorry for them if they did thisbe said the gods really must have hated them ha gremio said if only you were joking after all what did the gods bring them the gods brought them us thats what and since the gods love us they must have hated the blonds stands to reason eh makes sense to me sir thisbe finished his own cup of tea and then made as if to retch gremio laughed though that really wasnt funny either thisbe asked what do we do today march along aimlessly forage as much as we can skirmish with the southrons if we happen to bump into them gremio answered i cant imagine anything more exciting can you thisbe gave back an uncertain smile if you dont like what we are doing what do you think we should be up to defending marthasville gremio said at once if wed kept on trying to defend the place instead of attacking an army twice our size we might still hold it well yes sir the sergeant said but its a little too late to worry about that now isnt it no indeed gremio answered thisbe looked puzzled the company commander explained its much too late to worry about that now er yes thisbes grin was uncertain too somewhere not far away a sergeant from another company started shouting at his men getting them up and ready for another days march no matter how aimless thisbe also climbed to his feet form up you lugs he shouted if you think youre going to be lazy all day you can godsdamned well think again gremios bones creaked when he rose when he walked off behind a bush his left foot felt cold examination showed the sole of his left shoe was staring to separate from the upper he muttered something nasty under his breath as he buttoned his fly he couldnt even complain about something like that not out loud not when a fair number of the men he led had no shoes at all geese mournfully honked overhead as the army of franklin got on the road again pointing to them gremio said i wish i could fly north for the winter too then i wouldnt have to worry about a lot of things thisbe gave him a quizzical look a couple of soldiers started honking as such things had a way of doing the raucous noise spread through the whole company what in the damnation is wrong with your men captain colonel florizel demanded why nothing sir gremio replied they arent down at all and they still have plenty of pluck oh good glad to hear it florizel said vaguely thisbe sent gremio a horrible look he tipped his hat to the sergeant thisbe snorted that tea must be rotting my brains gremio thought he tramped along the back roads of southern peachtree province when he went through a muddy stretch he had no doubt that his shoe was starting to come apart again he kept his curses quiet and private where exactly are we going sir sergeant thisbe asked as gremio squelched along with mud between his toes good question sergeant excellent question in fact gremio replied at the moment though i dont even know where approximately were going let alone exactly this isnt the first time youve exposed my ignorance either shall we consult with colonel florizel or shall we try to retain our touching simple faith that the general commanding has some idea of what were doing erwhatever you like sir thisbe said in my dreams sergeant but nowhere else gremio said sohe bowedwhat is your pleasure well never mind sir the sergeant answered i suppose well both find out i suppose we will gremio bowed again as if impersonating a very punctilious nobleman now i do hope you wont ask any awkward questions about what were going to do when we get there thisbe gave him an odd look i wouldnt think of it sir are you feeling all right but for one sloppy foot and that touching simple faith i was telling you about im fine sergeant though i do thank you for asking gremio bowed yet again the look sergeant thisbe sent him this time was a good deal more than odd but before the sergeant could say anything horns blared from off to one side colonel florizel bellowed shift from column into line of battle move move move hello gremio exclaimed i still dont know where were going but now at least ive got some idea of what were doing were going to fight he raised his voice to a shout my company shift from column into line move they performed their evolutions with the automatic speed and precision endless hours on the practice field had drilled into them as they moved thisbe asked what are we going to fight sir general hesmucets whole army to the hells with me if i know gremio answered one more thing well find out im sure if they were going up against hesmucets whole army not many of them would come back from the encounter he knew as much as thisbe was bound to neither of them dwelt on it horns blared again colonel florizel shouted forward did he know what he was advancing against gremio was inclined to doubt it the regimental commander ordered the men forward nonetheless when gremio tramped past a stand of trees that had obscured his view he discovered the army of franklin wasnt the only one that made mistakes a couple of regiments of soldiers in gray had also formed line of battle and were trying to scrape up breastworks and dig holes in the ground for themselves they must have been coming up from the south to reinforce caesar gremio said why dont they surrender thisbe said they havent got a chance not against so many men i dont know gremio answered then as he came closer to the embattled foe he understood oh theyre full of blonds theyre going to be full of dead blonds if they dont give up thisbe said i dont think they think they can surrender gremio said they may be right too i havent got much stomach for a massacre but plenty of soldiers in the army of franklin wouldhe was sure of that king avram the men in gray shouted king avram and freedom no they showed no sign of wanting to surrender some of them started singing the battle psalm of the kingdom how much fighting had they seen how many men would they kill could they kill before they went down to death themselves they seemed big and strong and ready to fight gremio knew perfectly well that the army of franklin couldnt afford the losses it would take subduing them he also knew perfectly well his comrades couldnt walk away from the blonds he sighed he hated quandaries like that be careful he called to his company those bastards up ahead have nothing to lose dont throw yourselves away if you can help it king geoffrey needs every single one of us they werent going to listen to him he could tell at once by the way they leaned forward how eager they were to get into this skirmish some of them were liege lords themselves others aspired to estates with serfs blonds who bore arms against detinans contradicted everything they held dear and conjured up pictures of peasant revolts now the northerners had a chance to make the blonds pay and they were going to take it as usual soldiers from both sides started shooting too soon coming into crossbow range of each other though didnt take long gremio hated the sound of quarrels humming past his ear he hated even more the flat unemphatic smack they made when they slapped into flesh and the sounds that came from a man whod been shot he hated those most of all blonds ahead began falling gremio wondered how many of them came from the southron provinces and how many were runaway serfs he couldnt very well pause and ask all he could do was run toward them waving an officers sword that wouldnt do him a bit of good till he got close enough for them to have a fine chance of killing him too the more he thought about it the stupider a way to pass his time this seemed however much he wanted to though he couldnt go back even if his superiors didnt crucify him for cowardice hed never again be able to hold up his head among men that mattered to him more than the possibility of getting shot not for the first time he wondered why it should beside him thisbe said its a good thing theyre all crossbowmen we couldnt charge them like this if they had pikemen with them oh yes a very good thinga bloody wonderful thing gremio said in tones of something less than complete enthusiasm sergeant thisbes laugh abruptly turned into a yelp of pain instead of running the underofficer took a couple of staggering steps and crashed to the ground clutching at his left leg gremio skidded to a stop just beyond him go on sir thisbe said go on ill be all right he tried to get to his feet tried and failed the left leg of his pantaloons started to turn red he began crawling away from the fight ahead here ill help you gremio knelt beside him give me your arm ill heave you upright and you can use your good leg for a little ways weve got to get you back to the healers get that wound seen to thisbe waved him away repeating go on sir ill be all right sergeant give me your arm gremio said in a voice harsher than hed ever used with thisbe that is an order thisbe looked as if he wanted to argue further but then the wound must have twinged again for he winced and nodded yes sir thats better gremio put the underofficers arm over his shoulder let me have some help from your good leg if you can sergeant he straightened thisbe wasnt a big man gremio had less trouble getting him up than hed expected come on he said sir i dont want to go to the healers thisbe said what you want doesnt matter very much right now sergeant gremio said what you need matters and what you need is healing ill get you there never fear sir could you bandage me yourself thisbe asked desperately by all the gods sir ill give you anything you like anything at all if only you dont take me to the healers why are you so afraid of them gremio asked is it for the same reason you never wanted to be promoted no matter how much you deserve it he was talking only to distract thisbe from his pain but the underofficer seized on his words and gave him a quick urgent nod yes for just the same reason sir dont take me there i beg you gremio used his free hand to scratch his head if ever a man seemed in earnest thisbe was the one what is this precious reason of yours sergeant the company commander asked something more like fear than pain twisted thisbes face i cant tell you sir i dont dare tell you i dont dare tell anybody what was that supposed to mean gremio started to come out and ask the question then stopped with the words unspoken hed had an arm around thisbe for some little while now while thisbe had had one around him the sergeant didnt usually care to be touched this time thered been no choice gremio thought he understood now why thisbe had fought shy of it before what he thought was madness but there were times when madness made more sense than anything else what he saw what he heardhe could be wrong about all of that what he felt no madness or not he thought it was true sergeant ill look at your wound he said if i think i can just bandage it ill do that if i think it has to go to the healers to save your life ill take you there thats the best i can offer because i donti especially dontwant to lose you i suppose itll have to do sir despite pain the underofficer picked up nuance especially how much dismay was in that voice especially gremio said firmly he eased thisbe down to the ground im going to look at the wound now and then sergeant i think you have a lota lot of explaining to do thisbe let out a long long sigh and then nodded yes sir lieutenant general bell nodded happily to his aidedecamp by the gods major i know where im going again im glad to hear it sir major zibeon answered where are you going is the army of franklin going with you it certainly is bell answered the time has come for the army of franklin to return to the province from which it takes its name franklin has groaned under the southron yoke since the war was young high time it should be liberated from the hated hateful foe eryes sir zibeon said how do you propose to arrange that sir how ill tell you how by marching straight to ramblerton and taking it away from the enemy thats how bell answered we can do it were ahead of hesmucet what have the southrons got in franklin a few piddling garrisons thats all ned of the forests riders have driven them mad when a real army erupts in their midst theyll run like rabbits major zibeon didnt say anything he didnt say anything at all he looked from one map to another in bells farmhouse headquarters then turned away he walked out into the cold rain still without a word he didnt even shake his head he simply walked away bell started to call back his dour aidedecamp he didnt he let zibeon leave calling him back would have meant wrangling with him and bell had had all the wrangling he could stand for a while he felt as weary as a man bowed under the burden of twice his years and his legor rather the phantom still haunting the place where his leg had formerly dweltbegan to burn like fire the pain wasnt real how could it be when the leg itself was gone a few inches below the hip but real or not it hurt him not to put too fine a point on things it tormented him cursing under his breath he groped for his little bottle of laudanum he found it pulled it from the tunic pocket where it hidand dropped it had his left hand been in working order he might have caught it but as far as movement went his left handhis whole left armwas as much a phantom as his amputated leg the bottle the precious laudanum thumped down on the rammedearth floor being made of thick glass it didnt break bell cursed in good earnest nonetheless how the hells was he supposed to recover the drug for which his body screamed for a whole man it would have been the work of a moment but then a whole man wouldnt have needed the laudanum so desperately as he did himself and he was anything but whole later he realized he could have asked one of the young hale sentries outside the door to retrieve the little bottle that was later at the moment only two thoughts went through his head i need the drug and i can do it myself gods damn it mutilated or not he remained as stubborn in his pursuit of independence as did the northern kingdom geoffrey ruled and so bell made his slow way over to the ironframed cot on which he slept he eased himself down till he was sitting on the floor beside it propping his crutches carefully against the cot he stretched out at full length and began an inchworms progress toward the laudanum in fact his progress was more like that of an inchworm which had been stepped on but wasnt quite dead crawling didnt go well not with one good arm and one leg with which to work he tried to roll but his ruined left shoulder let out a horrible shriek at the very idea he ended up hitching forward again and again while lying on his right side he felt like shouting when his questing fingers closed on the little bottle he drew the cork with his teeth and poured down a long draughta draught that would have sent him into oblivion a few months before but his tolerance was more than it had been even such a heroic dose took its own sweet time bringing him relief as always the laudanum made him feel as if he were floating on air but whatever he felt in truth he remained on the floor he had to hitch his way back to the cot in the same fashion hed used to get the bottle then he pulled himself up onto the cot with his good arm the strength that required was one more thing he didnt think about it was just something he had to do and he did it having done it he lay there panting for a little while then he made one more urgent effort and sat up oh by the gods he said he hadnt been down on a dirt floor for a while or thought about what moving across one on his side and belly would do to his uniform it was thoroughly filthy im probably filthy too he thought he brushed at himself dust flew from his tunic and pantaloons in a choking cloud as if his hand were an army on the road in a summertime drought after a while the uniform looked less grimy than it had he used his good arm and remaining leg to heave himself upright then stood swaying till he got the crutches in position under his arms that done he went over to a chest of drawers found a rag and sat down at a table on which stood a pitcher of water he wet the rag and daubed at his face before long the rag which had been white turned the redorange of the dirt floor he dared hope that meant his face took on its normal color and appearance his hope was tested as soon as one of the sentries came in the man didnt stare or gape or point or exclaim so bell supposed hed made himself at least tolerably presentable once more you went through all that for the drug he wondered but he would have endured worse humiliations for the reliefand the pleasurelaudanum brought him and he knew it sir theres a colonel of unicornriders a fellow named biffle outside whod like to see you the sentry said oh good bell said yes ive been expecting him send him in by all means ill do it the sentry said dont you go anywhere now as if i could bell thought as the soldier went outside colonel biffle came in a moment later he was a tall solidly made man with a high forehead and a long black beard he wore a uniform so old and faded it might almost have been southron gray saluting he said good to see you looking so hale sir thank you bell didnt feel particularly hale and doubted he ever would again but he inclined his head at the compliment then he asked and how is ned of the forest hes very fine thank you kindly and about two days ride east of here with all his riders replied colonel biffle who was one of the famous northern officers regimental commanders we had ourselves a busy time out in the east by the great river so we did yes i heard about some of that bell said you smashed up a southron army twice your size in great river province three times our size sir easy biffle said with a reminiscent grin smashed em up and made em run for luxor with their tails between their legs and we raided luxor our ownselves and almost nabbed the southron general commanding in his bed but the son of a bitch managed to sneak away in his nightshirt he had a rustic northern accent by all accounts ned of the forests was thicker still but neither neds accent nor his unsavory past as a serfcatcher had kept king geoffrey from promoting him to lieutenant general though hed begun the war as a common soldier bell nodded i heard something about that yes and i heard something more about your raid down into clovistonwasnt there a place called fort cushion on the great river yes sir colonel biffle nodded too though his face turned grim that was a nasty business most of the garrison in the place were blonds their officers surrendered them and then they started fighting again cant have that sort of thing going on we didnt leave a whole lot of them alive i heard bits and pieces about the fort cushion massacre yesthats what the southron papers call it you understand bell said if you ask me the blonds surely had it coming if they try to face their betters with weapons in their hands such things will happen colonel biffle visibly relaxed glad you see it that way sir ned didnt give the order to kill the bastards but i cant say he was sorry it happened either who could be sorry about getting rid of blonds we just smashed a couple of regiments of them ourselves bell said and then got down to business you tell me ned is two days away thats right biffle nodded again excellent colonel bell felt as happy as anything but his drugs could make him i look forward to his joining us well show the stinking southrons theres still life in geoffreys men eryes sir colonel biffle coughed a couple of times then went on uh sir lieutenant general ned he asked me to ask you just what have you got in mind once you put his unicornriders together with your army what have i got in mind bell struck a pose ill tell you what ive got in mind by the gods i aim to lift the southrons yoke from franklin reconquer ramblerton sweep down into the province of clovistonmy home province ill have you knowroll on to the highlow river and then again with the help of the gods cross the river and attack the town of horatii in highlow province thatll impress him bell thought but biffle remained unimpressed no sir he said sorry sir thats not what ned of the forest had in mindnot even a little bit what he meant was what do you aim to do about brigadier spinner the two of them they purely dont get along lord ned swore a great oath hed never fight alongside spinner again on account of spinner stole his best men after the battle by the river of death that was one more of thraxton the braggarts nasty little tricks bell grunted there lay his glorious vision of northern triumph shot dead by a petty political squabble or perhaps not so petty he remembered rumors that had slid through the army of franklin while he was recovering from his amputation now maybe he could find out if those rumors held any truth tell me he said did ned of the forest really challenge count thraxton to a duel he did sir by the gods sir he did i was standing closer to him than i am to you right now and i heard it with my own ears biffle answered he made the challenge and thraxton didnt have the stones to answer it isnt that interesting lieutenant general bell murmured as his maneuvers against joseph the gamecock proved he wasnt above political squabbling himself having a weapon to use against thraxton the braggart might come in handy you never could tell i want you to know sir lord ned hes dead serious about this business colonel biffle said he said biff you tell that fellowif im stuck under spinner ill stay down here in franklin and give the southrons a hard time all by my lonesome his very words sir lion god claw me if i lie he would disobey a superiors direct order bell rumbled ominously that didnt impress ned of the forests regimental commander either hes disobeyed a whole great pile of them in his time ned has he replied and usually hes come off better on account of it i ought to send him packing for dickering with me like this bell said colonel biffle only shrugged plainly he didnt care one way or the other however difficult ned of the forest was bell knew him to be a genius at handling unicorns brigadier spinner was competent enough but nobody had ever accused him of genius and nobody ever would no matter how grandiose bells visions he also knew he needed all the help he could get to bring them off he plucked at his beard you may tell lieutenant general ned that i will place brigadier spinner on detached duty harrying general hesmucets men here in peachtree province will that satisfy him yes sir biffle said im sure of it all right lieutenant general bell said well do it that way then it wasnt all right he had every intention of writing king geoffrey about it but while that would put him on the record and make him feel better ned of the forest was unlikely to get excited about it ned did what he wanted not what anyone else wanted no bell didnt like bargaining with subordinates but no matter what he liked he couldnt afford to lose this one now that biffle had got what heor rather nedwanted he was all courtesy himself he gave bell a smart salute and said ill head back to lord ned fast as my unicorn can take me sir and well see you in a little more than two days time good bell said he hardly noticed colonel biffle leave the farmhouse he was looking south with his minds eye looking south toward the victory that had eluded him in peachtree province looking south toward glory doubting george was gnawing on some pork ribs when colonel andy ducked into his pavilion georges adjutant looked even more like an irate chipmunk than usual sir he said theres a messenger from general hesmucet waiting outside youre ordered to the commanding generals headquarters at once well if im ordered i should probably go eh doubting george heaved his bulk off the folding chair where he was sitting and if its at once i probably shouldnt finish dinner first youre welcome to the rest of the ribs colonel theyre mighty good its not right sir andy said in injured tones what the ribs george said you might as well eat em gods only know when ill get back no not the ribs colonel andy snapped the ribs have nothing to do with it the orders general hesmucets going to give youtheyre not right well maybe they are and maybe they arent doubting george replied but right or wrong theyre legal and binding because hes the commanding general if i didnt believe in following legal and binding orders id be fighting for king geoffrey today wouldnt i and then youd want to kill me never sir andy said stiffly oh of course you wouldid be the enemy george said but im not and i dont intend to be and so im off to general hesmucets enjoy the ribs he left before his adjutant could carp any more trouble is i agree with every word andys saying george thought as he climbed aboard his unicorn but whether he agreed or not he could obey hesmucet or he could go home after a moment he shook his head he couldnt even go home over in parthenia the traitors still held the estate theyd confiscated hesmucets aides and sentries saluted when he rode up to them when he dismounted one of them took charge of the unicorn another one said general hesmucet will see you right away well good george said agreeably because im going to see him hello george hesmucet said when his secondincommand went into the pavilion the general commanding quiveredhe practically glowedwith excitement george knew what was coming even before he spoke ive got it by the gods marshal bart and king avram have given me leave to march across peachtree tear up everything in the way and take veldt congratulations sir doubting george said i trust youll send me a postcard or two as you go hesmucet coughed and turned red i told you lieutenant general i need someone i can count on in franklin to keep bell from making mischief yes you told me that george said just because you told it to me though doesnt mean i have to like it whom else could i send hesmucet asked him after me youre the next best general weve got here i am taking what i think is the most important job ahead of us im leaving you what i think is the next most important job that strikes me as fair who knows doubting george shrugged the groom has the most important job on his wedding day the best man the secondmost but ill tell you one thing sir the groom has a lot more fun not necessarily no not necessarily by the gods hesmucet said remember youll still have bell to deal with and so with any luck at all well both get to screw the traitors he threw back his head and laughed you give me so many of your sly little stories this time i got in my own punch line yes sir george said resignedly hed known this was going to happen now it had and he had to make the best of it what sort of force will you leave me to defend franklin well for one thing youll have all the garrisons already posted through the province hesmucet said expansively oh happy day doubting george replied in a hollow voice he knewand hesmucet surely knew toothat the garrisons in franklin were a case where the whole was much less than the sum of its parts they were enough to hold northern raiders at bay against the army of franklin george didnt want to think about that some of those garrison soldiers hadnt done any real fighting in years what else have you got for me something i hope oh yes hesmucet nodded brightly ive ordered a good solid division to come west from across the great river but theyre a little occupied right now what with earl price of sterlings unicorn raid down into showme splendid nothing plus nothing equals nothing doubting george said if im going to defend franklin against a real live army shouldnt i have at least part of a real live army of my own oh i suppose so by the way hesmucet sounded he didnt really suppose any such thing but was humoring a willful subordinate he went on ill give you half of the wing youve been commanding i intend to take all of absalom the bears men with me what george felt on the point of bursting with outrage half and the worse half at that half hesmucet said and ill give you hardriding jimmy and his brigade of unicornriders all of them carrying these fancy new quickshooting crossbows hardriding jimmys still wet behind the ears george said which was true the officer couldnt have been much above twentyfive if you dont want him ill be glad to keep him i didnt mean that sir george said quickly yes jimmy was young yes hed been a staff officer till not very long ago but hed shown signs of making a good fighting soldier his riders were very tough and george doubted hed get any other men if he didnt take jimmys hesmucet smiled at him i thought you were a good sensible fellow so thats all settled then he sounded perfectly happy and why shouldnt he george thought hed settled everything to his own satisfaction george was the one left with the odds and ends of military meat he said give me one other thing whats that all of a sudden hesmucet didnt sound so happy any more give me john the lister too as my secondincommand sure enough the idea seemed to affront hesmucet he said johns a fine officer i had in mind taking him along with me im sure you did george said but youre taking everything you want and leaving me with nothing but dribs and drabs you say you count on me to keep order in franklin and make sure bell doesnt steal the place while im not looking well i need somebody i can count on too give me john the lister gods damn it when had someone last presumed to swear at the general commanding not for a while unless doubting george missed his guessprobably not since fighting joseph decided he was underappreciated and so spectacularly left king avrams service hesmucet did take it pretty well he scowled but didnt growl when he might well have and in the end he nodded all right take him i may not like it but you make good sense i thank you sir george said to the seven hells with me if i think brigadier john will thank youor me hes got to be looking forward to marching across peachtree himself but somebody has to stay and do the dirty jobs he chuckled and besides misery loves company it may be a dirty job but its an important one hesmucet said if bell comes hell come full force and youre the best defensive fighter ive got flattery wont get you far sir george said its not flattery its the truth standing on the defensive youre as good as anybody on either side of this godsdamned war when it comes to putting in an attack id choose some other men before you tell that to the traitors who tried to hold proselytizers ridge against my men sir doubting george said hotly well you have a pointof sorts hesmucet said but you got a little help from thraxton the braggart you know he was right about that however much doubting george wished to deny it he couldnt he did the next best thing saying youll find out whether i can manage an attack or not by the gods you wait and see i look forward to doing just that lieutenant general with any luck at all well both smash up the traitors and if we can do that and if marshal bart can keep the army of southern parthenia bottled up in pierrevillewell if all that happens the wars within shouting distance of being over doubting george couldnt very well deny that either nor did he want to instead of telling hesmucet to go to the seven hells which was what he wanted to do he gave him a precise salute if youll excuse me sir ill start getting ready to move with what youve so generously left me again hesmucet refused to take offense if thinking im a firstclass son of a bitch makes you meaner lieutenant general then go right ahead and i hope you get some good from it muttering george ducked out of the commanding generals pavilion muttering he mounted his unicorn and rode back to his own headquarters muttering still he dismounted and tied up the beast colonel andy came over to him well sir the adjutant asked not very well as a matter of fact doubting george replied i get half my present command along with every soldier in every garrison in franklinand a division tied up across the great river put them all together and they add up to not bloody much andy cursed with surprising fluency and passion for a small round chubbycheeked man justice is dead no by the gods justice is murdered and we both know who killed it he said it cant be helped george said andy looked at him as if hed just turned traitor he still wasnt happyhe was anything but happybut he went on hesmucets right the job needs doing he chose me to do it thats all someone has to ive just got to make the best of it for that job he could have chosen any general his adjutant declared why did he have to pick you he answered his own question to keep you from going along with him thats why i thought that too george said it made me furious let me tell you so furious i almost drew blade on him but then i asked him for john the lister as my secondincommand and i began to understand which is sir more than i can say i do colonel andy sniffed think on it doubting george told him i wanted at least one good solid officer to help me because i cant be everywhere at once if hed left me absalom i wouldnt have asked for john and i wouldnt have made a fuss till i godsdamned well got him i still dont understand a word youre saying andy replied hesmucet did the same thing i did george explained i want john the lister to back me up hesmucet wants someone hes sure he can trust to back him upand i happen to be the man its a compliment of sorts of sorts andy echoed bitterly he marches off toward veldt and if that goes well the bards will sing of it for the next hundred years and more and you go back to ramblerton and when has anybody ever won glory by going back instead of forward for all you know for all hesmucet knows bell wont try to come south at all you can march your garrison back and forth back and forth through the mud happy day that had also occurred to doubting george he wished his adjutant hadnt spelled it out quite so plainly its the chance i take i have to make the best of it and if bell doesnt come south maybe ill be able to move north after the army of franklin myself who knows they hashed over possibilities for a while little by little both george and andy grew resigned perhaps even mollified as andy said you kept the army of franklin from wrecking us altogether by the river of death more than a year ago now maybe its fitting that you be the one to finish it off if i can doubting george started to say something more then pointed someones riding this way in a hells of a hurry wonder who that could be looks like john the lister andy replied after a brief pause why so it does said george who was anything but surprised as john reined in george raised his voice hello john what brings you here you do you with visible effort john the lister restrained himself to a degree youre the reason i cant go west gods damn it he was red with fury all the way to the top of his bald head i am sorry about that brigadier i truly am george meant it he spent the next quarter of an hour calming the irate john and explaining exactly why hed chosen him john the lister was a capableand even more to the point a sensibleman as george had before him he listened and a bit at a time calmed down at last he said well i still dont love you for it but i can see why you did it if bell does bring his men southand what other move has he got left wed better be able to stop him he wont get through us eh i doubt he will doubting george replied by all the gods john i doubt it very much
