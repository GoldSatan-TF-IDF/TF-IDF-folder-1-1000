consider phlebas iain banks idolatry is worse than carnage the koran gentile or jew o you who turn the wheel and look to windward consider phlebas who was once handsome and tall as you t s eliot the waste land iv prologue the ship didnt even have a name it had no human crew because the factory craft which constructed it had been evacuated long ago it had no lifesupport or accommodation units for the same reason it had no class number or fleet designation because it was a mongrel made from bits and pieces of different types of warcraft and it didnt have a name because the factory craft had no time left for such niceties the dockyard threw the ship together as best it could from its depleted stock of components even though most of the weapon power and sensory systems were either faulty superseded or due for overhaul the factory vessel knew that its own destruction was inevitable but there was just a chance that its last creation might have the speed and the luck to escape the one perfect priceless component the factory craft did have was the vastly powerful though still raw and untrained mind around which it had constructed the rest of the ship if it could get the mind to safety the factory vessel thought it would have done well nevertheless there was another reason the real reason the dockyard mother didnt give its warship child a name it thought there was something else it lacked hope the ship left the construction bay of the factory craft with most of its fittingout still to be done accelerating hard its course a fourdimensional spiral through a blizzard of stars where it knew that only danger waited it powered into hyperspace on spent engines from an overhauled craft of one class watched its birthplace disappear astern with battledamaged sensors from a second and tested outdated weapon units cannibalised from yet another inside its warship body in narrow unlit unheated hardvacuum spaces constructor drones struggled to install or complete sensors displacers field generators shield disruptors laserfields plasma chambers warhead magazines manoeuvring units repair systems and the thousands of other major and minor components required to make a functional warship gradually as it swept through the vast open reaches between the star systems the vessels internal structure changed and it became less chaotic more ordered as the factory drones completed their tasks several tens of hours out on its first journey while it was testing its track scanner by focusing back along the route it had taken the ship registered a single massive annihilation explosion deep behind it where the factory craft had been it watched the blossoming shell of radiation expand for a while then switched the scanner field to dead ahead and pushed yet more power through its already overloaded engines the ship did all it could to avoid combat it kept well away from the routes enemy craft would probably use it treated every hint of any craft as a confirmed hostile sighting at the same time as it zigzagged and ducked and weaved and rose and fell it was corkscrewing as fast as it could as directly as it dared down and across the strand of the galactic arm in which it had been born heading for the edge of that great isthmus and the comparatively empty space beyond on the far side on the edge of the next limb it might find safety just as it arrived at that first border where the stars rose like a glittering cliff alongside emptiness it was caught a fleet of hostile craft whose course by chance came close enough to that of the fleeing ship detected its ragged noisy emission shell and intercepted it the ship ran straight into their attack and was overwhelmed outarmed slow vulnerable it knew almost instantly that it had no chance even of inflicting any damage on the opposing fleet so it destroyed itself detonating the stock of warheads it carried in a sudden release of energy which for a second in hyperspace alone outshone the yellow dwarf star of a nearby system scattered in a pattern around it an instant before the ship itself was blown into plasma most of the thousands of exploding warheads formed an outrushing sphere of radiation through which any escape seemed impossible in the fraction of a second the entire engagement lasted there were at the end some millionths when the battlecomputers of the enemy fleet briefly analysed the fourdimensional maze of expanding radiation and saw that there was one bewilderingly complicated and unlikely way out of the concentric shells of erupting energies now opening like the petals of some immense flower between the star systems it was not however a route the mind of a small archaic warship could plan for create and follow by the time it was noticed that the ships mind had taken exactly that path through its screen of annihilation it was too late to stop it from falling away through hyperspace towards the small cold planet fourth out from the single yellow sun of the nearby system it was also too late to do anything about the light from the ships exploding warheads which had been arranged in a crude code describing the vessels fate and the escaped minds status and position and legible to anybody catching the unreal light as it sped through the galaxy perhaps worst of all and had their design permitted such a thing those electronic brains would now have felt dismay the planet the mind had made for through its shield of explosions was not one they could simply attack destroy or even land on it was schars world near the region of barren space between two galactic strands called the sullen gulf and it was one of the forbidden planets of the dead sorpen the level was at his top lip now even with his head pressed hard back against the stones of the cell wall his dose was only just above the surface he wasnt going to get his hands free in time he was going to drown in the darkness of the cell in its stink and warmth while the sweat ran over his brows and tightly closed eyes and his trance went on and on one part of his mind tried to accustom him to the idea of his own death but like an unseen insect buzzing in a quiet room there was something else something that would not go away was of no use and only annoyed it was a sentence irrelevant and pointless and so old hed forgotten where he had heard or read it and it went round and round the inside of his head like a marble spun round the inside of a jug the jinmoti of bozlen two kill the hereditary ritual assassins of the new yearkings immediate family by drowning them in the tears of the continental empathaur in its sadness season at one point shortly after his ordeal had begun and he was only partway into his trance he had wondered what would happen if he threw up it had been when the palace kitchens about fifteen or sixteen floors above if his calculations were correct had sent their waste down the sinuous network of plumbing that led to the sewercell the gurgling watery mess had dislodged some rotten food from the last time some poor wretch had drowned in filth and garbage and that was when he felt he might vomit it had been almost comforting to work out that it would make no difference to the time of his death then he had wondered in that state of nervous frivolity which sometimes afflicts those who can do nothing but wait in a situation of mortal threat whether crying would speed his death in theory it would though in practical terms it was irrelevant but that was when the sentence started to roll round in his head the jinmoti of bozlen two kill the hereditary ritual the liquid which he could hear and feel and smell all too clearly and could probably have seen with his far from ordinary eyes had they been open washed briefly up to touch the bottom of his nose he felt it block his nostrils filling them with a stench that made his stomach heave but he shook his head tried to force his skull even further back against the stones and the foul broth fell away he blew down and could breathe again there wasnt long now he checked his wrists again but it was no good it would take another hour or more and he had only minutes if he was lucky the trance was breaking anyway he was returning to almost total consciousness as though his brain wanted fully to appreciate his own death its own extinction he tried to think of something profound or to see his life flash in front of him or suddenly to remember some old love a longforgotten prophecy or premonition but there was nothing just an empty sentence and the sensations of drowning in other peoples dirt and waste you old bastards he thought one of their few strokes of humour or originality had been devising an elegant ironic way of death how fitting it must feel to them dragging their decrepit frames to the banquethall privies literally to defecate all over their enemies and thereby kill them the air pressure built up and a distant groaning rumble of liquid signalled another flushing from above you old bastards well i hope at least you kept your promise balveda the jinmoti of bozlen two kill the hereditary ritual thought one part of his brain as the pipes in the ceiling spluttered and the waste splashed into the warm mass of liquid which almost filled the cell the wave passed over his face then fell back to leave his nose free for a second and give him time to gulp a lungful of air then the liquid rose gently to touch the bottom of his nose again and stayed there he held his breath it had hurt at first when they had hung him up his hands tied inside tight leather pouches were directly above his head manacled inside thick loops of iron bolted to the cell walls which took all his weight his feet were tied together and left to dangle inside an iron tube also attached to the wall which stopped him from taking any weight on his feet and knees and at the same time prevented him from moving his legs more than a hands breadth out from the wall or to either side the tube ended just above his knees above it there was only a thin and dirty loincloth to hide his ancient and grubby nakedness he had shut off the pain from his wrists and shoulders even while the four burly guards two of them perched on ladders had secured him in place even so he could feel that niggling sensation at the back of his skull which told him that he ought to be hurting that had lessened gradually as the level of waste in the small sewercell had risen and buoyed up his body he had started to go into a trance then as soon as the guards left though he knew it was probably hopeless it hadnt lasted long the cell door opened again within minutes a metal walkway was lowered by a guard onto the damp flagstones of the cell floor and light from the corridor washed into the darkness he had stopped the changing trance and craned his neck to see who his visitor might be into the cell holding a short staff glowing cool blue stepped the stooped grizzled figure of amahainfrolk security minister for the gerontocracy of sorpen the old man smiled at him and nodded approvingly then turned to the corridor and with a thin discoloured hand beckoned somebody standing outside the cell to step onto the short walkway and enter he guessed it would be the culture agent balveda and it was she came lightly onto the metal boarding looked round slowly and fastened her gaze on him he smiled and tried to nod in greeting his ears rubbing on his naked arms balveda i thought i might see you again come to see the host of the party he forced a grin officially it was his banquet he was the host another of the gerontocracys little jokes he hoped his voice had shown no signs of fear perosteck balveda agent of the culture a full head taller than the old man by her side and still strikingly handsome even in the pallid glow of the blue torch shook her thin finely made head slowly her short black hair lay like a shadow on her skull no she said i didnt want to see you or say goodbye you put me here balveda he said quietly yes and there you belong amahainfrolk said stepping as far forward on the platform as he could without overbalancing and having to step onto the damp floor i wanted you tortured first but miss balveda here the ministers high scratchy voice echoed in the cell as he turned his head back to the woman pleaded for you though god knows why but thats where you belong all right murderer he shook the staff at the almost naked man hanging on the dirty wall of the cell balveda looked at her feet just visible under the hem of the long plain grey gown she wore a circular pendant on a chain around her neck glinted in the light from the corridor outside amahainfrolk had stepped back beside her holding the shining staff up and squinting at the captive you know even now i could almost swear that was egratin hanging there i can he shook his gaunt bony head i can hardly believe it isnt not until he opens his mouth anyway my god these changers are dangerous frightening things he turned to balveda she smoothed her hair at the nape of her neck and looked down at the old man they are also an ancient and proud people minister and there are very few of them left may i ask you one more time please let him live he might be the gerontocrat waved a thin and twisted hand at her his face distorting in a grimace no you would do well miss balveda not to keep asking for this this assassin this murderous treacherous spy to be spared do you think we take the cowardly murder and impersonation of one of our outworld ministers lightly what damage this thing could have caused why when we arrested it two of our guards died just from being scratched another is blind for life after this monster spat in his eye however amahainfrolk sneered at the man chained to the wall we took those teeth out and his hands are tied so that he cant even scratch himself he turned to balveda again you say they are few i say good there will soon be one less the old man narrowed his eyes as he looked at the woman we are grateful to you and your people for exposing this fraud and murderer but do not think that gives you the right to tell us what to do there are some in the gerontocracy who want nothing to do with any outside influence and their voices grow in volume by the day as the war comes closer you would do well not to antagonise those of us who do support your cause balveda pursed her lips and looked down at her feet again clasping her slender hands behind her back amahainfrolk had turned back to the man hanging on the wall wagging the staff in his direction as he spoke you will soon be dead impostor and with you die your masters plans for the domination of our peaceful system the same fate awaits them if they try to invade us we and the culture are he shook his head as best he could and roared back frolk youre an idiot the old man shrank away as though hit the changer went on cant you see youre going to be taken over anyway probably by the idirans but if not by them then by the culture you dont control your own destinies any more the wars stopped all that soon this whole sector will be part of the front unless you make it part of the idiran sphere i was only sent in to tell you what you should have known anyway not to cheat you into something youd regret later for gods sake man the idirans wont eat you ha they look as though they could monsters with three feet invaders killers infidels you want us to link with them with threestrides tallmonsters to be ground under their hooves to have to worship their false gods at least they have a god frolk the culture doesnt the ache in his arms was coming back as he concentrated on talking he shifted as best he could and looked down at the minister they at least think the same way you do the culture doesnt oh no my friend oh no amahainfrolk held one hand up flat to him and shook his head you wont sow seeds of discord like that my god you stupid old man he laughed you want to know who the real representative of the culture is on this planet its not her he nodded at the woman its that powered fleshslicer she has following her everywhere her knife missile she might make the decisions it might do what she tells it but its the real emissary thats what the cultures about machines you think because balvedas got two legs and soft skin you should be on her side but its the idirans who are on the side of life in this war well you will shortly be on the other side of that the gerontocrat snorted and glanced at balveda who was looking from under lowered brows at the man chained to the wall let us go miss balveda amahainfrolk said as he turned and took the womans arm to guide her from the cell this things presence smells more than the cell balveda looked up at him then ignoring the dwarfed minister as he tried to pull her to the door she gazed right at the prisoner with her clear blackirised eyes and held her hands out from her sides im sorry she said to him believe it or not thats rather how i feel he replied nodding just promise me youll eat and drink very little tonight balveda id like to think there was one person up there on my side and it might as well be my worst enemy he had meant it to be defiant and funny but it sounded only bitter he looked away from the womans face i promise balveda said she let herself be led to the door and the blue light waned in the dank cell she stopped right at the door by sticking his head painfully far out he could just see her the knife missile was there too he noticed just inside the room probably there all the time but he hadnt noticed its sleek sharp little body hovering there in the darkness he looked into balvedas dark eyes as the knife missile moved for a second he thought balveda had instructed the tiny machine to kill him now quietly and quickly while she blocked amahainfrolks view and his heart thudded but the small device simply floated past balvedas face and out into the corridor balveda raised one hand in a gesture of farewell bora horza gobuchul she said goodbye she turned quickly stepped from the platform and out of the cell the walkway was hoisted out and the door slammed scraping rubber flanges over the grimy floor and hissing once as the internal seals made it watertight he hung there looking down at an invisible floor for a moment before going back into the trance that would change his wrists thin them down so that he could escape but something about the solemn final way balveda had spoken his name had crushed him inside and he knew then if not before that there was no escape by drowning them in the tears his lungs were bursting his mouth quivered his throat was gagging the filth was in his ears but he could hear a great roaring see lights though it was black dark his stomach muscles started to go in and out and he had to clamp his jaw to stop his mouth opening for air that wasnt there now no now he had to give in not yet surely now now now now any second surrender to this awful black vacuum inside him he had to breathe now before he had time to open his mouth he was smashed against the wall punched against the stones as though some immense iron fist had slammed into him he blew out the stale air from his lungs in one convulsive breath his body was suddenly cold and every pan of it next to the wall throbbed with pain death it seemed was weight pain cold and too much light he brought his head up he moaned at the light he tried to see tried to hear what was happening why was he breathing why was he so damn heavy again his body was tearing his arms from their sockets his wrists were cut almost to the bone who had done this to him where the wall had been facing him there was a very large and ragged hole which extended beneath the level of the cell floor all the ordure and garbage had burst out of that the last few trickles hissed against the hot sides of the breach producing steam which curled around the figure standing blocking most of the brilliant light from outside in the open air of sorpen the figure was three metres tall and looked vaguely like a small armoured spaceship sitting on a tripod of thick legs its helmet looked big enough to contain three human heads side by side held almost casually in one gigantic hand was a plasma cannon which horza would have needed both arms just to lift the creatures other fist gripped a slightly larger gun behind it nosing in towards the hole came an idiran gunplatform lit vividly by the light of explosions which horza could now feel through the iron and stones he was attached to he raised his head to the giant standing in the breach and tried to smile well he croaked then spluttered and spat you lot certainly took your time the hand of god outside the palace in the sharp cold of a winters afternoon the clear sky was full of what looked like glittering snow horza paused on the warshuttles ramp and looked up and around the sheer walls and slim towers of the prisonpalace echoed and reflected with the booms and flashes of continuing firefights while idiran gunplatforms cruised back and forth firing occasionally around them on the stiffening breeze blew great clouds of chaff from antilaser mortars on the palace roof a gust sent some of the fluttering flickering foil towards the stationary shuttle and horza found one side of his wet and sticky body suddenly coated with reflecting plumage please the battle is not over yet thundered the idiran soldier behind him in what was probably meant to be a quiet whisper horza turned round to the armoured bulk and stared up at the visor of the giants helmet where he could see his own old mans face reflected he breathed deeply then nodded turned and walked slightly shakily into the shuttle a flash of light threw his shadow diagonally in front of him and the craft bucked in the shock wave of a big explosion somewhere inside the palace as the ramp closed by their names you could know them horza thought as he showered the cultures general contact units which until now had borne the brunt of the first four years of the war in space had always chosen jokey facetious names even the new warships they were starting to produce as their factory craft completed gearing up their war production favoured either jocular sombre or downright unpleasant names as though the culture could not take entirely seriously the vast conflict in which it had embroiled itself the idirans looked at things differently to them a ship name ought to reflect the serious nature of its purpose duties and resolute use in the huge idiran navy there were hundreds of craft named after the same heroes planets battles religious concepts and impressive adjectives the light cruiser which had rescued horza was the th vessel to be called the hand of god and it existed concurrently with over a hundred other craft in the navy using the same title so its full name was the hand of god horza dried in the airstream with some difficulty like everything else in the spaceship it was built on a monumental scale befitting the size of the idirans and the hurricane of air it produced nearly blew him out of the shower cabinet the querl xoralundra spyfather and warrior priest of the four souls tributory sect of farnidir clasped two hands on the surface of the table it looked to horza rather like a pair of continental plates colliding so bora horza boomed the old idiran you are recovered just about nodded horza rubbing his wrists he sat in xoralundras cabin in the hand of god clothed in a bulky but comfortable space suit apparently brought along just for him xoralundra who was also suited up had insisted the man wear it because the warship was still at battle stations as it swept a fast and lowpowered orbit around the planet of sorpen a culture gcu of the mountain class had been confirmed in the system by naval intelligence the hand was in on its own and they couldnt find any trace of the culture ship so they had to be careful xoralundra leaned towards horza casting a shadow over the table his huge head saddleshaped when seen from directly in front with the two front eyes clear and unblinking near the edges loomed over the changer you were lucky horza we did not come in to rescue you out of compassion failure is its own reward thank you xora thats actually the nicest thing anybodys said to me all day horza sat back in his seat and put one of his oldlooking hands through his thin yellowing hair it would take a few days for the aged appearance he had assumed to disappear though already he could feel it starting to slip away from him in a changers mind there was a selfimage constantly held and reviewed on a semisubconscious level keeping the body in the appearance willed horzas need to look like a gerontocrat was gone now so the mental picture of the minister he had impersonated for the idirans was fragmenting and dissolving and his body was going back to its normal neutral state xoralundras head went slowly from side to side between the edges of the suit collar it was a gesture horza had never fully translated although he had worked for the idirans and known xoralundra well since before the war anyway you are alive xoralundra said horza nodded and drummed his fingers on the table to show he agreed he wished the idiran chair he was perched on didnt make him feel so much like a child his feet werent even touching the deck just thanks anyway im sorry i dragged you all the way in here to rescue a failure orders are orders i personally am glad we were able to now i must tell you why we received those orders horza smiled and looked away from the old idiran who had just given him something of a compliment a rare thing he looked back and watched the other beings wide mouth big enough thought horza to bite off both your hands at once as it boomed out the precise short words of the idiran language you were once with a caretaker mission on schars world one of the draazon planets of the dead xoralundra stated horza nodded we need you to go back there now horza said to the broad dark face of the idiran there are only changers there ive told you i wont impersonate another changer i certainly wont kill one we are not asking you to do that listen while i explain xoralundra leant on his backrest in a way almost any vertebrate or even anything like a vertebrate would have called tired four standard days ago the idiran began then his suit helmet which was lying on the floor near his feet let out a piercing whine he picked up the helmet and set it on the table yes he said and horza knew enough about the idiran voice to realise that whoever was bothering the querl had better have a good reason for doing so we have the culture female a voice said from the helmet ahh xoralundra said quietly sitting back the idiran equivalent of a smile mouth pursing eyes narrowing passed over his features good captain is she aboard yet no querl the shuttle is a couple of minutes out im withdrawing the gunplatforms we are ready to leave the system as soon as they are all on board xoralundra bent closer to the helmet horza inspected the aged skin on the back of his hands what of the culture ship the idiran asked still nothing querl it cannot be anywhere in the system our computer suggests it is outside possibly between us and the fleet before long it must realise we are in here by ourselves you will set off to rejoin the fleet the instant the female culture agent is aboard without waiting for the platforms is that understood captain xoralundra looked at horza as the human glanced at him is that understood captain the querl repeated still looking at the human yes querl came the answer horza could hear the icy tone even through the small helmet speaker good use your own initiative to decide the best route back to the fleet in the meantime you will destroy the cities of deaychanbie vinch easnayowon izilere and ylbar with fusion bombs as per the admiraltys orders yes qu xoralundra stabbed a switch in the helmet and it fell silent you got balveda horza asked surprised we have the culture agent yes i regard her capture or destruction as of comparatively little consequence but only by our assuring the admiralty we would attempt to take her would they contemplate such a hazardous mission ahead of the main fleet to rescue you hmm bet you didnt get balvedas knife missile horza snorted looking again at the wrinkles on his hands it destructed while you were being put aboard the shuttle which brought you up to the ship xoralundra waved one hand sending a draught of idiranscented air across the table but enough of that i must explain why we risked a light cruiser to rescue you by all means horza said and turned to face the idiran four standard days ago the querl said a group of our ships intercepted a single culture craft of conventional outward appearance but rather odd internal construction judging by its emission signature the ship was destroyed easily enough but its mind escaped there was a planetary system near by the mind appears to have transcended real space to within the planetary surface of the globe it chose thus indicating a level of hyperspatial field management we had thought hoped was still beyond the culture certainly such spaciobatics are beyond us for the moment we have reason to believe due to that and other indications that the mind involved is one from a new class of general systems vehicles the culture is developing the minds capture would be an intelligence coup of the first order the querl paused there horza took the opportunity to ask is this thing on schars world yes according to its last message it intended to shelter in the tunnels of the command system and you cant do anything about it horza smiled we came to get you that is doing something about it bora horza the querl paused the shape of your mouth tells me you see something amusing in this situation what would that be i was just thinking lots of things that that mind was either pretty smart or very lucky that you were very lucky you had me close by also that the culture isnt likely to sit back and do nothing to deal with your points in order xoralundra said sharply the culture mind was both lucky and smart we were fortunate the culture can do little because they do not as far as we know have any changers in their employ and certainly not one who has served on schars world i would also add bora horza the idiran said putting both huge hands on the table and dipping his great head towards the human that you were more than a little lucky yourself ah yes but the difference is that i believe in it horza grinned hmm it does you little credit observed the querl horza shrugged so you want me to put down on schars world and get the mind if possible it may be damaged it may be liable to destruct but it is a prize worth fighting for we shall give you all the equipment you need but your presence alone would give us a toehold what about the people already there the changers on caretaker duty nothing has been heard from them they were probably unaware of the minds arrival their next routine transmission is due in a few days but given the current disruption in communications due to the war they may not be able to send what horza said slowly one finger describing a circular pattern on the table surface which he was looking at do you know about the personnel in the base the two senior members have been replaced by younger changers the idiran said the two junior sentinels became seniors remaining there they wouldnt be in any danger would they horza asked on the contrary inside a draazon quiet barrier on a planet of the dead must rank as one of the safest places to be during the current hostilities neither we nor the culture can risk causing the draazon any offence that is why they cannot do anything and we can only use you if horza said carefully sitting forward and dropping his voice slightly i can get this metaphysical computer for you something in your voice tells me we approach the question of remuneration xoralundra said we do indeed ive risked my neck for you lot long enough xoralundra i want out theres a good friend of mine on that schars world base and if shes agreeable i want to take her and me out of the whole war thats what im asking for i can promise nothing i shall request this your long and devoted service will be taken into account horza sat back and frowned he wasnt sure if xoralundra was being ironic or not six years probably didnt seem like very long at all to a species that was virtually immortal but the querl xoralundra knew how often his frail human charge had risked all in the service of his alien masters without real reward so perhaps he was being serious before horza could continue with the bargaining the helmet shrilled once more horza winced all the noises on the idiran ship seemed to be deafening the voices were thunder ordinary buzzers and bleepers left his ears ringing long after they stopped and announcements over the pa made him put both hands to his head horza just hoped there wasnt a fullscale alarm while he was on board the idiran ship alarm could cause damage to unprotected human ears what is it xoralundra asked the helmet the female is on board i shall need only eight more minutes to get the gun have the cities been destroyed they have querl break out of orbit at once and make full speed for the fleet querl i must point out said the small steady voice from the helmet on the table captain xoralundra said briskly in this war there have to date been fourteen singleduel engagements between type light cruisers and mountain class general contact units all have ended in victory for the enemy have you ever seen what is left of a light cruiser after a gcu has finished with it no querl neither have i and i have no intention of seeing it for the first time from the inside proceed at once xoralundra hit the helmet button again he fastened his gaze on horza i shall do what i can to secure your release from the service with sufficient funds if you succeed now once we have made contact with the main body of the fleet you will go by fast picket to schars world you will be given a shuttle there just beyond the quiet barrier it will be unarmed although it will have the equipment we think you may need including some closerange hyperspace spectographic analysers should the mind conduct a limited destruct how can you be certain itll be limited horza asked sceptically the mind weighs several thousand tonnes despite its relatively small size an annihilatory destruct would rip the planet in half and so antagonise the draazon no culture mind would risk such a thing your confidence overwhelms me horza said dourly just then the note of background noise around them altered xoralundra turned his helmet round and looked at one of its small internal screens good we are under way he looked at horza again there is something else i ought to tell you an attempt was made by the group of ships which caught the culture craft to follow the escaped mind down to the planet horza frowned didnt they know better they did their best with the battle group were several captured chuyhirtsi warp animals which had been deactivated for later use in a surprise attack on a culture base one of these was quickly fitted out for a smallscale incursion on the planet surface and thrown at the quiet barrier in a warpcruise the ruse did not succeed on crossing the barrier the animal was attacked with something resembling gridfire and was heavily damaged it came out of warp near the planet on a course which would take it in on a burnup angle the equipment and ground force it contained must be considered defunct well i suppose it was a good try but a draazon must make even this wonderful mind youre after look like a valve computer its going to take more than that to fool it do you think you will be able to i dont know i dont think they can read minds but who knows i dont think the draazon even know or care much about the war or what ive been doing since i left schars world so they probably wont be able to put one and one together but again who knows horza gave another shrug its worth a try good we shall have a fuller briefing when we rejoin the fleet for now we must pray that our return is without incident you may want to speak to perosteck balveda before she is interrogated i have arranged with the deputy fleet inquisitor that you may see her if you wish horza smiled xora nothing would give me greater pleasure the querl had other business on the ship as it powered its way out of the sorpen system horza stayed in xoralundras cabin to rest and eat before he called on balveda the food was the cruiser autogalleys best impression of something suitable for a humanoid but it tasted awful horza ate what he could and drank some equally uninspiring distilled water it was all served by a medjel a lizardlike creature about two metres long with a flat long head and six legs on four of which it ran using the front pair as hands the medjel were the companion species of the idirans it was a complicated sort of social symbiosis which had kept the exosocio faculties of many a university in research funds over the millennia that the idiran civilisation had been part of the galactic community the idirans themselves had evolved on their planet idir as the top monster from a whole planetful of monsters the frenetic and savage ecology of idir in its early days had long since disappeared and so had all the other homeworld monsters except those in zoos but the idirans had retained the intelligence that made them winners as well as the biological immortality which due to the viciousness of the fight for survival back then not to mention idirs high radiation levels had been an evolutionary advantage rather than a recipe for stagnation horza thanked the medjel as it brought him plates and took them away again but it said nothing they were generally reckoned to be about two thirds as intelligent as the average humanoid whatever that was which made them about two or three times dimmer than a normal idiran still they were good if unimaginative soldiers and there were plenty of them something like ten or twelve for each idiran forty thousand years of breeding had made them loyal right down to the chromosome level horza didnt try to sleep though he was tired he told the medjel to take him to balveda the medjel thought about it asked permission via the cabin intercom and flinched visibly under a verbal slap from a distant xoralundra who was on the bridge with the cruiser captain follow me sir the medjel said opening the cabin door in the companionways of the warship the idiran atmosphere became more obvious than it had been in xoralundras cabin the smell of idiran was stronger and the view ahead hazed over even seen through horzas eyes after a few tens of metres it was hot and humid and the floor was soft horza walked quickly along the corridor watching the stump of the medjels docked tail as it waggled in front of him he passed two idirans on the way neither of whom paid him any attention perhaps they knew all about him and what he was but perhaps not horza knew that idirans hated to appear either overinquisitive or underinformed he nearly collided with a pair of wounded medjel on ag stretchers being hurried along a crosscorridor by two of their fellow troopers horza watched as the wounded passed and frowned the spiralled spattermarks on their battle armour were unmistakably those produced by a plasma bolt and the gerontocracy didnt have any plasma weapons he shrugged and walked on they came to a section of the cruiser where the companionway was blocked by sliding doors the medjel spoke to each of the barriers in turn and they opened an idiran guard holding a laser carbine stood outside a door he saw the medjel and horza approaching and had the door open for the man by the time he got there horza nodded to the guard as he stepped through the door hissed shut behind him and another one immediately in front opened balveda turned quickly to him when he entered the cell it looked as though she had been pacing up and down she threw back her head a little when she saw horza and made a noise in her throat which might have been a laugh well well she said her soft voice drawling you survived congratulations i did keep my promise by the way what a turnaround eh hello horza replied folding his arms across the chest of his suit and looking the woman up and down she wore the same grey gown and appeared to be unharmed what happened to that thing around your neck horza asked she looked down at where the pendant had lain over her breast well believe it or not it turned out to be a memoryform she smiled at him and sat down crosslegged on the soft floor apart from a raised bedalcove this was the only place to sit horza sat too his legs hurting only a little he recalled the spattermarks on the medjels armour a memoryform wouldnt have turned into a plasma gun by any chance would it amongst other things the culture agent nodded thought so heard your knife missile took the expansive way out balveda shrugged horza looked her in the eye and said i dont suppose youd be here if you had anything important you could tell them would you here perhaps balveda conceded alive no she stretched her arms out behind her and sighed i suppose ill have to sit out the war in an internment camp unless they can find somebody to swap i just hope this thing doesnt go on too long oh you think the culture might give in soon horza grinned no i think the culture might win soon you must be mad horza shook his head well balveda said nodding ruefully actually i think itll win eventually if you keep falling back like you have for the last three years youll end up somewhere in the clouds im not giving away any secrets horza but i think you might find we dont do too much more falling back well see frankly im surprised you kept fighting this long so are our threelegged friends so is everybody so are we i sometimes think balveda horza sighed wearily i still dont know why the hell youre fighting in the first place the idirans never were any threat to you they still wouldnt be if you stopped fighting them did life in your great utopia really get so boring you needed a war horza balveda said leaning forward i dont understand why you are fighting i know heidohre is in heibohre horza interjected ok the goddamn asteroid the changers live in i know its in idiran space but thats got nothing to do with it balveda im fighting for them because i think theyre right and youre wrong balveda sat back amazed you she began then lowered her head and shook it staring at the floor she looked up i really dont understand you horza you must know how many species how many civilisations how many systems how many individuals have been either destroyed or throttled by the idirans and their crazy goddamned religion what the hell has the culture ever done compared to that one hand was on her knee the other was displayed in front of horza clawed into a strangling grip he watched her and smiled on a straight head count the idirans no doubt do come out in front perosteck and ive told them i never did care for some of their methods or their zeal im all for people being allowed to live their own lives but now theyre up against you lot and thats what makes the difference to me because im against you rather than for them im prepared horza broke off for a moment laughing lightly selfconsciously well it sounds a bit melodramatic but sure im prepared to die for them he shrugged simple as that horza nodded as he said it and balveda dropped the outstretched hand and looked away to one side shaking her head and exhaling loudly horza went on because well i suppose you thought i was just kidding when i was telling old frolk i thought the knife missile was the real representative i wasnt kidding balveda i meant it then and i mean it now i dont care how selfrighteous the culture feels or how many people the idirans kill theyre on the side of life boring oldfashioned biological life smelly fallible and shortsighted god knows but real life youre ruled by your machines youre an evolutionary dead end the trouble is that to take your mind off it you try to drag everybody else down there with you the worst thing that could happen to the galaxy would be if the culture wins this war he paused to let her say something but she was still sitting with her head down shaking it he laughed at her you know balveda for such a sensitive species you show remarkably little empathy at times empathise with stupidity and youre halfway to thinking like an idiot muttered the woman still not looking at horza he laughed again and got to his feet such bitterness balveda he said she looked up at him ill tell you horza she said quietly were going to win he shook his head i dont think so you wouldnt know how to balveda sat back again hands spread behind her her face was serious we can learn horza who from whoever has the lesson there to teach she said slowly we spend quite a lot of our time watching warriors and zealots bullies and militarists people determined to win regardless theres no shortage of teachers if you want to know about winning ask the idirans balveda said nothing for a moment her face was calm thoughtful perhaps sad she nodded after a while they do say theres a danger in warfare she said that youll start to resemble the enemy she shrugged we just have to hope that we can avoid that if the evolutionary force you seem to believe in really works then itll work through us and not the idirans if youre wrong then it deserves to be superseded balveda he said laughing lightly dont disappoint me i prefer a fight you almost sound as though youre coming round to my point of view no she sighed im not blame it on my special circumstances training we try to think of everything i was being pessimistic id got the impression sc didnt allow such thoughts then think again mr changer balveda said arching one eyebrow sc allows all thoughts thats what some people find so frightening about it horza thought he knew what the woman meant special circumstances had always been the contact sections moral espionage weapon the very cutting edge of the cultures interfering diplomatic policy the elite of the elite in a society which abhorred elitism even before the war its standing and its image within the culture had been ambiguous it was glamorous but dangerous possessed of an aura of roguish sexiness there was no other word for it which implied predation seduction even violation it had about it too an atmosphere of secrecy in a society that virtually worshipped openness which hinted at unpleasant shaming deeds and an ambience of moral relativity in a society which clung to its absolutes lifegood deathbad pleasuregood painbad which attracted and repulsed at once but anyway excited no other part of the culture more exactly represented what the society as a whole really stood for or was more militant in the application of the cultures fundamental beliefs yet no other part embodied less of the societys daytoday character with war contact had become the cultures military and special circumstances its intelligence and espionage section the euphemism became only a little more obvious that was all and with war scs position within the culture changed for the worse it became the repository for the guilt the people in the culture experienced because they had agreed to go to war in the first place despised as a necessary evil reviled as an unpleasant moral compromise dismissed as something people preferred not to think about sc really did try to think of everything though and its minds were reputedly even more cynical amoral and downright sneaky than those which made up contact machines without illusions which prided themselves on thinking the thinkable to its ultimate extremities so it had been wearily predicted that just this would happen sc would become a pariah a whippingchild and its reputation a gland to absorb the poison in the cultures conscience but horza guessed that knowing all this didnt make it any easier for somebody like balveda culture people had little stomach for being disliked by anybody least of all their fellow citizens and the womans task was difficult enough without the added burden of knowing she was even greater anathema to most of her own side than she was to the enemy well whatever balveda he said stretching he flexed his stiff shoulders within the suit pulled his fingers through his thin yellowwhite hair i guess itll work itself out balveda laughed mirthlessly never a truer word she shook her head thanks anyway he told her for what i think you just reinforced my faith in the ultimate outcome of this war oh just go away horza balveda sighed and looked down to the floor horza wanted to touch her to ruffle her short black hair or pinch her pale cheek but guessed it would only upset her more he knew too well the bitterness of defeat to want to aggravate the experience for somebody who was in the end a fair and honourable adversary he went to the door and after a word with the guard outside he was let out ah bora horza xoralundra said as the human appeared out of the cell doorway the querl came striding along the companionway the guard outside the cell straightened visibly and blew some imaginary dust off his carbine how is our guest not very happy we were trading justifications and i think i won on points horza grinned xoralundra stopped by the man and looked down hmm well unless you prefer to relish your victories in a vacuum i suggest that the next time you leave my cabin while we are at battle stations you take your horza didnt hear the next word the ships alarm erupted the idiran alarm signal on a warship as elsewhere consists of what sounds like a series of very sharp explosions it is the amplified version of the idiran chestboom an evolved signal the idirans had been using to warn others in their herd or clan for several hundred thousand years before they became civilised and produced by the chestflap which is the idiran vestigial third arm horza clapped his hands to his ears trying to shut out the awful noise he could feel the shock waves on his chest through the open neck of the suit he felt himself being picked up and forced against the bulkhead it was only then that he realised he had shut his eyes for a second he thought he had never been rescued never left the wall of the sewercell that this was the moment of his death and all the rest had been a strange and vivid dream he opened his eyes and found himself staring into the keratinous snout of the querl xoralundra who shook him furiously and just as the ship alarm cut off and was replaced by a merely painfully intense whine said very loudly into horzas face helmet oh shit said horza he was dropped to the deck as xoralundra let him go turned quickly and scooped a running medjel off the floor as it tried to get past him you xoralundra bellowed i am the spyfather querl of the fleet he shouted into its face and shook the sixlimbed creature by the front of its suit you will go to my cabin immediately and bring the small space helmet lying there to the portside stem emergency lock as fast as possible this order supersedes all others and cannot be countermanded go he threw the medjel in the right direction it landed running xoralundra flipped his own helmet over from its backhinged position then opened the visor he looked as though he was about to say something to horza but the helmet speaker crackled and spoke and the querls expression changed the small noise stopped and only the continuing wail of the cruisers alarm was left the culture craft was hiding in the surface layers of the system sun xoralundra said bitterly more to himself than to horza in the sun horza was incredulous he looked back at the cell door as though somehow it was balvedas fault those bastards are getting smarter all the time yes snapped the querl then turned quickly on one foot follow me human horza obeyed starting after the old idiran at a run then bumping into him as the huge figure stopped in its tracks horza watched the broad dark alien face as it swivelled round to look over his head at the idiran trooper still standing stiffly at the cell door an expression horza could not read passed over xoralundras face guard the querl said not loudly the trooper with the laser carbine turned kill the woman xoralundra stamped off down the corridor horza stood for a moment looking first at the rapidly receding querl then at the guard as he checked his carbine ordered the cell door to open and stepped inside then the man ran down the corridor after the old idiran querl gasped the medjel as it skidded to a stop by the airlock the suit helmet held in front of it xoralundra swept the helmet from its grasp and fitted it quickly over horzas head you will find a warp attachment in the lock the idiran told horza get as far away as possible the fleet will be here in about nine standard hours you shouldnt have to do anything the suit will summon help on a coded iff response i too xoralundra broke off as the cruiser lurched there was a loud bang and horza was blown off his feet by a shock wave while the idiran on his tripod of legs hardly moved the medjel which had gone for the helmet yelped as it was blown under xoralundras legs the idiran swore and kicked at it it ran off the cruiser lurched again as other alarms started horza could smell burning a confused medley of noises that might have been idiran voices or muffled explosions came from somewhere overhead i too shall try to escape xoralundra continued god be with you human before horza could say anything the idiran had rammed his visor down and pushed him into the lock it slammed shut horza was thrown against one bulkhead as the cruiser juddered mightily he looked desperately round the small spherical space for a warp unit then saw it and after a short struggle unclamped it from its wall magnets he clamped it to the rear of his suit ready a voice said in his ear horza jumped then said yes yes hit it the airlock didnt open conventionally it turned inside out and threw him into space tumbling away from the flat disc of the cruiser in a tiny galaxy of ice particles he looked for the culture ship then told himself not to be stupid it was probably still several trillion kilometres away that was how divorced from the human scale modern warfare had become you could smash and destroy from unthinkable distances obliterate planets from beyond their own system and provoke stars into novae from lightyears off and still have no good idea why you were really fighting with one last thought for balveda horza reached until he found the control handle for the bulky warp unit fingered the correct buttons on it and watched the stars twist and distort around him as the unit sent him and his suit lancing away from the stricken idiran spacecraft he played with the wristset for a while trying to pick up signals from the hand of god but got nothing but static the suit spoke to him once saying warpunitchargehalfexhausted horza kept a watch on the warp unit via a small screen set inside the helmet he recalled that the idirans said some sort of prayer to their god before going into warp once when he had been with xoralundra on a ship which was warping the querl had insisted that the changer repeat the prayer too horza had protested that it meant nothing to him not only did the idiran god clash with his own personal convictions the prayer itself was in a dead idiran language he didnt understand he had been told rather coldly that it was the gesture that mattered for what the idirans regarded as essentially an animal their word for humanoids was best translated as biotomaton only the behaviour of devotion was required his heart and mind were of no consequence when horza had asked what about his immortal soul xoralundra had laughed it was the first and only time horza had experienced such a thing from the old warrior whoever heard of a mortal body having an immortal soul when the warp unit was almost exhausted horza shut it off stars swam into focus around him he set the unit controls then threw it away from him they parted company he moving slowly off in one direction while the unit spun off in another then it disappeared as the controls switched it back on again to use the last of its power leading anybody following its trace away in the wrong direction he calmed his breathing down gradually it had been very fast and hard for a while but he slowed it and his heart deliberately he accustomed himself to the suit testing its functions and powers it smelled and felt new and looked like a rairchbuilt device rairch suits were meant to be among the best people said the culture made better ones but people said the culture made better everything and they were still losing the war horza checked out the lasers the suit had built in and searched for the concealed pistol he knew it ought to carry he found it at last disguised as part of the left forearm casing a small plasma hand gun he felt like shooting it at something but there was nothing to aim at he put it back he folded his arms across his bulky chest and looked around stars were everywhere he had no idea which one was sorpens so the culture ships could hide in the photospheres of stars could they and a mind even if it was desperate and on the run could jump through the bottom of a gravitywell could it maybe the idirans would have a tougher job than they expected they were the natural warriors they had the experience and the guts and their whole society was geared for continual conflict but the culture that seemingly disunited anarchic hedonistic decadent melange of more or less human species forever hiving off or absorbing different groups of people had fought for almost four years without showing any sign of giving up or even coming to a compromise what everybody had expected to be at best a brief limited stand lasting just long enough to make a point had developed into a wholehearted war effort the early reverses and first few megadeaths had not as the pundits and experts had predicted shocked the culture into retiring horrified at the brutalities of war but proud to have put its collective life where usually only its collective mouth was instead it had just kept on retreating and retreating preparing gearing up and planning horza was convinced the minds were behind it all he could not believe the ordinary people in the culture really wanted the war no matter how they had voted they had their communist utopia they were soft and pampered and indulged and the contact sections evangelical materialism provided their consciencesalving good works what more could they want the war had to be the minds idea it was part of their clinical drive to clean up the galaxy make it run on nice efficient lines without waste injustice or suffering the fools in the culture couldnt see that one day the minds would start thinking how wasteful and inefficient the humans in the culture themselves were horza used the suits internal gyros to steer himself letting him look at every part of the sky wondering where in that lightflecked emptiness battles raged and billions died where the culture still held and the idiran battle fleets pressed the suit hummed and clicked and hissed very quietly around him precise obedient reassuring suddenly it jolted steadying him without warning and jarring his teeth a noise uncomfortably like a collision alarm trilled violently in one ear and out of the corner of his eye horza could see a microscreen set inside the helmet near his left cheek light up with a holo red graph display targetacquisitionradar the suit said incomingincreasing clean air turbulence what roared horza targetacqui the suit began again oh shut up horza shouted and started punching buttons on the suits wrist console twisting this way and that scanning the darkness around him there ought to have been a way of getting a headup display on the inside of the helmet visor to show him what direction the signals were coming from but he hadnt enough time to familiarise himself completely with the suit and he couldnt find the right button then he realised he could probably just ask suit give me a headup on the transmission source the top left edge of the visor flashed he turned and tipped until a winking red dot positioned itself on the transparent surface he hit the wrist buttons again and the suit hissed as it evacuated gas from its solenozzles sending him shooting away under about one gravity nothing appeared to change apart from his weight but the red light went out briefly then came back on he swore the suit said targetacquisition i know horza told it he unslung the plasma pistol from his arm and readied the suit lasers he cut the gas jets too whatever it was coming after him he doubted hed be able to outrun it he became weightless again the small red light continued to flash on the visor he watched the internal screens the transmission source was closing on a curved course at about point zeroone lights in real space the radar was low frequency and not particularly powerful all too lowtech to be either the culture or the idirans he told the suit to cancel the headup brought the magnifiers down from the top of the visor and switched them on aiming at where the radar source had been coming from a doppler shift in the signal still displayed on one of the helmets small internal screens announced that whatever was producing the transmission was slowing down was he going to be picked up rather than blown apart something glinted hazily in the magnifiers field the radar switched off it was very close now he felt his mouth go dry and his hands shook inside the heavy gloves of the suit the image in the magnifiers seemed to explode with darkness then he swept them back to the top of the helmet and looked out into the starfields and the inky night something tore across his vision pure black racing across the backdrop of sky in utter silence he jabbed at the button which switched on the suits needle radar and tried to follow the shape as it passed him occluding stars but he missed so there was no way of telling how close it had come or how big it was he had lost track of it in the spaces between the stars when the darkness ahead of him flared he guessed it was turning sure enough back came the radar pulse ta quiet horza said checking the plasma gun the dark shape expanded almost directly ahead the stars around it wobbled and brightened in the lens effect of an imperfectly adjusted warp motor in cancel mode horza watched the shape come closer the radar switched off again he switched his own back on the needle beam scanning the craft ahead he was looking at the resulting image on an internal screen when it flickered and went out the suits hissings and hummings stopped and the stars started to fade away sappingeffectorfi re said the suit as it and horza went limp and unconscious there was something hard under him his head hurt he couldnt remember where he was or what he was supposed to be doing he only just remembered his name bora horza gobuchul changer from the asteroid heibohre lately employed by the idirans in their holy war against the culture how did that connect with the pain in his skull though and the hard cold metal under his cheek he had been hit hard while he still couldnt see or hear or smell anything he knew something severe had occurred something almost fatal he tried to remember what had happened where had he been last what had he been doing the hand of god his heart leapt as he remembered he had to get off where was his helmet why had xoralundra deserted him where was that stupid medjel with his helmet help he found he couldnt move anyway it wasnt the hand of god or any idiran ship the deck was hard and cold if it was a deck and the air smelled wrong he could hear people talking now too but still no sight he didnt know if his eyes were open and he was blind or if they were shut and he couldnt open them he tried to bring his hands up to his face to find out but nothing would move the voices were human there were several they were speaking the cultures language marain but that didnt mean much it had grown increasingly common as a second language in the galaxy over the last few millennia horza could speak and understand it though he hadnt used it since since he had talked to balveda in fact but before that not for a long time poor balveda but these people were chattering and he couldnt make out the individual words he tried to move his eyelids and eventually felt something he still couldnt think where he might be all this darkness then he remembered something about being in a suit and a voice talking to him about targets or something with a shock he realised he had been captured or rescued he forgot about trying to open his eyes and concentrated hard on understanding what the people near by were saying he had used marain just recently he could do it he had to he had to know goddamn system for two weeks and all we get is some old guy in a suit that was one voice female he thought what the hell did you expect a culture starship male well shit a bit of one the female voice again some laughter its a good suit riarch by the look of it think ill have it another male voice tone of command no mistaking it no good too quiet they adjust idiot the man again bits of idiran and culture ships would be floating all over the place and we could that bow laser and its still fucked woman different one our effector wont have damaged it will it another male young sounding cutting across what the woman had said it was on suck not blow the captain said or whatever he was who were these people of a lot less than grandad over there said one of the men him they were talking about him he tried not to show any sign of life he only now realised that of course he was out of the suit lying a few metres away from people probably standing around it some with their backs to him he was lying with one arm underneath his body on his side naked facing them his head still hurt and he could feel saliva dribbling from his halfopen mouth weapon of some sort with them cant see it though said the man and his voice altered as though he was changing position as he spoke sounded like they had lost the plasma gun they were mercenaries had to be privateers can i have your old suit kraiklyn young male well thats that the man said his voice sounding as though he was getting up from a squatting position or turning round it seemed he had ignored the previous speaker a bit of a disappointment maybe but we did get this suit better get out now before the big boys show what now one of the females again horza liked her voice he wished he could get his eyes open that temple should be easy meat even without the bow laser only about ten days from here well do a little bit more fundingup on some of their altar treasures and then buy some heavy weaponry on vavatch we can all spend our illgotten gains there the man krakeline or whatever his name was paused he laughed doro dont look so frightened thisll be simple youll be thankful i heard about this place once were rich the goddamn priests dont even carry weapons itll be easy easy out yeah we know a womans voice the nice one horza was aware of light now pink in front of his eyes his head was still sore but he was coming to he checked out his body consciously calling on the feedback nerves to gauge his own physical readiness below normal and it wouldnt be perfect until the last effects of his geriatric appearance had faded away in a few days if he lived that long he suspected they thought he was already dead zallin the man said dump that weed horza opened his eyes with a start as footsteps approached the man had been talking about him aah somebody cried nearby hes not dead his eyes are moving the footsteps suddenly halted horza sat up shakily narrowing his eyes in the glare he was breathing hard and his head swam as he raised it his eyes focused he was in a brightly lit but small hangar an old weatherbeaten shuttle craft filled about half of it he was sitting almost against one bulkhead near the other stood the people who had been talking halfway between him and the group stood a large ungainly youth with very long arms and silver hair as horza had guessed the suit he had been wearing lay prone on the floor at the feet of the group of humans he swallowed and blinked the youth with the silver hair stared at him and scratched nervously at one ear he wore a pair of shorts and a frayed tshirt he jumped when one of the taller men in the group in the voice horza had decided was that of the captain said wubslin he turned to one of the other men isnt that effector working properly dont let them talk about you as though you arent here he cleared his throat and spoke as loudly and as determinedly as he could theres nothing wrong with your effector then the tall man said smiling thinly and arching one eyebrow you should be dead they were all looking at him most with suspicion the youth near him was still scratching his ear he appeared puzzled even frightened but the rest just looked as though they wanted rid of him as quickly as possible they were all humans or close to male and female mostly dressed in either suits or bits of suits or tshirts and shorts the captain now moving through the group closer to horza looked tall and muscular he had a mass of dark hair combed back from his brow a sallow complexion and something feral about his eyes and mouth the voice suited him as he came closer horza saw that he was holding a laser pistol the suit he wore was black and its heavy boots rang on the naked metal deck he advanced until he was level with the young man with the silver hair who was fiddling with the hem of his tshirt and biting his lip why arent you dead the man asked horza quietly because im a lot fucking tougher than i look horza said the man smiled and nodded you must be he turned round and looked briefly back at the suit what were you doing way out here in that i used to work for the idirans they didnt want the culture ship to catch me and they thought they might be able to rescue me later so they threw me overboard to wait for the fleet itll be here in about eight or nine hours by the way so i wouldnt hang around will it now the captain said quietly raising his eyebrow again you seem very well informed old man im not that old this was a disguise for my last job an agatic drug its wearing off a couple of days and ill be useful again the man shook his head sadly no you wont he turned and started back towards the other people dump him he told the youth in the tshirt the youth started forward now wait a goddamned minute horza shouted scrambling to his feet he backed against the wall hands out but the youth was coming straight at him the others were looking either at him or at their captain horza swung forward and up with one leg too fast for the young man with the silver hair he caught him in the groin with his foot the youth gasped and fell to the deck clutching at himself the man had turned he looked down at the youth then at horza yes he said horza got the impression he was enjoying it all horza pointed to the now kneeling youth i told you i can be useful im pretty good in a fight you can have the suit ive got the suit the captain said drily so at least give me a chance horza looked around them youre mercenaries or something right nobody said anything he could feel himself starting to sweat he stopped it let me join all im asking fors a chance if i louse up first time dump me then why not dump you now and save the hassle the captain laughed spreading his arms wide some of the others laughed too a chance horza repeated shit it isnt much to ask im sorry the man shook his head were overcrowded already the silverhaired youth was looking up at horza his face twisted with pain and hate the people in the group were smirking at horza or talking quietly to each other and nodding at him grinning he was suddenly aware that he looked like just a skinny old man in the nude fuck it he spat glaring right at the man give me five days and ill take you on anytime the captains eyebrows went up for a second he might have looked angry then he burst out laughing he waved the laser at horza all right old man ill tell you what well do he put his hands on his waist and nodded at the youth still kneeling on the deck you can fight zallin here you feel up to a rumble zallin ill kill him zallin said looking straight at horzas throat the man laughed some of his black hair spilled out of the back lip of his suit thats the idea he looked at horza i told you were already overcrowded youll have to produce a vacancy he turned round to the others clear a space and somebody get this old guy some shorts hes putting me off my food one of the women threw horza a pair of shorts he put them on the suit had been lifted from the deck and the shuttle rolled a couple of metres sideways until it clanged against the hull on the far side of the hangar zallin had finally risen from the deck and gone back to the others somebody sprayed anaesthetic on his genitals thank goodness for nonretractables horza thought he was resting against the bulkhead watching the group of people zallin was taller than any of them his arms seemed to reach to his knees and they were as thick as horzas thighs horza saw the captain nod towards him and one of the women walked over she had a small hardlooking face her skin was dark and she had spiky fair hair her whole body looked slim and hard she walked horza thought like a man as she got closer horza saw she was lightly furred on her face legs and arms which the long shirt she wore revealed she stopped in front of him and looked at him from his feet to his eyes im your second she said whatever good thats supposed to do you she was the one with the nice voice horza was disappointed even through his fear he waved one hand my names horza thanks for asking idiot he told himself tell them your real name thats it why not tell them youre a changer as well yalson the woman said abruptly and stuck her hand out horza wasnt sure if the word was a greeting or her name he was angry with himself as though he didnt have enough problems hed tricked himself into giving his real name probably it wouldnt matter but he knew too well that it was the small slips the seemingly inconsequential mistakes that often made the difference between success and failure even life and death he reached out and clasped the womans hand when he realised that was what he was supposed to do her hand was dry and cool and strong she squeezed his she let go before he had time to squeeze back he had no idea where she came from so he didnt read too much into it where he came from that would have been a fairly specific sort of invitation horza eh she nodded and put her hands on her hips in the same way as the captain had done well good luck horza i believe kraiklyn thinks zallins the most expendable member of the crew so he probably wont mind if you win she looked down at his slackskinned paunch and ribskinny chest and her brow furrowed if you win she repeated thanks a lot horza said trying to suck in his belly and push out his chest he gestured over to the others they taking bets over there he tried to grin only on how long youll last horza let the attempt at a grin fade he looked away from the woman and said you know i could probably get this depressed even without your help dont let me stop you if you want to go and put some money down he looked back at the womans face he could see no compassion or even sympathy in it she looked him up and down again then nodded turned on her heel and went back to the others horza swore right kraiklyn clapped his gloved hands together the group of people split up and moved around the sides of the hangar lining two of them zallin was standing glaring at horza from the far end of the cleared space horza pushed himself away from the bulkhead and shook himself trying to loosen up and get ready so its to the death both of you kraiklyn announced smiling no weapons but i dont see any referees so anything goes ok begin horza made a little more room between himself and the bulkhead zallin was coming towards him crouched arms out like a pair of oversized mandibles on some enormous insect horza knew that if he used all his builtin weapons and if he had them all he had to keep reminding himself theyd taken out his venomteeth on sorpen he could probably win without too much trouble unless zallin landed a lucky blow but he was equally sure that if he did use the only effective weapon he had left the poison glands under his fingernails the others would guess what he was and hed be dead anyway he might have got away with using his teeth somehow and biting zallin the poison affected the central nervous system and zallin would have slowed down gradually probably nobody would guess but scratching him would be fatal for both of them the poison contained in the sacs under horzas nails paralysed muscles sequentially from the point of entry and it would be obvious zallin had been scratched by something other than ordinary nails even if the other mercenaries didnt regard this as cheating there would be a good chance the man kraiklyn would guess horza was a changer and have him killed a changer was a threat to anybody who ruled by force either of will or of arms amahainfrolk had known that and so would kraiklyn there was also a degree of humanbasic revulsion reserved for horzas species not only were they much altered from their original genetic stock they were a threat to identity a challenge to the individualism even of those they were never likely to impersonate it had nothing to do with souls or physical or spiritual possession it was as the idirans well understood the behaviouristic copying of another which revolted individuality the thing which most humans held more precious than anything else about themselves was somehow cheapened by the ease with which a changer could ignore it as a limitation and use it as a disguise he had changed into an old man and that legacy still lay with him zallin was getting very close the youth lunged using his huge arms like pincers and making an ungainly grab for horza horza ducked and jumped to one side faster than zallin had anticipated before he could follow horza round the changer had landed a kick on the youths shoulder which had been aimed at his head zallin swore so did horza hed hurt his foot rubbing his shoulder the youth came forward again almost casually at first then suddenly swinging one long arm out hand fisted and very nearly catching horzas face the changer felt the wind of the scything swing on his cheek if the blow had landed it would have finished the fight horza dummied one way then leapt in the other direction pivoting on one heel and lashing out again with a foot aimed between the youths legs it landed but zallin just smiled painfully and grabbed at horza again the spray must have deadened all feeling horza circled the youth zallin was staring at him with a look of intense concentration on his face his arms were still bowed out in front of him like pincers and at their ends his fingers flexed every now and again as though desperate for the feel of horzas throat horza was hardly aware of the people standing around him or the lights and fittings of the hanger all he could see was the crouched ready young man in front of him with his massive arms and silvery hair his frayed tshirt and light shoes the shoes squeaked on the metal deck as zallin lunged again horza spun and flicked out with his right foot it caught zallin across his right ear and the youth pranced away rubbing his ear horza knew he was breathing hard again he was using up too much energy just staying at maximum tension ready for the next attack and in the meantime he just wasnt hurting zallin enough at this rate the youth would soon wear him down even without coming at him zallin spread his arms again and advanced horza skipped to one side his old muscles complaining zallin swivelled horza leapt forward pivoting again on one foot and swinging the other heel at the youths midriff it connected with a satisfying thump and horza started to jump away then realised his foot was caught zallin was holding it horza fell to the deck zallin was swaying one hand down at the base of his ribcage he was gasping almost doubled up and staggering horza suspected hed cracked a rib but he held horzas foot with the other hand twist and pull as he might horza couldnt loosen the grip he tried a sweatpulse in his lower right leg he hadnt done that since singlecombat exercise in the academy in heibohre but it was worth a try anything was if it had a chance of loosening that grip it didnt work perhaps he had forgotten how to do it properly or perhaps his artificially aged sweat glands were incapable of reacting that fast but either way he was still trapped in the youths grip zallin was recovering now from the blow horza had landed he shook his head the hangar lights reflecting on his hair then he took hold of horzas foot with his other hand horza was walking on his hands round the youth one leg gripped the other hanging down trying to take some weight on the deck zallin stared at the changer and whipped his hands round as though trying to twist horzas foot right off horza read the motion and was throwing his whole body round even as zallin started the manoeuvre he ended up back where hed started his foot held in zallins hands and his own palms crabbing across the deck as he tried to follow the movements of the youth i could go for his legs sweep in and bite horza thought desperately trying to think of something the instant he starts to slow down id have a chance they wouldnt notice all i need is then of course he remembered again they had taken those teeth out those old bastards and balveda were going to kill him after all in balvedas case from beyond the grave as long as zallin had his foot like this the fight was only going to go one way what the hell ill bite him anyway he surprised himself with the thought it was conceived and acted upon before he had time really to consider it the next thing he knew he had pulled on the leg which zallin held and pushed as hard as he could with his hands flinging himself between the youths legs he fastened his remaining teeth into the boys right calf aah zallin screamed horza bit harder feeling the grip round his foot slacken slightly he jerked his head up trying to tear the youths flesh he felt as though his kneecap was going to explode and his leg would break but he worried the mouthful of living flesh and punched up towards zallins body with all his might zallin let go horza stopped biting instantly and threw himself away as the youths hands came slamming down towards his head horza got to his feet his ankle and knee were sore but not seriously injured zallin was limping as he came forward blood pouring from his calf horza changed tactics and pounced forward striking the youth square in the belly beneath the rudimentary guard of his huge arms zallin put his hands to his stomach and lower ribcage and crouched reflexively as horza went past he turned and brought both hands down on zallins neck normally the blow would have killed but zallin was strong and horza was still weak as the changer steadied and turned he had to avoid colliding with some of the mercenaries lining the bulkhead the fight had traversed the hangar from one end to the other before horza could get ill another blow zallin was upright again his face contorted with frustrated aggression he screamed and rushed at horza who sidestepped neatly but zallin stumbled in his headlong rush and by pure luck his head thumped into horzas stomach the blow was all the more painful and demoralising for being unexpected horza fell and rolled trying to send zallin straight over the top but the youth fell on him pinning him to the deck horza wriggled but nothing happened he was trapped zallin raised himself up on one palm and drew the other hand up behind him into a fist as he leered at the face of the man beneath him horza realised suddenly that there was nothing he could do he watched that massive fist go up and back his own body flattened his arms pinned and knew it was over hed lost he got ready to move his head as fast as possible out of the way of the bonesplintering punch he could see would be unleashed at any moment and tried again to move his legs but knew it was hopeless he wanted to close his eyes but knew he had to keep them open maybe the man will take pity he must have seen i fought well i was just unlucky maybe hell stop it zallins fist paused like a guillotine blade raised to its highest point just before release the blow never fell as zallin tensed his other hand taking the weight of his upper body on the deck skidded it went shooting out from under him as it slipped on some of the youths own blood zallin grunted in surprise as he fell towards horza his body shifted and the changer could feel the weight pinning him lessen he heaved himself out from underneath zallin as the youth rolled horza rolled in the other direction almost into the legs of the mercenaries who stood watching zallins head hit the deck not hard but before the youth could react horza threw himself onto zallins back locking his hands round his neck and bringing the youths silverhaired head back he slid his legs down either side of zallins body straddling him and held him there zallin went still a gurgling noise coming from his throat where horzas hands held him he was more than strong enough to throw the changer off to roll on his back and crush him but before he could have done anything one flick of horzas hands would have broken his neck zallin was looking up at kraiklyn who stood almost right in front of him horza too lathered in sweat and gulping air looked up into the dark deepset eyes of the man zallin wriggled a little then went motionless again when horza tensed his forearms they were all looking at him all the mercenaries all the pirates or privateers or whatever they wanted to call themselves they stood round the two walls of the hangar and they looked at horza but only kraiklyn was looking into horzas eyes this doesnt have to be to the death horza panted he looked for a moment at the silver hairs in front of him some of them plastered with sweat to the boys scalp he looked up at kraiklyn again i won you can let the kid off next place you stop or let me off i dont want to kill him something warm and sticky seemed to be seeping from the deck along his right leg he realised it was zallins blood from the wound on his leg kraiklyn had a strangely distant look on his face the laser gun which he had holstered was lifted easily back out of its holster into his left hand and pointed at the centre of horzas forehead in the silence of the hangar horza heard it click and hum as it was switched on about a metre away from his skull then youll die kraiklyn told him in a flat even voice ive no place on this ship for somebody who hasnt the taste for a little murder now and again horza looked into kraiklyns eyes over the motionless barrel of the laser pistol zallin moaned the snap echoed round the metal spaces of the hangar like a gunshot horza opened his arms without taking his eyes off the mercenary chiefs face zallins limp body tumbled slackly to the deck and crumpled under its own weight kraiklyn smiled and put the gun back in its holster it clicked off with a fading whine welcome aboard the clear air turbulence kraiklyn sighed and stepped over zallins body he walked to the middle of one bulkhead opened a door and went out his boots clattering on some steps most of the others followed him well done horza still kneeling turned at the words it was the woman with the nice voice again yalson she offered him her hand once more this time to help him up he took it gratefully and got to his feet i didnt enjoy it he told her he wiped some sweat from his brow with his forearm and looked into the womans eyes you said your name was yalson right she nodded and youre horza hello yalson hello horza she smiled a little horza liked her smile he looked at the corpse on the deck blood had stopped flowing from the wound in one leg what about that poor bastard he asked might as well dump him yalson said she looked over at the only other people left in the hangar three thickly furred and identical heavyset males in shorts they stood in a group near the door the others had left by looking at him curiously all three had heavy boots on as though they had just started to suit up and had been interrupted at the same moment horza wanted to laugh instead he smiled and waved hello ah those are the bratsilakins yalson said as the three furry bodies waved dark grey hands at him not quite in synch one two and three she continued nodding at each one in turn we must be the only free company with a clone group thats paranoid horza looked at her to see if she was serious just as the three furry humans came over to him dont listen to a word she says one of them said in a soft voice horza found surprising shes never liked us we just hope that youre on our side six eyes looked anxiously at horza he did his best to smile you can depend on it he told them they smiled back and looked from one to another nodding lets get zallin into a vactube probably dump him later yalson said to the other three she went over to the body two of the bratsilakins followed her and between the three of them they got the limp corpse to an area of the hangar deck where they lifted some metal planks up opened a curved hatch stuffed zallins body into a narrow space then closed both hatch and deck again the third bratsilakin took a cloth from a wall panel and mopped up the blood on the deck then the hairy clone group headed for the door and the stairs yalson came up to horza she made a sideways gesture with her head come on ill show you where you can clean up he followed her over the hangar deck towards the doorway she turned round as they went the rest have gone to eat ill see you in the mess if youre ready in time just follow your nose anyway i have to collect my winnings your winnings horza said as they got to the doorway where yalson put her hand on what horza assumed were lighting switches she turned to him looking into his eyes sure she said and pressed one of the switches covered by her hand the lights didnt change but under his feet horza could feel a vibration he heard a hiss and what sounded like a pump running i bet on you yalson said then turned and bounded up the steps beyond the door two at a time horza looked round at the hangar once and then followed her just before the clear air turbulence went back into warp and its crew sat down at table the ship expelled the limp corpse of zallin where it had found a live man in a suit it left a dead youth in shorts and a tattered shirt tumbling and freezing while a thin shell of air molecules expanded around the body like an image of departing life temple of light the clear air turbulence swung through the shadow of a moon past a barren cratered surface its track dimpling as it skirted the top edge of a gravity well and then down towards a cloudy bluegreen planet almost as soon as it passed the moon its course started to curve gradually pointing the crafts nose away from the planet and back into space halfway through that curve the cat released its shuttle slinging it towards one hazy horizon of the globe at the trailing edge of the darkness which swept over the planet surface like a black cloak horza sat in the shuttle with most of the rest of the cats motley crew they were suited up sitting on narrow benches in the cramped shuttles passenger compartment in a variety of spacesuits even the three bratsilakins had slightly different models on the only really modern example was the one kraiklyn wore the rairch suit he had taken from horza they were all armed and their weapons were as various as their suits mostly they were lasers or to be more exact what the culture called crews coherent radiation emission weapon systems the better ones operated on wavelengths invisible to the human eye some people had plasma cannons or heavy pistols and one had an efficientlooking microhowitzer but only horza had a projective rifle and an old crude slowfiring one at that he checked it over for the tenth or eleventh time and cursed it he cursed the leaky old suit hed been given too the visor was starting to mist up this whole thing was hopeless the shuttle started to lurch and vibrate as it hit the atmosphere of the planet marjoin where they were going to attack and rob something called the temple of light it had taken the clear air turbulence fifteen days to crawl across the twentyone or so standard lightyears that lay between the sorpen system and that of marjoin kraiklyn boasted that his ship could hit nearly twelve hundred lights but that sort of speed he said was for emergencies only horza had taken a look at the old craft and doubted it would even get into four figures without its outboard warping engines pancaking the ship and everything in it all over the skies the clear air turbulence was a venerable hronish armouredassault ship from one of the declining later dynasties and was built more for ruggedness and reliability than for performance and sophistication given the level of technical expertise possessed by its crew horza thought this was just as well the ship was about a hundred metres long twenty across the beam and fifteen high plus on top of the rear hull a tenmetrehigh tail on either side of the hull the warp units bulged like small versions of the hull itself and connected to it by stubby wings in the middle and thin flying pylons swept back from just behind the crafts nose the cat was streamlined and fitted with sprinter fusion motors in the tail as well as a small lift engine in the nose for working in atmospheres and gravity wells horza thought its accommodation left a lot to be desired he had been given zallins old bunk sharing a twometre cube euphemistically termed a cabin with wubslin who was the mechanic on the ship he called himself the engineer but after a few minutes talk trying to pump him for technical stuff on the cat horza realised that the thickset whiteskinned man knew little about the crafts more complex systems he wasnt unpleasant didnt smell and slept silently most of the time so horza supposed things could have been worse there were eighteen people on the ship in nine cabins the man of course had one to himself and the bratsilakins shared one rather pungent one they liked to leave the door to it open everybody else liked to close the door as they went past horza was disappointed to find that there were only four women aboard two of them hardly ever showed themselves outside their cabin and communicated with the others mostly by signs and gestures the third was a religious fanatic who when not trying to convert him to something called the circle of flame spent her time wired up in the cabin she shared with yalson spooling fantasy headtapes yalson seemed to be the only normal female on board but horza found it difficult to think of her as a woman at all it was she however who took on the job of introducing him to the others and telling him the things about the ship and its crew which he would need to know he had cleaned up in one of the ships coffinlike washpoints then followed his nose as yalson had suggested to the mess where he was more or less ignored but some food was shoved in his direction kraiklyn looked at him once as he sat down between wubslin and a bratsilakin then didnt look at him again and continued talking about weapons and armour and tactics after the meal wubslin had shown horza to their cabin then left horza cleared a space on zallins bunk hauled some torn sheets over his tired aching oldlooking frame and fell into a deep sleep when he woke he bundled up zallins few possessions it was pathetic the dead youth had a few tshirts shorts a couple of little kilts a rusty sword a collection of cheap daggers in frayed sheaths and some large plastic micropage books with moving pictures repeating and repeating scenes from ancient wars for as long as they were held open that was about all horza kept the youths leaky suit though it was far too big and nonadjustable and the badly maintained and ancient projectile rifle he carried the rest wrapped in one of the more tatty bed sheets down to the hangar it was as it had been when hed left it nobody had bothered to roll the shuttle back yalson was there stripped to the waist exercising horza stood in the doorway at the bottom of the steps watching the woman work out she spun and leapt did backflips and somersaults kicked her feet out and jabbed punches at the air making small grunting noises with each sharp movement she stopped when she saw horza welcome back she stooped and picked up a towel from the deck then started to rub it over her chest and arms where sweat glistened in the golden down thought youd croaked have i been asleep long horza asked he didnt know what sort of time system they used on the ship two days standard yalson towelled her spiky hair and draped the damp towel over her lightly furred shoulders you look better for it though i feel better horza said he hadnt had a look in a mirror or a reverser yet but knew that his body was starting to come back to normal losing the geriatric look that zallins stuff yalson nodded at the package in his hands yes ill show you how to work the vactubes well probably sling it when we next come out of warp yalson opened the deck and the tube hatch beneath then horza dropped zallins gear into the cylinder and yalson closed it again the changer liked the way yalson smelled when he caught the scent of her warm perspiring body but somehow there was nothing in her attitude towards him to make him think they would ever become more than friends hed settle for a friend on this ship though he certainly needed one they went to the mess after that to have something to eat horza was ravenous his body demanded food to rebuild itself and put more bulk onto the thin shape it had assumed to impersonate the gerontocracy of sorpens outworld minister at least thought horza the autogalley works all right and the ag field seems smooth the idea of cramped cabins rotten food and a lumpy or erratic gravity field filled the changer with horror zallin didnt have any real friends yalson said shaking her head as she stuffed some food into her mouth they were sitting in the mess together horza wanted to know if there was anybody on the ship who might want to avenge the youth he had killed poor bastard horza said again he put his spoon down and stared across the cluttered space of the lowceilinged mess room for a second feeling again that quick decisive bonesnap through his hands seeing in his minds eye the spinal column sever windpipe crumple arteries compress turning off the youths life as though rotating a switch he shook his head where did he come from who knows yalson shrugged she saw the expression on horzas face and added between chews look hed have killed you hes dead forget about him sure its tough but anyway he was pretty boring she are some more i just wondered if there was anybody i ought to send anything to friends or relations or look horza yalson said turning to him when you come on board this ship you dont have a past its considered very bad manners to ask anybody where they came from or what theyve done in their lives before they joined maybe weve all got some secrets or we just dont want to talk or think about some of the things weve done or some of the things weve had done to us but either way dont try to find out between your ears is the only place on this crate youll ever get any privacy so make the most of it if you live long enough maybe somebody will want to tell you all about themselves eventually probably when theyre drunk but by that time you may not want them to whatever my advice is just to leave it for the moment horza opened his mouth to say something but yalson went on ill tell you all i know now just to save you asking she put her spoon down and wiped her lips with one finger then turned in her seat to face him she held up one hand the tiny hairs of the light fur on her forearms and the back of her hands gave a golden outline to her dark skin she stretched one finger out one the ship hronish been around hundreds of years at least a dozen not very careful owners currently without its bow laser since we blew it up trying to alter its wavelength pattern two she extended another finger kraiklyn hes had this craft since any of us have known him he says he won it in a game of damage somewhere just before the war i know he plays the game but i dont know how good he is anyway thats his business officially were called the kfc kraiklyns free company and hes the boss hes a pretty good leader and he isnt afraid to slug it out with the rest of the troops when it comes to the crunch he leads from the front and that makes him ok in my book his gimmick is he never sleeps he has a ah yalson frowned obviously looking for the right words an enhanced hemispherical taskdivision in his brain one third of the time one half sleeps and hes a bit dreamy and vague the other third of the time the other half sleeps and hes all logic and numbers and he doesnt communicate too well the other third of the time like when hes in action or whenever theres an emergency both sides are awake and functioning makes it pretty hard to sneak up on him in his bunk paranoid clones and a man with a shift system in his skull horza shook his head ok go on three yalson said were not mercenaries were a free company actually were just pirates but if thats what kraiklyn wants to call us thats what we are in theory anybody can join so long as they eat the food and breathe the air but in practice hes a bit more selective than that and hed like to be even more so ill bet anyway weve carried out a few contracts mostly protection a couple of escort duties for thirdlevel places whove found themselves caught up in the war but most of the time we just attack and steal wherever we think the confusion caused by the war makes us likely to get away with it thats what were on our way to do at the moment kraiklyn heard about this place called the temple of light on a justaboutlevel three planet in this neck of the woods and he reckons itll be easy in easy out to use one of his favourite expressions according to him its full of priests and treasure we shoot the former and grab the latter then we head for the vavatch orbital before the culture blows it away and we buy something to replace our bow laser i guess the prices should be pretty good if we hang on long enough people will probably be trying to give the stuff away whats happening to vavatch horza asked this wasnt something hed heard about he knew the big orbital was in this part of the war zone but hed thought its condominiumstyle ownership would keep it out of the firing line didnt your idiran friends tell you yalson said she dropped the hand with the outstretched fingers well she said when horza just shrugged as you probably do know the idirans are advancing through the whole inward flank of the gulf the glittercliff the culture seems to be putting up a bit of a fight for a change or at least preparing to it looked like they were going to come to one of their usual understandings and leave vavatch as neutral territory this religious thing the idirans have about planets means they werent really interested in the o as long as the culture didnt try to use it as a base and they promised they wouldnt shit with these big fucking gsvs theyre building these days they dont need bases on os or rings or planets or anything else well all the various types and weirdos on vavatch thought they were going to be just fine thank you and probably do very well out of the galactic firefight going on around them then the idirans announced they were going to take vavatch over after all though only nominally no military presence the culture said they werent having this both sides refused to abandon their precious principles and the culture said ok if you wont back down were going to blow the place away before you get there and thats whats happening before the idiran battle fleets arrive the cultures going to evacuate the whole damn o and then blast it theyre going to evacuate an orbital horza said this really was the first hed heard of any of this the idirans had mentioned nothing about vavatch orbital in the briefings they had given him and even once he was actually impersonating the outworld minister egratin most of what had been coming in from outside had been rumour any idiot could see that the whole volume around the sullen gulf was going to become a battle space hundreds of lightyears across hundreds tall and decades deep at least but exactly what was going on he hadnt been able to find out the war was shifting up a gear indeed still only a lunatic would think of trying to move everybody off an orbital yalson nodded all the same so they say dont ask me where theyre going to pull the ships from for that one but thats what they say theyre going to do theyre crazy horza shook his head yeah well i think they proved that when they went to war in the first place ok sorry go on horza said waving one hand ive forgotten what else i was going to say yalson grinned looking at the three fingers she had extended as though they would give her a clue she looked at horza i think that about covers it id advise you to keep your head down and your mouth shut until we get to marjoin where this temple is and still to keep your head down once we get there come to think of it she laughed and horza found himself laughing with her she nodded and picked up her spoon again assuming you come through ok people will accept you more once youve been in a firefight with them for now youre the baby on the ship no matter what youve done in the past and regardless of zallin horza looked at her doubtfully thinking about attacking anywhere even an undefended temple in a secondhand suit with an unreliable projectile rifle well he sighed spooning more food from his plate so long as you dont all start betting on which way ill fall again yalson looked at him for a second then grinned and went back to her food kraiklyn proved more inquisitive about horzas past despite what yalson had said the man invited horza to his cabin it was neat and tidy with everything stowed and clamped or webbed down and it smelt fresh real books lined one wall and there was an absorber carpet on the floor a model of the cat hung from the ceiling and a big laser rifle was cradled on another wall it looked powerful with a large battery pack and a beamsplitter device on the end of the barrel it gleamed in the soft light of the cabin as though it had been polished sit down kraiklyn said motioning horza to a small seat while he adjusted the single bed to a couch and flopped into it he reached behind to a shelf and picked up two snifflasks he offered one to horza who took it and broke the seal the captain of the clear air turbulence drew deeply on the fumes from his own bowl then sipped a little of the misty liquid horza did the same he recognised the substance but couldnt remember the name it was one of those you could snort and get high on or drink and just be sociable the active ingredients lasted only a few minutes at body temperature and anyway were broken up rather than absorbed by most humanoid digestive tracts thanks horza said well youre looking a lot better than when you came on board kraiklyn said looking at horzas chest and arms the changer had almost resumed his normal shape after four days of rest and heavy eating his trunk and limbs had filled out to something approaching their fairly muscular usual and his belly had grown no larger his skin had tautened and taken on a goldenbrown sheen while his face looked both firmer and yet more supple too his hair was growing in dark from the roots he had cut off the yellowwhite lankness of the gerontocrats sparse locks his venomteeth were also regrowing but they would need another twenty days or so before they could be used i feel better too hmm pity about zallin but im sure you could see my point sure im just glad you gave me the chance some people would have zapped me and thrown me out it crossed my mind kraiklyn said toying with the flask he held but i sensed you werent totally full of crap cant say i believed you about this ageing drug and the idirans at the time but i thought you might make a fight of it mind you you were lucky right he smiled at horza who smiled back kraiklyn looked up at the books on the far wall anyway zallin was sort of dead weight know what i mean he looked back at horza kid hardly knew which end of his rifle to point i was thinking of dropping him from the team next place we hit he took another gulp of the fumes like i say thanks horza was deciding that his first impression of kraiklyn that the man was a shit was more or less correct if he had been going to drop zallin anyway there was no reason for the fight to be to the death horza could have bunked down in the shuttle or the hangar or zallin could have one more person wouldnt have made the cat any more roomy for the time it took to get to marjoin but it wouldnt have been for all that long and they werent going to start using up all the air or anything kraiklyn had just wanted a show im grateful to you horza said and raised the flask towards the captain briefly before inhaling again he studied kraiklyns face carefully so tell me what its like working for these guys with the three legs kraiklyn said smiling and resting one arm on a shelf at the side of the couch bed he raised his eyebrows hmm ahhah thought horza he said i didnt have much time to find out fifty days ago i was still a captain in the marines on sladden dont suppose youve heard of it kraiklyn shook his head horza had been working on his story for the past two days and knew that if kraiklyn did check up he would find there was such a planet its inhabitants were mostly humanoid and it had recently fallen under idiran suzerainty well the idirans were going to execute us because we fought on after the surrender but then i was hauled out and told id live if i did a job for them they said i looked a lot like this old guy they wanted on their side if they removed him would i pretend to be him i thought what the hell what have i got to lose so i ended up on this sorpen place with this ageing drug impersonating a government minister i was doing all right too until this culture woman shows blows my whole bloody act and nearly gets me killed they were just about to bump me off when this idiran cruiser came in to snatch her they rescued me and captured her and they were making their way back to the fleet when they got jumped by a gcu i got stuffed into that suit and thrown overboard to wait for the fleet horza hoped his story didnt sound too rehearsed kraiklyn stared into the flask he held frowning ive been wondering about that he looked at horza why should a cruiser go in by itself when the fleet was just behind it horza shrugged dont really know myself they hardly had time to debrief me before the gcu showed up i guess they must have wanted that culture woman pretty badly and thought if they waited for the fleet to show the gcu would have spotted it picked up the woman and made a run for it kraiklyn nodded looking thoughtful hmm they must have wanted her awful bad did you see her oh i saw her all right before she dropped me in it and afterwards what was she like kraiklyn furrowed his brows and played with the flask again tall thin sort of good looking but offputting as well too damn smart for my liking i dont know not much different from any culture woman ive seen i mean they all look different and so on but she wouldnt have stood out they say theyre pretty special some of these culture agents supposed to be able to do tricks you know all sorts of special adaptations and fancy body chemistry she do anything special you heard of horza shook his head wondering where all this was leading not that i know of he said fancy body chemistry kraiklyn had said was the man starting to guess did he think horza was a culture agent or even a changer kraiklyn was still looking at his drug flask he nodded and said about the only sort of woman id have anything to do with one of these culture ones they say they really do have all these alterations you know kraiklyn looked at horza and winked as he inhaled the drug between the legs the men have these soupedup balls right sort of recirculating and the women have something similar too supposed to be able to come for fucking hours well minutes anyway kraiklyns eyes looked slightly glazed as his voice trailed off horza tried not to appear as scornful as he felt here we go again he thought he tried to count the number of times hed had to listen to people usually from third or low fourthlevel societies usually fairly humanbasic and more often than not male talking in hushed enviously admiring tones about how its more fun in the culture perversely coy for once the culture played down the extent to which those born into it inherited such altered genitalia naturally such modesty only increased everybody elses interest and horza occasionally became angry with humans who exhibited the sort of fawning respect the cultures quasitechnological sexuality so often engendered coming from kraiklyn it didnt surprise him a bit he wondered if the man had had some cheap cultureimitative surgery himself it wasnt uncommon it wasnt safe either too often such alterations were simply plumbing jobs especially on males and made no attempt to uprate the heart and the rest of the circulatory system at least to cope with the increased strain in the culture of course that high performance was genofixed in such mimicking of this symptom of the cultures decadence had quite literally caused a lot of broken hearts i suppose well hear about those wonderful drug glands next horza thought yeah and they have those drug glands kraiklyn went on eyes still unfocused nodding to himself supposed to be able to take a hit of almost anything any time they want just by thinking about it secrete stuff that makes them high kraiklyn stroked the flask he held you know they say you cant rape a culture woman he didnt seem to expect an answer horza stayed silent kraiklyn nodded again yeah theyve got class those women not like some of the shit on this ship he shrugged and took another snort from the flask still horza cleared his throat and leant forward in his seat not looking at kraiklyn shes dead now anyway horza said looking up hmm kraiklyn said absently looking at the changer the culture woman horza said shes dead oh yes kraiklyn nodded then cleared his throat and said so what do you want to do now im sort of expecting you to come along on this temple caper i think you owe us that for the ride oh yeah dont worry horza said good after that well see if you shape up you can stay otherwise well drop you off somewhere you want within reason like they say this operation should be no problem easy in easy out kraiklyn made a dipping flying motion with his flattened hand as though it was the model of the cat which hung somewhere over horzas head then we go to vavatch he took another gulp from the fumes in the snifflask dont suppose you play damage hmm he brought the flask down and horza looked into the predatory eyes through the thin mist rising from the flasks neck he shook his head not one of my vices never really got the chance to learn yeah i guess not its the only game kraiklyn nodded apart from this he smiled and glanced about obviously meaning the ship the people in it and their occupation well kraiklyn said smiling and sitting up i think ive already said welcome aboard but you are welcome he leant forward and tapped horza on the shoulder so long as you realise whos boss eh he smiled widely its your ship horza said he drank what remained of the flasks contents and put it on a shelf beside a portrait holocube which showed kraiklyn standing in his black suit holding the same laser rifle which was mounted on the wall above i think well get on just fine horza you get to know the others and train up and well knock the shit out of these monks what do you say the man winked at him again you bet horza said standing and smiling kraiklyn opened the door for him and for my next trick thought horza as soon as he was out of the cabin and walking down to the mess my impression of captain kraiklyn during the next few days he indeed got to know the rest of the crew he talked to those who wanted to talk and he observed or carefully overheard things about those who didnt yalson was still his only friend but he got on well enough with his roommate wubslin though the stocky engineer was quiet and when not eating or working usually asleep the bratsilakins had apparently decided that horza probably wasnt against them but they seemed to be reserving their opinion about whether he was for them until marjoin and the temple of light dorolow was the name of the religious woman who roomed with yalson she was plump fair skinned and fair haired and her huge ears curved down to join onto her cheeks she spoke in a very high squeaky voice which she said was pretty low as far as she was concerned and her eyes watered a lot her movements were fluttery and nervous the oldest person in the company was aviger a smallish weatherbeaten man with brown skin and little hair he could do surprisingly supple things with his legs and arms like clasp his hands behind his back and bring them over his head without letting go he shared a cabin with a man named jandraligeli a tall thin middleaged mondlidician who wore the scarmarks from his homeworld on his forehead with unrepentant pride and a look of perpetual disdain he ignored horza devoutly but yalson said he did this with every new recruit jandraligeli spent a lot of time keeping his old but wellmaintained suit and laser rifle clean and sparkling gow and keealsorofus were the two women who kept themselves so much to themselves and were alleged to do things when alone in their cabin which seemed to annoy the less tolerant of the company males that is most of them both women were fairly young and had a rather poor grasp of marain horza thought maybe that was all that kept them so isolated but it turned out they were pretty shy anyway they were of average height medium build and sharpfeatured in grey skin with eyes that were pools of black horza thought perhaps it was just as well they didnt look at people straight too often with those eyes it could be an unsettling experience mipp was a fat sombre man with jetblack skin he could pilot the ship manually when kraiklyn wasnt aboard and the company needed close support on the ground or he could take over at the shuttle controls he was supposed to be a good shot too with a plasma cannon or rapid projectile rifle but he was prone to binges getting dangerously drunk on a variety of poisonous liquids he procured from the autogalley once or twice horza heard him throwing up in the next stall in the heads mipp shared a cabin with another drunkard called neisin who was more sociable and sang a lot he had or had convinced himself he had something terrible to forget and although he drank more steadily and regularly than mipp sometimes when hed had a bit more than usual he would go very quiet and then start crying in great sucking sobs he was small and wiry and horza wondered where he put all the drink and where all the tears came from inside his compact shaved head perhaps there was some sort of short circuit between his throat and his tear ducts tzbalik odraye was the ships selfstyled computer ace because he and mipp together could in theory have overridden the fidelities kraiklyn had programmed into the cats nonsentient computer and then flown off in the ship they were never allowed to stay on the craft together when kraiklyn wasnt aboard in fact odraye wasnt that well versed in computers at all as horza discovered through a little close but apparently casual questioning however the tall slightly hunchbacked man with the long yellowskinned face probably knew just about enough horza reckoned to handle anything that went wrong with the ships brains which seemed to have been designed for durability rather than philosophical finesse tzbalik odraye roomed with rava gamdol who looked as though he came from the same place as yalson judging from his skin and light fur but he denied this yalson was vague on the subject and neither liked the other rava was another recluse he had boarded off the tiny space around his top bunk and installed some small lights and an air fan sometimes he spent days at a time in this small space going in with a container of water and coming out with another full of urine tzbalik odraye did his best to ignore his roommate and always vigorously denied blowing the smoke from the pungent cifetressi weed which he smoked through the ventilation holes of ravas tiny cubicle the final cabin was shared by lenipobra and lamm lenipobra was the youngster of the company a gangly youth with a stutter and garish red hair he had a tattooed tongue which he was very proud of and would display at every possible opportunity the tattoo of a human female was in every sense crude lenipobra was the cats best excuse for a medic and was rarely seen without a small screenbook which contained one of the more uptodate panhuman medical textbooks he proudly showed this to horza including a few of the moving pages one of which showed in vivid colour the basic techniques for treating deep laser burns in the most common forms of digestive tracts lenipobra thought it looked like great fun horza made a mental note to try even harder not to get shot in the temple of light lenipobra had very long and skinny arms and spent about a quarter of each day going about on all fours though whether this was entirely natural to his species or merely affectation horza could not discover lamm was rather below average height but very muscular and dense looking he had double eyebrows and small horngrafts the latter stuck out from his thinning but very dark hair above a face he usually did his best to make aggressive and threatening he did comparatively little talking between operations and when he did talk it was usually about battles he had been in people he had killed weapons he had used and so on lamm considered himself secondincommand on the ship despite kraiklyns policy of treating everybody else as equals every now and again lamm would remind people not to give him any problems he was well armed and deadly and his suit even had a nuclear device in it which he said he would set off sooner than be captured the inference he seemed to hope people would make was that if they upset him he might just set off this fabled nuke in a fit of pique what the hell are you looking at me for lamms voice said in amongst the storm of static as horza sat in the shuttle shaking and rattling inside his toobig suit horza realised he had been looking across at the other man who was directly opposite he touched the mike button on his neck and said thinking about something else i dont want you looking at me us all got to look somewhere horza said jokingly to the man in the mattblack suit and greyvisored helmet the black suit made a gesture with the hand not holding a laser rifle well dont fucking look at me horza let his hand drop from his neck he shook his head inside the suit helmet it fitted so badly it didnt move on the outside he stared at the section of fuselage above lamms head they were going to attack the temple of light kraiklyn was at the controls of the shuttle bringing it in low over the forests of marjoin still covered in night heading for the line of dawn breaking over the packed and steaming greenery the plan was that the cat would come back in towards the planet with the sun very low behind it using its effectors on any electronics the temple did have and making as much noise and as many flashes as it could with its secondary lasers and a few blast bombs while this diversion was absorbing any defensive capacity the priests might have the shuttle would either head straight for the temple and let everybody off or if there was any hostile reaction land in the forest on the night side of the temple and disgorge its small force of suited troops there the company would then disperse and if they had the facility use their ag to fly to the temple or as in horzas case just crawl creep walk or run as best they could for the collection of low slopesided buildings and short towers which made up the temple of light horza couldnt believe they were going in without some sort of reconnaissance but kraiklyn when tackled on this point during the preop briefing in the hangar had insisted that that might mean giving up the element of surprise he had accurate maps of the place and a good battle plan as long as everybody stuck to the plan nothing would go wrong the monks werent total idiots and the planet had been contacted and doubtless knew about the war going on around it so just in case the sect had hired any overhead observation it was wiser not to attempt a looksee which might give the game away anyway temples didnt change much horza and several of the others hadnt been very impressed with this reading of the situation but there was nothing they could do so here they all sat sweating and nervous and being shaken up like the ingredients of a cocktail in this clappedout shuttle slamming into a potentially hostile atmosphere at hypersonic speeds horza sighed and checked his rifle again like his antique armour the rifle was old and unreliable it had jammed twice when he tested it on the ship using dummy shells its magnetic propulsor seemed to work reasonably but judging by the erratic spread of the bullets its rifling field was next to useless the shells were big at least sevenmillimetre calibre and three times that long and the gun could hold only fortyeight at a time and fire them no faster than eight a second incredibly the huge bullets werent even explosive they were solid lumps of metal nothing else to top it all the weapons sight was out a red haze filled the small screen when it was turned on horza sighed were about three hundred metres above the trees now kraiklyns voice said from the shuttle flight deck doing about one and a half sounds the cats just started its runin about another two minutes i can see the dawn good luck all the voice crackled and died in horzas helmet speaker a few of the suited figures exchanged glances horza looked over at yalson sitting on the other side of the shuttle about three metres away but her visor was mirrored he couldnt tell if she was looking at him or not he wanted to say something to her but didnt want to bother her over the open circuit in case she was concentrating preparing herself beside yalson dorolow sat her gloved hand making the circle of flame sign over the top of her helmet visor horza tapped his hands on the old rifle and blew through his mouth at the mist of condensation forming on the top edge of his visor it made it worse just as he thought it might perhaps he should open his visor now that they were inside the planets atmosphere the shuttle shook suddenly as though it had clipped the top of a mountain everybody was thrown forward straining their seat harnesses and a couple of guns went sailing forward and up to clatter off the shuttle ceiling before slamming back to the deck people grabbed for the guns and horza closed his eyes he wouldnt have been at all surprised if one of these enthusiasts had left their safety catch off however the guns were retrieved without mishap and people sat cradling them and looking about what the hell was that the old man aviger said and laughed nervously the shuttle began some hard manoeuvring throwing first one half of the group on their backs while the people on the other side were suspended by their seat webbing then flipping in the other direction and reversing the postures grunts and curses came over the open channel into horzas helmet the shuttle dipped making horzas stomach feel empty floating then the craft steadied again bit of hostile fire kraiklyns clipped tones announced and all the suited heads started to look from side to side what hostile fire i knew it ohoh fuck why did i think as soon as i heard those fateful words easy in easy out that this was going began jandraligeli in a bored knowing drawl only to be cut off by lamm hostile fucking fire thats all we need hostile fucking fire they are gunned up lenipobra said shit who isnt these days yalson said chicelhorhava sweet lady save us all muttered dorolow speeding up the tracings of the circle over her visor shut the fuck up lamm told her lets hope mipp can distract them without getting his ass blown off yalson said maybe we should call it off rava gamdol said think we ought to call it off do you think we should call it off does anybody no yes no shouted three voices almost in unison everybody looked at the three bratsilakins the two outer bratsilakins turned their helmets to look at the one in the middle as the shuttle swooped again the middle bratsilakins helmet turned briefly to each side oh shit a voice said over the open channel all right no i think maybe we should rava gamdols voice started again then kraiklyn shouted here we go everybody ready the shuttle braked hard banking steeply one way then the other shuddering once and dipping it bounced and shook and for a second horza thought they were crashing but then the craft slid to a stop and the rear doors jawed open horza was on his feet with the rest of them piling out of the shuttle and into the jungle they were in a clearing at its far end a few branches and twigs were still tumbling from huge heavylooking trees where the shuttle had just seconds before torn through the edge of the forest canopy as it dipped in for the small area of level grassy ground horza had time to see a couple of bright birds flying fast out of the trees near by and caught a glimpse of a bluepink sky then he was running with the others round the front of the shuttle where it still glowed dark red and vegetation beneath it smouldered and on into the jungle a few of the company were using their ag floating over the undergrowth between the mosscovered tree trunks but hampered by creepers which hung like thick flowerstrewn ropes between the trees so far they still couldnt see the temple of light but according to kraiklyn it was just ahead of them horza looked round at the others on foot as they clambered over fallen trees covered in moss and swept past creepers and suspended roots fuck dispersing this is too hard going it was lamms voice horza looked round and up and saw the black suit heading vertically for the green mass of foliage above them bastard said a breathless voice yeah bbbastard lenipobra agreed lamm kraiklyn said you son of a bitch dont break through up there spread out disperse damn it then a shock wave horza could feel through his suit blasted over them all horza hit the ground immediately and lay there another boom came through the hissing helmet speaker as it fed in the noise from outside that was the cat going over he didnt recognise the voice you sure somebody else i saw it through the trees it was the cat horza got up and started running again black bastard nearly took my fucking head off lamm said there was light ahead of horza through the trunks and leaves he heard some firing the sharp crack of projectiles the sucking whoop of lasers and the snapwhooshcrash of plasma cannon he ran to a small earth and shrub bank and threw himself down so that he could just see over the top sure enough there was the temple of light silhouetted against the dawn all covered in vines and creepers and moss with a few spires and towers sticking out above like angular tree trunks there she is kraiklyn shouted horza looked along the earth bank and saw a few of the company in the same prone position as he was wubslin aviger kraiklyn shouted cover us with the plasmas neisin you keep the micro on each side of the grounds beyond as well everybody else follow me more or less as one they were off over the tangled bank of mossy ground and bushes and down the other side through light scrub and long canelike grass the stalks covered in clinging dark green moss the mixture of ground cover came up to about chest height and made the going difficult but it would be reasonably easy to duck down out of a line of fire horza waded through as best as he could plasma bolts sang through the air above them lighting the dim stretch of ground between them and the sloping temple wall distant fountains of earth and crashes he could feel through his feet told horza that neisin sober the last two days was laying down a convincing and more importantly accurate fire pattern with the microhowitzer theres a little gunfire from the upper left level the cool unhurried voice of jandraligeli said according to the plan he was supposed to be hiding high in the forest canopy watching the temple im hitting it now shit somebody yelled suddenly one of the women horza could hear firing from ahead though there were no flashes from the part of the temple he could see ha ha jandraligelis smug voice came through the helmet speaker got them horza saw a puff of smoke over to the left of the temple he was about halfway there by now maybe closer he could see some of the others not far away to his left and right pushing and striding through the cane grass and bushes with their rifles held high to one shoulder they were all gradually getting covered in the dark green moss which horza supposed might be useful as camouflage providing of course that it didnt turn out to be some horrible previously undiscovered sentient killermoss he told himself to stop being silly loud crashes in the shrubbery around him and smashed bits of cane and twigs fluttering past like nervous birds sent him diving for the ground the earth beneath him shuddered he rolled over and saw flames lick the mossy stalks above a flickering patch of fire lay directly behind him horza a voice said yalsons ok he said he got up to a crouch and started running through the grass past bushes and young trees were coming in now yalson said she was up in the trees too along with lamm jandraligeli and neisin according to the plan all except neisin and jandraligeli would now start moving through the air on ag towards the temple although the antigravity units on their suits gave them an extra dimension to work with they could be something of a mixed blessing while a figure in the air tended to be harder to hit than one on the ground it also tended to attract a lot more fire the only other person in the company with ag was kraiklyn but he said he preferred to use his for surprise or in emergencies so he was still on the ground with the rest of them im at the walls horza thought it was odrayes voice this looks all right the walls are really easy the moss makes it horzas helmet speaker crackled he wasnt sure if there was something wrong with his communicator or if something had happened to odraye ver me while im on you useless voices clashed in horzas helmet he kept wading through the cane grass and thumped the side of his helmet asshole the helmet speaker buzzed then went silent horza swore and stopped crouching down he fumbled with the communicator controls at the side of the helmet trying to coax the speaker back into life his toobig gloves hindered him the speaker stayed silent he cursed again and got to his feet pushing through the scrub and long grass to the temple wall rojectiles inside a voice yelled suddenly this cking simple he couldnt identify the voice and the speaker went dead again immediately he arrived at the base of the wall it slanted out of the scrub at about forty degrees and was covered in moss further along two of the company were clambering up it almost at the top about seven metres above horza saw a flying figure weaving through the air and disappearing over the parapet he started climbing the clumsily large suit made it more difficult than it should have been but he got to the top without falling and jumped down from the parapet onto a broad wallwalk a similar mosscovered wall sloped up to the next storey to horzas right the wall turned a corner beneath a stubby tower to his left the wallwalk seemingly disappeared into a blank crosswall according to kraiklyns plan horza was supposed to head along that way there ought to be a door there horza jogged along towards the blank wall a helmet bobbed up from the side of the sloped wall horza started to duck and swerve just in case but first an arm waved from the same place then both helmet and arm appeared and he recognised the woman gow horza threw back the visor on his helmet as he ran getting a faceful of junglescented marjoin air he could hear some rattling projectile fire from inside the temple and the distant thud of an exploding microhowitzer round he ran up to a narrow entrance cut in the sloped wall half covered by streamers of mossy growth gow was kneeling gun ready on the splintered remains of a heavy wooden door which had blocked the passageway beyond horza knelt beside her and pointed at his helmet my communicators out whats been happening gow touched a button on her wrist and her suit pa said ok so far no hurts they on towers she pointed up them no fly go in they enemy got projectile guns only them fall back she nodded and kept glancing round through the doorway and into the dark passageway beyond horza nodded too gow tapped his arm i tell kraiklyn you go in yes yeah tell him my communicators out ok yeah sure zallin same trouble had you be safe ok yeah you be safe too horza said he stood up and entered the temple scuffing over splinters of wood and fragments of sandstone scattered over the moss by the doors demolition the dark corridor branched three ways he turned back to gow and pointed centre corridor correct the crouched figure silhouetted against the light of the dawn nodded and said yeah sure go middle horza set off the corridor was covered in moss every few metres dim yellow electric lights burned from the walls casting murky pools of light which the dark moss seemed to absorb softwalled spongefloored the narrow passage made horza shiver though it wasnt cold he checked that his gun was ready to fire he could hear no other sound apart from his own breathing he came to a tjunction in the corridor and took the righthand branch some steps appeared and he ran up them stumbling once as his feet tried to run out of his oversized boots he put his hand out and jarred his arm on the step some moss came off the step and he caught a glimpse of something glinting underneath in the dull yellow light cast by the wall lights he recovered his balance shaking his jarred arm as he continued up the steps and wondering why the temples builders had made the steps out of what looked like glass at the top of the steps he went down a short corridor then up another flight of stairs curving to the right and unlit considering its name horza thought the temple was remarkably dark he came out onto a small balcony the monks cloak was dark the same colour as the moss and horza didnt see him until the pale face turned towards him along with the gun horza threw himself to one side against the wall to his left and fired his gun from the hip at the same time the monks gun jerked upwards and let loose a fusillade of rapid fire at the ceiling as he collapsed the shots echoed round the dark empty space beyond the small balcony horza squatted by the wall gun pointed at the dark crumpled figure only a couple of metres away he raised his head and in the gloom saw what was left of the monks face then relaxed slightly the man was dead horza levered himself away from the wall and knelt by the balcony balustrade now he could see a large hall in the dim light of the few small globes which protruded from its roof the balcony was about halfway up and along one of the longer walls and from what he could see there was some sort of stage or altar at one end of the hall the light was so dim he couldnt be sure but he thought he saw shadowy figures on the floor of the hall moving he wondered if it was the company and tried to recall seeing other doors or corridors on his way to the balcony he was supposed to be down there on that level on the floor of the hall he cursed his useless communicator and decided he would have to risk shouting down to the people in the hall he leant forward some shards of glass had fallen from the roof where it had been hit by the monks gun and his suited knee crunched on the debris before he could open his mouth to shout down into the hall he heard noises from beneath a highpitched voice speaking a language of squeaks and clicks he went still said nothing it might just have been dorolows voice he supposed but why would she talk in anything other than marain the voice called again he thought he heard another but then laser and projectile fire erupted briefly from the opposite end of the hall from the altar he ducked and in the lull heard something click behind him he spun round tightening his finger on the trigger but there was nobody there instead a small round thing about the size of a childs clenched fist wobbled on the top of the balustrade and plonked down onto the moss about a metre away he kicked at it with his foot and dived across the body of the dead monk the grenade detonated in midair just under the balcony horza jumped up while the echoes were still cracking back from the altar he leapt into the doorway at the far end of the balcony putting out one hand and grabbing the soft corner of the wall as he went past spinning himself round as he fell to his knees he reached out and grabbed the dead monks gun from the corpses slack grip just as the balcony started to come away from the wall with a glassy grinding noise horza shoved himself back into the corridor behind him the balcony tipped bodily away into the empty space of the hall in a dully glittering cloud of fragments and fell with a great shattering crash onto the floor below taking the shadowy form of the dead monk fluttering with it horza saw more of the shapes scatter in the darkness beneath him and fired down with the gun he had just acquired then he turned and looked down the corridor he was now in wondering if there was some way down to the hall floor or even back outside he checked the gun he had taken it looked better than his own he crouched and ran away from the doorway looking over the hall putting his old rifle over his shoulder the dimly lit corridor curved right horza straightened gradually as he left the doorway behind and stopped worrying about grenades then it all started to happen in the hall behind him the first thing he knew was that his shadow was being thrown in front of him flickering and dancing on the curving wall of the passage then a cacophony of noise and a stuttering burst of blast waves rocked him on his feet and assaulted his ears he brought the helmet visor down quickly and crouched again as he turned back towards the hall and the bright flashes of light even through the helmet he thought he could hear screams mixed in with the gunfire and explosions he ran back and threw himself down where he had been before lying looking out into the hall he put his head down as fast as he could and used his elbows to lever himself back the instant he realised what was happening he wanted to run but he lay where he was stuck the dead monks rifle round the corner of the doorway and sprayed fire in the general direction of the altar until the weapon stopped firing keeping his helmet as far back from the doorway as possible visor turned away when that gun stopped he threw it away and used his own until it jammed he slid himself away after that and ran off down the corridor away from the opening of the hall he didnt doubt that the rest of the company would be doing the same thing those that could what he had seen ought to have been incredible but although he had looked only long enough for a single hardly moving image to form on his retinas he knew what he was seeing and what was happening as he ran he tried to work out why the hell the temple of light had been laserproofed when he came to a tjunction in the corridor he stopped he swung his rifle butt at the corner of the wall through the moss the metal connected doubtless denting but he felt something else give too using the weak light from the suit torch cells on either side of the visor he looked at what lay underneath the moss oh god he breathed to himself he struck at another part of the wall and looked again he remembered the glint of what hed thought was glass under the moss on the stairs when hed jarred his arm and the crunching feeling under his knee on the balcony he leant against the soft wall feeling sick nobody had gone to the extraordinary lengths of laserproofing an entire temple or even one large hall it would have been horrendously expensive and surely unnecessary on a stagethree planet anyway no probably the whole interior of the temple he recalled the sandstone to which the outer door had been attached had been built from blocks of crystal and that was what was buried under all the moss hit it with a laser and the moss would vaporise in an instant leaving the interior surfaces of the crystal beneath to reflect the rest of that pulse and any subsequent shots falling on the same place he looked again at the second place hed struck with the gun looked deep into the transparent surface beyond and saw his own suit lights shining dully back at him from a mirrored boundary somewhere inside he pushed himself away and ran down the righthand branch of the corridor past heavy wooden doors then down some curved steps towards a splash of light what he had seen in the hall was chaos lit with lasers a single glimpse coinciding with several flashes had burned an image into his eyes he thought he could still half see at one end of the hall on the altar monks were crouched guns firing their own guns flashing with chemicalexplosive fire around them burst dark explosions of smoke as moss vaporised at the other end of the hall several of the company stood or lay or staggered their own shadows huge on the wall behind them they were loosing off with everything they had rifles strobing pulses off the far wall and they were being hit by their own shots slamming back from the internal surfaces of crystal blocks they didnt even realise they were aiming at at least two were blind already judging by the way they were caught in poses of sightless blundering arms out in front of them guns firing from one hand horza knew too well that his own suit his visor especially was not capable of stopping a laser hit from either visible wavelength guns or xrays all he could do was get his head out of the way and loose off with what projectiles he had hoping to get a few of the priests or their guards he had probably been lucky he hadnt been hit even in the brief length of time hed looked into the hall now all he could do was get out he tried shouting into the helmet mike but the communicator was dead his voice sounded hollow in the suit and he couldnt hear himself through the ear speaker he saw another shadowy shape ahead a dim silhouette crouched low against the wall in the pool of daylight coming from another corridor horza threw himself into a doorway the figure didnt move he tried his rifle its knocks on the crystal walls seemed to have unjammed it a burst of fire made the figure collapse slackly to the floor horza stepped out of the doorway and walked to it it was another monk dead hand gripped round a pistol his white face was visible in the light which came down another passageway on the wall behind the monk there were the pockmarks of burnedoff moss clear undamaged crystal showed through beneath as well as the holes produced by horzas burst of fire the monks tunic now seeping with bright red blood was covered with laser burns horza stuck his head round the corner looking into the light against the morning glow framed in a slanting doorway a suited form lay on the mossy floor gun extended at the end of one hand so that it pointed down the passageway towards horza a heavy door lay at an angle behind just hanging by one twisted hinge its gow horza thought then he looked at the door again thinking it looked wrong somehow the door and the walls leading to it were scarred with laser burns he went up the corridor to the fallen figure and rolled it over so that he could see the face his head swam for a second as he looked it wasnt gow it was her friend keealsorofus who had died here her blackened cracked face stared out dryeyed through the still clear visor of her helmet he looked at the door and at the corridor of course he was in another part of the temple same situation but a different set of passageways and a different person the womans suit was holed centimetres deep in a few places the smell of burned flesh leaked into horzas illfitting suit making him gag he stood up took keealsorofuss laser stepped over the slanted door and went out onto the wallwalk he ran along it round a corner ducking once as a microhowitzer shell landed too close to the temples sloping walls and sent up a shower of flashing crystal fragments and ruddy chunks of sandstone the plasma cannons were still firing from the forest too but horza couldnt see any flying figures he was looking for them when he suddenly sensed the suit to one side of him standing in the angle of the wall he stopped recognising gows suit and stood about three metres from her while she looked at him she pushed the visor on her helmet up slowly her grey face and black pitlike eyes fixed on the laser rifle he was carrying the look on her face made him wish he had checked the gun was still switched on he looked down at the gun in his hand then at the woman who was still staring at it i he was going to explain she killed yeah the womans voice sounded flat she seemed to sigh horza drew in a breath was about to start talking again but gow spoke in the same monotone i thought i hear she suddenly she brought her gun hand up flashing in the blue and pink of the morning sky horza saw what she was doing and started forward reaching out instantly with one hand even though he knew he was too far away and too late to do anything dont he had time to shout but the gun was already in the womans mouth and an instant later as horza started to duck and his eyes closed instinctively the back of gows helmet blew out in a single pulse of unseen light throwing a sudden red cloud over the mossy wall behind horza sat down on his haunches hands closed round the gun barrel in front of him eyes staring out at the distant jungle what a mess he thought what a fucking obscene stupid mess he hadnt been thinking of what gow had just done to herself but he looked round at the red stain on the angled wall and the collapsed shape of gows suit and thought it again he was about to start back down the outer wall of the temple when something moved in the air above him he turned and saw yalson landing on the wallwalk she looked at gows body once then they exchanged what they both knew of the situation what she had heard over the open communicator channel what horza had seen in the hall and decided they would stay put until some of the others came out or they gave up hope according to yalson only rava gamdol and tzbalik odraye were definitely dead after the firefight in the hall but all three bratsilakins had been there too and nobody had heard anything from them after the open channel had become intelligible again and most of the screaming had stopped kraiklyn was alive and well but lost dorolow lost too sitting crying maybe blinded and lenipobra against all advice and kraiklyns orders had entered the temple through a roof door and was heading down to try to rescue anybody he could using only a small projectile pistol hed been carrying yalson and horza sat back to back on the wallwalk yalson keeping the changer informed on how things were going in the temple lamm flew overhead heading for the jungle where he took one of the plasma cannons from the protesting wubslin he had just landed near by when lenipobra announced proudly he had found dorolow and kraiklyn reported he could see daylight there was still no sound from the bratsilakins kraiklyn appeared round a corner of the wallwalk lenipobra leapt into view clutching dorolow to his suit and bounding down over the walls in a series of great slow jumps as his ag struggled to lift both him and the woman they set off back to the shuttle jandraligeli could see movement on the road beyond the temple and there was sniper fire coming from the jungle on either side lamm wanted to tear into the temple with the plasma cannon and vaporise a few monks but kraiklyn ordered the retreat lamm threw the plasma gun down and sailed off towards the shuttle alone swearing loudly over the open channel on which yalson was still trying to call the bratsilakins they waded through the tall cane grass and bushes under the whooshing trails of plasma bolts as jandraligeli gave them cover they had to duck occasionally as smallbore projectile fire tore through the greenery around them they sprawled in the hangar of the clear air turbulence beside the still warm shuttle as it clicked and creaked cooling down again after its highspeed climb through the atmosphere nobody wanted to talk they just sat or lay on the deck some with their backs against the side of the warm shuttle those who had been inside the temple were the most obviously affected but even the others who had only heard the mayhem over their suit communicators seemed in a state of mild shock helmets and guns lay scattered about them temple of light jandraligeli said eventually and gave what sounded like a mixture of laugh and snort temple of fucking light lamm agreed mipp kraiklyn said in a tired voice to his helmet any signals from the bratsilakins mipp still on the cats small bridge reported that there was nothing we ought to bomb that place to fuck lamm said nuke the bastards nobody replied yalson got up slowly and left the hangar walking tiredly up the steps to the upper deck helmet dangling from one arm gun from the other her head down im afraid weve lost that radar wubslin closed an inspection hatch and rolled out from underneath the nose of the shuttle that first bit of hostile fire his voice trailed off least nobodys injured neisin said he looked at dorolow your eyes better the woman nodded but kept her eyes closed neisin nodded too actually worse when people are injured we were lucky he dug into a small pack on the front of his suit and produced a little metal container he sucked at a nipple at the top and grimaced shaking his head yeah we were lucky and it was fairly quick for them too he nodded to himself not looking at anybody not caring that nobody seemed to be listening to him see how everybody weve lost all shared the same i mean they went in pairs or threes huh he took another slug and shook his head dorolow was near by she reached over and held out her hand neisin looked at her in surprise then handed the small flask to her she took a swig and passed it back neisin looked around but no one else wanted any horza sat and said nothing he was staring at the cold lights of the hangar trying not to see the scene he had witnessed in the hall of the dark temple the clear air turbulence broke orbit on fusion drive and headed for the outer edge of marjoins gravity well where it could engage its warp motors it didnt pick up any signals from the bratsilakins and it didnt bomb the temple of light it set a course for the vavatch orbital from radio transmissions they had picked up from the planet they worked out what had happened to the place what had caused the monks and priests in the temple to be so well armed two nation states on the world of marjoin were at war and the temple was near the frontier between the two countries constantly ready for attack one of the states was vaguely socialist the other was religiously inspired the priests in the temple of light representing one sect of that militant faith the war was partly caused by the greater galactic conflict taking place around it as well as being a tiny and approximate image of it it was that reflection horza realised which had killed the members of the company as much as any bounced laserflash horza wasnt sure how he would sleep that night he lay awake for a few hours listening to wubslin having quiet nightmares then the cabin door was tapped lightly yalson came in and sat on horzas bunk she put her head on his shoulder and they held each other after a while she took his hand and led him quietly down the companionway away from the mess where a splash of light and distant music witnessed that the unsleeping kraiklyn was unwinding with a drug flask and a holosound tape down to the cabin which had been gows and keealsorofuss in the darkness of the cabin on a small bed full of strange scents and new textures they performed the same old act theirs they both knew an almost inevitably barren crossmatching of species and cultures thousands of lightyears apart then they slept state of play one fal ngeestra watched the shadows of the clouds move on the distant plain ten kilometres away horizontally and one vertically and then with a sigh lifted her gaze to the line of snowcapped mountains on the far side of the open grassland the mountain range was fully thirty kilometres from her eyes but the peaks were sharp and distinct in the thin air which they invaded with their rock and brilliant icy whiteness even at that distance through that much atmosphere their glare startled the eye she turned away walking along the broad flagstones of the lodge terrace with a stifflegged gait unsuited to her lack of years the trelliswork above her head was covered in bright red and white flowers and cast a regular pattern of shadows over the terrace beneath she walked through light and shade her hair dim then shining gold in turn as each halting step moved her from shadow to sunlight the gunmetal bulk of the drone called jase appeared at the far end of the terrace out of the lodge itself fal smiled when she saw it and sat down on a stone bench jutting out from the low wall which separated terrace from view they were high up but it was a hot and windless day she wiped a little sweat from her forehead as the old drone floated along the terrace towards her the slanting lines of sunlight passing over its body in a steady rhythm the drone settled on the stones beside the bench its broad flat top about level with the crown of the girls head isnt it a lovely day jase fal said looking back at the distant mountains again it is jase said the drone had an unusually deep and fulltoned voice and made the most of it for a thousand years or more culture drones had had aura fields which coloured according to their mood their equivalent of facial expression and body language but jase was old made long before aura fields were thought of and had refused to be refitted to accommodate them it preferred either to rely on its voice to express what it felt or to remain inscrutable damn fal shook her head looking at the faraway snow i wish i was climbing she made a clicking noise with her mouth and looked down at her right leg which stuck straight out in front of her she had broken the leg eight days before while climbing in the mountains on the other side of the plain now it was splinted up with a fine tracery of fieldstrands concealed beneath fashionably tight trousers jase ought she thought to have taken this as an excuse to lecture her again on the advisability of only climbing with a floater harness or with a rescue drone near by or at the very least on not climbing alone but the old machine said nothing she looked at it her tanned face shining in the light so jase what have you got for me business im afraid so fal settled herself as comfortably as she could on the stone bench and crossed her arms jase stretched out a short force field from its casing to support the awkwardlooking outstretched leg though it knew that the splints own fields were taking all the strain spit it out fal said you may recall an item from the daily synopsis eighteen days ago about one of our spacecraft which was cobbled together by a factory vessel in the volume of space inside from the sullen gulf the factory craft had to destruct and later so did the ship it made i remember said fal who forgot little about anything and nothing at all from a daily synopsis it was a mongrel because the factory was trying to get a gsv mind out of the way well jase said its voice a little weary we have a problem with that fal smiled the culture there could be no doubt relied profoundly on its machines for both its strategy and tactics in the war it was now engaged in indeed a case could be made for holding that the culture was its machines that they represented it at a more fundamental level than did any single human or group of humans within the society the minds that the cultures factory craft safe orbitals and larger gsvs were now producing were some of the most sophisticated collections of matter in the galaxy they were so intelligent that no human was capable of understanding just how smart they were and the machines themselves were incapable of describing it to such a limited form of life from those mental colossi down through the more ordinary but still sentient machines and the smart but ultimately mechanistic and predictable computers right down to the smallest circuit in a micromissile hardly more intelligent than a fly the culture had placed its bets long before the idiran war had been envisaged on the machine rather than the human brain this was because the culture saw itself as being a selfconsciously rational society and machines even sentient ones were more capable of achieving this desired state as well as more efficient at using it once they had that was good enough for the culture besides it left the humans in the culture free to take care of the things that really mattered in life such as sport games romance studying dead languages barbarian societies and impossible problems and climbing high mountains without the aid of a safety harness a hostile reading of such a situation might lead to the idea that the discovery by the cultures minds that some humans were actually capable of matching and occasionally beating their record for accurately assessing a given set of facts would lead to machine indignation and blown circuits but this was not the case it fascinated those minds that such a puny and chaotic collection of mental faculties could by some sleight of neuron produce an answer to a problem which was as good as theirs there was an explanation of course and it perhaps had something to do with patterns of cause and effect which even the almost godlike power of the minds had difficulty trying to fathom it also had quite a lot to do with sheer weight of numbers there were in excess of eighteen trillion people in the culture just about every one of them well nourished extensively educated and mentally alert and only thirty or forty of them had this unusual ability to forecast and assess on a par with a wellinformed mind of which there were already many hundreds of thousands it was not impossible that this was pure luck toss eighteen trillion coins in the air for a while and a few of them are going to keep landing the same side up for a long long time fal ngeestra was a culture referer one of those thirty maybe forty out of the eighteen trillion who could give you an intuitive idea of what was going to happen or tell you why she thought that something which had already happened had happened the way it did and almost certainly turn out right every time she was being handed problems and ideas constantly being both used and assessed herself nothing she said or did went unrecorded nothing she experienced went unnoticed she did insist however that when she was climbing alone or with friends she must be left to her own devices and not watched by the cultures she would take a pocket terminal with her to record everything but she would not have a realtime link with any part of the mind network on the plate she lived on because of that insistence she had lain in the snow with a shattered leg for a day and a night before a search party had discovered her the drone jase started to give her the details of the flight of the nameless ship from its mothercraft of its interception and selfdestruction fal had turned her head though and was only half listening her eyes and mind were on the distant snowy slopes where she hoped she would be climbing again in a few days time once these stupid bones in her leg had thoroughly healed the mountains were beautiful there were other mountains on the up slope side of the lodge terrace reaching into the clear blue sky but they were tame stuff indeed compared to those sharp rearing peaks across the plain she knew that was why they had put her in this lodge they hoped she would climb those nearer mountains rather than take the trouble to hop into a flyer and head over the plain it was a silly idea though they had to let her see the mountains or she wouldnt be herself and as long as she could see them she just had to climb them idiots on a planet she thought you wouldnt be able to see them so well you wouldnt be able to see the lower foothills the way the mountains rise from the plain just so the lodge the terrace the mountains and the plain were on an orbital humans had built this place or at least built the machines that built the machines that well you could go on and on the plate of the orbital was almost perfectly flat in fact vertically it was slightly concave but as the internal diameter of the completed orbital properly formed only once all the individual plates had been joined up and the last dividing wall was removed would measure over three million kilometres the curvature was a great deal less than on the convex surface of any humanhabitable globe so from fals raised vantage point she could see right to the base of the distant mountains fal thought it must be very strange to live on a planet and have to look over a curve so that for example you would see the top of a seaship appear over the horizon before the rest of it she was suddenly aware that she was thinking about planets because of something jase had just said she turned round and looked earnestly at the dark grey machine playing back her shortterm memory to recall exactly what it had just said this mind went underneath the planet in hyperspace she said then warped inside that was what it said it was trying to do when it sent the coded message in its destruct pattern as the planet is still there it must have succeeded had it failed at least half a per cent of its mass would have reacted with the planets own material as though it was antimatter i see fal scratched at one cheek with a finger i thought that wasnt supposed to be possible her voice contained the question she looked at jase what it said doing she scowled at not being immediately understood and waved one hand impatiently doing what it did going under something so big in hyperspace and then bouncing over i was told even we couldnt do that so was the mind in question but it was desperate the general war council itself decided that we should try to duplicate the feat using a similar mind and a spare planet what happened fal asked grinning at the idea of a spare planet no mind would even consider the idea far too dangerous even the eligible ones on the war council demurred fal laughed gazing up at the red and white flowers curled round the trelliswork overhead jase which deep down was a hopeless romantic thought her laughter sounded like the tinkling of mountain streams and always recorded her laughs for itself even when they were snorts or guffaws even when she was being rude and it was a dirty laugh jase knew a machine even a sentient one could not die of shame but it also knew that it would do just that if fal ever guessed any of this fal stopped laughing she said what does this thing actually look like i mean you never see them by themselves theyre always in something a ship or whatever and how did it what did it use to warp with externally jase said in its usual calm measured tones it is an ellipsoid fields up it looks like a very small ship its about ten metres long and two and a half in diameter internally its made up of millions of components but the most important ones are the thinking and memory parts of the mind proper those are what make it so heavy because theyre so dense it weighs nearly fifteen thousand tonnes it is fitted with its own power of course and several field generators any of which could be pressed into service as emergency motors and indeed are designed with this in mind only the outer envelope is constantly in real space the rest all the thinking parts anyway stay in hyperspace assuming as we must that the mind did what it said it was going to do there is only one possible way it could have accomplished the task given that it does not have a warp motor or displacer jase paused as fal sat forward her elbows on her knees her hands clenched under her chin it saw her shifting her weight on her backside and a tiny grimace appear fleetingly on her face jase decided she was getting uncomfortable on the hard stone bench and ordered one of the lodge drones to bring some cushions the mind does have an internal warping unit but it is supposed to be used only to expand microscopic volumes of the memory so that there is more space around the sections of information in the form of thirdlevel elementary particlespirals which it wants to change the normal volume limit on that warping unit is less than a cubic millimetre somehow the ship mind juryrigged it so that it would encompass its entire body and let it appear within the planets surface a clear air space would be the logical place to go for and the tunnels of the command system seem an obvious choice that is where it said it would head for right fal said nodding ok now what are oh a small drone carrying two large cushions appeared at her side hmm thanks fal said levering herself up with one hand and placing one cushion beneath her the other at her back the small drone floated off to the lodge again fal settled herself did you ask for these jase she asked not me jase lied secretly pleased what were you going to ask these tunnels fal said leaning forward more comfortably this time this command system what is it briefly it consists of a winding paired loop of twentytwometre diameter tunnels buried five kilometres deep the whole system is several hundred kilometres in length the trains were designed to be the wartime mobile command centres of a state which once existed on the planet when it was at the intermediatesophisticated stagethree phase stateoftheart weaponry at the time was the fusion bomb delivered by transplanetary guided rocket the command system was designed to yes fal waved her hand quickly protect keep mobile so they couldnt be blown up right yes what sort of rock cover did they have granite jase said batholithic just a second jase said consulting elsewhere yes correct a batholith a batholith fal said eyebrows raised just one just one this is a slightly lowg world thick crust both uhhuh so the minds inside these she looked along the terrace not really seeing anything but in her minds eye looking down kilometres of dark tunnels and thinking there might be some pretty impressive mountains above them all that granite lowg good climbing territory she looked at the machine again so what happened its a planet of the dead did the natives eventually do it to themselves with biological weapons not nukes to the last humanoid eleven thousand years ago hmm fal nodded now it was obvious why the draazon had made schars world one of their planets of the dead if you were a pureenergy superspecies long retired from the normal matterbased life of the galaxy and your conceit was to cordon off and preserve the odd planet or two you thought might serve as a fitting monument to death and futility schars world with its short and sordid history sounded like the sort of place youd put pretty near the top of your list something occurred to her how come the tunnels havent sealed up again over all that time five klicks worth of pressure we dont know jase sighed the draazon have not been very forthcoming with information it is possible the systems engineers devised a technique for withstanding the pressure over such a period this is unlikely admittedly but then they were ingenious pity they didnt devote a little more ingenuity to staying alive rather than conducting mass slaughter as efficiently as possible fal said and made a little snorting noise jase felt pleasure at the girls words if not the snort but at the same time detected in them a tinge of that mixture of contempt and patronising smugness the culture found it so difficult not to exhibit when surveying the mistakes of less advanced societies even though the source civilisations of its own mongrel past had been no less fallible still the underlying point held experience as well as common sense indicated that the most reliable method of avoiding selfextinction was not to equip oneself with the means to accomplish it in the first place so fal said looking down as she tapped her one good heel on the grey stones the minds in the tunnels the draazons on the outside whats the quiet barrier limit the usual halfdistance to the nearest other star three hundred and ten standard lightdays in the case of schars world at the moment and she held out her hand to jase and raised her head and her eyebrows flower shadows moved on her neck as the gentlest of breezes started and ruffled the blossoms on the trelliswork above her head whats the problem well jase said the reason the mind was allowed in at all was because in distress right go on jase who had stopped being annoyed by fals interruptions the first time she had brought it a mountain flower went on there is a small base on schars world as there is on almost all the planets of the dead as usual it is staffed from a small nominally neutral nondynamic society of some galactic maturity the changer fal broke in quite slowly as though guessing the answer to a puzzle which had been troubling her for hours and ought to have been simple she looked through the flowerstrewn trellis to a blue sky where a few small white clouds were moving slowly she looked back to the machine im right arent i that changer guy who and that special circumstancer balveda and the place where you have to be senile to rule theyre changers on schars world and this bloke she broke off and frowned but i thought he was dead now were not so sure the last message from the gcu nervous energy seemed to indicate he might have escaped what happened to the gcu we dont know contact was lost while it was trying to capture rather than destroy the idiran ship both are presumed lost capture it eh fal said tartly another showoff mind but thats it isnt it the idirans might be able to use this guy whats his name do we know bora horza gobuchul whereas we dont have any changers we do but the one we have is on the other side of the galaxy on an urgent job not connected with the war it would take half a year to get her there besides she has never been to schars world the tricky part about this problem is that bora horza gobuchul has hoho fal said in addition we have unconfirmed information that the same idiran fleet which knocked out the fleeing ship also tried unsuccessfully to follow the mind to schars world with a small landing force thus the draazon concerned is going to be suspicious it might let bora horza gobuchul through as he has served before with the caretaker staff on the planet but even he is not certain to gain entry anybody else is very doubtful indeed of course the poor devil might be dead changers are not notoriously easy to kill and besides it would seem unwise simply to count on that possibility and youre worried he might get to this precious mind and bring it back to the idirans it could just happen just supposing it did happen jase fal said screwing up her eyes and leaning forward to look at the machine so what would it really make any difference what would happen if the idirans did get their hands on this admittedly resourceful kid mind assuming that we are going to win the war jase said thoughtfully it could lengthen the proceedings by a handful of months and how manys that supposed to be fal said somewhere between three and seven i suppose it depends whose hand youre using fal smiled and the problem is that the mind cant destruct without making this planet of the dead even more dead than it is already in fact without making it an asteroid belt exactly so maybe the little devil shouldnt have bothered saving itself from the wreck in the first place and should have just gone down with the ship its called the instinct to survive jase paused while fal nodded then it went on its programmed into most living things it made a show of weighing the girls injured leg in its fieldheld grip though of course there are always exceptions yes fal said giving what she hoped was a condescending smile very droll jase so you see the problem i see the problem fal agreed of course we could force our way in there and blow the place to smithereens if necessary and to hell with the draazon she grinned yes jase conceded and put the whole outcome of the war in jeopardy by antagonising a power whose haziest unknown quantity is the exact extent of its immensity we could also surrender to the idirans but i doubt well do that either well so long as were considering all the options fal laughed oh yes ok jase if thats all let me think about this lot for a while fal ngeestra said sitting up straight on the bench and stretching and yawning it sounds interesting she shook her head this is lapofthegods stuff though let me have anything you think might be relevant id like to concentrate on this bit of the war for a while all the information weve got on the sullen gulf all i can handle anyway ok ok jase said hmm fal murmured nodding vaguely her eyes unfocused yes all weve got on that general area i mean volume she waved her hand round in a circle in her imagination encompassing several million cubic lightyears very well jase said and retreated slowly from the girls gaze it floated back down the terrace in the shafts of sunlight and shade towards the lodge under the flowers the girl sat by herself rocking backwards and forwards on her haunches and humming quietly her hands at her mouth again and her elbows on her knees one of which was bent and one of which was straight here we are she thought killing the immortal only just stopping short of tangling with something most people would think of as a god and here am i eighty thousand lightyears away if im a metre supposed to think of a way out of this ridiculous situation what a joke damn i wish theyd let me be a field referer out there where the action is instead of sitting it out back here so far away it takes two years just to get there oh well she shifted her weight and sat sideways on the seat so that her broken leg lay along the bench then turned her face to the mountains glittering on the far side of the plain she rested her elbow on the stone parapet her hand supporting her head as her eyes drank in the view she wondered whether they really had kept their word about not watching her when she went climbing she wouldnt put it past them to have kept a small drone or micromissile or something near by just in case anything did happen and then after the accident after shed fallen left her lying there frightened cold and in pain just to convince her they were doing no such thing and to see the effect it had on her as long as she wasnt in any real danger of dying she knew after all the way their minds worked it was the sort of thing she would consider doing if she was in charge maybe i should just pack it in leave tell them to shove their war trouble is i like all this she looked at one of her hands golden brown in a beam of sunlight she opened and closed it looking at the fingers three to seven she thought of an idiran hand depending she looked back over the shadowstrewn plain towards the distant mountains and sighed megaship vavatch lay in space like a gods bracelet the fourteenmillion kilometre hoop glittered and sparkled blue and gold against the jetblack gulf of space beyond as the clear air turbulence warped in towards the orbital most of the company watched their goal approach on the main screen in the mess the aquamarine sea which covered most of the surface of the artefacts ultradense base material was spattered with white puffs of cloud collected in huge storm systems or vast banks some of which seemed to stretch right across the full thirtyfivethousandkilometre breadth of the slowly turning orbital only on one side of that looped band of water was there any land visible hard up against one sloped retaining wall of pure crystal although from the distance they were watching the sliver of land looked like a tiny brown thread lying on the edge of a great rolledout bolt of vivid blue that thread was anything up to two thousand kilometres across there was no shortage of land on vavatch its greatest attraction however was and had always been the megaships dont you have a religion dorolow asked horza yes he replied not taking his eyes away from the screen on the wall above the end of the main messroom table my survival so your religion dies with you how sad dorolow said looking back from horza to the screen the changer let the remark pass the exchange had started when dorolow struck by the beauty of the great orbital expressed the belief that even though it was a work of base creatures no better than humans it was still a triumphant testimony to the power of god as god had made man and all other souled creatures horza had disagreed genuinely annoyed that the woman could use even something so obviously a testament to the power of intelligence and hard work as an argument for her own system of irrational belief yalson who was sitting beside horza at the table and whose foot was gently rubbing the changers ankle put her elbows on the plastic surface beside the plates and beakers and theyre going to blow it away in four days time what a fucking waste whether or not this would have worked as a subjectchanging parry she did not get a chance to find out because the mess pa crackled once and then came clear with the voice of kraiklyn who was on the bridge thought you might like to see this people the view of the distant orbital was replaced by a blank screen onto which there then appeared a message in flashing letters warningsignalwarningsignalwarningsignalwarning attention all craft vavatch orbital and hub with all ancillary units will be destroyed repeat destroyed maraintime a exact equivalent ghub time equivalent limb three time equivalent ldirtimerelative quuribalta eqivalent vavatchtime seg th by

number one of seven follows warningsignalwarningsignalwarning we just ran through that message shell kraiklyn added see you later the pa crackled again then was silent the message faded from the screen and the orbital filled it again hmm jandraligeli said brief and to the point like i said yalson nodded at the screen i remember wubslin said slowly staring at the band of brilliant blue and white on the screen when i was very young one of my teachers floated a little toy metal boat on the surface of a bucketful of water then she lifted the bucket by the handle and held me up against her chest with her other arm so that i was facing the same way she was she started to go round and round faster and faster letting the spin send the bucket out away from her and eventually the bucket was straight out the surface of the water in it at ninety degrees to the floor and i was held there with this great big adult hand across my belly and everything spinning around me and i was watching this little toy boat which was still floating on the water even though the water was straight up and down in front of my face and my teacher said you remember this if youre ever lucky enough to see the megaships of vavatch yeah lamm said well theyre about to let the fucking handle go so lets just hope were not still on the surface when they do yalson said jandraligeli turned to her one eyebrow up after that last fiasco dear nothing would surprise me easy in easy out aviger said and the old man laughed the haul from marjoin to vavatch had taken twentythree days the company had gradually recovered from the effects of the abortive attack on the temple of light there were a few small sprains and grazes dorolow had been blind in one eye for a couple of days and everybody had been quiet and withdrawn but by the time vavatch came into sight they were all starting to get so bored with life on board ship even with less of them on it that they were looking forward to another operation horza kept the laser rifle which keealsorofus had used and carried out what rudimentary repairs and improvements the cats limited engineering facilities would allow him to effect to his suit kraiklyn was full of praise for the one he had taken from horza it had lifted him out of the worst of the trouble in the hall of the temple of light and although it had still taken some heavy fire pulses it was hardly marked let alone damaged neisin had said hed never liked lasers anyway and wouldnt use one again he had a perfectly good rapidfiring light projectile rifle and lots of ammunition he would carry that in future when he wasnt using the microhowitzer horza and yalson had started sleeping together every night in what was now their cabin the one the two women had occupied during the long days of the voyage they had grown closer but spoken comparatively little for new lovers both seemed to want it that way horzas body had completed its regeneration after its impersonation of the gerontocrat and there was no longer any trace or sign of that role left on him but while he told the company that he was now the way he had always looked he had in fact moulded his body to look like that of kraiklyn horza was a little taller and fullerchested than his neutral normal and his hair was darker and thicker his face of course he could not yet afford to change but under its lightbrown surface it was ready a short trance and he could pass for the captain of the clear air turbulence perhaps vavatch would give him the opportunity he needed he had thought long and hard about what to do now that he was part of the company and relatively safe but cut off from his idiran employers he could always just go on his own way but that would let down xoralundra whether the old idiran was alive or dead it would also be running away from the war from the culture and the part he had chosen to play against it in addition at first there was the idea horza had been toying with anyway even before he had heard that his next task was to involve going to schars world and that was the idea of returning to an old love her name was sro kierachell zorant she was what they called a dormant changer one who had no training in and no desire to practise changing and had accepted the post on schars world partly as a relief from the increasingly warlike atmosphere in the changers home asteroid of heibohre that had been seven years before when heibohre was already within what was generally recognised as being idiran space and when many changers were already employed by the idirans horza was sent to schars world partly because he was being punished and partly for his own protection a group of changers had plotted to fire up the ancient asteroids powerplants and take it out of idiran space make their home and their species neutral again in the war they could see was becoming inevitable horza had discovered the plot and killed two of the conspirators the court of the academy of military arts on heibohre its ruling body in all but name had compromised between popular feeling on the asteroid which wanted horza punished for taking other changers lives and the gratitude it felt towards horza the court had a delicate task considering the not wholehearted support the majority of changers gave to staying where they were and therefore within the idiran sphere of influence by sending horza to schars world with instructions to stay there for several years but not punishing him otherwise the court hoped to make all concerned feel their own particular view had carried the day to the extent that there was no revolt that the academy remained the ruling force in the asteroid and that the services of changers were in demand as never before since the formation of their unique species the court had succeeded in some ways horza had been lucky he was without friends or influence his parents were dead his clan was all but defunct save for him family ties meant a lot in the changer society and with no influential relatives or friends to speak for him horza had perhaps escaped more lightly than he had a right to expect horza cooled his heels on schars worlds snows for less than a year before leaving to join the idirans in their fight against the culture both before and after it was officially termed a war during that time he had started a relationship with one of the four other changers there the woman changer kierachell who disagreed with almost everything horza believed but had loved him body and mind despite it all when he left he knew it had hurt her much more than it had hurt him he had been glad of the companionship and he liked her but he hadnt felt anything like what humans were supposed to feel when they talked of love and by the time he left he was starting just starting to grow bored he told himself at the time that that was the way life was that he would only hurt her more in the end by staying that it was partly for her sake he was leaving but the expression in her eyes the last time hed looked into them had not been something he enjoyed thinking about for a long time he had heard she was still there and he thought of her and had fond memories and the more he had risked his life and the more time had elapsed the more he wanted to see her again the more a quieter less dangerous sort of existence appealed to him he had imagined the scene imagined the look in her eyes when he came back to her maybe she would have forgotten about him or even be committed to some relationship with the other changers at the base on schars world but horza didnt really think so he thought of such things only as a sort of insurance yalson made things a little difficult perhaps but he was trying not to build too much into their friendship and coupling even though he was fairly sure it was only those two things to her as well so he would impersonate kraiklyn if he could or at least kill him and just take over and hope he could get round the comparatively crude identity fidelities built into the cats computer or get somebody else to do so then he would take the clear air turbulence to schars world rendezvous with the idirans if he could but go in anyway assuming mr adequate the pet name the changers on the schars world base had for the draazon being which guarded the planet would allow him through the quiet barrier after the idirans botched attempt to fool it with a hollowedout chuyhirtsi he would if at all possible give the rest of the company the chance to back out one problem was knowing when to strike at kraiklyn horza was hoping that an opportunity would arise on vavatch but it was hard to make definite plans because kraiklyn didnt seem to have any of his own he had simply talked of opportunities on the orbital which were bound to arise due to its impending destruction whenever he had been asked during the journey that lying bastard yalson said one night when they were about halfway to vavatch from marjoin they were lying together in what was now their cabin in the darkness of the ship night in about a halfg on the cramped bedspace what horza said dont you think hes going to vavatch after all oh hes going there all right but not because there are unknown possibilities for a successful job hes going for the damage game what damage game horza asked turning to her in the darkness where her naked shoulders lay on his arm he could feel their soft down against his skin you mean a big game a real one yeah the ring itself last i heard it was only a rumour but it makes more sense every time i think about it vavatch is a certainty provided they can get a quorum together the players on the eve of destruction horza laughed gently you think kraiklyn means to watch or play hell try to play i suppose if hes as good as he says he is they might even let him as long as he can raise the stake thats supposed to be how he won the cat not off anybody in a ring game but it must have been pretty heavy company if they were gambling ships but i guess hed be prepared to watch if it came to it i bet thats why were all going on this little holiday he might try and come up with some sort of excuse or fabricate some op but thats the real reason damage either hes heard something or hes making an intelligent guess but its so fucking obvious her voice died away and horza felt her head shake on his arm isnt one of the ring regulars he said ghalssel now horza could feel the light shorthaired head nod against the skin of his arm yeah hell be there if he possibly can be hed burn out the motors on the leading edge to get to a major damage game and the way things have been hotting up in this neck of the woods recently presenting all those wonderful easyin easyout opportunities i cant imagine him being far away yalsons voice sounded bitter myself i think ghalssels the subject of kraiklyns wet dreams thinks the guys a fucking hero shit yalson horza said into the womans ear her hair tickling his nose one how does kraiklyn have wet dreams if he doesnt sleep and two what if he has these cabins bugged her head turned towards him quickly so fucking what im not afraid of him he knows im one of the most reliable people hes got i shoot straight and i dont fill my pants when it starts getting hot i also think kraiklyns the best excuse for a leader weve got on the ship or are likely to get and he knows that dont you worry about me anyway he felt her shoulders and head move again and knew she was looking at him youd settle it up if i got shot in the back wouldnt you the thought had never occurred to him wouldnt you she repeated well of course i would he said she didnt move he could hear her breathing you would wouldnt you yalson said he brought his arms up and took her by the shoulders she was warm the down on her skin was soft and the muscles and flesh underneath over her slim frame were strong and firm yes i would he said and only then realised that he meant it it was during this time between marjoin and vavatch that the changer found out what he wanted to know about the controls and fidelities of the clear air turbulence kraiklyn wore an identity ring on the small finger of his right hand and some of the locks in the cat would work only in the presence of that rings electronic signature the control of the ship depended on an audiovisual identity link kraiklyns face was recognised by the crafts computer as was his voice when he said this is kraiklyn it was that simple the ship had once had a retina recognition lock as well but it had malfunctioned long before and been removed horza was pleased copying somebodys retina pattern was a delicate and tricky operation requiring amongst a lot of other things the careful growth of lasing cells around the iris it almost made more sense to go for a total genetic transcription where the subjects own dna became the model for a virus which left only the changers brain and optionally gonads unaltered that wouldnt be necessary to impersonate captain kraiklyn however horza found out about the ships fidelities when he asked the man for a lesson on how to fly the vessel kraiklyn had been reluctant at first but horza had not pressed him and had answered a few of kraiklyns apparently casual questions about computers which followed this request with feigned ignorance seemingly convinced that teaching horza how to fly the cat would not carry the risk of him taking over the ship kraiklyn relented and allowed horza to practise piloting the craft on manual using the rather crude controls in simulator mode under mipps instruction while the craft went on its way through space towards vavatch on autopilot this is kraiklyn the ship pa announced to the mess a few hours after they ran through the culture transmission warning of the orbitals destruction they were sitting around after a meal drinking or inhaling relaxing or in dorolows case making the circle of flame sign on her forehead and saying the prayer of thanks the big orbital was still on the mess screen and had grown much larger almost filling it with its inner surface daylight side but everybody had grown a little blasé about it and now gave it only the occasional glance all the remaining company were there save for lenipobra and kraiklyn himself they looked at each other or the pa speaker when kraiklyn spoke ive got a job for us something i just had confirmed wubslin you get the shuttle ready ill meet the rest of you in the hangar in three ship hours suited up team and dont worry this time therell be no hostiles this time it really is youknowwhat in and out the speaker crackled then went silent horza and yalson exchanged looks so jandraligeli said leaning back in his chair and putting his hands behind his neck the scar marks on his face deepened slightly as he put on an expression of thoughtfulness our esteemed leader has again found us something to employ our slight talents better not be in another fuckin temple lamm growled scratching the small horn grafts where they joined his head how are you going to find a temple on vavatch neisin said he was slightly drunk talking more than he normally did when with the others lamm turned his face towards the smaller man a few seats away and on the other side of the table youd better just sober up friend he said seaships neisin told him taking the nippled cylinder from the table in front of him nothing but big goddamned seaships on that place no temples he closed his eyes put his head back and drank there might jandraligeli said be temples on the ships there might be a fucking drunk on this spaceship lamm said watching neisin neisin looked at him youd better sober up fast neisin lamm continued pointing with one finger at the smaller man think ill head for the hangar wubslin said standing and walking out of the mess im going to see if kraiklyn wants a hand mipp said leaving in the opposite direction through another door think we could see any of those megaships yet aviger was looking back at the screen dorolow looked up at it too dont be fucking stupid lamm told him they arent that big theyre big neisin said nodding to himself and the small cylinder lamm looked at him then at the others and shook his head yeah neisin said theyre pretty big theyre actually no more than a few kilometres long sighed jandraligeli sitting back in his chair and looking thoughtful emphasising the scar marks still further so you wont see them from this far out but they certainly are large and they just go round and round the whole orbital yalson said she already knew but she would rather have the mondlidician talking than lamm and neisin arguing horza smiled to himself jandraligeli nodded for ever and ever it takes them about forty years to go right round in a circle dont they ever stop yalson asked jandraligeli looked at her and raised an eyebrow it takes them several years just to get to full speed young lady they weigh about a billion tonnes they never stop they just keep going round in circles fullsize liners go on excursions and act as tenders and they use aircraft too did you know aviger said looking round those still seated at the table and leaning forward with his elbows tightly folded you actually weigh less on a megaship its because they go round in the opposite direction from the way the orbital spins aviger paused and frowned or is it the other way round oh fuck lamm said shaking his head violently then getting up and leaving jandraligeli frowned fascinating he said dorolow smiled at aviger and the old man looked round the others nodding well whatever its a fact aviger declared right kraiklyn placed one foot up on the shuttles rear ramp and put his hands on his hips he wore a pair of shorts his suit stood ready to be put on opened down the chest front like a discarded insect skin just behind him i told you weve got a job this is what it is kraiklyn paused looked at the company standing or sitting or leaning on guns and rifles throughout the hangar were going to hit one of the megaships he paused apparently waiting for a reaction only aviger looked surprised and in any way excited the rest with only mipp and the recently woken lenipobra absent seemed unimpressed mipp was on the bridge lenipobra was still struggling to get ready in his cabin well kraiklyn said annoyed you all know that vavatch is going to get blown away by the culture in a few days people have been getting everything they can off the place and the megaships are all abandoned now apart from a few wrecking and salvage teams i guess all the valuables are off them but there is one ship called the olmedreca where a couple of the teams had a little argument some careless person let off a little nuke and now the olmedrecas got a damn great hole in one side its still afloat and its still scrubbing off speed but because the nuke went off on one side and that hole hasnt done a lot for the ships streamlining its started going round in a big curve and its getting closer to the outside edgewall all the time the last transmission i picked up nobody was sure whether it would hit before the culture starts blasting or not but they dont seem happy to take the chance so it looks like there isnt anybody on board you want us to go onto it yalson said yeah because ive been on the olmedreca and i think i know something people will have forgotten in the rush to get off bow lasers a few of the company looked sceptically from one to another yeah megaships have bow lasers especially the olmedreca it used to sail through stretches of the circlesea a lot of the other ships didnt go through places where there was a lot of floating weeds or icebergs it couldnt exactly manoeuvre out of the way so it had to be able to destroy anything in its path and have the firepower to do it the olmedrecas front armament would put a few fleet battleships to shame that thing could frazzle its way through an iceberg bigger than it was itself and blast islands of floatweed out of the water so big that people used to think it was attacking the edgeland my guess and its an educated one because ive been reading between the lines of the outcoming signals is that nobodys remembered about all that weaponry and so were going to go for it what if this ship hits the wall while were on board dorolow said kraiklyn smiled at her were not blind are we we know where the wall is and we know where well be able to see where the olmedreca is well go down take a look and then if we decide we have the time well remove a few of the smaller lasers hell just one would do im going to be down there too you know and im not going to risk my own neck if i can see the edge wall looming up am i we taking the cat lamm said not over the top the orbitals got just enough mass to make the warp a tricky proposition and the fusions would get zapped by the hub autodefences theyd think our motors were meteorites or something no well leave the cat here unmanned i can always control it remotely from my suit if theres an emergency well use the shuttles ffd force fields work fine on an orbital oh thats one thing i shouldnt really have to remind you about dont try to use your ag on the place ok antigravity works against mass not spin so youd end up taking an unexpected bath if you jumped over the side expecting to fly round to the bows what do we do after we get this laser if we get it yalson said kraiklyn frowned briefly he shrugged probably the best thing is to head for the capital its called evanauth a port where they used to build the megaships its on the land of course he smiled looking at some of the others yeah yalson said but what do we do once we get there well kraiklyn looked hard at the woman horza kicked her heel with his toe yalson glared round at the changer while kraiklyn spoke we might be able to use the port facilities in space that is on the underside of evanauth to mount the laser but anyway im sure the culture will be prompt so we might even just go to sample the last days of one of the most interesting combined ports of call in the galaxy and its last nights i might add kraiklyn looked at several of the others and there was some laughter and a few remarks he stopped smiling and looked at yalson again so it could be quite interesting dont you think yeah all right youre the boss kraiklyn yalson grinned then put her head down under her breath to horza she hissed guess where the damage game is wont this big seaship go right through the wall and wreck the orbital anyway before the culture does anything aviger was saying kraiklyn smiled condescendingly and shook his head i think youll find the edgewalls are up to it ho i hope so aviger laughed well dont worry about it kraiklyn reassured him now somebody give wubslin a hand to run a final check on the shuttle im going up to the bridge to make sure mipp knows what to do well be setting off in about ten minutes kraiklyn stepped back and into his suit gathering it up and putting his arms into the sleeves he fastened the main chest latches picked up his helmet and nodded to the company as he walked by them and up the steps out of the hangar were you trying to annoy him horza asked yalson she turned to the changer ah i just wanted to give him a hint that i could see through him he doesnt fool me wubslin and aviger were checking the shuttle lamm was fiddling with his laser jandraligeli stood with arms crossed his back resting against the hangar bulkhead near the door eyes raised to the ceiling lights a bored expression on his face neisin was talking quietly to dorolow who saw the small man as a possible convert to the circle of flame you reckon evanauth is where this damage games going to be horza asked he was smiling yalsons face looked very small inside the big still open neck of her suit and very serious yes i do that devious bastard probably invented the whole goddamn op on this megaboat thing hes never told me hed been to vavatch before lying bastard she looked at horza punched him in the suit belly making him laugh and dance back what are you smiling at you horza laughed so what if he wants to go and playa game of damage you keep saying its his ship and hes the boss and all that crap but you wont let the poor guy have a bit of fun so why doesnt he admit it yalson nodded sharply at horza because he doesnt want to share any of his winnings thats why the rule is we divide everything we make sharing it out according to well i can see his point if thats what it is horza said reasonably if he wins in a damage game its all his own work nothing to do with us thats not the point yalson yelled her mouth was set in a tight line her hands were on her hips she stamped her feet ok horza said grinning so when you bet on me to win my fight with zallin why didnt you give all your winnings right back again thats different yalson said in exasperation but she was interrupted hey hey lenipobra came bounding down the steps into the hangar as horza was about to say something both he and yalson turned to the younger man as he skipped up to them fastening his suit gloves to the cuffs dddid you see that message earlier he looked excited and didnt seem to be able to keep still he kept rubbing his gloved hands together and shuffling his feet novagrade ggridfire wow what a spectacle i love the cculture and a cccam dusting hoowee he laughed doubled at the waist slapped both hands on the hangar deck bounced up and smiled at everybody dorolow scratched her ears and looked puzzled lamm glared at the youth over the barrel of his rifle while yalson and horza looked at each other shaking their heads lenipobra went dancing and shadowboxing up to jandraligeli who raised one eyebrow and watched the gangly young man prancing about in front of him the weaponry of the end of the universe and this young idiot is practically coming in his pants aw youre just a spoilsport ligeli lenipobra said to the mondlidician stopping dancing and dropping his punching arms to turn away and slouch off towards the shuttle as he passed yalson and horza he muttered yalson what the hell is ccam anyway collapsed antimatter kid yalson smiled as lenipobra kept on walking horza laughed soundlessly as the young mans head nodded inside the open neck of his suit he walked into the open rear of the shuttle the clear air turbulence rolled the shuttle left the hangar and flew along the underside of the vavatch orbital leaving the spacecraft flying underneath like a tiny silver fish under the hull of some great dark ship on a small screen fitted at one end of the shuttles main compartment since its last outing the suited figures could watch the seemingly endless curve of ultradense base material stretching off into the dark distance lit by starlight it was like flying upsidedown over a planet made of metal and of all the sights the galaxy held which were the result of conscious effort it was one bested for what the culture would call gawp value only by a big ring or a sphere the shuttle crossed a thousand kilometres of the smooth undersurface then suddenly above it there was a wedge of darkness a slant of something which looked even smoother than the base material but which was clear transparent and angling out from the base itself and slicing into space like the edge of a crystal knife for two thousand kilometres the edgewall this was the wall bordered by sea on the far side of the orbital from the thread of land they had seen on their approach in the cat the first ten kilometres of the flat curve were dark as space their mirror surface showed only when stars reflected on them and looking at that perfect image the mind could spin seeing for what looked like lightyears when in fact the surface was only a few thousand metres away god that things big neisin whispered the shuttle continued to rise and above it there appeared through the wall a glow of light a shining expanse of blue into sunlight hardly filtered through the transparent wall the shuttle climbed in empty space beside the edgewall two kilometres away there was air even if it was thin air but the shuttle climbed in nothing angling out along with the wall as it sloped towards its line of summit the shuttle crossed that knifeedge two thousand kilometres up from the base of the orbital then started to follow the slope of wall back down on the inside it passed through the orbitals magnetic field a region where small magnetised particles of artificial dust blocked out some of the suns rays so making the sea below it cooler than elsewhere on the world producing vavatchs different climates the shuttle continued to fall through ions then thin gases finally into thin and cloudless air shuddering in a coriolis jetstream the sky above turned from black to blue the orbital of vavatch a fourteen million kilometre hoop of water seemingly hung naked in space spread out before the falling craft like some vast circular painting well at least were in daylight yalson said lets just hope our captains information about exactly where this wonderful ship is turns out to be accurate the screen showed clouds as the shuttle fell and flew it was coming down onto a false landscape of water vapour the clouds seemed to stretch for ever along the curved inside surface of the orbital which even from that height looked flat then sweeping up into the black sky above only much further away could they see the blue expanse of real ocean though there were hints of smaller patches closer to hand dont worry about the cloud kraiklyn said over the cabin speaker thatll shift as the morning wears on the shuttle was still dropping still flying forward through the thickening atmosphere after a while they started going through the first few very high altitude clouds horza shifted slightly in his suit ever since the cat had matched velocities and curve with the big orbital and turned off its own ag the craft and the company had been under the same fake gravity of the constructions spin slightly more in fact because they were stationary relative to the base but further out from it vavatch whose original builders had come from a higherg planet was spun to produce about twenty per cent more gravity than the accepted human average which the cats generator was set for so horza like the rest of the company felt heavier than he was used to his suit was chafing already clouds filled the cabin screen with grey there it is kraiklyn shouted not trying to keep the excitement from his voice he had been quiet for almost a quarter of an hour and people had started to get restless the shuttle had banked a few times this way and that apparently searching for the olmedreca sometimes the screen had been clear showing layers of cloud beneath sometimes it hazed over with grey again as they entered another bank or pillar of vapour once it had iced over i can see the topmost towers the company crowded forward in the cabin getting out of their seats and coming closer to the screen only lamm and jandraligeli stayed sitting down about fucking time lamm said how the hell do you have to look all this time for something four k long its easy when youve no radar jandraligeli said im just thankful we didnt hit the damn thing while we were flying through those awful clouds shit lamm said and inspected his rifle again look at that neisin said in a wasteland of clouds like some vast canyon torn in a planet made of vapour through kilometres of levels and in a space so long and wide that even in the clear air between the piled clouds the view simply faded rather than ended the olmedreca moved its lower levels of superstructure were quite hidden invisible in the oceanhugging bank of mist but from its unseen decks rose immense towers and structures of glass and light metal rearing hundreds of metres into the clear air seemingly unconnected they moved slowly and smoothly over the flat surface of the low bank of cloud like pieces on an endless game board casting dim and watery shadows on the opaque top of the mist as the sun of vavatchs system shone through layers of cloud ten kilometres above as those huge towers moved through the air they left behind them wisps and strands of vapour ruffled from the mists smooth top by the passage of the great ship beneath in the small clear spaces that the towers and higher levels of superstructure left in the mist lower levels could be seen walkways and promenades the linked arches of a monorail system pools and small parks with trees even a few pieces of equipment like small flyers and bits of tiny dollshouselike furniture as the eye and brain grasped the scene they could from that height make out the overall bulge in the surface of the cloud that the ship made an area of slight uplift in the mist four kilometres long and nearly three wide and shaped like a stubby pointed leaf or an arrowhead the shuttle came lower the towers with their glinting windows their suspended bridges flyer pads ariels railings decks and flapping awnings sailed by alongside silent and dark well kraiklyns voice said in a businesslike way looks like well have a bit of a walk to the bows team i cant take us under this lot still were a good hundred kilometres away from the edgewall so weve got plenty of time the ship isnt heading straight for it anyway ill put us down as close as i can fuck here we go lamm said angrily i might have known a long walk in this gravity is just what i need jandraligeli said its vast lenipobra was still staring at the screen that thing is huge he was shaking his head lamm got up from his seat pushed the youth out of the way and banged on the door of the shuttle flight deck what is it kraiklyn said over the cabin speaker im looking for a place to put down if thats you lamm just sit down lamm stared at the door with a look first of surprise then of annoyance he snorted and went back to his seat shoving past lenipobra again bastard he muttered then put his helmet visor down and turned it to mirror right kraiklyn said were putting down those still standing sat again and in a few seconds the shuttle bumped carefully down the doors jawed and a cold gust of air entered through them they filed out slowly into the wide views of the silent rocksteady megaship horza sat in the shuttle waiting for the rest to go then saw lamm watching him horza stood and gave a mock bow to the darksuited figure after you he said no lamm said you first he nodded his head to one side towards the open doors horza went out of the shuttle followed by lamm lamm always made a point of being last out of the shuttle it was lucky for him they stood on a flyer landing pad near the base of a large rectangular tower of superstructure perhaps sixty metres tail the decks of the tower soared into the sky above while over the surface of the cloud bank in front and to all sides of the pad towers and small bulges in the mist showed where the rest of the ship was though where it ended it was impossible to tell now that they were so low down they couldnt even see where the nuke had gone off there was no list not a tremor to reveal that they were really on a damaged ship travelling over an ocean not standing in a deserted city with clouds moving smoothly past horza joined some of the others by a low restraining wall at the edge of the pad looking down about twenty metres to a deck just visible now and again through the thin surface of the mist streamers of vapour flowed across the area below in long sinuous waves sometimes revealing sometimes obscuring a deck covered with patches of earth planted with small bushes with little canopies and chairs scattered about and small tentlike buildings on the surface it all looked deserted and forlorn like a resort in winter and horza shivered inside his suit ahead of them the view led to an implied point about a kilometre away where a few small skinny towers poked out of the cloud bank near the unseen bows of the craft looks like were heading into even more cloud wubslin said pointing in the direction they were heading there a great canyon wall of cloud hung in the air stretching from one side of the horizon to the other and higher than any tower on the megaship it shone for them in the increasing sunlight maybe itll go away as it gets warmer dorolow said not sounding convinced if we hit that lot we can forget about these lasers horza said looking round from the rest towards the shuttle where kraiklyn was talking to mipp who was to stay on guard at the shuttle craft while the rest went forward to the bows with no radar well have to lift off before we go into the cloud bank maybe yalson began well im going to take a look down there lenipobra said bringing his visor down and putting one hand on the low parapet horza looked across at him lenipobra waved see you at the bbows yahoo he vaulted cleanly over the parapet and started to fall towards the deck five storeys below horza had opened his mouth to shout and started forward to grab the youth but like the rest of them he had realised too late what lenipobra was doing one second he was there the next he had leapt over no leni those not already looking down rushed to the parapet the tiny figure was tumbling horza saw it and hoped that somehow it could pull up stop do something the scream started in their helmets when lenipobra was less than ten metres from the deck below it ended abruptly the instant the spreadeagled figure crashed onto the border of a small earthed area it bounced slackly for about a metre over the deck then lay still oh my god neisin suddenly sat down took off his helmet and put his hand to his eyes dorolow put her head down and started to unfasten her helmet what the hell was that kraiklyn was running over from the shuttle mipp behind him horza was still looking over the parapet down at the still dolllike figure crumpled on the deck below mist thickened around it as the wisps and streamers grew thicker for a while lenipobra lenipobra wubslin shouted into his helmet microphone yalson turned away and swore to herself softly turning off her transmit intercom aviger stood shaking his face blank inside his helmet visor kraiklyn skidded to a halt at the parapet then looked over leni he looked round at the others is that what happened what was he doing if any of you were fooling he jumped jandraligeli said his voice was shaky he tried to laugh guess kids these days just cant tell their gravity from their rotating frame of reference he jumped kraiklyn shouted he grabbed jandraligeli by the suit collar how could he jump i told you ag wouldnt work i told you all when we were in the hangar he was late lamm broke in he kicked at the thin metal of the parapet failing to dent it the stupid little bastard was late none of us thought to tell him kraiklyn let go of jandraligeli and looked around the rest its true horza said he shook his head i just didnt think none of us did lamm and jandraligeli were even complaining about having to walk to the bows when leni was in the shuttle and you mentioned it but i suppose he just didnt hear horza shrugged he was excited he shook his head we all fucked up yalson said heavily she had turned her communicator back on nobody spoke for a while kraiklyn stood and looked round them then went to the parapet put both hands on it and looked down leni wubslin said into his communicator looking down too his voice was quiet chicelhorhava dorolow made the circle of flame sign closed her eyes and said sweet lady accept his soul in peace wormshit lamm swore and turned away he started firing the laser at distant higher parts of the tower above them dorolow kraiklyn said you wubslin and yalson head down there see what ah shit kraiklyn turned round get down there mipp you drop them a line or the medkit whatever the rest of us were going forward to the bows all right he looked around them challenging you might want to go back but that just means hes died for nothing yalson turned away switching off her transmit button again might as well jandraligeli said i suppose not me neisin said im not im staying here with the shuttle he sat with his head bowed between his shoulders his helmet on the deck he stared at the deck and shook his head not me no sir not me ive had it for today im staying here kraiklyn looked at mipp and nodded at neisin look after him he turned to dorolow and wubslin get going you never know you might be able to do something yalson you too yalson wasnt looking at kraiklyn but she turned and followed wubslin and the other woman when they set off to find a way down to the lower deck a crash they felt through their soles made them all jump they turned round to see lamm a distant figure against the faraway clouds firing up at flyerpad supports five or six decks above the invisible beam licking flame around the stressed metal another pad gave way flapping and spinning like a huge playingcard smashing into the level they stood on with another deckquivering thump lamm kraiklyn burst out stop that the black suit with the raised rifle pretended not to hear and kraiklyn lifted his own heavy laser and flicked the trigger a section of deck five metres in front of lamm ruptured in flame and glowing metal heaving up then collapsing back down a blister of gases blowing out from it rocking lamm off his feet so that he staggered and almost fell he steadied and stood visibly shaking with rage even from that distance kraiklyn still had the gun pointing towards him lamm straightened and shouldered his own gun coming back almost at a saunter as though nothing had happened the others relaxed slightly kraiklyn got them all together then they set off following dorolow yalson and wubslin to the inside of the tower and a broad sweeping spiral of carpeted staircase which led down into the megaship the olmedreca dead as a fossil yalsons voice said bitterly in their helmet speakers when they were about halfway down dead as a goddamned fossil when they passed them on their way to the bows yalson and wubslin were waiting by the body for the winch line mipp was lowering from above dorolow was praying they crossed over the deck level lenipobra had died on down into the mist and along a narrow gangway with nothing but empty space on either side just five metres kraiklyn said using the light needle radar in his rairch suit to plumb the depths of vapour below them the mist was getting slowly thinner as they went on up again onto another deck now clear then down again by outside stairs and long ramps the sun was hazily visible a few times a red disc which sometimes brightened and sometimes dimmed they crossed decks skirted swimming pools traversed promenades and landing pads went past tables and chairs through groves and under awnings arcades and arches they saw towers above them through the mist and a couple of times looked down into huge pits carved out of the ship and lined with yet more decks and opened areas from the bottom of which they thought they could hear the sea the swirling mist lay in the bottom of such great bowls like a broth of dreams they stopped at a line of small open wheeled vehicles with seats and gaily striped awnings for roofs kraiklyn looked around getting his bearings wubslin tried starting the vehicles but none of the small cars were working there are two ways to go here kraiklyn said frowning as he looked forward the sun was briefly bright above turning the vapour over them and to each side golden with its rays the lines of some unknown sport or game lay drawn out on the deck under their feet a tower forced out of the mist to one side the curls and whorls of mist moving like huge arms dimming the sun again its shadow cut across the path in front of them well split up kraiklyn looked around ill go that way with aviger and jandraligeli horza and lamm you go that way he pointed to one side thats leading down to one of the side prows there ought to be something there just keep looking he touched a wrist button yalson hello yalson said over the intercom she wubslin and dorolow had watched lenipobras body being winched up to the shuttle and then left following the rest right kraiklyn said looking at one of the helmet screens youre only about three hundred metres away he turned and looked back the way they had come a collection of towers some kilometres away were strung out behind them now mostly starting at higher levels they could see more and more of the olmedreca mist streamed quietly past them in the silence oh yeah kraiklyn said i see you he waved some small figures on a distant deck at the side of one of the great mistfilled bowls waved back i see you too yalson said when you get to where we are now head over to the left for the other side prow there are subsidiary lasers there horza and lamm will yeah we heard yalson said right well be able to bring the shuttle closer maybe right down to wherever we find anything soon lets go keep your eyes open he nodded at aviger and jandraligeli and they went forward lamm and horza looked at each other then set off in the direction kraiklyn had indicated lamm motioned to horza to switch off his communicator transmit and open his visor if wed waited we could have put the shuttle down where we wanted to in the first place he said with his own visor open horza agreed stupid little bastard lamm said who asked horza that kid jumping off the goddamned platform hmm know what im going to do lamm looked at the changer what im going to cut that stupid little bastards tongue out thats what im going to do a tattooed tongue should be worth something shouldnt it little bastard owed me money anyway what do you think how much do you think itd be worth no idea little bastard lamm muttered the two men tramped along the deck angling away from the deadahead line they had taken previously it was difficult to tell where exactly they were heading but according to kraiklyn it was towards one of the side prows which stuck out like enormous outriggers attached to the olmedreca and formed harbours for the liners which had shuttled to and from the megaship in its heyday on excursions or working as tenders they passed where there had evidently been a recent firefight laser burns smashed glass and torn metal littered an accommodation section of the ship and torn curtains and wall hangings flapped in the steady breeze of the great ships progress two of the small wheeled vehicles lay smashed on their sides near by they crunched over the debris and kept walking the other two groups were heading forward too making reasonable progress according to their reports and chatter ahead of them there still lay the enormous bank of cloud they had seen earlier it wasnt growing any thinner or lower and they could only be a couple of kilometres from it now though distances were hard to estimate were here kraiklyn said eventually his voice crackling in horzas ear lamm turned his transmit channel on what he looked mystified at horza who shrugged whats keeping you two kraiklyn said we had further to walk were at the main bows they stick further out than the bit youre on the hell you are kraiklyn yalson broke in from the other team which was supposed to be heading for the opposite set of side prows what kraiklyn said lamm and horza stopped to listen to the exchange over their communicators yalson spoke again weve just come to the edge of the ship in fact i think were a bit out from the main side on some sort of wing or buttress anyway theres no side prow around here youve sent us in the wrong direction but you kraiklyn began his voice died away kraiklyn dammit youve sent us towards the bow and youre on a side prow lamm yelled into his helmet mike horza had been coming to the same conclusion that was why they were still walking and kraiklyns team had reached the bows there was silence from the clear air turbulences captain for a few seconds then he said shit you must be right they could hear him sigh i guess you and horza had better keep going ill send somebody down in your direction once weve had a quick look round here i think i can see some sort of gallery with a lot of transparent blisters where there might be some lasers yalson you head back to where we split up and tell me when you get there well see who comes up with something useful first fucking marvellous lamm said stamping off into the mist horza followed wishing the illfitting suit didnt rub so much the two men walked on lamm stopped to investigate some state rooms which had already been looted fine materials snagged on broken glass floated like the cloud around them in one apartment they saw rich wooden furniture a holosphere lying broken in a corner and a glasssided water tank the size of a room full of rotting brilliantly coloured fish and fine clothes floating together on the surface like exotic weeds over their communicators horza and lamm heard the others in kraiklyns group find what they thought was a door leading to the gallery where they hoped they would find lasers behind the transparent bubbles they had seen earlier horza told lamm they had best not waste their time and so they left the state rooms and went back out onto the deck to continue heading forward hey horza kraiklyn said as the changer and lamm walked along the deck and into a long tunnel lit by dim sunlight coming through mist and opaque ceiling panels this needle radars not working properly horza answered as they walked whats wrong it isnt going through cloud thats whats wrong i never really got a chance to what do you mean horza stopped in the corridor he felt something wrong in his guts lamm kept walking away from him down the corridor its giving me a reading off that big cloud in front right the way along and about half a k up kraiklyn laughed it isnt the edgewall thats for sure and i can see thats a cloud and its closer than the needle says it is where are you now dorolow broke in did you find any lasers what about that door no just a sort of sun lounge or something kraiklyn said kraiklyn horza shouted are you sure about that reading im sure the needle says sure isnt much fucking sun to lounge somebody broke in though it sounded as if it was accidental and they didnt know their transmit was on horza felt sweat start out on his brow something was wrong lamm he shouted lamm thirty metres away down the corridor turned as he walked and looked back come back horza shouted lamm stopped horza there cant be anything kraiklyn this time it was mipps voice calling from the shuttle there was somebody else here i just saw another craft take off somewhere behind where we landed theyve gone now ok thanks mipp kraiklyn said his voice calm listen horza from what i can see from here the bows where you are have just gone into the cloud so it is a cloud shit we can all see its a goddamn cloud dont the ship shuddered under horzas feet he rocked lamm looked at him puzzled did you feel that horza shouted feel what kraiklyn said kraiklyn it was mipp again i can see something lamm get back here horza shouted through the air and into his helmet mike together lamm looked around him horza thought he could feel a continuing tremor in the deck below what did you feel kraiklyn said he was starting to get annoyed yalson chipped in i thought i felt something nothing much but listen these things arent supposed to they arent supposed to kraiklyn mipp said more urgently i think i can see lamm horza was backing off now back down the long tunnel of corridor lamm stayed where he was looking hesitant horza could hear something a curious growling noise it reminded him of a jet engine or a fusion motor heard from a very long distance away but it wasnt either he could feel something under his feet too that tremor and there was some sort of pull a tug that seemed to be dragging him forward towards lamm towards the bows as though he was in a weak field or kraiklyn mipp yelled i can there is i you im he spluttered look will you all just calm down i can feel something yalson began horza started running pounding back down the corridor lamm who had started to walk back stopped and put his hands on his hips when he saw the other man running away from him there was a distant roaring noise in the air like a big waterfall heard from far down a gorge i can feel something too its as if what was mipp yelling about were crashing horza shouted as he ran the roaring was coming closer growing stronger all the time ice it was mipp im bringing the shuttle run its a wall of ice neisin where are you neisin ive got what ice the roaring noise grew the corridor around horza started to groan several of the opaque roof panels fractured and fell to the floor in front of him a section of wall suddenly sprang out like an opening door and he just avoided running into it the noise filled his ears lamm looked round and saw the end of the corridor coming towards him the whole end section was closing off steadily with a grinding roar advancing towards him at about running speed he fired at it but it didnt stop smoke poured into the corridor he swore turned and ran following horza people were yelling and shouting from all over now there was a babble of tiny voices in both horzas ears but all he could really hear was the thundering noise behind him the deck beneath his feet bucked and trembled as though the whole gigantic ship was a building caught in an earthquake the plates and panels which made up the corridor walls were buckling the floor rose up in places more roof panels shattered and fell all the time the same sapping force was pulling him back slowing him down as though he was in a dream he ran out into daylight heard lamm not far behind kraiklyn you stupid motherfucking son of a bitchs bastard lamm screamed the voices yammered in his ear his heart pounded he threw each foot forward with all his might but the roaring was coming closer growing stronger he ran past the empty state rooms where the soft materials blew the roof was starting to fold in on the apartments and the deck was tilting the holosphere they had seen earlier came rolling and bouncing out of the collapsing windows a hatch near horza blew out in a gust of pressured air and flying debris he ducked as he ran felt splinters strike his suit he skidded as the deck under him banged and leapt lamms steps came pounding behind him lamm continued to scream abuse at kraiklyn over the intercom the noise behind him was like a gigantic waterfall a big rockslide like a continuous explosion a volcano his ears ached and his mind reeled stunned by the volume of the racket a line of windows set in the wall ahead of him went white then exploded towards him throwing particles at his suit in a series of small hard clouds he put his head down again he headed for the doorway bastard bastard bastard lamm bellowed not stopping over here shut up lamm horzaaa voices screamed in his ear he was running on carpet now inside a broad corridor open doors were flapping light fittings on the ceiling were vibrating suddenly a deluge of water swept across the corridor in front of him twenty metres away and for a second he thought he was at sea level but knew he couldnt be when he ran over the place where the water had been he could see and hear it frothing and gurgling down a broad spiral stairwell and only a few dribbles were falling from overhead the tugging of the slowly decelerating ship seemed less now but the roar of noise was still all around him he was weakening running in a daze trying to keep his balance as the long corridor vibrated and twisted around him now a rush of air was flowing past him some sheets of paper and plastic flapped past him like coloured birds bastard bastard bastard lamm there was daylight ahead through a glassedover sun deck of broad windows he jumped through some bigleaved plants growing in large pots and landed in a group of flimsy chairs set round a small table demolishing them fucking stupid bast lamm shut up kraiklyns voice broke in we cant hear the line of windows ahead went white cracking like ice then bursting out he dived through the space to skid over the fragments scattered on the deck beyond behind him the top and bottom of the shattered windows started to close slowly like a huge mouth you bastard you motherfu dammit change channels go to he slipped on the shards of glass almost falling only lamms voice sounded through his helmet now filling his ears with oaths which were mostly drowned in the smothering roar of the endless wreck behind he looked back just for a second to see lamm throwing himself between the jaws of the crumpling windows he careened over the deck falling and rolling then rising again still holding his gun as horza looked away it was only at that point he realised he no longer had his own gun he must have dropped it but he couldnt remember where or when horza was slowing down he was fit and strong but the abovestandard pull of vavatchs false gravity and the badly fitting suit were taking their toll he tried as he ran in something like a trance as his breath streamed back and forth through his wideopen mouth to imagine how close they had been to the bows for how long that immense weight of ship behind would be able to compress its front section as its billiontonne mass rammed into what must if it had filled the cloud bank they had seen earlier be a massive tabular iceberg as though in a dream horza could see the ship about him still wrapped in clouds and mist but lit from above by the wash of golden sunlight the towers and spires seemed unaffected the whole vast structure still sliding forward towards the ice as the kilometres of megaship behind them pressed forward with the vessels own titanic momentum he ran by game courts past tents of billowing silver through a pile of musical instruments ahead there was a huge tiered wall of more decks and above him were bridges swaying and thrashing as their bowward supports out of sight behind him came closer to the advancing wave of wreckage and were consumed he saw the deck to one side drop away into airy hazy nothing the deck under his feet started to rise slowly but for fifteen metres or more in front of him he was fighting his way up a slope growing steeper all the time a suspension bridge to his left collapsed wires flailing it disappeared into the golden mist the noise of its fall lost in the crushing din assaulting his ears his feet started to slide on the tilt of deck he fell landed heavily on his back and turned looking behind him against a wall of pure white towering higher than the olmedrecas tallest spire the megaship was throwing itself to destruction in a froth of debris and ice it was like the biggest wave in the universe rendered in scrap metal sculpted in grinding junk and beyond and about it over and through cascades of flashing glittering ice and snow swept down in great slow veils from the cliff of frozen water beyond horza stared at it then started to slide down towards it as the deck tilted him to his left a huge tower was collapsing slowly bowing to the breaking wave of compacted wreckage like a slave before a master horza felt a scream start in his throat as he saw decks and railings walls and bulkheads and frames he had only just run past start to crumple and smash and come towards him he rolled over sliding shards and skidding fragments to the buckling rail at the edge of the deck grabbed at the rails caught them heaved with both arms kicked with one foot and threw himself over the side he fell only one deck crashing into sloped metal winding himself he got to his feet as fast as he could sucking air through his mouth and swallowing as he tried to get his lungs to work the narrow deck he was on was also buckling but the foldpoint was between him and the wall of towering grinding wreckage he slipped and slid away from it down the sloping surface as the deck behind him rose into a peak metal tore and girders crashed out of the deck above like broken bones through skin a set of steps faced him leading to the deck hed just jumped from but to an area that was still level he scrambled up to the level deck which only then started to tip canting away from the wave front of debris as its front edge lifted crumpling he ran down the increasing slope water from shallow ornamental pools cascading around him more steps he hauled himself towards the next deck his chest and throat seemed filled with hot coals his legs with molten lead and all the time that awful nightmarish pull came from behind dragging him back towards the wreckage he stumbled and gasped his way from the top of the steps past the side of a broken drained swimming pool horza a voice yelled is that you horza its mipp look up horza lifted his head in the mist thirty metres above him was the cats shuttle he waved weakly at it staggering as he did so the shuttle lowered itself through the mist ahead of him its rear doors opening until it was hovering just over the next deck above ive opened the doors jump in mipp shouted horza tried to reply but could produce no sound apart from a sort of rasping wheeze he staggered on feeling as though the bones in his legs had turned to jelly the heavy suit bumped and crashed around him his feet slipped on the broken glass which covered the thrumming deck under his boots yet more steps towered ahead leading to the deck where the shuttle waited hurry up horza i cant wait much longer he threw himself at the steps hauled himself up the shuttle wavered in the air swivelling its open rear ramp pointing at him then away the steps beneath him shuddered the noise around him roared full of screams and crashes another voice was shouting in his ears but he couldnt make out the words he fell onto the upper deck lunged forward for the shuttle ramp a few metres away he could see the seats and lights inside lenipobras suited body slumped in one corner i cant wait ive mipp shouted above the scream of the wreckage and the other shouting voice the shuttle started to rise horza threw himself at it his hands caught the lip of the ramp just as it rose level with his chest he was hoisted from the deck swinging under outstretched arms and looking forward under the shuttles fuselage belly as the craft forced its way up into the air horza horza im sorry mipp sobbed youve got me horza yelled hoarsely what the shuttle was still climbing passing decks and towers and the thin horizontal lines of monorail tracks all horzas weight was taken by his fingers hooked in their gloves over the edge of the ramp door his arms ached im hanging onto the goddamn ramp you bastards screamed another voice it was lamm the ramp started to close the jerk almost broke horzas grip they were fifty metres up and climbing he saw the top part of the doors jawing down towards his fingers mipp he yelled dont close the door leave the ramp where it is and ill try to get in ok mipp said quickly the ramp stopped angling up halting at about twenty degrees horza began swinging his legs from side to side they were seventy eighty metres up facing away from the wave of wreckage and heading slowly away from it you black bastard come back lamm bellowed i cant lamm mipp cried i cant youre too close you fat bastard lamm hissed light flickered around horza the underside of the shuttle blazed in a dozen places as laser fire hit it something slammed into horzas left foot on the sole of his boot and his right leg was kicked out as his leg burned with pain mipp screamed incoherently the shuttle started to gather speed heading back over the megaship and diagonally across it the air roared around horzas body slowly tearing his grip away mipp slow down he shouted bastard lamm yelled again the mist to one side glowed as a fan of shortlived beams incandesced within it then the laser fire shifted and the shuttle sparkled again cracking with five or six small explosions around the front and nose section mipp howled the shuttle increased speed horza was still trying to swing one leg onto the sloped ramp but the clawed fingers of his gloves were slowly scraping along the roughened surface as his body was slipstreamed back behind the speeding craft lamm screamed a high gurgling sound which went through horzas head like an electric shock until the noise snapped off suddenly replaced for an instant by sharp cracking breaking noises the shuttle raced over the surface of the crashing megaship a hundred metres up horza felt the strength ebbing from his fingers and arms he looked through the helmet visor at the interior of the shuttle only a few metres away as millimetre by millimetre he slipped away from it the interior flashed once then an instant later blazed white blindingly unbearably his eyes closed instinctively and a burning yellow light came through his eyelids his helmet speakers made a sudden piercing inhuman noise like a machine screaming then cut out altogether the light faded slowly he opened his eyes the shuttle interior was still brightly lit but it was smouldering now too in the turbulent air whirling in from the open rear doors wisps of smoke were tugged from scorched seats singed straps and webbing and the crisped black skin on lenipobras exposed face shadows seemed to be burnt onto the bulkhead in front horzas fingers one by one came to the edge of the ramp my god he thought looking at the scorch marks and the smoke that maniac had a nuke after all then the shock wave hit it slapped him forward over the ramp and into the shuttle just before it hit the machine itself throwing it bucking and bouncing about the sky like a tiny bird caught in a storm horza was rattled about the interior from side to side trying desperately to grab hold of something to stop himself falling back out through the open rear doors his hand found some straps and fisted round them with the last of his strength back through the doors through the mist a huge rolling fireball was climbing slowly into the sky a noise like every clap of thunder he had ever heard vibrated through the hot hazed interior of the fleeing machine the shuttle banked throwing horza against one set of seats a big tower flashed by the open rear doors blocking out the fireball as the shuttle continued to turn the rear doors seemed to try to close then jammed horza felt heavy and hot inside his suit as the heat from the bombs flash seeped through from the surfaces which had been exposed to the initial fireball his right leg hurt badly somewhere below the knee he could smell burning as the shuttle steadied and its course straightened horza got up and limped forward to the door set in the bulkhead where the outlines of the seats and lenipobras slumped body now spreadeagled near the rear doors were burnt in frozen shadows onto the offwhite surface of the wall he opened the door and went through mipp was in the pilots seat hunched over the controls the monitor screens were blank but the view through the thick polarised glass of the shuttles windscreen showed cloud mist some towers sliding underneath and open sea beyond covered with yet more cloud thought you were dead mipp said thickly half turning towards horza mipp looked wounded crouched in his seat hunchbacked eyelids drooped sweat glistened on his dark brow there was smoke in the flight deck acrid and sweet at once horza took his helmet off and fell into the other seat he looked down at his right leg a neat blackrimmed hole about a centimetre across had been punched through the back of the suit calf matched by a larger and more ragged hole on the side he flexed the leg and winced just a muscle burn already cauterised he could see no blood he looked at mipp you all right he asked he already knew the answer mipp shook his head no he said in a soft voice that lunatic hit me leg and my back somewhere horza looked at the back of mipps suit near where it rested against the seat a hole in the bowl of the seat led to a long dark scar on the suit surface horza looked down at the flightdeck floor shit he said this things full of holes the floor was pitted with craters two were directly under mipps seat one laser shot had caused that dark scar on the side of the suit the other must have hit mipps body feels like that bastard shot me right up the ass horza mipp said trying to smile he did have a nuke didnt he thats what went off blew all the electrics away only the optic controls still working useless damn shuttle mipp let me take over horza said they were in cloud now only a vague coppery light showed through the crystal screen ahead mipp shook his head cant you couldnt fly this thing with it in this shape weve got to go back mipp the others might have cant theyll all be dead mipp said shaking his head and gripping the controls tighter staring through the screen god this things dying he looked round the blank monitors shaking his head slowly i can feel it shit horza said feeling helpless what about radiation he said suddenly it was a truism that in any properly designed suit if you survived the flash and blast youd survive the radiation but horza wasnt sure that his was a properly designed suit one of the many instruments it lacked was a radiation monitor and that was a bad sign in itself mipp looked at a small screen on the console radiation he shook his head nothing serious he said low on neutrons he grimaced with pain pretty clean bomb probably not what that bastard wanted at all he should take it back to the shop mipp gave a small strangled despairing laugh we have to go back mipp horza said he tried to imagine yalson running away from the wreckage with a better start than he and lamm had had he told himself shed have made it that when the bomb had gone off shed have been far enough away not to be injured by it and that the ship would finally stop the metal glacier of wreckage slowing and halting but how would she or any of the others get off the megaship if any of them had survived he tried the shuttles communicator but it was as dead as his suits you wont raise them mipp said shaking his head you cant raise the dead i heard them they cut off while they were running i was trying to tell them mipp they changed channels that was all didnt you hear kraiklyn they swapped channels because lamm was shouting so much mipp crouched in his seat shaking his head i didnt hear that he said after a moment that wasnt what i heard i was trying to tell them about the ice the size of it the height he shook his head again theyre dead horza they were well away from us mipp horza said quietly at least a kilometre they probably survived if they were in shadow if theyd run when we did they were further back theyre probably alive mipp weve got to go back and get them mipp shook his head cant horza they must be dead even neisin went off for a walk after you had all gone had to leave without him couldnt raise him they must be dead all of them mipp horza said it wasnt a very big nuke mipp laughed then groaned he shook his head again so what you didnt see that ice horza it was just then the shuttle lurched horza looked quickly to the screen but there was only the glowing light of the cloud they were flying through all around them oh god mipp whispered were losing it whats wrong horza asked mipp shrugged painfully everything i think were dropping but ive no altimeter no airspeed indicator communicator or nav gear nothing running rough because of all these holes and the doors being open were losing height horza asked looking at mipp mipp nodded you want to start throwing things out he said well throw things out might get us more height the shuttle lurched again youre serious horza said starting to get out of the seat mipp nodded were dropping im serious damn even if we did go back we couldnt take this thing over the edgewall not even with one or two of us just mipps voice trailed off horza levered himself painfully out of his seat and through the door in the passenger compartment there was smoke mist and noise the hazy light streamed through the doors he tried to tear the seats from the walls but they wouldnt move he looked at lenipobras broken body and burned face the shuttle lurched for a second horza felt lighter inside his suit he grabbed lenipobras suit by the arm and hauled the dead youth to the ramp he pushed the corpse over the ramp and the limp husk fell vanishing into the mist below the shuttle banked one way then the other almost throwing horza off his feet he found some other bits and pieces a spare suit helmet a length of thin rope an ag harness and a heavy gun tripod he threw them out he found a small fire extinguisher he looked round but there didnt seem to be any flames and the smoke hadnt got any worse he held onto the extinguisher and went through to the flight deck the smoke appeared to be clearing there too how are we doing he asked mipp shook his head dont know he nodded at the seat horza had been sitting in you can unlock that from the deck throw it out horza found the latches securing the seat to the deck he undid them and dragged the seat through the door to the ramp and threw it out along with the extinguisher there are catches on the walls near this bulkhead mipp called then grunted with pain he went on you can detach the wall seats horza found the catches and pushed first one line of seats then the other complete with straps and webbing along the rails fixed to the shuttle interior until they rolled out bouncing on the ramp edge and then spinning away into the glowing mist he felt the shuttle bank again the door between the passenger compartment and the flight deck slammed shut horza went forward to it it was locked mipp he shouted sorry horza mipps voice came weakly from the other side of the door i cant go back kraiklyn would kill me if he isnt dead already but i couldnt find them i just couldnt it was only luck i saw you mipp dont be crazy unlock the door horza shook it it wasnt strong he could break his way through it if he had to cant horza dont try to force the door ill point her nose straight down i swear it we cant be that high above the sea anyway i can hardly keep her flying as it is if you want try closing the doors manually there should be an access panel somewhere on the rear wall mipp for gods sake where are you going theyre going to blow the place up in a few days we cant fly for ever oh well ditch before that mipps voice came from behind the closed door he sounded tired well ditch before they blow the orbital up horza dont you worry this things dying but where are you going horza repeated shouting at the door dont know horza the far side maybe evanauth i dont know just away i there was a thump as though something had fallen to the floor and mipp cursed the shuttle juddered heeling over briefly what is it horza asked anxiously nothing mipp said i dropped the medkit thats all shit horza said under his breath and sat down back against the bulkhead dont worry horza ill ill do what i can yes mipp horza said he got to his feet again ignoring the ache of exhaustion in both legs and the stabbing pain in his right calf and went to the rear of the shuttle he looked for an access panel found one and prised it open it revealed another fire extinguisher he threw it out too on the other wall the panelled to a hand crank horza twisted the grip the doors started to close slowly then jammed he strained at the lever until it snapped he swore and threw it out as well just then the shuttle came clear of the mist horza looked down and saw the ruffled surface of a grey sea where slow waves rolled and broke the bank of mist lay behind them an indeterminate grey curtain beneath which the sea disappeared the sunlight slanted across the layered mist and hazy clouds filled the sky horza watched the broken handle tumble down towards the sea becoming smaller and smaller it stroked a mark of white across the water then it was gone he reckoned they were about one hundred metres above the sea the shuttle banked forcing horza to grab the side of the door the craft turned to head almost parallel to the cloud bank horza went to the bulkhead and banged on the door mipp i cant get the doors closed its all right the other man replied faintly mipp open the door dont be crazy leave me alone horza leave me alone understand goddamn horza said to himself he went back to the open doors buffeted by the wind curling back in from the slipstream they seemed to be heading away from the edgewall judging by the angle of the sun behind them lay nothing but sea and clouds there was no sign of the olmedreca or any other craft or ship the seemingly flat horizon to either side disappeared into a haze the ocean gave no impression of being concave only vast horza tried to stick his head round the corner of the shuttles open door to see where they were going the rush of air forced his head back before he could take a proper look and the craft lurched again slightly but he had an impression of another horizon as flat and featureless as that on either side he got further back into the shuttle and tried his communicator but there was nothing from his helmet speakers all the circuits were dead everything seemed to have been knocked out by the electromagnetic pulse from the explosion on the megaship horza considered taking the suit off and throwing it out too but he was already cold and if he took the suit off hed be virtually naked he would keep the device on unless they started losing height suddenly he shivered and his whole body ached he would sleep there was nothing he could do for now and his body needed rest he considered changing but decided against it he closed his eyes he saw yalson as he had imagined her running on the megaship and opened his eyes again he told himself she was all right just fine then closed his eyes once more maybe by the time he woke they would be out from under the layers of magnetised dust in the upper atmosphere in the tropical or even just temperate zones rather than the arctic region but that would probably mean only that they would finally ditch in warm water not cold he couldnt imagine mipp or the shuttle holding together long enough to complete a journey right across the orbital assume it was thirty thousand kilometres across they were making perhaps three hundred per hour his head full of changing figures horza slipped into sleep his last coherent thought was that they just werent going fast enough and probably couldnt they would still be flying over the circlesea towards land when the culture blew the whole orbital into a fourteen millionkilometre halo of light and dust horza woke rolling around inside the shuttle in the first few blurred seconds of his waking he thought he had already tumbled out of the rear door of the shuttle and was falling through the air then his head cleared and he found himself lying spreadeagled on the floor of the rear compartment watching the blue sky outside tilt as the shuttle banked the craft seemed to be travelling more slowly than he remembered he could see nothing from the rear view out of the doors except blue sky blue sea and a few puffy white clouds so he stuck his head round the side of the door the buffeting wind was warm and over in the direction the shuttle was banking lay a small island horza looked at it incredulously it was tiny surrounded by smaller atolls and reefs showing pale green through the shallow water and it had a single small mountain sticking up from concentric circles of lush green vegetation and bright yellow sand the shuttle dipped and levelled straightening on its course for the island horza brought his head back in resting the muscles of his neck and shoulder after the exertion of holding his head out in the slipstream the shuttle slowed yet more dipping again a slight juddering vibrated through the crafts frame horza saw a torus of limecoloured water appear in the sea behind the shuttle he stuck his head round the side of the door again and saw the island just ahead and about fifty metres below small figures were running up the beach which the shuttle was approaching a group of the humans were heading across the sand for the jungle carrying what looked like a huge pyramid of golden sand on a sort of litter or stretcher held on poles between them horza watched the scene slide by underneath there were small fires on the beach and long canoes at one end of the beach where the trees cut down towards the water there squatted a broadbacked shovelnosed shuttle perhaps two or three times the size of the cats the shuttle flew over the island through some vague grey pillars of smoke the beach was almost clear of people the last few who looked thin and almost naked ran into the cover of the trees as though afraid of the craft flying over them one figure lay sprawled on the sand near the module horza caught a glimpse of one human figure more fully clothed than the others not running but standing and pointing up towards him pointing towards the shuttle flying over the island with something in his hand then the top of the small mountain appeared just underneath the open shuttle door blocking off the view horza heard a series of sharp reports like small hard explosions mipp he shouted going to the closed door weve had it horza mipp said weakly from the other side there was a son of despairing jocularity in his voice even the natives arent friendly they looked frightened horza said the island was disappearing behind they werent turning back and horza felt the shuttle speeding up one of them had a gun mipp said he coughed then moaned did you see that shuttle horza asked yeah i saw it i think we should go back mipp horza said i think we ought to turn round no mipp said no i dont think we ought to i dont think thats a good idea horza i didnt like the look of the place mipp it looked dry what more do you want horza looked at the view through the rear doors the island was nearly a kilometre away already and the shuttle was still increasing speed gaining height all the time got to keep going horza head for the coast mipp well never get there itll take us four days at least and the cultures going to blow this place apart in three there was silence from the far side of the door horza shook its light grubby surface with his hand just leave it horza mipp screamed horza hardly recognised the mans hoarse shrill voice just leave it ill kill us both i swear the shuttle suddenly tilted pointing its nose at the sky and its open doors at the sea horza started to slide back his feet slipping on the shuttles floor he jammed the suit fingers into the wall slot the seats had been attached to hanging there as the shuttle started to stall in its steep climb all right mipp he shouted all right the shuttle fell sideslipping throwing horza forward and against the bulkhead he was suddenly heavy as the craft bottomed out of its short dive the sea slithered underneath only fifty or so metres below just leave me alone horza mipps voice said ok mipp horza said ok the shuttle rose a little gaining altitude and increasing speed horza went back away from the bulkhead which separated him from the flight deck and mipp horza shook his head and went to stand by the open door looking back towards the island with its lime shallows grey rock greenblue foliage and band of yellow sand it all slowly shrank the frame of the open shuttle doors filling with more and more sea and sky as the island lost itself in the haze he wondered what he could do and knew there was only one course of action there had been a shuttle on that island it could hardly be in a worse state than the one he was in now and their chances of being rescued at the moment were virtually nil he turned round to look at the flimsy door leading to the flight deck still holding onto the edge of the rear door the warm buffeting air spilling in around him he wondered whether just to charge straight in or to try to reason with mipp first while he was still thinking about it the shuttle gave a shudder then started to fall like a stone towards the sea the eaters horza was weightless for a second he felt himself caught by the eddying wind swirling through the rear doors drawing him towards them he grabbed at the channel in the wall he had held onto earlier the shuttle dipped its nose and the roar of the wind increased horza floated his eyes closed his fingers jammed into the wall slot waiting for the crash but instead the shuttle levelled out again and he was back on his feet mipp he shouted staggering forward to the door he felt the craft turning and glanced out through the rear doors they were still falling its gone horza mipp said faintly ive lost it he sounded weak calmly despairing im turning back for the island we wont get there but were going to hit in a few moments youd best get down by this bulkhead and brace yourself ill try to put her down as soft as i can mipp horza said sitting down on the floor with his back to the bulkhead is there anything i can do nothing mipp said here we go sorry horza brace yourself horza did exactly the opposite letting himself go limp the air roaring through the rear doors howled in his ears the shuttle shook underneath him the sky was blue he caught a glimpse of waves he kept just enough tension in his back to keep his head against the bulkhead surface then he heard mipp shout not words just a shout of fear an animal noise the shuttle crashed slamming into something forcing horza hard back against the wall then releasing him the craft raised its nose slightly horza felt light for a moment saw waves and white spray through the open rear doors then the waves went he saw sky and closed his eyes as the shuttles nose dipped again the craft smashed into the waves crashing to a stop in the water horza felt himself squashed into the bulkhead as though by the foot of some gigantic animal the wind was forced out of him blood roared the suit bit at him he was shaken and flattened and then just as the impact seemed to be over another shock sledgehammered into his back and neck and head and suddenly he was blind the next thing he knew there was water everywhere about him he was gasping and spluttering striking out in the darkness and hitting his hands off hard sharp broken surfaces he could hear water gurgling and his own choked breath frothing he blew water out of his mouth and coughed he was floating in a bubble of air in darkness in warm water most of his body seemed to be aching each limb and part clamouring with its own special message of pain he felt gingerly round the small space he was trapped in the bulkhead had collapsed he was at last in the flightdeck area with mipp he found the other mans body crushed between seat and instrument panel trapped and still half a metre under the surface of the water his head which horza could feel by reaching down between the seat headrest and what felt like the innards of the main monitor screen moved too easily in the neck of the suit and the forehead had been crushed the water was rising higher the air was escaping through the smashed nose of the shuttle floating and bobbing bowup in the sea horza knew he would have to swim down and back through the shuttles rear section and out through the rear doors otherwise hed be trapped he breathed as deeply as he could despite the pain for about a minute while the rising water level gradually forced his head into the angle between the top of the crafts instrument panel and the flightdeck ceiling he dived he forced his way down past the wreckage of the crushed seat mipp had died in and past the twisted panels of light metal which had made up the bulkhead he could see light vaguely greengrey forming a rectangle beneath him air trapped in his suit bubbled round him along his legs upwards to his feet he was slowed for a moment buoyed up by the air in his boots and for a second he thought he wasnt going to make it that he was going to hang there upsidedown and drown then the air bubbled out through the holes in his boots punched there by lamms laser and horza sank he struggled down through the water to the rectangle of light then swam through the open rear doors and into the shimmering green depths of the water under the shuttle he kicked and went up breaking out into the waves with a gasp sucking warm fresh air into his lungs he felt his eyes adjust to the slanted but still bright sunlight of late afternoon he grabbed hold of the shuttles dented punctured nose sticking above the water by about two metres and looked around trying to see the island but without success still just treading water and letting his battered body and brain recover horza watched the uptilted nose of the craft sink lower in the water and tip slowly forward so that the shuttle gradually floated almost level in the waves its top surface just awash the changer his arm muscles straining and hurting eventually hauled himself onto the top of the shuttle and lay there like a beached fish he started to shut off the pain signals like a weary servant picking up the litter of breakables after an employers destructive rage it was only lying there with small waves washing over the top surface of the shuttles fuselage that he realised that all the water he had been coughing up and swallowing was fresh it hadnt occurred to him that the circlesea would be anything other than salt like most planetary oceans but in fact there was not even the slightest tang of it and he congratulated himself that at least he would not die of thirst he stood up carefully in the centre of the shuttle roof waves breaking round his feet he looked around and could see the island just it looked very small and far away in the early evening light and while there was a faint warm breeze blowing more or less towards the island he had no idea which way any currents might be taking him he sat down then lay back letting the waters of the circlesea wash over the flat surface beneath him and break in small lines of surf against his muchdamaged suit after a while he just fell asleep not really meaning to but not stopping himself when he realised that he was telling himself to sleep for only an hour or so he woke up to see the sun though still high in the sky looking dark red as it shone through the layers of dust above the distant edgewall he got to his feet again the shuttle didnt seem to have sunk any lower in the water the island was still far away but it looked a little nearer than it had earlier the currents or the winds such as they were seemed to be carrying him in roughly the right direction he sat down again the air was still warm he thought of taking the suit off but decided against it it was uncomfortable but perhaps he would get too cold without it he lay back again he wondered where yalson was now had she survived lamms bomb and the wreck he hoped so he thought she probably had he couldnt imagine her dead or dying it was little enough to go on and he refused to believe he was superstitious but not being able to imagine her dead was somehow comforting shed survive take more than a tactical nuke and a billiontonne ship impacting a berg the size of a small continent to polish that girl off he found himself smiling remembering her he would have spent more time thinking about yalson but there was something else he had to think about as well tonight he would change it was all he could do probably by now it was irrelevant kraiklyn was either dead or if surviving unlikely ever to meet horza again but the changer had prepared for the transformation his body was waiting for it and he could think of nothing better to do the situation he told himself was far from hopeless he wasnt badly injured he seemed to be heading for the island where the shuttle might still be and if he could make it in time there was always evanauth and that damage game anyway the culture might be looking for him by now so it wouldnt do to keep the same identity for too long what the hell he thought he would change he would go to sleep as the horza the others knew him as and he would wake up as a copy of the captain of the clear air turbulence he prepared his bruised and aching body for the alteration as best he could relaxing muscles and readying glands and groups of cells sending deliberate signals from brain to body and face through nerves that only changers possessed he watched the sun dimming through red stages somewhere low over the ocean now he would sleep sleep and become kraiklyn take on yet another identity another shape to add to the many he had assumed already during his life maybe there was no point maybe he was only taking this new shape on to die in but he thought what have i got to lose horza watched the falling darkening red eye of the sun until he entered the sleep of changing and in that changing trance though his eyes were closed and beneath their lids also altering he seemed to see that dying glare still animal eyes predators eyes caged behind them looking out never sleeping being three people ownership rifle and ship and company not much yet maybe but one day with just a little little luck no more than everybody else had a right to one day he would show them he knew how good he was he knew what he was fit for and who was fit for him the rest were just tokens they were his because they were under his command it was his ship after all the women especially just game pieces they could come and go and he didnt care all you had to do with any of them was share their danger and they thought you were wonderful they couldnt see that for him there was no danger he had a lot left to do in life he knew he wasnt going to die some stupid squalid little combat death the galaxy one day would know his name and either mourn him or curse him when eventually he did have to die he hadnt decided yet whether it would be mourn or curse maybe it depended on how the galaxy treated him in the meantime all he needed was the tiniest break just the sort of thing the others had had the leaders of the bigger more successful better known more feared and respected free companies they must have had them they might seem greater than he was now but one day they would look up to him everybody would all would know his name kraiklyn horza woke in the dawn light still lying on the wavewashed shuttle roof like something washed up and spread upon a table he was half awake half asleep it was colder the light was thinner and more blue but nothing else had changed he started to drift back to sleep again away from pain and lost hopes nothing else had changed only him he had to swim for the island he had woken for the second time the same morning feeling different better rested the sun was angling up and out of the overhead haze the island was closer but he was going past it the currents were taking him and the shuttle away now having swept no closer than two kilometres to the group of reefs and sandbanks round the isle he cursed himself for sleeping so long he got out of the suit it was useless now and deserved to be ditched and left it lying on the still justawash shuttle roof he was hungry his stomach rumbled but he felt fit and ready for the swim he estimated it was about three kilometres he dived in and struck out powerfully his right leg hurt where hed been hit by lamms laser and his body still ached in places but he could do it he knew he could he looked back once after hed swum for a few minutes he could see the suit but not the shuttle the empty suit was like the abandoned cocoon of some metamorphosed animal riding opened and empty seeming just above the surface of the waves behind he turned away and kept swimming the island came closer but very slowly the water was warm at first but it seemed to get colder and the aches in his body increased he ignored them switching them off but he could feel himself slowing and he knew that hed started off too fast he paused treading water for a moment then after drinking a little of the warm fresh water set off again stroking more deliberately and steadily for the grey tower of the distant island he told himself how lucky hed been the shuttle crash hadnt injured him badly though the aches still plagued him like noisy relatives locked in a distant room disturbing his concentration the warm water though apparently getting colder was fresh so that he could drink from it and wouldnt dehydrate yet it crossed his mind that he would have been more buoyant had it been salty he kept going it ought to have been easy but it was getting more difficult all the time he stopped thinking about it he concentrated on moving the slow steady rhythmic beat of arms and legs forcing him through the water up waves over down up over down under my own power he told himself under my own power the mountain on the island grew larger very slowly he felt as though he was building it as though the effort required to make it appear larger in his sight was the same as if he was toiling to construct that peak heap it up rock by rock with his own hands two kilometres then one the sun angled rose eventually the outer reefs and shallows he passed them in a daze into shallower water a sea of aching an ocean of exhaustion he swam towards the beach through a fan of waves and surf radiating from the reefgap hed swum through and felt as though hed never taken the suit off as though he wore it still and it was stiff with rust or age or filled with heavy water or wet sand dragging stiffening pulling him back he could hear waves breaking on the beach and when he looked up he could see people on it thin dark people dressed in rags gathered round tents and fires or walking between them some were in the water ahead of him carrying baskets large openwork baskets which they held on their waists gathering things from the sea as they waded through it putting what they collected in their baskets they hadnt seen him so he swam on making a slow crawling motion with his arms and kicking feebly with his legs the people harvesting the sea didnt appear to notice him they kept on wading through the surf stooping occasionally to pick from the sands underneath their eyes sweeping and probing scanning and searching but too close in not seeing him his stroke slowed to a gasping dying crawl he could not lift his hands free of the water and his legs stayed paralysed then through the surf noise like something from a dream he heard several people shouting nearby and splashes coming close he was still swimming weakly when another wave lifted him and he saw several of the skinny people clad in loincloths and tattered tunics wading through the water towards him they helped horza in through the breaking waves over sunstreaked shallows and onto the golden sands he lay there while the thin and haggard people crowded round they talked quietly to each other in a language he hadnt heard before he tried to move but couldnt his muscles felt like lengths of limp rag hello he croaked he tried it in all the languages he knew but none seemed to work he looked into the faces of the people around him they were human but that word covered so many different species throughout the galaxy it was a continuing subject for debate who was and who wasnt human as in all too many matters the consensus of opinion was starting to resemble what the culture had to say on the subject the culture would lay down the law except of course that the culture didnt have any real laws about what being human was or how intelligent a particular species was while at the same time making clear that pure intelligence didnt really mean much on its own or on how long people should live though only as a rough guide naturally and people would accept these things without question because everybody believed the cultures own propaganda that it was fair unbiased disinterested concerned only with absolute truth and so on so were these people around him really human they were about horzas height they seemed to have roughly the same bone structure bilateral symmetry and respiratory system and their faces though each was different all had eyes mouth nose and ears but they all looked thinner than they ought to have been and their skin regardless of hue or shade looked somehow diseased horza lay still he felt very heavy again but at least he was on dry land on the other hand it didnt look as though there was much food on the island judging by the state of the bodies around him he assumed that was why they were so thin he raised his head weakly and tried to see through the clumps of thin legs towards the shuttle craft he had seen earlier he could just see the top of the machine sticking up above one of the large canoes beached on the sands its rear doors were open a smell wafted under horzas nose and made him feel sick he put his head down onto the sand again exhausted the talking stopped and the people turned their thin tanned or anyway dark bodies shuffling round to face up the beach a space opened in their ranks just above horzas head and try as he might he couldnt get up on one elbow or swivel his head to see what or who was coming he lay and waited then the people to his right all drew back and a line of eight men appeared on that side holding a long pole together in their left hands their other arms stuck out for balance it was the litter he had seen being carried into the jungle the day before when the shuttle had overflown the island he watched to see what it held two lines of men turned the litter so that it faced horza and set it down then all sixteen sat down looking exhausted horza stared on the litter sat the most enormous obscenely fat human horza had ever seen he had mistaken the giant for a pyramid of golden sand the previous day when he had seen the litter and its huge burden from the cats shuttle now he could see that his first impression had been close in shape if not in substance whether the vast cone of human flesh belonged to a male or a female horza couldnt tell great mammarylike folds of naked flesh spilled from the creatures upper and middle chest but they drooped over even more enormous waves of nude hairless torsofat which lay partly cradled in the vast beefs of the giants akimboed legs and partly overflowing those to droop into the canvas surface of the litter horza could see no stitch of clothing on the monster but no trace of genitals either whatever they were they were quite buried under rolls of goldenbrown flesh horza looked up to the head rising from a thick cone of neck gazing out over concentric ramparts of chins a bald dome of puffy flesh contained a limp and rambling length of pale lips a small button nose and slits where eyes must be the head sat on its layers of neck shoulder and chest fat like a great golden bell on top of a manydecked temple the sweatglistened giant suddenly moved its hands rolling them round on the end of the bloated fatbound balloons of its arms until the merely chubby fingers met and clasped as tightly as their size would allow as the mouth opened to speak another one of the skinny humans his rags slightly less tattered than those of the others moved into horzas field of vision just behind and to the side of the giant the bell of head moved a few centimetres to one side and swivelled round saying something to the man behind that horza couldnt catch then the giant raised his or her arms with obvious effort and gazed round the skinny humans gathered around horza the voice sounded like congealing fat being poured into a jug it was a drowning voice horza thought like something from a nightmare he listened but couldnt understand the language being used he looked round to see what effect the giants words were having on the famishedlooking crowd his head spun for a moment as though his brain had shifted while his skull stayed still he was suddenly back in the hangar of the clear air turbulence when the company had been looking at him and he had felt as naked and vulnerable as he did now oh not again he moaned in marain ohhoo said the golden rolls of flesh the voice tumbling over the slopes of fat in a faltering series of tones gracious our bounty from the sea speaks the hairless dome of head turned further round to the man standing by its side mr first isnt this wonderful the giant burbled fate is kind to us prophet the man said gruffly fate favours the beloved yes mr first it sends our enemies away and brings us bounty bounty from the sea fate be praised the great pyramid of flesh shook as the arms went higher trailing folds of paler flesh as the turretlike head went back the mouth opening to exposé a dark space where only a few small fangs glinted like steel when the bubbling voice spoke again it was in the language horza couldnt make out but it was the same phrase repeated over and over again the giant was quickly joined by the rest of the crowd who shook their hands in the air and chanted hoarsely horza closed his eyes trying to wake from what he knew was not a dream when he opened his eyes the skinny humans were still chanting but they were crowded around him again blocking out his view of the goldenbrown monster their faces eager their teeth bared their hands stretched out like claws the crowd of starving chanting humans fell on him they stripped off his shorts he tried to struggle but they held him down in his exhaustion he was probably no stronger than anyone of them and they had no difficulty pinning him they rolled him over pulled his hands behind him and tied them there then they tied his feet together and pulled his legs back until his feet were almost touching his hands and bound them to his wrists by a short length of rope naked trussed like an animal ready for the slaughter horza was dragged across the hot sand past a weakly burning fire then hauled upright and lowered over a short pole stuck into the beach so that it ran up between his back and his tied limbs his knees sank into the sand taking most of his weight the fire burned in front of him sending acrid woodsmoke into his eyes and the awful smell returned it seemed to come from various pots and bowls spread around the fire other fires and collections of pans were littered across the beach the huge pile of flesh the man named mr first had called prophet was set down near the fire mr first stood at the obese humans side staring at horza through deepset eyes contained within a pale and grubby face the golden giant on the litter clapped chubby hands together and said stranger gift of the sea welcome i am the great prophet fwisong the vast creature spoke a crude form of marain horza opened his mouth to tell them his name but fwisong continued you have been sent to us in our time of testing a morsel of human flesh on the tide of nothingness a harvestthing plucked from the tasteless wash of life a sweetmeat to share and be shared in our victory over the poisonous bile of disbelief you are a sign from fate for which we give thanks fwisongs huge arms lifted up rolls of shoulder fat wobbled on either side of the turretlike head nearly covering the ears fwisong shouted out in a language horza didnt know and the crowd echoed the phrase chanting it several times the fatsmothered arms were lowered again you are the salt of the sea oceangift fwisongs syrupy voice changed back into marain once more you are a sign a blessing from fate you are the one to become many the single to be shared yours will be the gaining gift the blessed beauty of transubstantiation horza stared horrified at the golden giant unable to think of anything to say what could you say to people like this horza cleared his throat still hoping to say something but fwisong went on be told then gift of the sea that we are the eaters the eaters of ashes the eaters of filth the eaters of sand and tree and grass the most basic the most loved the most real we have laboured to prepare ourselves for our day of testing and now that day is gloriously near the goldenskinned prophets voice grew shrill folds of fat shook as fwisongs arms opened out behold us then as we await the time of our ascension from this mortal plane with empty bellies and voided bowels and hungry minds fwisongs pudgy hands met in a slap the fingers interweaved like huge fattened maggots if i can croaked horza but the giant was talking to the crowd of grubby people again the voice bubbling out over the golden sands and the cooking fires and the dull malnourished people horza shook his head a little and looked out over the expanse of beach to the opendoored shuttle in the distance the more he looked at the craft the more certain he became it was a culture machine it was nothing he could pin down but he grew more certain with every moment spent looking at the machine he guessed it was a forty or fiftyseater just about big enough to take all the people he had seen on the island it didnt look particularly new or fast and it didnt look armed at all but something about the whole way its simple utilitarian form had been put together spoke of the culture if the culture designed an animaldrawn cart or an automobile they would still share something in common with the device at the far end of the beach for all the gulf of time between the epochs each represented it would have helped if the culture had used some sort of emblem or logo but pointlessly unhelpful and unrealistic to the last the culture refused to place its trust in symbols it maintained that it was what it was and had no need for such outward representation the culture was every single individual human and machine in it not one thing just as it could not imprison itself with laws impoverish itself with money or misguide itself with leaders so it would not misrepresent itself with signs all the same the culture did have one set of symbols it was very proud of and horza didnt doubt that if the machine he was looking at was a culture craft it would have some marain writing on or in it somewhere was it in some way connected with the mass of flesh still talking to the scrawny humans around the fire horza doubted it fwisongs marain was shaky and ill tutored horzas own grasp of the language was far from perfect but he knew enough about the tongue to realise fwisong did it some violence when he or she used it anyway the culture was not in the habit of loaning out its vehicles to religious nutcases was it here to evacuate them then lift them to safety when the cultures hightechnology shit hit the rotating fan that was the vavatch orbital with a sinking feeling horza realised this was probably the answer so there was no escape either these crazies sacrificed him or did whatever it was they were set on doing to him or it was a ride into captivity courtesy of the culture he told himself not to assume the worst after all he now looked like kraiklyn and it wasnt that likely the cultures minds had made all the correct connections between him the cat and kraiklyn even the culture didnt think of everything but they probably did know hed been on the hand of god they probably did know hed escaped from it they probably did know that the cat was in that volume at the time he recalled the statistics xoralundra had quoted to the hands captain yes the gcu must have won the battle he remembered the cats roughrunning warp motors probably producing a wake any selfrespecting gcu could track from centuries away damn it he wouldnt put it past them maybe they were testing everybody they were picking up from vavatch they would know in seconds from just a single sample cell a skin flake a hair for all he knew hed been sampled already a micromissile sent from the nearby shuttle picking up some tiny piece of tissue he dropped his head his neck muscles aching with all the others in his battered bruised exhausted body stop it he told himself thinking like a failure too damn sorry for yourself get yourself out of this still got your teeth and your nails and your brain just bide your time for lo fwisong warbled the godless ones the most hated the despisedbythedespised the atheists the anathematics have sent us this instrument of the nothingness the vacuum to us as the giant said those words horza looked up and saw fwisong point along the beach to the shuttle but we shall not waver in our faith we shall resist the lure of the nothingness between the stars where the godless ones the anathematised of the vacuum exist we shall stay part of what is a part of us we shall not treat with the great blasphemy of the material we shall stand as the rocks and trees stand firm rooted secure staunch unyielding fwisongs arms went out again and the voice bellowed out the gruffvoiced man with the dirty pale skin shouted something at the seated crowd and they shouted back the prophet smiled at horza from across the fire fwisongs mouth was a dark hole with four small fangs protruding when the lips formed a smile they shone in the sunlight this the way you treat all your guests horza said trying not to cough until the end of his sentence he cleared his throat fwisongs smile vanished guest you are not seawanton saltgift prize ours to keep mine to use bounty from the sea and the sun and the wind brought to us by fate heehee fwisongs smile returned with a girlish giggle and one of the huge hands went to cover the pale lips fate recognises its prophet sends him tasty treats just when some of my flock were having second thoughts too eh mr first the turrethead turned to the thin figure of the paler man standing with arms folded by the giants side mr first nodded fate is our gardener and our wolf it weeds out the weak to honour the strong so the prophet has spoken and the word which dies in the mouth lives in the ear fwisong said turning the huge head back to look at horza at least horza thought now i know its a male for whatever thats worth mighty prophet mr first said fwisong smiled wider but continued looking at horza mr first went on the seagift should see the fate that awaits him perhaps the treacherous coward twentyseventh oh yes fwisong clapped his huge hands together and a smile lit up his whole face for a second horza thought he saw small white eyes beyond the slits staring at him oh lets yes bring the coward let us do what must be done mr first spoke in ringing tones to the emaciated humans gathered around the fire a few stood up and walked off behind horza towards the forest the rest started singing and chanting after a few minutes horza heard a scream then a series of yells and screams gradually coming closer at last the people who had left came back carrying a short thick log much like the one horza was held by swinging on the pole was a young man screaming shouting in the language horza didnt understand and struggling horza saw drops of sweat and saliva fall from the young mans face and spot the sand the log was sharpened at one end that point was driven into the sand on the opposite side of the fire from horza so that the young man faced the changer this my libation from the seas fwisong said to horza pointing at the young man who was quivering and moaning his eyes rolling about in their sockets and his lips dribbling this is my naughty boy called twentyseventh since his rebirth this was one of our respected much loved sons one of our anointed one of our fellow morsels one of our brotherly taste buds on the great tongue of life fwisongs voice chortled with laughter as he spoke as though he knew the absurdity of the part he was playing and couldnt resist hamming it up this splinter from our tree this grain from our beach this reprobate dared to run towards the seventimescursed vehicle of the vacuum he spurned the gift of burden with which we honoured him he chose to abandon us and flee across the sands when the alien enemy passed over us yesterday he did not trust our salving grace but turned instead to an instrument of darkness and nothingness towards the soaking shade of the soulless ones the anathematics fwisong looked at the man still shaking on the post across the fire from horza the prophets face went stern with reproach by the workings of fate the traitor who ran from our side and put his prophets life at risk was caught so that he might learn his sad mistake and make good his terrible crime fwisongs arm dropped the vast head shook mr first shouted to the people round the fire they faced the young man called twentyseventh and chanted the ghastly smells horza had sensed earlier came back making his eyes mist and his nose tingle while the people chanted and fwisong watched mr first and two of the women followers dug up small sacks from the sand out of them they brought some thin lengths of cloth which they proceeded to wrap round their bodies as mr first put his vestments on horza saw a large cumbersomelooking projectile pistol held in a string holster beneath the mans grubby tunic horza presumed that was the gun fired at the shuttle the day before when he and mipp had overflown the island the young man opened his eyes saw the three people in their cloths and started screaming hear how the stricken soul cries out for its lesson pleads for its bounty of regret its solace of refreshing suffering fwisong smiled looking at horza our child twentyseventh knows what awaits him and while his body already proved so weak breaks before the storm his soul cries out yes yes mighty prophet succour me make me part of you give me your strength come to me is it not a sweet and uplifting sound horza looked into the prophets eyes and said nothing the young man went on screaming and trying to tear himself away from the stump mr first was crouched before him on his knees his head bowed muttering to himself the two women dressed in the dull cloth were preparing bowls of steaming liquid from the vats and pots around the fire warming some over the flames the smells came to horza turning his stomach fwisong switched to the other language and spoke to the two women they looked at horza then came up to him with the bowls horza drew his head away as they shoved the containers under his nose he wrinkled his face up in disgust at what looked and smelled like fish entrails in a sauce of excrement the women took the awful stuff away it left a stink in his nose he tried breathing through his mouth the young mans mouth had been wedged open with blocks of wood and his choking screams altered in pitch while mr first held him the women ladled the liquids from the bowls into his mouth the young man spluttered and wailed choked and tried to spit he moaned then threw up let me show you my armoury my benefaction fwisong said to horza and reached behind his vast body he brought back a large bundle of rags which he startled to unfold glittering in the sunlight metal devices like tiny mantraps were revealed fwisong put one finger to his lips while he surveyed the collection then picked up one of the small metal contraptions he put it into his mouth fitting both pans over the pins horza had seen earlier zhare fwisong said raising his mouth in a broad smile towards the changer whatoo you shink of zhat the artificial teeth sparkled in his mouth rows of sharp serrated points or zhese fwisong swapped them for another set full of tiny fangs like needles then another with angled teeth like hooks with barbs then another with holes set in them goo eh he smiled at horza leaving the last pair in he turned to mr first wha you shink nishtur shursht ehs or fwisong took out the set with the holes put in another set like long bladelike spades zheze a ink eeg a rar ah nishe esh rert ush zhtart wish eez rets punish zhoze naughty tootsiesh twentysevenths voice was becoming hoarse one of his legs was lifted out in front of him and held by four kneeling men fwisong was lifted and carried on the liner to just in front of the young man he bared the bladeteeth then leaned forward and with a quick nodding motion bit off one of twentysevenths toes horza looked away in the next halfhour or so of leisurely paced eating the enormous prophet nibbled at various bits of twentysevenths body attacking the extremities and the few remaining fat deposits with his various sets of teeth the young man gained fresh breath with each new site of butchery horza watched and didnt watch sometimes trying to think himself into a kind of defiance that would let him work out a way to get back at this grotesque distortion of a human being at other times just wanting the whole awful business to be over and done with fwisong left his exdisciples fingers until last then used the teeth with the holes in like wirestrippers ery asty he said wiping his bloodstained face with one gigantic forearm twentyseventh was cut down moaning covered in streaks of blood and only semiconscious he was gagged with a length of rag then pinned down flat face up on the sand wooden spikes through the palms of his mangled hands and a huge boulder crushing his feet he started screaming weakly again through the gag when he saw the prophet fwisong on his litter being carried over towards him fwisong was lowered almost on top of the moaning form then he struggled with some cords at the side of his litter until a small flap under his great bulk flopped open over the face of the gagged bloodspattered human on the sand beneath the prophet gave a sign and he was lowered on top of the man quieting the sound of moaning the prophet smiled and settled himself with little movements of his huge body like a bird nestling down over its eggs his vast bulk obliterating all trace or shape of the human under him fwisong hummed to himself while the emaciated crowd looked on singing very slowly and quietly swaying together as they stood fwisong started to rock backwards and forwards softly very slowly at first then faster as sweat appeared in beads on the golden dome of his face he panted and made a rough gesture towards the crowd the two women dressed in the lengths of cloth came forward and started to lick at the trickles of blood which had spilled from the prophets mouth over the folds of his chins and down the expanse of his chest and breasts like red milk fwisong gasped seemed to sag and stay still for a moment and then with a surprisingly fast and fierce motion clouted both the lapping women across the head with his mighty arms the women scurried off rejoining the crowd mr first started a louder chant which the others took up at last fwisong ordered himself to be lifted again the litter bearers hauled his massive frame into the air to reveal the crushed body of twentyseventh his moaning silenced for ever they lifted him out beheaded the corpse and removed the top of the skull they ate his brains and it was only then that horza threw up and now we are become each other fwisong intoned solemnly to the youths hollow head then threw its bloody bowl over his shoulder into the fire the rest of the body was taken down to the sea and thrown in only ceremony and the love of fate distinguish us from the beasts o mark of fates devotion fwisong warbled to horza as the prophets vast body was cleaned and perfumed by the attendant women tied to his post stuck in the ground his mouth fouled horza breathed carefully and deliberately and did not try to reply twentysevenths body floated slowly out to sea fwisong was towelled down the skinny humans sat about listlessly or tended the awfulsmelling liquid in the bubbling vats mr first and his two women helpers took off their lengths of cloth leaving the man in his grimy but whole tunic and the women in their tattered rags fwisong had his litter placed on the sand in front of horza see bounty from the waves harvest from the rolling ocean my people prepare to break their fast the prophet swept one fatwobbling arm about to indicate the people tending the fires and cauldrons the smell of rotting food filled the air they eat what others leave what others will not touch because they want to be closer to the fabric of fate they eat the bark from the trees and the grass from the ground and the moss from the rocks they eat the sand and the leaves and the roots and the earth they eat the shells and the entrails of seaanimals and the carrion of the land and the ocean they eat their bodily products and share mine i am the fount i am the wellspring the taste on their tongues you bubble of froth on the ocean of life are a sign crop of the ocean you will come to see before the time of your unmaking that you are all you have eaten and that food is merely undigested excrement this i have seen this you will see one of the attendant women came back from the sea with fwisongs freshly cleaned sets of teeth he took them from her and put them in the rags somewhere behind him all shall fall but we all go to their deaths their unmakings we alone will be made in our unmaking brought into the glory of our ultimate consummation the prophet sat smiling at horza while around him as the long afternoons shadows drew out across the sands the emaciated illlooking people sat down to their foul meals horza watched them try to eat some did encouraged by mr first but most could keep nothing down they gasped for breath and gulped at the liquids but often as not they vomited up what they had just forced down fwisong looked on them sadly shaking his head you see even my closest children are not ready yet we must pray and entreat that they are ready when the time comes as it must in a few days time we must hope that their bodies lack of grasp of sympathy with all things will not make them despised in the eyes and mouth of god you fat bastard youre within range if you only knew i could blind you from here spit in your little eyes and maybe but horza thought maybe not the giants eyes were set so deep within the flabby skin of his brows and cheeks that even the venomous spittle with which horza could have hit the golden monster might not find its way to the membranes of the eye but it was all horza could find to give him solace in his situation he could spit at the prophet and that was it perhaps there would come a point when it might make some difference but to do it now would be stupid a blind enraged fwisong struck horza as something to try to avoid even more than a sighted tittering one fwisong talked on to horza never questioning never really stopping repeating himself more and more often he told him about his revelations and his past life as a circus freak then as a palace pet for some alien satrap on a megaship then as a convert to a fashionable religion on another megaship his revelation occurring there when he persuaded a few converts to join him on an island to await the end of all things more followers had arrived when the culture announced what the fate of the vavatch orbital was going to be horza was only half listening his mind racing as he tried to think of a way out we await the end of all things the last day we prepare ourselves for our final consummation by mixing the fruits of earth and sea and death with our fragile bodies of flesh and blood and bone you are our sign our aperitif our scent you must feel honoured mighty prophet horza said swallowing hard and doing his best to keep his voice calm fwisong stopped talking the eyes narrowing still further and a frown forming horza went on i am indeed your sign i bring you myself i am the follower the disciple numbered last i come to rid you of the machine from the vacuum horza looked over at the culture shuttle sitting with its rear doors open at the far end of the beach i know how to remove this source of temptation let me prove to you my devotion by performing this small service for your great and majestic self then you will know i am your last and most faithful servant the one numbered last the one come before the unmaking to to steel your followers for the test to come and remove the anathematics temptation device i have mixed with the stars and the air and ocean and i bring you this message this deliverance horza stopped there his throat and lips dry his eyes running as the highly spiced stench of the eaters food drifted on a light breeze around him fwisong sat quite still on his litter looking into horzas face with his sliteyes narrowed and his bulbous brows creased mr first fwisong said turning to where the paleskinned man in the tunic was massaging one of the eaters bellies while the unfortunate follower lay moaning on the ground mr first rose and came over to the giant prophet who nodded at horza and spoke in the language the changer couldnt understand mr first bowed slightly then went behind horza taking something from under his tunic as he went out of the changers field of view horzas heart thudded he looked desperately back at fwisong what had the prophet said what was mr first going to do hands appeared over horzas head gripping something the changer closed his eyes a rag was tied tightly over his mouth it smelled of the foul food his head was forced back against the stake then mr first went back to the prone groaning eater horza stared at fwisong who said there now as i was saying horza didnt listen the fat prophets cruel faith was little different from a million others only the degree of its barbarity made it unusual in these supposedly civilised times another side effect of the war maybe blame the culture fwisong talked but there was no point in listening horza recalled that the cultures attitude to somebody who believed in an omnipotent god was to pity them and to take no more notice of the substance of their faith than one would take of the ramblings of somebody claiming to be emperor of the universe the nature of the belief wasnt totally irrelevant along with the persons background and upbringing it might tell you something about what had gone wrong with them but you didnt take their views seriously that was the way horza felt about fwisong he had to treat him as the maniac he obviously was the fact that his insanity was dressed in religious trappings meant nothing no doubt the culture would disagree claiming that there was ample common ground between insanity and religious belief but then what else could you expect from the culture the idirans knew better and horza while not agreeing with everything the idirans stood for respected their beliefs their whole way of life almost their every thought was illuminated guided and governed by their single religionphilosophy a belief in order place and a kind of holy rationality they believed in order because they had seen so much of its opposite first in their own planetary background taking part in the extraordinarily fierce evolutionary contest on idir and then when they finally entered into the society of their local stellar cluster around them between and amongst other species they had suffered because of that lack of order they had died by the millions in stupid greedinspired wars in which they became involved through no fault of their own they had been naive and innocent overdependent on others thinking in the same calm rational way they always did they believed in the destiny of place certain individuals would always belong in certain places the high ground the fertile lands the temperate isles whether they had been born there or not and the same applied to tribes clans and races and even to species most of the ancient holy texts had proved sufficiently flexible and vague to cope with the discovery that the idirans were not alone in the universe the texts which had claimed otherwise were promptly ditched and their authors were first ritually cursed and then thoroughly forgotten at its most mundane the belief could be expressed as the certainty that there was a place for everything and everything ought to be in its place once everything was in its place god would be happy with the universe and eternal peace and joy would replace the current chaos the idirans saw themselves as agents in this great reordering they were the chosen at first allowed the peace to understand what god desired and then goaded into action rather than contemplation by the very forces of disorder they gradually understood they had to fight god had a purpose beyond study for them they had to find their own place in the whole galaxy at least perhaps even outside that as well the more mature species could look to their own salvation they had to make their own rules and find their own peace with god and it was a sign of his generosity that he was happy with their achievements even when they denied him but the others the swarming chaotic struggling peoples they needed guidance the time had come to do away with the toys of selfinterested striving that the idirans had realised this was the sign of it in them and in the word that was their inheritance from the divine the spell within their genetic inheritance a new message was abroad grow up behave prepare horza didnt believe in the idirans religion any more than balveda had and indeed he could see in its overdeliberate tooplanned ideals exactly the sort of lifeconstricting forces he so despised in the cultures initially more benign ethos but the idirans relied on themselves not on their machines and so they were still part of life to him that made all the difference horza knew the idirans would never subdue all the lessdeveloped civilisations in the galaxy their dreamedof day of judgement would never come but the very certainty of that ultimate defeat made the idirans safe made them normal made them part of the general life of the galaxy just one more species which would grow and expand and then finding the plateau phase all nonsuicidal species eventually arrived at settle down in ten thousand years the idirans would be just another civilisation getting on with their own lives the current era of conquests might be fondly remembered but it would be irrelevant by then explained away by some creative theology they had been quiet and introspective before so they would be again in the end they were rational they listened to common sense before their own emotions the only thing they believed without proof was that there was a purpose to life that there was something which was translated in most languages as god and that that god wanted a better existence for his creations at the moment they pursued this goal themselves believed themselves to be the arms and hands and fingers of god but when the time came they would be able to assimilate the realisation that theyd got it wrong that it was not up to them to bring about the final order they would themselves become calm they would find their own place the galaxy and its many and varied civilisations would assimilate them the culture was different horza could see no end to its policy of continual and escalating interference it could easily grow for ever because it was not governed by natural limitations like a rogue cell a cancer with no off switch in its genetic composition the culture would go on expanding for as long as it was allowed to it would not stop of its own accord so it had to be stopped this was a cause he had long ago decided to devote himself to horza told himself listening to fwisong droning on also a cause he would serve no more if he didnt get away from the eaters fwisong talked for a little longer then after a word from mr first had his litter turned round so that he could address his followers most of them were either being very ill or looking it fwisong switched to the local language horza didnt understand and gave what was evidently a sermon he ignored the occasional bout of vomiting from his flock the sun dipped lower over the ocean and the day cooled the sermon over fwisong sat silently on his litter as one by one the eaters came up to him bowed and spoke earnestly to him the prophets domelike head wore a large smile and every now and again it would nod with what looked like agreement later the eaters sang and chanted while fwisong was washed and oiled by the two women who had helped officiate at twentysevenths death then his vast body gleaming in the rays of the falling sun fwisong was carried waving cheerfully off the beach and into the small forest beneath the islands single stunted mountain fires were stoked and wood was brought the eaters dispersed to their tents and camp fires or set off in small groups with crudely made baskets apparently to gather fresh debris they would later try to eat at about sunset mr first joined the five quiet eaters who sat around the fire horza was by now tired of facing the emaciated humans had taken little or no notice of the changer but mr first came and sat near the man tied to the post in one hand he held a small stone in the other some of the artificial teeth fwisong had used on twentyseventh earlier that day mr first sat grinding and polishing the teeth while he talked to the other eaters after a couple of them had gone to their tents mr first went behind horza and undid the gag horza breathed through his mouth to get rid of the stale taste and exercised his jaw he shifted trying to ease the accumulating aches in his arms and legs comfortable mr first said squatting down again he continued to sharpen the metal fangs they flickered in the firelight ive felt better horza said youll feel worse too friend mr first made the last word sound like a curse my names horza i dont care what your name is mr first shook his head your name doesnt matter you dont matter i had started to form that impression horza admitted oh had you mr first said he got up and came closer to the changer had you really he lashed out with the steel teeth he held in his hand catching horza across the left cheek think youre clever eh think youre going to get out of this do you he kicked horza in the belly horza gasped and choked see you dont matter youre just a hunk of meat thats all anybody is just meat and anyway he kicked horza again pain isnt real just chemicals and electrics and that sort of thing right oh horza croaked his wounds aching briefly yes right ok mr first grinned you remember this tomorrow ok youre just a piece of meat and the prophets a bigger one you ah dont believe in souls then horza said diffidently hoping this wouldnt lead to another kick fuck your soul stranger mr first laughed youd better hope theres no such thing theres people that are natural eaters and theres those that are always going to get eaten and i cant see that their souls are going to be any different so as youre obviously one of those that are always going to get eaten youd better hope there isnt any such thing thats your best bet believe me mr first brought out the rag he had taken from horzas mouth he tied it back there saying no no soul at all would be the best thing for you friend but if it turns out you have got one you come back and tell me so i can have a good laugh right mr first pulled the knotted rag tight hauling horzas head against the wooden stake fwisongs lieutenant finished sharpening the sets of gleaming metal teeth then rose and spoke to the other eaters sitting around the fire after a while they went to some of the small tents and soon they were all off the beach leaving only horza to watch the few dying fires the waves crashed softly on the distant surfline stars arced slowly above and the dayside of the orbital was a bright line of light overhead shining in the starlight and the olight the silent waiting bulk of the culture shuttle sat its rear doors open like a cave of safe darkness horza had already tested the knots restraining his hands and feet shrinking his wrists wouldnt work the rope twine or whatever they had used was tightening very slightly all the time it would just take up the slack as quickly as he could produce it perhaps it shrank when drying and they had wet it before tying him he couldnt tell he could intensify the acid content in his sweat glands where the rope touched his skin and that was always worth a try but even the long night of vavatch probably wouldnt give enough time for the process to work pain isnt real he told himself crap he awoke at dawn along with several of the eaters who walked slowly down to the water to wash in the surf horza was cold he started shivering as soon as he woke and he could tell that his body temperature had dropped a long way during the night in the light trance required for altering the skin cells on his wrists he strained at the ropes testing for some give the slightest tearing of fibres or strands there was nothing just more pain from the palms of his hands where some sweat had run down onto skin unchanged and therefore unprotected from the acid his sweat glands had been producing he worried about that for about a second recalling that if he was ever to impersonate kraiklyn properly he would need to lift the mans finger and palm prints and so would need his skin in perfect changing condition then he laughed at himself for worrying about that when he wasnt even likely to see the day out he vaguely considered killing himself it was possible with only a little internal preparation he could use one of his own teeth to poison himself but while there was still any chance he could not bring himself to think of it seriously he wondered how culture people faced the war they were supposed to be able to decide to die too though it was said to be more complicated than simple poison but how did they resist it those soft peacepampered souls he imagined them in combat autoeuthenising almost the instant the first shots landed the first wounds started to appear the thought made him smile the idirans had a death trance but it was only for use in cases of extreme shame and disgrace or when a lifes work was completed or a crippling disease threatened and unlike the culture or the changers they felt their pain to the full undampened by genofixed inhibitors the changers regarded pain as a semiredundant hangover from their animal evolution the culture was simply frightened of it but the idirans treated it with a sort of proud contempt horza looked across the beach over the two big canoes towards the open rear doors of the shuttle a pair of brightly coloured birds were strutting around on its top making little ritualised movements horza watched them for a while as the eaters camp gradually woke up and the morning sun brightened mist rose from the thin forest and there were a few clouds high up in the sky mr first came yawning and stretching out of his tent then took the heavy projectile pistol out from under his tunic and fired it in the air this seemed to be a signal for all the eaters to wake and set about their daily business if they hadnt already done so the noise of the crude weapon frightened the two birds on the roof of the culture shuttle they took to the air and flew away over the trees and shrubs around the island horza watched them go then let his eyes drop staring at the golden sand and breathing slow and deep your big day stranger mr first said with a grin coming up to the changer he put the pistol into the string holster under his tunic horza looked at the man but said nothing another feast in my honour he thought mr first walked around horza looking down at him horza followed him with his eyes where he could and waited for the man to spot whatever damage the acidsweat had succeeded in inflicting on the rope round his wrists but mr first didnt notice anything and when he reappeared in horzas view he was still smiling slightly nodding his head a little seemingly satisfied that the man tied to the stake was still well enough restrained horza did his best to stretch straining at the bonds at his wrists there was not even a hint of give it hadnt worked mr first left to supervise the launching of a fishing canoe fwisong was brought out of the forest on his litter not long before noon as the fishing canoe was returning gift of the seas and air tribute of the great circleseas vast wealth see what a wondrous day awaits you now fwisong had himself brought up to horza and was put down to one side of the fire he smiled at the changer all the night you have had time to think of what the day now holds for all the darkness you have been able to look into the fruits of the vacuum you have seen the spaces between the stars seen how much there is of nothing how little there is of anything now you can appreciate what an honour lies in store for you how lucky you are to be my sign my offering fwisong clapped his hands with delight and his enormous body shook up and down the chubby hands went to his mouth as he spoke and the folds of flesh over his eyes lifted momentarily to reveal the whites within hohoo what fun we all shall have the prophet made a sign and his litter carriers took him down to the sea to be washed and anointed horza watched the eaters prepare their food they gutted the fish throwing away the meat and keeping the offal and skins heads and spikes they removed the shells from the animals inside and threw the animals away they ground up the shells with the weeds and some brightly coloured sea slugs horza watched all this happen in front of him and saw just how rundown the eaters really were the scabs and sores the deficiency diseases and general weakness the colds and coughs peeling skin and partly deformed limbs all spoke of a very gradually fatal diet the dead meat and animals from the sea were returned to the waves via great bloodsoaked baskets horza watched as closely as his gag and the distance would allow but none of the eaters seemed to take a surreptitious bite of the raw meat as they threw it from the baskets into the waves fwisong being dried on the sand just up the beach from the line of breakers watched the food being thrown into the sea and nodded with approval speaking quiet words of encouragement to his flock then he clapped his hands and the litter was slowly carried along the beach to the fire and the changer offertory thing benefaction prepare yourself fwisong warbled settling down in his litter with little movements which sent ripples all over the great folds and sweeps of his massive body horza started to breathe harder felt his heart pound he swallowed and strained again at the rope holding his hands mr first and the two women were digging at the sand for the thin robes in their buried sacks all the eaters gathered round the fire facing horza their eyes looked black or vaguely interested nothing more there was a listlessness about their actions and expressions which horza found even more depressing than outright hatred or sadistic glee would have been the eaters began to chant and sing mr first and the two women were twisting the dull lengths of cloth around their bodies mr first looked at horza and grinned oh happy moment in the ending days fwisong said raising his voice and hands his choked tones ringing out towards the centre of the island the smells of the eaters foul cooking drifted past the changer again let this ones unmaking and making be a symbol for us fwisong continued letting his arms drop back in enormous rolls of white flesh the goldenbrown surfaces gleamed in the sunlight as the prophet clasped his fat fingers together let his pain be our delight as our unmaking shall be our joining let his flaying and consummation be our satisfaction and delectation fwisong raised his head and spoke loudly in the language the others understood their chanting altered and grew louder mr first and the two women approached horza horza felt mr first take the gag from his mouth the paleskinned man spoke to the two women who went to the bubbling vats of stinking liquid horzas head was feeling very light there was a taste he knew too well at the back of his throat as though some of the acid from his wrists had somehow found its way to his tongue he strained again at his bonds behind him feeling the muscles shake the chanting went on the women were ladling the foul broth into bowls his empty stomach was churning already there are two main ways to escape bonds apart from those open to nonchangers the academys lecture notes said by acidsweat pulse on a sustained level where the binding material is susceptible to such an attack and by malleable preferential tapering of the limbpoint involved horza tried to coax a little more strength from his tired muscles excessive acidsweating can damage not only the adjacent skin surfaces but also the body as a whole through dangerously altered chemical imbalances overmuch tapering poses the risk of the muscles being so wasted and the bone so weakened that their subsequent use may be severely restricted in the short and longterm escape attempt mr first was approaching with the wooden blocks he would fit into horzas mouth a couple of the larger eaters had stood up near the front of the crowd and advanced slightly ready to assist mr first fwisong was reaching behind his back the women started forward from the bubbling vats open wide stranger mr first said holding out the two wooden blocks or do we use a crowbar mr first smiled horzas arms strained his upper arm moved mr first saw the movement and halted momentarily one of horzas hands jerked free it shot round in an instant nails ready to rake mr firsts face the paleskinned man drew back not quickly enough horzas nails caught mr firsts robe and tunic as they flapped out from his dodging body already straining as far out from the stake as he could horza felt his clawed hand rip through the two layers of material without connecting with the flesh underneath mr first staggered back bumping into one of the women carrying the bowls of stinking gruel knocking it from her hands one of the wooden wedges sailed from mr firsts hand and landed in the fire horzas arm completed its swing just as the two eaters in the front of the crowd came forward quickly and caught the changer by the head and arm sacrilege fwisong screamed mr first looked at the woman he had bumped into at the fire at the prophet then back with a furious look at the changer he lifted one arm to look at the tears in his robe and tunic the giftfilth desecrates our vestments fwisong shouted the two eaters held horza pinning his arm back where it had been and his head to the stake mr first started towards horza taking the gun out from under his tunic and holding it by the barrel like a club mr first fwisong snapped stopping the paleskinned man in his tracks shtand gack hold gat am out eell show gish naught goy how we geel wish hish short horzas free arm was straightened out in front of him one of the eaters holding him put his leg round the back of the post bracing himself there and trapping horzas other hand where it was fwisong had a set of gleaming steel teeth in his mouth the holed ones he glared at the changer while mr first stepped back still holding the projectile pistol the prophet nodded to another two eaters in the crowd they took horzas hand and prised the fingers apart tying that wrist to a pole horza felt his whole body shake he cut off all feeling in that hand naughty naughty gisht rom the shee fwisong said he leant forward buried horzas index finger in his mouth closed the stripper teeth over them cutting into the flesh and then pulled quickly back the prophet chewed and swallowed watching the changers face as he did so and frowning not gery tashty genegiction rom the oceansh currentsh the prophet licked his lips an not shore enush or you eisher sho it wood sheen letch shee ot elsh nee can fwisong was frowning again horza looked past the eaters holding him to the hand stretched out over the pole one finger stripped bare the bones limp blood dripping from the thin tip beyond that fwisong sat frowning on his litter on the sand mr first near his side still glaring at horza and holding the gun barrel as fwisongs silence continued mr first looked at the prophet fwisong said not elsh nee can nee can fwisong reached up and took the stripper teeth with some difficulty from his mouth he laid them in front of him with the rest on their rag and put one pudgy hand to his throat the other onto the vast hemisphere of his belly mr first looked on then back at horza who did his best to smile the changer opened his teeth glands and sucked poison mr first fwisong began then put out the hand on his belly towards the other man mr first seemed uncertain what to do he transferred the gun from one hand to the other and took the prophets offered hand with his free one i think i i fwisong said as his eyes started to open from slits to small ovals horza could see his face changing colour already soon the voice as the vocal cords react help me mr first fwisong took hold of a lump of fat round his throat as though trying to undo a scarf tied too tightly he stuck his fingers into his mouth down his throat but horza knew that wouldnt work the prophets stomach muscles were already paralysed he couldnt vomit the poison up fwisongs eyes were wide now glaring white his face was going greyblue mr first was goggling at the prophet and still holding his huge hand his own was buried somewhere inside the great golden fist of fwisongs hellp squeaked the prophet then nothing but choking noises the white eyes bulged the vast frame shook the domehead went blue somebody in the crowd started screaming mr first looked at horza and brought up the big pistol horza tensed then spat with all his might the spittle splashed across mr firsts face from mouth to one ear in a sickle shape which just took in one eye mr first staggered back horza breathed in sucked more poison then spat and blew at the same time landing a second burst of spittle right across mr firsts eyes mr first clutched at his face dropping the gun his other hand was still caught in fwisongs grip as the obese prophet shook and quivered his eyes wide but seeing nothing the people holding horza wavered he could feel it in them more people in the crowd were crying out horza jerked his body and snarled spitting again at one of the men holding the pole his hand was tied to the man screamed shrilly and fell back the others let go of him or the pole and ran fwisong was going blue from the neck down still quivering and clutching his throat with one hand and mr first with the other mr first was on his knees his face lowered moaning as he tried to wipe the spittle from his face and remove the unbearable burning from his eyes horza looked round quickly the eaters were watching either their prophet and his chief disciple or him but they werent doing anything either to aid them or to stop him not all of them were crying or screaming some were still chanting quickly and fearfully as though something they could say would stop whatever terrible things were happening gradually though they were backing off away both from the prophet and mr first and from the changer horza pulled and jerked his hand tied to the pole it started to come free aah mr first suddenly raised his head hand clutching at one eye and screamed for all his worth his hand still caught in that of the prophet jerked out straight as he tried to pull free fwisong still held him in his grip though even as he quaked and stared and turned blue horzas hand came free he tugged at the bonds behind him and did his best with the crippled free hand to untie the knots the eaters were moaning now some still chanting but they were moving away horza roared partly at them partly at the stubborn knots behind him several in the crowd ran one of the women dressed in the ragged vestment clothes screamed threw her bowl of gruel at him missing him then fell sobbing to the sand horza felt the ropes behind him give he got the other arm free then one foot he stood shakily watching fwisong gargle and choke while mr first howled shaking his head this way and that and pulling and swinging his gripped hand as though in some monstrous travesty of a handshake eaters were running for the canoes or the shuttle or throwing themselves onto the sand horza struggled free at last and staggered towards the grossly imbalanced duo of men linked by the hand he plunged forward and grabbed the fallen pistol from the sands as he knelt and then stood fwisong as though suddenly seeing horza again gave one last gurgling gagging splutter of noise and tipped slowly towards the side mr first was pulling and tugging from mr first fell to his knees again still screaming as the venom seared the membranes of his eyes and attacked the nerves beyond as fwisong toppled and his arm and hand went slack mr first looked up and round in time to see through his pain the vast bulk of the prophet falling towards him he howled once on an indrawn breath as he pulled his hand free at last from the now blue clump of chubby fingers he started to rise to his feet but fwisong rolled over and crashed into him knocking him to the sand before mr first could utter another sound the immense prophet had fallen over his disciple flattening him into the sand from head to buttocks fwisongs eyes closed slowly the hand at his throat flopped across the sand and into the outer edge of the fire where it started to sizzle mr firsts legs beat a tattoo on the sand just as the last of the eaters ran away jumping tents and fires and racing for the canoes or shuttle or forest then the two skinny legs sticking out from under the prophets body were reduced to spasms and after a while they stopped moving altogether none of their movements had succeeded in shifting fwisongs huge body a centimetre horza blew some sand off the clumsy feeling pistol and moved upwind from the smell of the prophets hand burning in the fire he checked the gun looking round the deserted stretch of beach around the fires and tents the canoes were being launched eaters were crowding into the culture shuttle horza stretched his aching limbs looked at his bareboned finger then shrugged put the gun under one armpit put his good hand round the set of bones pulled and twisted his useless bones snapped from their sockets and he threw them onto the fire pain isnt real anyway he told himself shakily and started for the culture shuttle at a slow run the eaters in the shuttle saw him coming straight towards them and started screaming again they piled out some of them ran down the beach to wade out after the escaping canoes others scattered into the forest horza slowed down to let them go then looked warily at the open doors of the culture craft he could see seats inside up the short ramp and lights and a far bulkhead he took a deep breath and walked up the gentle slope of ramp into the shuttle hello said a crudely synthesised voice horza looked around the shuttle looked pretty well used and old it was culture he was fairly certain of that but it wasnt as neat and spankingnew as the culture liked its products to look why were those people so frightened of you horza was still looking round wondering where and what to address im not sure he said shrugging he was naked and still holding the gun with only a couple of strips of flesh on one finger though the bleeding had quickly stopped he thought he must look a threatening figure anyway but maybe the shuttle couldnt tell that where are you what are you he said deciding to feign ignorance he looked around in a very obvious manner hamming up a display of looking forward through a door in the bulkhead to a control area forward im the shuttle its brain how do you do fine horza said just fine how are you very well considering thank you i havent been bored at all but it is nice to have somebody to talk to at last you speak very good marain where did you learn ah i did a course in it horza said he did some more looking around look i dont know where to look when i talk to you where should i look huh ha ha the shuttle laughed i suppose youd best look up here forward towards the bulkhead horza did so see that little round thing right in the middle near the ceiling thats one of my eyes oh horza said he waved and smiled hi my names orab hello orab im called tsealsir actually thats only part of my name designation but you can call me that what was happening out there i havent been watching the people im here to rescue i was told not to in case i got upset but i did hear people screaming when they came near and they seemed frightened when they came inside me then they saw you and ran away what is that youre holding is it a gun ill have to ask you to put that away for safe keeping im here to rescue people who want to be rescued when the orbital is destructed and we cant have dangerous weapons on board in case somebody gets hurt can we is that finger hurt i have a very good medkit on board would you like to use it orab yes that might be an idea good its on the inward side of the doorway through to my front compartment on the left horza started walking past the rows of seats towards the front of the shuttle for all its age the shuttle smelled of he wasnt quite sure all the synthetic materials it was made from he supposed after the natural but godawful odours of the last day horza found the shuttle much more pleasant even if it was culture and therefore belonged to the enemy horza touched the gun he was carrying as though doing something to it just putting the safety catch on he told the eye in the ceiling dont want it to go off but those people out there were trying to kill me earlier and i feel safer with it in my hand know what i mean well not exactly orab the shuttle said but i think i can understand but youll have to give the gun to me before we take off oh sure as soon as you close those rear doors horza was in the doorway between the main compartment and the smaller control area now it was in fact a very short corridor less than two metres long with opened doors to each compartment horza looked round quickly but he couldnt see another eye he watched a large flap open at about hip level to reveal a comprehensive medical kit well orab id close those doors to make you feel a bit safer if i could but you see im here to rescue people who want to be rescued when the time comes to destruct the orbital and i cant close those doors until just before i leave so that everybody who wants to can get on board actually i cant really understand why anybody wouldnt want to escape but they told me not to get worried if some people stayed behind but i must say i think that would be kind of silly dont you orab horza was rummaging through the medkit but looking above it at other outlines of doors set in the wall of the short corridor he said hmm oh yeah that would be when is the place due to blow anyway he poked his head round the corner into the control compartment or flight deck looking up at another eye set in the corresponding position to the one in the main compartment but looking forward from the other side of the thick wall between the two horza grinned and gave a little wave then ducked back hi the shuttle laughed well orab im afraid that were going to be forced to destruct the orbital in fortythree standard hours unless of course the idirans see sense and are reasonable and withdraw their threat to use vavatch as a war base oh horza said he was looking at one of the door outlines above the opened one the medkit was protruding from as far as he could guess those two eyes were back to back separated by the thickness of the wall between the two compartments unless there was a mirror he couldnt see he was invisible to the shuttle while he remained in the short corridor he looked back out through the open rear doors the only movement came from the tops of some distant trees and the smoke from the fires he checked the gun the projectiles seemed to be hidden in some sort of magazine but a little circular indicator with a sweep hand indicated either one bullet left or one expended out of twelve yes the shuttle said its very sad of course but these things are necessary in wartime i suppose not that i pretend to understand it all im just a humble shuttle after all id actually been given away as a present to one of the megaships because i was too oldfashioned and crude for the culture you know i thought they could have upgraded me but they didnt they just gave me away anyway they need me now im happy to say we have quite a job on our hands you know getting everybody who wants to get off away from vavatch ill be sorry to see it go ive had some happy times here believe me but thats just the way things go i suppose hows that finger going by the way want me to have a look at it bring the medkit stuff round into one of the two compartments so i can take a look i might be able to help you know oh are you touching one of the other lockers in that corridor horza was trying to lever open the door nearest the roof by using the barrel of the gun no he said heaving away at it im nowhere near it thats odd im sure i can feel something are you sure of course im sure horza said putting all his weight behind the gun the door gave way revealing tubes fibreruns metal bottles and various other unrecognisable bits of machinery electrics optics and field units ouch said the shuttle hey horza shouted it just blew open theres something on fire in there he raised the gun holding it in both hands he sighted carefully about there fire yelped the shuttle but thats not possible you think i cant tell smoke when i see it you crazy goddamned machine horza yelled he pulled the trigger the gun exploded throwing his hands up and him back the noise of the shuttles exclamation was covered by the crack and bang of the bullet hitting inside and exploding horza covered his face with his arm im blind wailed the shuttle now smoke really was pouring from the compartment horza had opened he staggered into the control compartment youre on fire in here too he yelled theres smoke coming out everywhere what but that cant be youre on fire i dont know how you cant feel it or smell it youre burning i dont trust you the machine yelled put that gun away or youve got to trust me horza yelled looking all over the control area for where the shuttles brain might be located he could see screens and seats readout screens and even the place where manual controls might be hidden but no indication of where the brain was smokes pouring out everywhere he repeated trying to sound hysterical here heres an extinguisher im turning mine on the machine shouted a wall unit spun round and horza grabbed the bulky cylinder attached to the inside of the flap he wrapped his four good fingers on his injured hand round the pistol grip a hissing noise and a light vapourlike steam was appearing from various places in the compartment nothings happening horza screamed theres loads of black smoke and its arrch he pretended to cough aargh its getting thicker where is it coming from quickly everywhere horza yelled glancing all round the control area from near your eye under the seats over the screens under the screens i cant see go on i can smell smoke too now horza looked at the slight smudge of grey filtering into the control area from the spluttering fire in the short corridor where he had shot the craft its coming from those places and those info screens on either side of the end seats and just above the seats on the side walls where that bit juts out what screamed the shuttle brain on the left facing forward yes put that one out first the shuttle screeched horza dropped the extinguisher and gripped the gun in both hands again aiming it at the bulge in the wall over the lefthand seat he pulled the trigger once twice three times the gun blasted shaking his whole body sparks and bits of flying debris flew from the holes the bullets were smashing in the casing of the machine eeeeee said the shuttle then there was silence some smoke rose from the bulge and it joined with that coming from the corridor to form a thin layer under the ceiling horza let the gun down slowly looking around and listening mug he said he used the handheld extinguisher to put out the small fires in the wall of the corridor and where the shuttles brain had been then he went out into the passenger area to sit near the open doors while the smoke and the fumes cleared he couldnt see any eaters on the sand or in the forest and the canoes were out of sight too he looked for some door controls and found them the doors closed with a hiss and horza grinned he went back to the control area and started punching buttons and opening sections of panelling until he got some life from the screens they all suddenly blinked on while he was fiddling with some buttons on the arm of one of the couchlike seats the noise of surf in the flight deck made him think the doors had opened again but it was only some external microphones relaying the noise from outside screens flickered and lit up with figures and lines and flaps opened in front of the seats control wheels and levers sighed out smoothly and clicked into place just ready to be held and used feeling happier than he had been in many days horza started an eventually successful but longer and more frustrating search for some food he was very hungry some small insects were running in orderly lines over the huge body collapsed on the sands one hand of which was sticking charred and blackened into the dying flames of a fire the little insects started by eating the deepset eyes which were open they hardly noticed as the shuttle rose wobbling into the air picked up speed and turned inelegantly above the mountain then roared off through the early evening air away from the island interlude in darkness the mind had an image to illustrate its information capacity it liked to imagine the contents of its memory store written out on cards little slips of paper with tiny writing on them big enough for a human to read if the characters were a couple of millimetres tall and the paper about ten centimetres square and written on both sides then ten thousand characters could be squeezed onto each card in a metre long drawer of such cards maybe one thousand of them ten million pieces of information could be stored in a small room a few metres square with a corridor in the middle just wide enough to pull a tray out into you could keep perhaps a thousand trays arranged in closepacked cabinets ten billion characters in all a square kilometre of these cramped cells might contain as many as one hundred thousand rooms a thousand such floors would produce a building two thousand metres tall with a hundred million rooms if you kept building those squat towers squeezed hard up against each other until they entirely covered the surface of a largish standardg world maybe a billion square kilometres you would have a planet with one trillion square kilometres of floor space one hundred quadrillion paperstuffed rooms thirty lightyears of corridors and a number of potential stored characters sufficiently large to boggle just about anybodys mind in base that number would be a followed by twentyseven zeros and even that vast figure was only a fraction of the capacity of the mind to match it you would need a thousand such worlds systems of them a clusterful of informationpacked globes and that vast capacity was physically contained within a space smaller than a single one of those tiny rooms inside the mind in darkness the mind waited it had counted how long it had waited so far it had tried to estimate how long it would have to wait in the future it knew to the smallest imaginable fraction of a second how long it had been in the tunnels of the command system and more often than it needed to it thought about that number watched it grow inside itself it was a form of security it supposed a small fetish something to cling to it had explored the command system tunnels scanning and surveying it was weak damaged almost totally helpless but it had been worthwhile taking a look around the mazelike complex of tunnels and caverns just to take its attention off the fact that it was there as a refugee the places it could not get to itself it sent its one remaining remote drone into so that it could have a look and see what there was to be seen and all of it was at once boring and frighteningly depressing the level of technology possessed by the builders of the command system was very limited indeed everything in the tunnels worked either mechanically or electronically gears and wheels electric wires superconductors and lightfibres very crude indeed the mind thought and nothing it could possibly interest itself in a glance through any of the machines and devices in the tunnel was sufficient to know them exactly what they were made of how they had been made even what they were made for no mystery nothing to employ the mind there was something too about the inexactitude of it all that the mind found almost frightening it could look at some carefully machined piece of metal or some delicately moulded bit of plastic and know that to the people who had built the command system to their eyes these things were exact and precise constructed to fine tolerances with dead straight lines perfect edges smooth surfaces immaculate right angles and so on but the mind even with its damaged sensors could see the rough edges the crudity of the parts and the components involved they had been good enough for the people at the time and no doubt they had fulfilled the most important criterion of all they worked but they were crude clumsy imperfectly designed and manufactured for some reason the mind found this worrying and it would have to use this ancient crude shopsoiled technology it would have to connect with it it had thought it through as best it could and decided to formulate plans for what to do if the idirans did get somebody through the quiet barrier and threatened it with discovery it would arm and it would make a place to hide in both actions implied damage to the command system so it would not act until it knew it was definitely threatened once it knew it was it would be forced to risk the draazons displeasure but it might not come to that it hoped it wouldnt planning was one thing execution was another it was unlikely to have very much time either to hide or to arm both plans might perforce be rather crudely implemented especially as it had only one remote drone and its own badly crippled fields with which to manipulate the engineering facilities of the system better than nothing though better still to have problems than to let death eradicate them all there was however another less immediately relevant but more intrinsically worrying problem it had discovered and it was implied in the question who was it its higher functions had had to close down when it had transferred from four to threedimensional space the minds information was held in binary form in spirals composed of protons and neutrons and neutrons outside a nucleus and also outside hyperspace decayed into protons haha not too long after entering the command system the vast majority of its memory would have consisted of the stunningly illuminating message so it had effectively frozen its primary memory and cognitive functions wrapping them in fields which prevented both decay and use it was working instead on backup picocircuitry in real space and using realspace light to think with how humiliating in fact it could still access all that stored memory though the process was complicated and so slow so all was not lost there but as for thinking as for being itself another matter entirely it wasnt its real self it was a crude abstracted copy of itself the mere ground plan for the full labyrinthine complexity of its true personality it was the truest possible copy its limited scale was theoretically capable of providing and it was still sentient conscious by even the most rigorous of standards yet an index was not the text a street plan was not the city a map not the land so who was it not the entity it thought it was that was the answer and it was a disconcerting one because it knew that the self it was now could never think of all the things its old self would have thought of it felt unworthy it felt fallible and limited and dull but think positively patterns images the telling analogy make the ill work to good just think if it was not itself then it would be not itself as it was now to what it had been before so the remote drone was to it now nice connection the remote drone would be more than just its eyes and ears on the surface in or near the changers base keeping lookout more than just its assistant in the doubtless frantic preparations to equip and secrete which would ensue if the drone did raise the alarm more and less look on the happy side think of the good things hadnt it been clever yes it had its escape from the spareparts warship had been though it thought it itself quite breathtakingly masterful and brilliant its courageous use of warp so deep into a gravity well would have been foolhardy in the extreme in anything else but the dire circumstances it had found itself in but was anyway superbly skilled and its stunning crossrealm transfer from hyper to real space was not simply even more brilliant and even braver than anything else it had done it was almost certainly a first there was nothing anywhere in its vast store of information to indicate that anybody had ever done that before it was proud but after all that here it was trapped an intellectual cripple a philosophical shadow of its former self now all it could do was wait hoping that whoever came to find it would be friendly the culture must know the mind was certain its signal had worked and that it would be picked up somewhere but the idirans knew as well it didnt think they would just try to storm in because they knew as well as it did that antagonising the draazon was a bad idea but what if the idirans found a way in and the culture couldnt what if the whole region of space around the sullen gulf was now idiran held the mind knew there was only one thing it could do if it fell into idiran hands but not only did it not want to destruct for purely personal reasons it didnt want to destruct anywhere near schars world anyway for the same reason that the idirans wouldnt come charging in but if it was captured in the planet that might be the last time it would have a chance to destroy itself by the time it was taken off the planet the idirans might have found a way of stopping it from destructing perhaps it had made a mistake in escaping at all perhaps it should have just destructed along with the rest of the ship and saved all this complication and worry but it had seemed like an almost heavensent opportunity to escape finding itself so close to a planet of the dead when it had been attacked it wanted to live anyway but it would have been wasteful to throwaway such a great chance even if it had been perfectly sanguine about its own survival or destruction well there was nothing to be done about it now it was here and it just had to wait wait and think consider all the options few and possibilities many rack those memories as best it could for anything that might be relevant that might help for example and the one really interesting bit would be a bad one it had discovered that the idirans had probably employed one of the changers who had actually served with the caretaker staff on schars world of course perhaps the man was dead or busy on something else or too far away or the information had been incorrect in the first place and the intelligencegathering section of the culture had got it wrong but if not then that man would be the one obvious person to send after something hiding in the command system tunnels it was part of the minds very construction at every level to believe that there was no such thing as bad knowledge except in very relative terms but it really did wish that it hadnt had that bit of information in its memory banks it would just as soon not have known anything about this man this changer who knew schars world and probably worked for the idirans perversely it found itself wishing it knew this mans name but with any luck he would be irrelevant or the culture would get here first or the draazon being would recognise a fellow mind in trouble and help or anything in darkness the mind waited hundreds of those planets were empty the hundred million room towers were there the little rooms the cabinets and the trays and the cards and the spaces for the numbers and letters were there but nothing was written nothing held on any of the cards sometimes the mind liked to imagine travelling down the narrow spaces between the cabinets one of its remote drones floating between the banked files of memory in the thin corridors from room to room for floor after floor kilometre after kilometre over buried continents of rooms filledin oceans of rooms levelled ranges felled forests covered deserts of rooms these whole systems of dark planets those trillions of square kilometres of blank paper represented the minds future the spaces it would fill in its life to come if it had one a game of damage damage the game banned everywhere tonight in that unprepossessing building across the square under the dome theyll gather the players of the eve of destruction the most select group of rich psychotics in the human galaxy here to play the game that is to real life what soap opera is to high tragedy this is the biport city of evanauth vavatch orbital the very same vavatch orbital that in about eleven standard hours from now is due to be blasted into its component atoms as the idiranculture war in this part of the galaxy near the glittercliff and sullen gulf reaches a new high in standingbyyourprinciplesregardless and a new low in common sense its that imminent destruction thats attracted these scatological vultures here not the famous megaships or the azureblue technological miracles of the circlesea no these people are here because the whole orbital is doomed to be blown away shortly and they think its kind of amusing to play damage an ordinary card game with a few embellishments to make it attractive to the mentally disturbed in places on the verge of annihilation theyve played on worlds about to suffer massive comet or meteorite strikes in volcanic calderas about to blow in cities due for nuclear bombardment in ritualistic wars in asteroids heading for the centre of stars in front of moving cliffs of ice or lava inside mysterious alien spacecraft discovered empty and deserted and set on courses aiming them into black holes in vast palaces about to be sacked by android mobs and just about everywhere you can think of youd rather not want to be immediately after the players leave it might seem like a strange sort of way to get your kicks but it takes all sorts to make a galaxy i guess so here theyve come these hyperrich deadbeats in their rented ships or their own cruisers right now theyre sobering up and coming down going through plastic surgery or behaviour therapy or both to make them acceptable in what passes for normal society even in these rarefied circles after months spent in whatever expensive and unlikely debauchery or perversion particularly appeals to them or happens to be in fashion at the moment at the same time they or their minions are scraping together their aoish credits all actual no notes and scouting hospitals asylums and freezestores for new lives here too have come the hangerson the damage groupies the fortune seekers the past failures at the game desperate for another try if they can only raise the money and the lives and damages very own special sort of human debris the moties victims of the games emotional fallout mindjunkies who only exist to lap at the crumbs of ecstasy and anguish falling from the lips of their heroes the players of the game nobody knows exactly how all these different groups hear about the game or even how they all get here in time but the word goes out to those who really need to or want to hear about it and like ghouls they come ready for the game and the destruction originally damage was played on such occasions because only during the breakdown of law and morality and the confusion and chaos normally surrounding final events could the game be carried out in anything remotely resembling part of the civilised galaxy which believe it or not the players like to think theyre part of now the subsequent nova worldbusting or other cataclysm is seen as some sort of metaphysical symbol for the mortality of all things and as the lives involved in a full game are all volunteers a lot of places like good old pleasureoriented permissive vavatch let the game take place with official blessing from the authorities some people say its not the game it used to be even that its become something of a media event but i say its still a game for the mad and the bad the rich and the uncaring but not the careless the unhinged but well connected people still die in damage and not just the lives either or the players its been called the most decadent game in history about all you can say in the games defence is that it rather than reality occupies the warped minds of some of the galaxys more twisted people gods know what they would get up to if it wasnt there and if the game does any good apart from reminding us as if we needed reminding how crazy the bipedal oxygenbreathing carboniform can become it does occasionally remove one of the players and frighten the rest for a while in these arguably insane times any lessening or attenuation of madness is maybe something to be grateful for ill be filing another report again some time during the course of the game from within the auditorium if i can get in there but in the meantime goodbye and take care this is sarble the eye evanauth city vavatch the image on the wrist screen of a man standing in sunlight on a plaza faded the halfmasked youngish face disappearing horza put his terminal screen back onto his cuff the time display winked slowly with the countdown to vavatchs destruction sarble the eye one of the most famous of the humanoid galaxys freelance reporters and also one of the most successful at getting into places he wasnt supposed to would now probably be trying to enter the games hall if he hadnt got in already the broadcast horza had just watched had been recorded that afternoon doubtless sarble would be in disguise so horza was glad hed bribed his way in before the reporters broadcast went out and the security guards round the hall got even more wary it had been hard enough as it was horza in his new guise as kraiklyn had posed as a motie one of the emotional junkies who followed the erratic secretive progress of the major game series round the more tawdry fringes of civilisation having discovered that all but the most expensive reserved places had been sold out the day before the five aoish credit tenths he had started out with that morning were now reduced to three though he also had some money keyed into a couple of credit cards hed bought that currency would shrink in real value though as the destruction time drew nearer horza took a deep satisfying breath and looked around the big arena he had climbed as high as he could up the banked steps slopes and platforms using the interval before the game began to get an overview of the whole thing the dome of the arena was transparent showing stars and the bright shining line that was the orbitals far side now in daylight the lights of shuttles coming and going mostly going traced lines across the still points beneath the dome cover hung a smoky haze lit with the popping lights of a small firework display the air was filled too with the chanting of massed voices a choir of scalecones stood banked on the far side of the auditorium the humanoids forming the choir appeared identical in all but stature and in the tones they produced from their puffedout chests and long necks they seemed to be making the ambient racket but as he looked around the arena horza could make out the faint purple edges in the air where other more localised sound fields held command over smaller stages where dancers danced singers sang strippers stripped boxers boxed or people just stood around talking banked all around the paraphernalia of the game seethed like a vast storm maybe ten or even twenty thousand people mostly humanoid but some utterly different including not a few machines and drones they sat or lay or walked or stood watching magicians jugglers fighters immolators hypnotics couplers actors orators and a hundred other types of entertainers all doing their turns tents had been pitched on some of the larger terraces rows of seats and couches remained on others many small stages frazzled with lights smoke and glittering holograms and soligrams horza saw a d maze spread out over several terraces full of tubes and angles some clear some opaque some moving some staying still shadows and forms moved inside a slowmotion animal trapeze act arced gradually overhead horza recognised the beasts performing it it would become a combat act later on some people walked by horza tall humanoids in fabulous clothes glittering like a gaudy night city seen from the air they chattered in almost inaudibly high voices and from a network of fine golden coloured tubes branching all around their bright red and dark purple faces tiny puffs of incandescent gas pulsed out wreathing their semiscaled necks and naked shoulders and trailing and dimming behind them in a fiery orange glow horza watched them pass their cloaks flowing out behind as though hardly heavier than the air through which they moved flickered with the image of an alien face each cloak showing part of one huge moving image as though a projector overhead was focused on the capes of the moving group the orange gas touched horzas nostrils and his head swam for a second he let his immuneglands deal with the narcotic and continued to look around the arena the eye of the storm the still quiet spot was so small it could easily have been missed in even a slow and attentive scan of the auditorium it was not in the centre but set at one end of the ellipsoid of level ground forming the lowest visible level of the arena there under a canopy of still dark lighting units a round table stood just about large enough to accommodate at its rim the sixteen large differently styled chairs which each faced a wedge of colour fixed to the top of the table a console set into the table itself faced each chair on which straps and other restraining devices lay opened behind each of the seats lay an area of clear space on which small seats twelve in all were placed a small fence separated them from the larger seats in front and another fence cordoned off the set of twelve seats from a larger area behind where people most of them moties were already quietly waiting the game seemed to have been delayed horza sat down on what was either an overdesigned seat or a rather unimaginative piece of sculpture he was almost on the highest level of the terraces of the arena with a good view over most of the rest there was nobody near by he reached deep inside his heavy blouse and peeled off some artificial skin from his abdomen he rolled the skin into a ball and threw it into a large pot that held a small tree just behind where he sat then he checked the aoish credit tenths the negotiable memory card the pocket terminal and the light cre pistol which had been hidden by the paunch of fake skin out of the corner of his eye he saw a small darkly dressed man approach the man looked at horza with his head tilted from about five metres off then came closer hey you want to be a life no goodbye horza said the small man sniffed and walked off stopping further along the walkway to prod a shape lying near the edge of a narrow terrace horza looked over and saw a woman there raise her head groggily then shake it slowly moving sinuous lengths of bedraggled white hair her faced showed briefly in the light of an overhead spot she was beautiful but looked very tired the small man spoke to her again but she shook her head and made a motion with one hand the small man walked off the flight in the exculture shuttle had been relatively uneventful after some confusion horza had succeeded in patching through to the orbitals navigation system discovered where he was in relation to the olmedrecas last known position and set off to find whatever was left of the megaship hed accessed a news service while gorging himself on culture emergency rations and found a report on the olmedreca in the index the pictures showed the ship listing a little and fractionally bowdown floating in a calm sea surrounded by ice the first kilometre of its hull seemingly buried inside the huge tabular berg small aircraft and a few shuttles hovered and flew about the gigantic wreck like flies above the carcass of a dinosaur the commentary accompanying the visuals spoke of a mysterious second nuclear explosion aboard the craft it also reported that when police craft had arrived the megaship had proved to be deserted hearing that horza had immediately altered the shuttles destination swinging the craft round to head for evanauth horza had had three tenths of an aoish credit he had sold the shuttle for five tenths it was absurdly cheap especially given the imminent destruction of the orbital but he had been in a hurry and the dealer who accepted the craft was certainly taking a risk handling the machine it was very obviously a culture design the brain had equally obviously been shot out of it so there could be little doubt it had been stolen the culture would treat the destruction of the crafts consciousness as murder in three hours horza had sold the shuttle bought clothes cards a gun a couple of terminals and some information all except the information had been cheap horza now knew that there was a craft answering the description of the clear air turbulence on the orbital or rather underneath it inside the exculture general systems vehicle called the ends of invention he found that hard to believe but there was no other craft it could be according to the information agency a ship fitting the cats description had been brought on board by one of the evanauth port shipbuilders to have repairs made to its warping units it had arrived under tow two days previously with only its fusion motors working he could not however find out its name or exact location it sounded to horza like the cat had been used to rescue the survivors of kraiklyns band it must have come over the o wall on remote control using its warp units it had picked the free company up then hopped back over again damaging its warp motors in the process he had also been unable to find out who the survivors might be but assumed kraiklyn must be one of them nobody else could have brought the cat over the edgewall he hoped hed find kraiklyn at the damage game either way horza had decided to make for the cat afterwards he still intended to head for schars world and the clear air turbulence was the most likely way of getting there he hoped yalson was alive he also hoped it was true about the ends of invention being totally demilitarised and the volume around vavatch being free of culture ships after all this time he wouldnt have put it past the cultures minds to have found out about the cat being in the same volume of space as the hand of god when it came under attack and to have made a connection or two he sat back in the seat or sculpture and relaxed letting the internal pattern of the motie drop from his mind and body he had to start thinking like kraiklyn again he closed his eyes after a few minutes he could hear things starting to happen down in the lower reaches of the arena he brought himself to and looked around the whitehaired woman who had been lying on the nearby terrace had got up she was walking a little unsteadily down into the arena her long heavy dress sweeping over the steps horza got up too following quickly down the stairs in the wake of her perfume she didnt look at him when he skipped past her she was fiddling with an askew tiara the lights were on over the coloured table where the game would be played some of the stages in the auditorium were starting to close up or go dim people were gradually gravitating towards the game table to the seats and loungers and standing areas overlooking it in the glare of the overhead lights tall figures in black robes moved slowly checking pieces of the game equipment they were the adjudicators ishlorsinami the species was renowned for being the most unimaginative humourless prissy honest and incorruptible group in the galaxy and they always officiated at damage games because hardly anybody else could be trusted horza stopped by a food stall to stock up on food and drink he watched the game table and the figures around it while his order was prepared the woman with the heavy dress and long white hair passed him still going down the steps her tiara was almost straight though her long loose gown was crumpled she yawned as she went past horza paid for his food with a card then followed the woman again going towards the growing crowd of people and machines starting to cluster all around the outer perimeter of the game area the woman looked suspiciously at him when he half ran half walked down the steps past her again horza bribed his way into one of the better terraces he pulled the hood of his heavy blouse out from the thick collar stretching it over his forehead and out a little so that his face was in shadow he didnt want the real kraiklyn to see him now the terrace jutted out over lower ones slanting down with an excellent view of the table itself and the gantries above most of the fenced areas around the table were visible too horza settled onto a soft lounger near a noisy group of extravagantly dressed tripedals who hooted a lot and kept spitting into a large pot in the centre of their group of gently rocking couches the ishlorsinami seemed to have satisfied themselves that everything was working and was set up fairly they walked down a ramp set into the surface of the arenas ellipsoid floor some lights went off a quietfield slowly cut off the sounds from the rest of the auditorium horza took a quick look round a few stages and sets still showed lights but they were going out the slowmotion animal trapeze act was still going on though high up in the darkness below the stars the huge ponderous beasts were swinging through the air field harnesses glittering they somersaulted and twisted but now as they did so passing each other in midair they reached out with their clawed paws slashing slowly and silently at each others fur nobody else seemed to be watching horza was surprised to see the woman he had passed twice on the stairs walk past him again and drape herself over a vacant couch which had been reserved near the front of the terrace somehow he hadnt thought she would be rich enough to afford this area without a fanfare or announcement the players of the eve of destruction appeared coming up the ramp in the arena floor led by a single ishlorsinami horza checked his terminal it was exactly seven hours standard to the orbitals destruction applause cheers and near horza at least loud hooting greeted the contestants though the quietfields muffled everything as they appeared from the shadows on the ramp some of the players acknowledged the crowd who had come to see them play while other players totally ignored them horza recognised few of them the ones he did know or had at least heard of were ghalssel tengayet doysuut wilgre and neeporlax ghalssel of ghalssels raiders probably the most successful of the free companies horza had heard the mercenary ship arrive from about eleven kilometres away while he was making the deal with the shuttle saleswomen she had frozen at the time her eyes glazed horza didnt like to ask whether she thought the noise was the culture coming to destroy the orbital a few hours early or just coming to get her for buying a hot shuttle craft ghalssel was an averagelooking man stocky enough to be obviously from a highg planet but without the look of compressed power that most such people possessed he was simply dressed and his head was clean shaven supposedly only a damage game where such things were banned could force ghalssel out of the suit he always wore tengayet doysuut was tall very dark and also simply dressed the suut was the champion damage player on both game average wins and maximum credits he had come from a recently contacted planet twenty years before and had been a champion player of games of chance and bluff there too that was where he had had his face removed and a stainlesssteel mask grafted on only the eyes looked alive expressionless soft jewels set in the sculpted metal the mask had a matt finish to prevent his opponents seeing his cards reflected in his face wilgre had to be helped up the ramp by some slaves from his retinue the blue giant from ozhleh clad in a mirror robe looked almost as though he was being rolled up the slope by the small humans behind although the hem of his robe kicked out now and again to show where his four stubby legs were scrabbling to propel his great body up the ramp in one of his two hands he held a large mirror in the other a whip lead on the end of which a blinded rogothuyr its four paws encrusted with precious metals its snout encased in a platinum muzzle and its eyes replaced by emeralds padded like a lithe nightmare in pure white the animals giant head swept from side to side as it used its ultrasonic sense to map out its surroundings on another terrace almost opposite horzas all thirtytwo of wilgres concubines threw aside their body veils and went down on their knees and elbows worshipping their lord he waved the mirror at them briefly virtually every magnifier and microcamera smuggled into the auditorium also swivelled to focus on the thirtytwo assorted females reputedly the finest onesex harem in the galaxy neeporlax presented something of a contrast the youth was a shambling gaunt shoddily clothed figure blinking in the lights of the arena and clutching a soft toy the boy was perhaps the secondbest damage player in the galaxy but he always gave his winnings away and the average meterbed hotel would have thought twice about admitting him he was diseased half blind incontinent and albino his head was liable to shake out of control at an anxious moment in a game but his hands held holocards as though the plastics had been set in rock he too was assisted up the ramp by a young girl who helped him to his seat combed his hair and kissed his cheek then went to stand in the area behind the twelve seats set immediately aft of the youths chair wilgre raised one of his chubby blue hands and threw a few hundredths at the crowd beyond the fences people scrabbled for the coins wilgre always mixed in a few higher denominations as well once at a game a few years previously inside a moon heading for a black hole he had thrown a billion away with the small change disposing of perhaps a tenth of a per cent of his fortune with just one flick of the wrist a decrepit asteroid tramp who had just been turned down as a life because he had only one arm ended up buying his own planet the rest of the players were a pretty variedlooking bunch as well but with one exception horza didnt recognise them three or four of the others were greeted with shouts and some fireworks so presumably they were well known the rest were either disliked or unknown the last player to come up the ramp was kraiklyn horza settled back in his lounger smiling the free company leader had had a little temporary facial alteration done probably pulloff and his hair was dyed but it was him all right he wore a lightcoloured onepiece fabric suit he was clean shaven and his hair was brown perhaps the others on the cat wouldnt have recognised him but horza had studied the man to see how he carried himself how he walked how the muscles in his face were set and to the changer kraiklyn stood out like a boulder in a pebblefield when all the players were seated their lives were led in to sit on the seats immediately behind each player the lives were all humans most already looked half dead anyway though they were all physically whole one by one they were taken to their seats strapped in and helmeted the lightweight black helmets covered their faces except for the eyes most slumped forward once they were strapped in a few sat more upright but none raised their eyes or looked round all the regular players had the full complement of lives allowed some had them specially bred while others had their agents supply all they wanted the less rich not so well known players like kraiklyn had the sweepings of prisons and asylums and a few paid depressives who had willed their share of any proceeds to somebody else often members of the despondent sect could be persuaded to become lives either for free or for a donation to their cause but horza couldnt see any of their distinctive tiered headdresses or bleedingeye symbols kraiklyn had only managed to find three lives it didnt look as though he would be staying all that long in the game the whitehaired woman in the reserved seat near the front of the terrace got up stretched and walked up the terrace between the couches and loungers a bored expression on her face just as she drew level with horzas couch a commotion erupted on a terrace behind them the woman stopped and looked horza turned round even through the quietfield he could hear a man shouting what looked like a fight had broken out a couple of security guards were trying to restrain two people rolling about on the floor the crowd on the terrace had made a circle about the disturbance and were looking on dividing their attention between the preparations for the damage game and the fisticuffs on the terrace beside them eventually the two people on the floor were brought to their feet but instead of both being restrained only one was a youngish man who looked vaguely familiar to horza though he appeared to have been disguising himself with a blond wig which was now slipping off his head the other person who had been fighting another man produced some sort of card from his clothes and showed it to the young man who was still shouting then the two uniformed guards and the man who had brandished the card led the young man away the man with the card took something small from behind one of the young mans ears as he was frogmarched off to an access tunnel the young woman with the long white hair crossed her arms and walked on up the terrace the circle of people on the terrace above closed again like a hole in cloud horza watched the woman weave her way through more couches until she left the terrace and he lost sight of her he looked up the duelling animals still spun and leapt their white blood seemed to glow as it matted their shaggy hides they snarled silently and scythed at each other with their long forelimbs but their acrobatics and their aiming had deteriorated they were starting to look tired and clumsy horza looked back to the game table they were all ready and the game was about to begin damage was just a fancy card game partly skill partly luck and partly bluff what made it interesting was not just the high sums involved or even the fact that whenever a player lost a life he lost a life a living breathing human being but the use of complicated consciousnessaltering twoway electronic fields around the game table with the cards in his or her band a player could alter the emotions of another player or sometimes of several others fear hate despair hope love camaraderie doubt elation paranoia virtually every emotional state the human brain was capable of experiencing could be beamed at another player or used for oneself from far enough away or in a field shield close in the game could look like a pastime for the deranged or the simpleminded a player with an obviously strong hand might suddenly throw it in somebody with nothing at all might gamble all the credits they had people broke down weeping or started laughing uncontrollably they might moan with love at a player known to be their worst enemy or claw at their restraining straps to free themselves for a murdering attack on their best friend or they could kill themselves damage players never did get free from their chairs should they ever do so an ishlorsinami would shoot them with a heavy stun gun but they could destroy themselves each game console from which the emotor units radiated the relevant emotions on which the cards were played and where the players could see the time and the number of lives they each had left contained a small hollow button inside which a needle filled with poison lay ready to inject any stabbing finger which pushed it damage was one of those games in which it was unwise to make too many enemies only the very strongwilled indeed could defeat the urge to suicide implanted in their brains by a concerted attack of half a table of players at the finish of each hand of cards when the money which had been gambled was taken by the player with the most card points all the other players who had stayed with the betting lost a life when they had none left they were out of the game as they would be if they ran out of money the rules said the game ended when only one player had any lives left though in practice it finished when the remaining contestants agreed that if they stayed any longer they were likely to lose their own lives to whatever disaster was about to ensue it could get very interesting at the end of a game when the moment of destruction was very close the hand had gone on for some time a great deal of money had been gambled on that one hand and one or several players would not agree to call it a day then the sophisticates really were separated from the simians and it became even more a game of nerve quite a few of the best damage players of the past had perished trying to outdare and outstay each other in such circumstances from a spectators point of view damages special attraction was that the closer you stood to the emotor unit of any particular player the more of the emotions they were experiencing affected you directly too a whole subculture of people hooked on such thirdhand feelings had grown up in the few hundred years since damage had become such a select but popular game the moties there were other groups playing damage the players of the eve of destruction were simply the most famous and the richest the moties could get their emotional fix in lots of places throughout the galaxy but only in a full game only on the edge of annihilation only with the very best players plus a few hopefuls could the most intense experiences be obtained it was one of these unfortunates horza had impersonated when he had discovered that an access pass could not be had for less than twice the amount of money he had made on the shuttle bribing a door guard had been a lot cheaper the real moties were packed tightly behind the fence separating them from the lives sixteen clumps of sweating nervouslooking people like the game players mostly male they jostled and pressed forward trying to get near to the table near to the players horza watched them as the cards were dealt by the chief ishlorsinami moties jumped up and down trying to see what was happening and security guards fitted with baffle helmets to keep out the emotor pulses patrolled the perimeter of the fence tapping nerver prods on their thighs or palms and watching warily sarble the eye somebody near by said and horza turned to see a cadaverouslooking human lying on a couch behind and to horzas left was talking to another and pointing up to the terrace where the disturbance had occurred a few minutes earlier horza heard the words sarble and caught a few more times from elsewhere around him as the news spread he turned round to watch the game as the players started to inspect their hands the betting began horza thought it was a pity the reporter had been caught but it might mean that the security guards relaxed a little giving him a better chance of not being asked for his pass horza was sitting a good fifty metres from the nearest player a woman whose name he had heard mentioned but had forgotten as the first hand progressed only mild versions of what she was feeling and was being made to feel impinged upon his consciousness nevertheless he didnt enjoy the sensation and switched on the loungers baffle field using the small control set on one arm of the couch had he wanted he could have cancelled the immediate effect of the player he just happened to be sitting behind and substituted the effects of any of the other emotor units on the table the effect would have been nothing like as intense as what the moties or the lives were experiencing but it would certainly have given a good idea of what the players were going through most of the other people around him were using their loungers controls in that way flicking from one player to another in an attempt to judge the overall state of the game horza would concentrate on kraiklyns broadcast emotions later but for now he just wanted to settle in and get the general feel of the game kraiklyn dropped out of the first hand early enough to be sure of avoiding losing a life when it finished with so few lives of his own it was the wisest course unless he had a very strong hand horza watched the man carefully as he sat back in his seat and relaxed his emotor unit dormant kraiklyn licked his lips and wiped his brow horza decided in the next hand he would eavesdrop on what kraiklyn was going through just to see what it was like the hand finished wilgre won he waved acknowledging the cheers of the crowd some moties had fainted already at the other end of the ellipsoid in its cage the rogothuyr snarled five players lost lives five seated humans sitting hopeless and despairing as the effects of the emotor fields still resounded in them went suddenly slack in their chairs as their helmets sent a neural blast through their skulls strong enough to stun the lives sitting around them and to make the nearest moties and the player each life belonged to flinch ishlorsinami undid the restrainers on the dead humans seats and carried them away down the access ramp the remaining lives gradually recovered but they sat as listless as before the ishlorsinami claimed they always checked that each volunteering life was genuine and that the drugs they gave them simply stopped them from becoming hysterical but it was rumoured that there were ways round the ishlorsinami screening process and that some people had succeeded in disposing of their enemies by drugging or hypnotising them and volunteering them for the game as the second hand began and horza switched on his couch monitor to experience kraiklyns emotions the whitehaired woman came back down the aisle and resumed her place in front of horza at the front of the terrace draping herself tiredly over the piece of furniture as though she was bored horza did not know enough about damage as a card game to be able to follow exactly what was going on with the cards either by reading the various emotions being passed round the table or by analysing each hand after it was finished as the first hand was already being analysed by the hooting tripeds near him when the cards as they had been dealt and played were flashed up on the arenas internal broadcast circuits but he tuned in to kraiklyns feelings just to see what they were like the captain of the clear air turbulence was being hit from various directions some of the emotions were contradictory which horza guessed meant that there was no concerted effort being made on kraiklyn he was just taking most peoples secondary armament there was a considerable urge to like wilgre that attractive blue colour and with those four little comical feet he couldnt really be much of a threat a bit of a clown really for all his money the woman sitting on kraiklyns right on the other hand stripped to the waist with no breasts and a sheath for a ceremonial sword slung across her naked back she was one to watch but it was a laugh really nothing really matters everything is just a joke life is the game is one cards pretty much like another when you come to think about it for all it matters might as well throw the lot in the air it was nearly his turn to play first that flatchested bitch boy did he have a card he was going to hit her with horza switched off again unsure whether he was hearing kraiklyns own thoughts about the woman or ones somebody else was trying to get him to think about her he picked up kraiklyns thoughts later on in the hand when the woman was out and sitting back and relaxing her eyes closed horza looked briefly at the whitehaired woman on the couch down in front of him she was watching the game apparently but one leg was slung over the side of her lounger swinging to and fro as though her mind was somewhere else kraiklyn was feeling good first of all that slut next to him was out and he was sure it was because of some of the cards he had played but also there was a sort of inner exhilaration here he was playing with the best players in the galaxy the players him him a sudden inhibitory thought blocked out a name he was about to think and he really wasnt doing that badly at all he was keeping up in fact this hand was looking pretty damn good at last things were going right he was going to win something too many things had well there was that think about the cards suddenly think about here and now yes the cards lets see i can hit that fat blue oaf with horza switched off again he was sweating he hadnt fully realised the degree of feedback from the players mind that was involved he had thought it was just the emotions beamed at them he hadnt dreamed he would be so much in kraiklyns mind yet this was only a taste of what kraiklyn himself was getting full blast and the moties and lives behind him real feedback only just under control only just stopping from becoming the emotional equivalent of a loudspeaker howl building to destruction now the changer realised the attraction of the game and why people had been known to go mad when playing it much as he disliked the experience horza felt new respect for the man he intended at least to remove and replace and most likely to kill kraiklyn had a sort of advantage in as much as the thoughts and emotions being beamed back at him were at least partly emanating from his own mind whereas the lives and the moties had to put up with extremely powerful blasts of what was entirely somebody elses way of feeling something all the same it had to take a considerable strength of character or a vast amount of hard training to be able to handle what kraiklyn was obviously coping with horza switched back in again and thought how do the moties stand it and watch out maybe this is how they started kraiklyn lost the hand two rounds of betting later the halfblind albino neeporlax was defeated too and the suut raked in his winnings his steel face glowing in the light reflected from the aoish credits in front of him kraiklyn was slumped in his seat feeling horza knew like death a pulse of a sort of resigned almost grateful agony swept through kraiklyn from behind as his first life died and horza felt it too he and kraiklyn both winced horza switched off and looked at the time less than an hour had passed since he had bluffed his way past the guards at the outer doors of the arena he had some food on a low table by his couch but he got up all the same and walked away from the table up the terrace towards the nearest walkway where food stalls and bars waited security guards were checking passes horza saw them moving from person to person on the terrace he kept his face to the front but flicked his eyes from side to side watching the guards as they moved one was almost directly in his path bending to ask an oldlooking female who was lying on an airbed which blew perfumed fumes round her thin exposed legs she was sitting watching the game with a big smile on her face and she took a while to notice the guard horza walked a little faster so that when the guard straightened he would be past her the old lady flashed her pass and turned quickly back to the game the guard put out an arm in front of horza may i see your pass sir horza stopped and looked into the face of the young burly woman he looked back down to the couch he had been on im sorry i think i left it down there ill be back in a second can i show it to you then im in a bit of a hurry he shifted his weight from one foot to the other and bent a little at the waist i got wrapped up in the last hand there too much to drink before the game started always the same never learn all right he put out his hands looked a little sheepish and made as if to clap the guard on her shoulders he shifted his weight again the guard looked down to where horza had indicated he had left his pass for now sir ill look at it later but you really shouldnt go leaving it lying about dont do it again right right thank you horza laughed and went off at a quick walk onto the circular walkway and then to a toilet just in case he was being watched he washed his face and hands listened to a drunk woman singing somewhere in the echoing room then left by another exit and walked round to another terrace where he got something else to eat and had a drink he bribed his way into a different terrace again this one even more expensive than the one he had been on originally because it was next to the one which held wilgres concubines a soft wall of shining black material had been erected at the rear and sides of their terrace to keep out the nearer eyes but their body scent wafted strongly over the terrace horza now found himself on genofixed before conception not only to be stunningly attractive to a wide variety of humanoid males the females in the harem also had highly accentuated aphrodisiac pheromones before horza knew what was happening he had an erection and had started to sweat again most of the men and women around him were in a state of obvious sexual arousal and those not plugged into the game on some sort of exotic doublefix were engaged in sexual foreplay or actual intercourse horza made his immune glands start up again and walked stiffly to the front of the terrace where five couches had been vacated by two males and three females who were rolling around on the ground in front just behind the restraining barrier clothes lay scattered on the terrace floor horza sat on one of the five free couches a female head beaded with sweat appeared from the tangle of heaving bodies long enough to look at horza and breathe feel free and if you would like to then her eyes rolled upwards and she moaned her head disappeared again horza shook his head swore and made his way out of the terrace his attempt to recover the money he had spent bribing his way in was met with a pitying laugh horza ended up sitting on a stool in front of a combined bar and betting stall he ordered a drug bowl and made a small bet on kraiklyn to win the next hand while his body gradually freed itself of the effects of the concubines doctored sweat glands his pulse lowered and his breathing shallowed perspiration stopped rolling down his brow he sipped his drug bowl and sniffed the fumes while watching kraiklyn lose first one and then another hand though in the first one he pulled out early enough not to lose a life nevertheless he was down to one life now it was possible for a damage player to gamble his own life if he had no other remaining behind him but it was a rare thing and in games where the very best met hopefuls as in this one the ishlorsinami tended to forbid it the captain of the clear air turbulence was taking no chances he dropped out of every game before he could lose a life obviously waiting for a hand that would be almost unbeatable before gambling for what might be the last time in the game horza ate horza drank horza sniffed sometimes he tried to look over at the terrace he had been on at first where the boredlooking woman was but he couldnt see for the lights now and again he looked up at the fighting animals on the trapezes they were tired now and injured the elaborate choreography of their earlier movements was gone and they were reduced to hanging grimly onto their trapeze with one limb and striking out at each other with the other clawed arm whenever they happened to come close enough drops of white blood fell like sparse snow and settled on an invisible force field twenty metres beneath them gradually the lives died the game went on time according to who you were dragged or flashed by the price of drinks and drugs and food went up slowly as the destruction time crept closer through the still transparent dome of the old arena the lights of departing shuttles blazed now and again a fight broke out between two punters at the bar horza got up and moved away before the security guards came to break it up horza counted his money he had two aoish credit tenths left plus some money credited to the negotiable cards which were becoming harder and harder to use as the accepting computers in the orbitals financial network were closed down he leant on a restraining bar on a circular walkway watching the game progress on the table below wilgre was leading the suut was just behind they had both lost the same number of lives but the blue giant had more money two of the hopefuls had left the game one after trying unsuccessfully to persuade the officiating ishlorsinami that he could afford to gamble with his own life kraiklyn was still in there but from the closeup of his face which horza caught on a monitor screen in a drug bar he passed the man was finding the going hard horza toyed with one of the aoish credit tenths wishing the game would end or at least that kraiklyn would get put out the coin stuck to his hand and he looked down into it it was like looking into a tiny infinite tube lit from the very bottom by bringing it up to your eye with the other closed you could experience vertigo the aoish were a banker species and the credits were their greatest invention they were just about the only universally acceptable medium of exchange in existence and each one entitled the holder to convert a coin into either a given weight of any stable element an area on a free orbital or a computer of a given speed and capacity the aoish guaranteed the conversion and never defaulted and although the rate of exchange could sometimes vary to a greater extent than was officially allowed for as it had during the idiranculture war on the whole the real and theoretical value of the currency remained predictable enough for it to be a safe secure hedge against uncertain times rather than a speculators dream rumour as ever contrary enough to be suspiciously believable had it that the group in the galaxy which possessed the greatest hoard of the coins was the culture the most militantly unmoneyed society on the civilised scene horza didnt really believe that rumour either though in fact he thought that it was just the sort of rumour the culture would spread about itself he pushed the coins away into a pocket inside his blouse as he saw kraiklyn reaching to the centre of the game table and toss some coins into the large pile already there watching carefully now the changer made his way round to the nearest moneychangers bar got eight hundredths for his single tenth an exorbitant rate of commission even by vavatch standards and used some of the change to bribe his way into a terrace with some unoccupied couches there he plugged into kraiklyns thoughts who are you the question leapt out at him into him the sensation was one of vertigo a stunning dizziness a vastly magnified equivalent of the disorientation which sometimes affects the eyes when they fasten on a simple and regular pattern and the brain mistakes its distance from that pattern the false focus seeming to pull at the eyes muscles against nerves reality against assumptions his head did not swim it seemed to sink foundering struggling who are you who am i who are you slam slam slam the sound of the barrage falling the sound of doors closing attack and incarceration explosion and collapse together just a little accident a slight mistake one of those things a game of damage and a hightech impressionist unfortunate combination two harmless chemicals which when mixed feedback a howl like pain and something breaking a mind between mirrors he was drowning in his own reflection something breaking falling through one fading part of him the part which didnt sleep yes no screamed from down the deep dark pit as it fell changer changer change eee the sound faded whisperquieted became the windmoan of stale air through dead trees on a barren midnight solstice the souls midwinter in some calm hard place he knew start again somebody knew that somewhere a man sat in a seat in a big hall in a city in on a big place a big threatened place and the man was playing playing a game a game which killed the man still there living and breathing but his eyes did not see his ears did not hear he had one sense now this one inside here fastened inside here whisper who am i thered been a little accident life a succession of same evolution dependent on garbling all progress a function of getting things wrong he and forget who this he is just accept the nameless term while this equation works itself out he is the man in the chair in the hall on the big place fallen somewhere inside himself somewhere inside another one a double a copy somebody pretending to be him but something wrong with this theory start again marshal forces need clues reference points something to hold onto memory of a cell dividing seen in time lapse the very start of independent life though still dependent hold that image words names need words not yet but something about turning inside out a place what am i looking for mind whose silence whose silence whose silence start again listen this is shock you were hit hard this is just some form of shock and youll recover you are the man playing the game as are we all still something wrong though something both missing and added think of those vital errors think of that dividing cell same and notsame the place thats turned inside out the cell cluster turning itself inside out looking like a split brain unsleeping moving listen for somebody trying to talk to you silence this from that very pit of night naked in the wasteland the icewind moaning his only covering alone in the freezing darkness under a sky of chill obsidian whoever tried to talk to me when did i ever listen when was i ever other than just myself caring only for myself the individual is the fruit of mistake therefore only the process has validity so whos to speak for him the wind howls empty of meaning a soak for warmth a cess for hope distributing his bodys exhausted heat to the black skies dissolving the salty flame of his life chilling to the core sapping and slowing he feels himself falling again and knows that this time it is a deeper plunge to where the silence and the cold are absolute and no voice cries out not even this one howled like the wind whoever cared enough to talk to me silence whoever ever cared silence who whisper listen the jinmoti of bozlen two two somebody had spoken once he was the changer he was the error the imperfect copy he was playing a different game from the other one but he still intended to take a life he was watching feeling what the other was feeling but feeling more horza kraiklyn now he knew the game was damage the place was a world where a ribbon of the original idea was turned inside out an orbital vavatch the mind in schars world xoralundra balveda the and finding his hate he hammered it into the wall of the pit like a peg for a rope culture a breach in the cell wall waters breaking light freeing illumination leading to rebirth weight and cold and bright bright light shit bastards lost it all thanks to a pit of selfdoubt treble a wave of despondent fury swept over him and something died horza tore the flimsy headset away he lay quivering on the couch his eyes gummed and smarting staring up at the auditorium lights and the two white fighting animals hanging halfdead from the trapezes overhead he forced his eyes closed then pulled them open again away from the darkness pit of selfdoubt kraiklyn had been hit by cards which made the target player question their own identity from the tenor of kraiklyns thoughts before hed pulled the headset off horza thought kraiklyn hadnt been too terrified by the effect just disorientated hed been sufficiently distracted by the attack to lose the hand and that was all his opponents had been aiming for kraiklyn was out of the game the effect on him trying to be kraiklyn but knowing he wasnt had been more severe that was all it was any changer would have had the same problem he was certain the trembling began to fade he sat up and swung his feet off the couch he had to leave kraiklyn would be going so he had to pull yourself together man he looked down to the playing table the breastless woman had won kraiklyn glared at her as she raked in her winnings and his straps were unfastened on the way out of the arena kraiklyn passed the limp still warm body of his last life as it was released from its seat he kicked the corpse the crowd booed horza stood up turned and bumped into a hard unyielding body may i see that pass now sir said the guard hed lied to earlier he smiled nervously aware that he was still trembling a little his eyes were red and his face was covered in sweat the guard gazed steadily at him her face expressionless some of the people on the terrace were watching them im sorry the changer said slowly patting his pockets with shaking hands the guard put out her hand and took his left elbow perhaps youd better look horza said bending closer to her i i havent got one would a bribe do he started to reach inside his blouse for the credits the guard kicked up with her knee and twisted horzas left arm behind his back it was all done in the most expert fashion and horza had to jump to ride the kick tolerably he let his left shoulder disconnect and started to crumple but not before his free hand had lightly scratched the guards face and that he realised as he fell had been an instinctive reaction nothing reasoned for some reason he found this amusing the guard caught horzas other arm and pinned both his hands behind his back using her lockglove to secure them there with her other hand she wiped blood from her cheek horza knelt on the terrace surface moaning the way most people would have with an arm broken or dislocated its all right everybody just a little problem over a pass please continue with your enjoyment the guard said then she pulled her arm up the locked glove hauled horza up too he yelped with pretended pain and then head down was pushed up the steps to the walkway seven three seven three male code green incoming walk seven spinwards the guard told her lapel mike horza felt her start to weaken as soon as they got to the walkway he couldnt see any other guards yet the pace of the woman behind him faltered and slowed he heard her gasp and a couple of drunks leaning on an autobar looked at them quizzically once turned on his bar stool to watch seven thr the guard began then her legs buckled horza was dragged down with her the locked glove staying tight while the muscles in the womans body relaxed he connected his shoulder again twisted and heaved the field filaments in the glove gave way leaving him with livid bruises already starting to form on his wrists the guard lay on her back on the walkway floor her eyes closed breathing lightly horza had scraped her with a nonlethal poison nail he thought anyway he had no time to wait and see they were sure to come looking for the guard soon and he couldnt afford to let kraiklyn get too far ahead of him whether he was heading back to the ship as horza expected he would or staying to observe more of the game horza wanted to stay close his hood had fallen back during the fall he pulled it forward then hoisted the woman up dragged her to the bar where the two drunks sat and heaved her onto a bar stool putting his arms crossed on the bar in front and letting her head rest on them the drunk who had watched what had happened grinned at the changer horza tried to grin back look after her now he said he noticed a cloak at the foot of the other drunks bar stool and lifted it up smiling at its owner who was too busy ordering another drink to notice horza put the cloak round the woman guards shoulders hiding her uniform in case she gets cold he told the first drunk who nodded horza walked off quietly the other drunk who hadnt noticed the woman until then got his drink from the flap in the counter in front of him turned round to talk to his friend noticed the woman draped across the bar nudged her and said hey you like the cloak uh how about i get you a drink before he left the auditorium horza looked up the fighting animals would fight no more beneath the shining hoop that was vavatchs far and at the moment day side one beast lay in a broad shallow pool of milky blood high in the air its huge fourlimbed frame an x poised over the proceedings beneath the dark fur and heavy head gashed white flecked the other creature hung swaying gently from its trapeze it dripped white blood and twisted slowly hanging by one closed and locked set of talons as dead as its fallen adversary horza racked his brains but could not recall the names of these strange beasts he shook his head and hurried away he found the players area an ishlorsinami stood by some double doors in a corridor deep underneath the arena surface a small crowd of people and machines stood or sat around some were asking the silent ishlorsinami questions most were talking amongst themselves horza took a deep breath then waving one of his now useless negotiable account cards elbowed his way through the crowd saying security come on out of the way there security people protested but moved horza planted himself in front of the tall ishlorsinami steely eyes looked down at him from a thin hard face you horza said snapping his fingers where did that player go the one in the light onepiece suit brown hair the tall humanoid hesitated come on man horza said ive been chasing that cardsharp round half the galaxy i dont want to lose him now the ishlorsinami jerked his head in the direction of the corridor leading to the main arena entrance he just left the humanoids voice sounded like two pieces of broken glass being rubbed together horza winced but nodded quickly and pushing his way back through the crowd ran up the corridor in the vestibule of the arena complex there was an even bigger crowd guards wheeled security drones private bodyguards car drivers shuttle pilots city police people with desperate looks waving negotiable cards others listing those who were buying space on shuttle buses and hovers running out to the port area people just hanging around waiting to see what was going to happen or hoping that an ordered taxi was about to show up people just wandering around with lost expressions on their faces their clothes torn and dishevelled others with smiles all confidence clutching bulky bags and pouches to themselves and frequently accompanied by a hired guard of their own they all milled around in the vast expanse of noisy bustling space which led from the auditorium proper to the plaza outside in the open air under the stars and the bright line of the orbitals far side pulling his hood further over his face horza pushed through a barricade of guards they still seemed concerned with keeping people out even at this late stage in the game and in the countdown to destruction and he was not hindered he looked over the swirling mass of heads capes helmets casings and ornamentation wondering how he was going to catch kraiklyn in this lot or even see him a wedge of uniformed quadrupeds pushed past him some tall dignitary carried on a litter in their midst as horza was still staggering a soft pneumatic tyre rolled over his foot as a mobile bar touted its wares would you like a drugbowl cocktail sir said the machine fuck off horza told it and he turned to head after the wedge of fourlegged creatures making for the doors certainly sir dry medium or horza elbowed his way through the crowd after the quadrupeds he caught up with them and in their wake had an easy passage to the doors outside it was surprisingly cold horza saw his breath in front of him as he looked quickly around trying to spot kraiklyn the crowd outside the arena was hardly less thick and rowdy than that inside people hawked wares sold tickets staggered about paced to and fro tried to beg money from strangers picked pockets scanned the skies or peered down the broad spaces between buildings a constant bright stream of machines appeared roaring out of the sky or sweeping up the boulevards stopped and after taking people on raced off again horza just couldnt see properly he noticed a huge hireguard a threemetretall giant in a bulky suit holding a large gun and looking about with a vacant expression on a broad pale face wisps of bright red hair poked from underneath his helmet you for hire horza asked doing a sort of breast stroke to get to the giant through a knot of people watching some fighting insects the broad face nodded gravely and the huge man came to attention that i am the great voice rumbled heres a hundredth horza said quickly shoving a coin into the mans glove where it looked quite lost let me up on your shoulders im looking for somebody all right the man said after a seconds thought he bent down slowly on one knee the rifle in his hand put out to steady him butt first on the ground horza slung his legs over the giants shoulders without being asked the man straightened and stood again and horza was hoisted high above the heads of the people in the crowd he pulled the hood of the blouse over his face again and scanned the mass of people for a figure in a light onepiece suit although he knew that kraiklyn might have changed by now or even have left a tight nervous feeling of desperation was building in horzas belly he tried to tell himself that it didnt matter that much if he lost kraiklyn now that he could still make his way alone to the port area and so to the gsv that the clear air turbulence was on but his guts refused to be calmed it was as though the atmosphere of the game the terminal excitement of the orbital the city the arena in their last hours had altered his own body chemistry he could have concentrated on it and made himself relax but he couldnt afford to do that now he had to look for kraiklyn he scanned the gaudy collection of individuals waiting in a cordoned area for shuttles then recalled kraiklyns thought about having wasted a lot of money he looked away and surveyed the rest of the crowd he saw him the captain of the clear air turbulence was standing his suit partly covered by a grey cloak his arms folded and his feet apart in a queue of people waiting to get buses and taxis thirty metres away horza dipped forward and leant over until he was looking at the hireguards upsidedown face thanks you can put me down now i have no change the man rumbled as he stooped the vibration went up through horzas body thats ok keep it horza jumped off the guards shoulders the giant shrugged as horza ran swerving and ducking to get past people towards where he had seen kraiklyn he had his terminal fastened to his left cuff the time was minus two and a half hours horza squeezed and shoved and excused and apologised his way through the crowd and on his way saw many people squinting at watches terminals and screens heard many little synthesised voices squawk the hour and nervous humans repeat it there was the queue it looked surprisingly orderly horza thought then he noticed that it was being supervised by the same security guards who had been inside the arena kraiklyn was near the front of the queue now and a bus had almost finished filling up road cars and hovers waited behind it kraiklyn pointed at one of them as a security guard with a notescreen talked to him horza looked at the row of waiting people and guessed there must be several hundreds of them in it if he were to join it he would lose kraiklyn he looked around quickly wondering what other way there might be of following somebody crashed into him from behind and horza turned round to the noise of shouting and voices and a press of brightly dressed people a masked woman in a tight silver dress was shouting and screaming at a small puzzledlooking man with long hair clad only in intricate loops of dark green string the woman shouted incoherently at the small man and struck out at him with her open hands he backed off shaking his head people watched horza checked that he hadnt had anything stolen when he was bumped into then looked round again for some transport or a taxi tout an aircraft flew overhead noisily and dropped leaflets written in a language horza didnt understand sarble a transparentskinned man said to a companion as they both squeezed out of the nearby crowd and went past horza the man was trying to look at a small terminal screen as he walked horza caught a glimpse of something which puzzled him he turned his own terminal onto the appropriate channel he was watching what looked like the same incident he had seen for real in the auditorium a few hours earlier the disturbance on the terrace above his own when hed heard that sarble the eye had been caught by the security guards horza frowned and brought the screen on his cuff closer it was that same place it was that incident seen from almost exactly the same angle and apparent distance hed watched it from he grimaced at the screen trying to imagine where the picture he was watching now could have been taken from the scene ended and was replaced by candid shots of various eccentriclooking beings enjoying themselves in the auditorium as the damage game went on somewhere in the background if id stood up horza thought and moved over just a it was the woman the woman with the white hair hed seen early on standing in the highest pan of the arena fiddling with a tiara shed been on that same terrace been standing by his lounger when the incident on the terrace above took place she was sarble the eye probably the tiara was the camera and the person on the higher terrace was a decoy a plant horza snapped off the screen he smiled then shook his head as though to dislodge the small useless revelation from the centre of his attention he had to find some transport he started walking quickly through the crowd threading his way through people in groups and lines and queues looking for a free vehicle an open door a touts eyes he caught a glimpse of the queue kraiklyn was in the cats commander was at the open door of a red road car apparently arguing with its driver and two other people in the queue horza felt sick he started to sweat he wanted to kick out to throw all the people crowding around him out of his path away from him he doubled back he would have to risk trying to bribe his way into kraiklyns queue at the front he was five metres away from the queue when kraiklyn and the two other people stopped arguing and got into the taxi which drove off as he turned his head to watch it go past his stomach sinking his fists clenching horza saw the whitehaired woman again she wore a hooded blue cloak but the hood fell back as she squeezed out of the crowd to the edge of the road where a tall man put his arm round her shoulders and waved into the plaza she pulled the hood up again horza put his hand into his pocket and onto the gun then went forward towards the couple just as a sleek mattblack hover hissed out of the darkness and stopped beside them horza stepped forward quickly as the hovers side door winged open and the woman who was sarble the eye stooped to enter horza reached out and tapped the woman on the shoulder she whirled round to face him the tall man started towards him and horza shoved his hand forward and up in his pocket so that the gun pressed out the man stopped looking down uncertain the woman froze one foot on the doors sill i think youre going my way horza said quickly i know who you are he nodded at the woman i know about that thing you had on your head all i want is a lift to the port thats all no fuss he gestured with his head in the direction of the security guards at the head of the main queue the woman looked at the tall man then at horza she stepped back slowly ok after you no you first horza motioned with the hand in his pocket the woman smiled shrugged and got in followed by the tall man and horza whats he began the driver a fiercelooking bald woman a guest sarble told her just drive the hover rose straight ahead horza said fast as you like im looking for a redcoloured wheeled car he took the gun out of his pocket and pivoted round so that he faced sarble the eye and the tall man the hover accelerated i told you they put that cast out too soon the tall man hissed in a hoarse high voice sarble shrugged horza smiled glancing occasionally out of the window at the traffic around the cab but watching the other two people from the corner of his eye just bad luck sarble said i kept bumping into this guy inside the place too you really are sarble then horza said to the woman she didnt look round and didnt reply look the man said turning to horza well take you to the port if thats where this red cars going but just dont try anything well fight if we have to im not afraid to die the tall man sounded frightened and angry at the same time his yellowwhite face looked like a childs about to cry youve convinced me horza grinned now why not watch out for the red car three wheels four doors driver three people in the back cant miss it the tall man bit his lip horza motioned him to look forward with a small movement of the gun that it the baldheaded driver said horza saw the car she meant it looked right yes follow it not too close the hover dropped back a little they entered the port area cranes and gantries were lit in the distance parked road vehicles hovers and even light shuttles lay scattered on either side of the road the car was just ahead now following a couple of struggling hover buses up a shallow ramp their own hovers engine laboured as they climbed the red car branched off the main route and followed a long curve of roadway water glittering darkly on either side are you really sarble horza asked the whitehaired woman who still didnt turn to him was that you earlier outside the hall or not is sarble really lots of people the people in the car said nothing horza just smiled watching them carefully but nodding and smiling to himself there was silence in the hover only the wind roaring the car left the roadway and angled down a fenced boulevard past huge gantries and the lit masses of towering machinery then sped along a road lined on both sides with dark warehouses it started to slow by the side of a small dock pull back horza said the baldheaded woman slowed the hover as the red car cruised by the dockside under the square cages of crane legs the red car drew up by a brightly lit building a pattern of lights revolving round the top of the construction spelt out subbase access in several languages fine stop horza said the hover stopped sinking on its skirts thanks horza got out still facing the man and the whitehaired woman youre just lucky you didnt try anything the man said angrily nodding sharply his eyes glistening i know horza said bye now he winked at the whitehaired woman she turned and made what he suspected was an obscene gesture with one finger the hover rose blasted forward then skidded round and roared off the way it had come horza looked back at the subplate shaft entrance where the three people who had got out of the car stood silhouetted against the light inside one of them might have looked back down the dock towards horza he wasnt sure they did but he shrank back into the shadows of the crane above him two of the people at the access tube went into the building and disappeared the third person who might have been kraiklyn walked off towards the side of the dock horza pocketed the gun again and hurried on underneath another crane a roaring noise like the one that sarbles hover had made when it drew away from him but much louder and deeper came from inside the dock lights and spray filled the seaend of the dock as a huge aircushion vehicle similar in principle to but vastly bigger than the hover horza had commandeered swept in from the expanse of black ocean lit by starlight by the glow of the orbitals daylight side arcing overhead and by the crafts own lights the billows of spray kicked up into the air with a milky luminescence the big machine lumbered between the walls of the dock its engines shrieking beyond it out to sea horza could see another couple of clouds also lit from inside by flashing lights fireworks burst from the leading craft as it came slowly up the dock horza could make out an expanse of windows and what appeared to be people dancing inside he looked back down the dockside the man he was following was mounting the steps to a footbridge which crossed high over the dock horza ran quietly ducking behind the legs of cranes and leaping over lengths of thick hawsers the lights of the hover flashed on the dark superstructure of the cranes the scream of the jets and impellers echoed between concrete walls as though pointing out the comparative crudity of the scene a small craft dark and silent but for the tearing noise its passage made through the atmosphere rushed overhead zooming and disappearing into the night sky specking once against the loop of the orbitals daytime surface horza gave it a glance then watched the figure on the small bridge lit by the flashing lights of the hover still making its lumbering way up the dock underneath the second craft was just swinging into position outside the dock to follow it horza came to the steps leading to the walkway of the narrow suspension bridge the man who walked like kraiklyn and wore a grey cloak was about halfway across horza couldnt see much of what the terrain was like on the other side of the dock but guessed he stood a good chance of losing his quarry if he let him get to the other side before he started after him probably the man kraiklyn if it was him had worked this out horza guessed he knew he was being followed he set off across the bridge it swayed slightly underneath him the noise and lights of the giant hovercraft were almost underneath the air filled with swirling dark spray kicked up from the shallow water in the dock the man didnt look round at horza though he must have felt horzas footsteps swinging the bridge with his own the figure left the bridge at the far end horza lost sight of him and started running the gun out in front of him the aircushion vehicle beneath blasting gusts of spraysoaked air about him soaking him loud music blared from the craft audible even through the scream of the engines horza skidded along the bridge at its end and ran quickly down the spiral steps to the dockside something sailed out of the darkness under the spiral of steps and crashed into his face immediately afterwards something slammed into his back and the rear of his skull he lay on something hard groggily wondering what had happened while lights swept over him the air in his ears roared and roared and music played somewhere a bright light shone straight into his eyes and the hood over his face was thrown back he heard a gasp the gasp of a man tearing a hood away from a face only to see his own face staring back at him who are you if that was what it was then that man was vulnerable now shocked for just a few seconds who am i he had enough strength to kick up hard with one leg forcing his arms up at the same time and grabbing some material his shin connecting with a groin the man started to go over horzas shoulders heading for the dock then horza felt his own shoulders grasped and as the man he held thumped to the ground to one side and behind him he was pulled over over the side of the dock the man had landed right on the edge and had gone over taking horza with him they were falling he was aware of lights than shadow the grip he had on the mans cloak or suit and one hand still on his shoulder falling how deep was the dock the noise of wind listen for the sound of it was a double impact he hit water then something harder in a crumpling collision of fluid and body it was cold and his neck ached he was thrashing about unsure which way was up and groggy from the blows to his head then something pulled at him he punched out hit something soft then pulled upright and found himself standing in a little over a metre of water staggering forward it was bedlam light and sound and spray everywhere and somebody hanging onto him horza flailed out again spray cleared momentarily and he saw the wall of the dock a couple of metres to his right and directly in front of him the rear of the giant hovercraft receding slowly five or six metres ahead a powerful gust of oily fiery air knocked him over splashing into the water again the spray closed over him the hand let go and he fell back through the water once more going under horza struggled upright in time to see his adversary heading off through the spray following the slowly moving hovercraft up the dock he tried to run but the water was too deep he had to force his legs forward in a slowmotion nightmarish version of a run angling his torso so that his weight carried him forward with exaggerated twistings of his body from side to side he strode after the man in the grey cloak using his hands like paddles in an attempt to gain speed his head was reeling his back face and neck all hurt terribly and his vision was blurred but at least he was still chasing the man in front seemed more anxious to get away than to stay and fight the blattering exhaust of the still moving hover blew another hole in the spray towards the two men revealing the slab of stem rising above the bulbous wall of the machines skirt bowing out from fully three metres above the surface of the water in the dock first the man in front of him and then horza was blown back by the pulse of hot choking fumes the water was getting shallower horza found that he could bring his legs out of the water far enough to wade faster the noise and spray swept over them again and for a moment horza lost sight of his quarry then the view ahead was clear and he could see the big aircushion vehicle on a dry area of concrete the walls of the dock extended high on either side but the water and the clouds of spray were almost gone the man in front staggered to the brief ramp leading from the now only ankledeep water onto the concrete staggered and almost fell then started running weakly after the hovercraft now powering faster along the level concrete down the canyon of the dock horza finally splashed out of the water and ran after the man following the wetly flapping grey cloak the man stumbled fell and rolled as he started to rise horza slammed into him bowling them both over he lashed out at the mans face shadowed in the light coming from behind him but missed the man kicked out at horza then tried to get away again horza threw himself at the mans legs bringing him down once more the wet cloak flopping over his head horza scrambled over on all fours and rolled him over face up it was kraiklyn he drew his hand back for a punch the pale shaved face underneath him was twisted in terror put in shadow by some lights coming from behind horza where another great roaring noise was kraiklyn screamed looking not at the man wearing his own real face but behind him above him horza whirled round a black mass blowing spray rushed towards him lights blazed high above a siren sounded then the crushing black bulk was over him hitting him knocking him flat pounding at his eardrums with noise and pressure pressing pressing pressing horza heard a gurgling sound he was being rammed into kraiklyns chest they were both being rubbed into the concrete as though by an immense thumb another hovercraft the second one in the line hed seen abruptly with a single sweeping stroke of pain bruising him from feet to head as if a giant was trying to sweep him up off the floor with a huge hard brush the weight was lifted off in its place was utter darkness noise fit to burst skulls and violent turbulent crushing air pressure they were under the skirts of the big vehicle it was right above them moving slowly forward or maybe it was too dark to see anything stationary over the concrete apron perhaps about to settle on the concrete crushing them as though it was just another part of the maelstrom of battering pain a blow thudded into horzas ear knocking him sideways in the darkness he rolled on the rough concrete pivoting on one elbow as soon as he could and bracing one leg while he struck out with the other in the direction the punch had come from he felt his foot hit something yielding he got to his feet ducking as he thought of whirling impeller blades just overhead the eddies and vortices of hot oilfilled air rocked him like a small boat bobbing in a chopping sea he felt like a puppet controlled by a drunk he staggered forward his arms out and hit kraiklyn they started to fall again and horza let go punching with all his might at the place he guessed the mans head was his fist crashed into bone but he didnt know where he skipped back in case there was a retaliatory kick or punch on its way his ears were popping his head felt tight he could feel his eyes vibrating in their sockets he thought he was deaf but he could feel a thudding in his chest and throat making him breathless making him choke and gasp he could make out just a hint of a border of light all around them as though they were under the middle of the hovercraft he saw something just an area of darkness on that border and lunged at it swinging his foot from low down again he connected and the dark part of the border disappeared he was blown off his feet by a crushing downdraught of air and tumbled bodily along the concrete thumping into kraiklyn where he lay on the ground after horzas last kick another punch hit horza on the head but it was weak and hardly hurt horza felt for and found kraiklyns head he lifted it and banged it off the concrete then did it again kraiklyn struggled but his hands beat uselessly off horzas shoulders and chest the area of lightness beyond the dim shape on the ground was enlarging coming closer horza banged kraiklyns head against the concrete one more time then threw himself flat the rear edge of the skin scrubbed over him his ribs ached and his skull felt as though somebody was standing on it then it was over and they were in the open air the big craft thundered on trailing remnants of spray there was another one fifty metres down the dock and heading towards him kraiklyn was lying still a couple of metres away horza got up onto all fours and crawled over to the other man he looked down into his eyes which moved a little im horza horza he screamed but couldnt even hear anything himself he shook his head and with a grimace of frustration on the face that was not really his own and which was the last thing the real kraiklyn ever saw he gripped the head of the man lying on the concrete and twisted it sharply breaking the neck just as he had broken zallins he managed to drag the body to the side of the dock just in time to get out of the way of the third and last hovercraft its towering skirt bulged past two metres away from where he half lay half sat panting and sweating his back against the cold wet concrete of the dock his mouth open and his heart thudding he undressed kraiklyn took off the cloak and the lightcoloured onepiece day suit he wore then climbed out of his own torn blouse and bloody pantaloons and put on what kraiklyn had been wearing he took the ring kraiklyn wore on the small finger of his right hand he picked at his own hands at the skin where palm became wrist it came away cleanly a layer of skin sloughing off his right hand from wrist to fingertips he wiped kraiklyns limp pale right palm on a damp bit of clothing then put the skin over it pressing it down hard he lifted the skin off carefully and positioned it back on his own hand then he repeated the operation using his left hand it was cold and it seemed to take a very long time and a lot of effort eventually while the three big aircushion vehicles were stopping and letting passengers off half a kilometre down the dock horza finally staggered to a ladder of metal rungs set into the concrete wall of the dock and with shaking hands and quivering feet hauled himself to the top he lay for a while then got up climbed the spiral stairs to the small footbridge staggered across it and down the other side and entered the circular access building brightly dressed and excited people just off the big hovers and still in a party mood quietened when they saw him wait near the elevator doors for the capsule which would take them down to the spaceport area half a kilometre under their feet horza couldnt hear very much but he could see their anxious looks sense the awkwardness he was causing with his battered bloody face and his ripped soaking clothes at last the elevator appeared the party goers piled in and horza supporting himself on the wall stumbled in too somebody held his arm helping him and he nodded thanks they said something which he heard as a distant rumble he tried to smile and nod again the elevator dropped the underside greeted them with an expanse of what looked like stars gradually horza realised it was the lightspeckled top of a spacecraft larger than anything hed ever seen or even heard about before it had to be the demilitarised culture ship the ends of invention he didnt care what it was called as long as he could get aboard and find the cat the elevator had come to a halt in a transparent tube above a spherical reception area hanging in hard vacuum a hundred metres under the base of the orbital from the sphere walkways and tube tunnels spread out in all directions heading for the access gantries and open and closed docks of the port area itself the doors to the closed docks where ships could be worked on in pressurised conditions were all open the open docks themselves where ships simply moored and airlocks were required were empty replacing them all directly underneath the spherical reception area just as it was directly underneath almost the entire port area was the exculture general systems vehicle the ends of invention its broad flat top stretched for kilometre after kilometre in all directions almost totally blocking out the view of space and stars beyond instead its top surface glittered with its own lights where various connections had been made with the access tubes and tunnels of the port he felt dizzy again registering the sheer scale of the vast craft he hadnt seen a gsv before far less been inside one he knew of them and what they were for but only now did he appreciate what an achievement they represented this one was theoretically no longer part of the culture he knew it was demilitarised stripped bare of most equipment and without the mind or minds which would normally run it but just the structure alone was enough to impress general systems vehicles were like encapsulated worlds they were more than just very big spaceships they were habitats universities factories museums dockyards libraries even mobile exhibition centres they represented the culture they were the culture almost anything that could be done anywhere in the culture could be done on a gsv they could make anything the culture was capable of making contained all the knowledge the culture had ever accumulated carried or could construct specialised equipment of every imaginable type for every conceivable eventuality and continually manufactured smaller ships general contact units usually warcraft now their complements were measured in millions at least they crewed their offspring ships out of the gradual increase in their own population selfcontained selfsufficient productive and in peacetime at least continually exchanging information they were the cultures ambassadors its most visible citizens and its technological and intellectual big guns there was no need to travel from the galactic backwoods to some distant culture homeplanet to be amazed and impressed by the stunning scale and awesome power of the culture a gsv could bring the whole lot right up to your front door horza followed the brightly dressed crowds through the bustling reception area there were a few people in uniform but they werent stopping anybody horza felt in a daze as though he was only a passenger in his own body and the drunken puppeteer he had felt in the control of earlier was now sobered up a little and guiding him through the crowds of people towards the doors of another elevator he tried to clear his head by shaking it but it hurt when he did that his hearing was coming back very slowly he looked at his hands then sloughed the imprinterskin from his palms rubbing it on each of the lapels of the daysuit until it rolled off and fell to the floor of the corridor when they got off the second elevator they were in the starship the people dispersed through broad pastelshaded corridors with high ceilings horza looked one way then another as the elevator capsule swished back up towards the reception sphere a small drone floated towards him it was the size and shape of a standard suit backpack and horza eyed it warily uncertain whether it was a culture device or not excuse me are you all right the machine said its voice was robust but not unfriendly horza could just hear it im lost horza said too loudly lost he repeated more quietly so that he could hardly hear himself he was aware that he was swaying a little as he stood there and he could feel water trickling into his boots and dripping off the sodden cloak onto the soft absorbent surface under his feet where do you want to go the drone asked to a ship called horza closed his eyes in weary desperation he didnt dare give the real name the beggars bluff the drone was silent for a second then said im afraid there is no such craft aboard perhaps it is in the port area by itself not on the ends its an old hronish assault ship horza said tiredly looking for somewhere to sit down he spotted some seats set into the wall a few metres away and made his way over there the drone followed him lowering itself as he sat so that it was still at his eye level about a hundred metres long the changer went on no longer caring if he was giving some sort of game away it was being repaired by some port shipbuilders had some damage to its warping units ah i think i have the one you want its more or less straight down from here i have no record of its name but it sounds like the one you want can you manage to get there yourself or shall i take you i dont know if i can manage horza said truthfully wait a moment the drone stayed floating silently in front of horza for a moment or two then it said follow me then there is a traveltube just over here and down a deck the machine backed off and indicated the direction they should head in by extending a hazy field from its casing horza got up and followed it they went down a small open ag lift shaft then crossed a large open area where some of the wheeled and skirted vehicles used on the orbital had been stored just a few examples the drone explained for posterity the ends already had a megaship aboard stored in one of its two general bays thirteen kilometres below in the bottom of the craft horza didnt know whether to believe the drone or not on the far side of the hangar they came to another corridor and there they entered a cylinder about three metres in diameter and six long which rolled its door closed flicked to one side and was instantly sucked into a dark tunnel soft lights lit the interior the drone explained that the windows were blanked out because unless you were used to it a capsules journey through a gsv could be unsettling due both to its speed and to the suddenness of the changes of direction which the eye saw but the body didnt feel horza sat down heavily in one of the folding seats in the middle of the capsule but only for a few seconds here we are smallbay in case you need it again innerlevel soright goodbye the capsule door rolled down horza nodded to the drone and stepped out into a corridor with straight transparent walls the capsule door closed and the machine vanished he had a brief impression of it flickering past him but it happened so fast he could have been wrong anyway his vision was still blurred he looked to his right through the walls of the corridor he looked into clear air kilometres of it there was some sort of roof high above with just a suggestion of wispy clouds a few tiny craft moved level with him far enough away for the view to be both hazy and vast were hangars level after level after level of them bays docks hangars call them what you wanted they filled horzas sight for square kilometres making him dizzy with the sheer scale of it all his brain did a sort of double take and he blinked and shook himself but the view did not go away craft moved lights went on or off a layer of cloud far below made the view further down still more hazy and something whizzed by the corridor horza stood in a ship fully three hundred metres long the ship passed along the level he was on swooped and far far away did a left turn banking gracefully in the air to disappear into another bright and vast corridor which seemed to pass by at right angles to the one horza stood staring at in the other direction the one that the ship had appeared from was a wall seemingly blank horza looked closer and rubbed his eyes he saw that the wall had an orderly speckle of lights in a grid across it thousands and thousands of windows and lights and balconies smaller craft flitted about its face and the dots of traveltube capsules flashed across and up and down horza couldnt take much more he looked to his left and saw a smooth ramp leading down underneath the tube the capsule travelled in he stumbled down it into the welcomingly small space of a two hundred metre long smallbay horza wanted to cry the old ship sat on three short legs square in the centre of the bay a few bits and pieces of equipment scattered around it there was nobody else in the bay that horza could see just machinery the cat looked old and battered but intact and whole it appeared that repairs were either finished or not yet started the main hold lift was down resting on the smooth white deck of the bay horza went over to it and saw a light ladder leading up into the brightness of the hold itself a small insect landed briefly on his wrist he flapped a hand at it as it flew off how very untidy of the culture he thought absently to allow an insect on board one of their sparkling vessels still officially at least the ends was no longer the cultures wearily he climbed the ladder hampered by the damp cloak and accompanied by the squelching noises coming from his boots the hold smelled familiar though it looked oddly spacious with no shuttle in it there was nobody about he went up the stairs from the hold to the accommodation section he walked along the corridor towards the mess wondering who was alive who was dead what changes had been made if any it had only been three days but he felt as though he had been away for years he was almost at yalsons cabin when the door was quickly pulled open yalsons fairhaired head came out an expression of surprise even joy starting to form on it haw she said then stopped frowned at him shook her head and muttered something ducking back into her cabin horza had stopped he stood there thinking he was glad she was alive realising he hadnt been walking properly not like kraiklyn his tread had sounded like his own instead a hand appeared from yalsons door as she pulled on a light robe then she came out and stood in the corridor looking at the man she thought was kraiklyn her hands on her hips her lean hard face looked slightly concerned but mostly wary horza hid his hand with the missing finger behind his back what the hell happened to you she said i got in a fight what does it look like he got the voice right they stood looking at each other if you want any help she began horza shook his head ill manage yalson nodded half smiling looking him up and down yeah all right you manage then she jerked a thumb over her shoulder in the direction of the mess your new recruit just brought her gear aboard shes waiting in the mess though if you look in now she might not think its such a wonderful idea to join up horza nodded yalson shrugged then turned and walked up the corridor through the mess towards the bridge horza followed her our glorious captain she said to somebody in the room as she went through horza hesitated at kraiklyns cabin door then went forward to stick his head round the door of the mess a woman was sitting at the far end of the mess table her legs crossed over a chair in front of her the screen was switched on above her as though she had been watching it it showed a view of a megaship being lifted bodily out of the water by hundreds of small lifter tugs clustered under and around it they were recognisably antique culture machines the woman had turned from the sight though and was gazing towards horza when he looked round the side of the door she was slim and tall and pale she looked fit and her blackcoloured eyes were set in a face just starting to show worried surprise at the battered face looking at her from the doorway she had on a light suit the helmet of which lay on the table in front of her a red bandanna was tied round her head below the level of her closecropped red hair oh captain kraiklyn she said swinging her feet off the seat and leaning forward her face showing shock and pity what happened horza tried to speak but his throat was dry he couldnt believe what he saw his lips worked and he licked them with a dry tongue the woman started to rise from the table but he put out one hand and gestured her to stay where she was she sat slowly back down and he managed to say im all right see you later just just stay there then he pushed himself away from the door and stumbled down the corridor to kraiklyns cabin the ring fitted into the door and it swung open he almost fell inside in something like a trance he closed the door stood there looking at the far bulkhead for a while then slowly sat down on the floor he knew he was still stunned he knew his vision was still blurred and he wasnt hearing perfectly he knew it was unlikely or if it wasnt then it was very bad news indeed but he was sure absolutely certain as certain as he had been about kraiklyn when he first walked up that ramp to the damage table into the arena as though he hadnt had enough shocks for one evening the sight of the woman sitting at the messroom table had all but silenced him and stopped his mind from working what was he going to do he couldnt think the shock was still resounding through his mind the image seemed stuck behind his eyes the woman in the mess room was perosteck balveda the ends of invention maybe shes a clone horza thought maybe its coincidence he sat on the floor of kraiklyns cabin his cabin now staring at the locker doors in the far wall aware that he needed to do something but not sure what it ought to be his brain wasnt able to take all the knocks and shocks it had had he needed to sit and think for a moment he tried telling himself he was mistaken that it wasnt really her that he was tired and confused and getting paranoid seeing things but he knew it was balveda though sufficiently altered so that probably only a close friend or a changer could possibly recognise her but definitely her alive and well and probably armed to the teeth he got up mechanically still staring straight ahead he took off the wet clothes and went out of the cabin down to the wash area where he left the clothes to dry and cleaned himself up back in the cabin he found a robe and put it on he started inspecting the small packed space and finally came across a small voice recorder he flicked it back and listened ahhh including ahh yalson kraiklyns voice said from the small speaker in the machine who i guess was umm in her relationship with ahh horza gobuchul shes been pretty abrupt and i dont think ive had the support from her which she which i ought to get ill have a word with her if it goes on but ahhh for now during the repairs and such there doesnt seem much point im not putting off ah i just think well see how she shapes up after the orbitals blown and were on our way ahh now this new woman gravant shes all right i get the impression she might ah need need a bit of ordering around seems to need discipline i dont think shell have ah too much conflict with anybody yalson especially i was worried about but i dont think ah i think itll be fine but you can never tell with women ah of course so but i like her i think shes got class and maybe i dont know maybe she could make a good number two if she shapes up i really need more people umm things havent gone all that well recently but i think ive been theyve let me down jandraligeli obviously and i dont know ill see if maybe i can do something about him because hes really sort of just been ahh hes betrayed me thats the way thats what it is i think anybody would agree so maybe ill have a word with ghalssel at the game assuming he arrives i dont think the guys really up to standard and ill tell ghalssel as much because were both in the same ah business and im i know that hell have heard well hell listen to what i have to say because he knows about the responsibilities of leadership and just ah the way i do anyway ill do some more recruiting after the game and after the gsv takes off therell be some time we have enough time still to run in this bay and ill put the word out theres bound to be a lot of people ready to sign on ah oh yeah mustnt forget about the shuttle tomorrow im sure i can get the price down ah i could just win at the game of course the small voice from the speaker laughed a tinny echo and just be incredibly rich and the laughter came again distorted and not give a fuck about any of this crap any more shit just ha give the cat away well sell it and retire but well see the voice faded horza switched off the machine in the silence he put it down where he had found it and rubbed the ring on the small finger of his right hand then he took off the robe and put his his suit on it started talking to him he told it to turn its voice off he looked at himself in the reverser field on the locker doors drew himself up made sure the plasma pistol strapped to his thigh was switched on pushed the pains and tiredness to the back of his mind then went out of the cabin and up the corridor to the mess yalson and the woman who was balveda were sitting talking in the long room at the far end of the table under the screen which had been turned off they looked up when he came in he went over and sat a couple of seats down from yalson who looked at his suit and said we going somewhere maybe horza said looking briefly at her then switching his gaze to the balveda woman smiling and saying im sorry ms gravant but im afraid having reconsidered your application i have to turn you down im sorry but theres no place for you on the cat i hope you understand he clasped his hands on the table and grinned again balveda the more he looked the surer he was that it was her looked crestfallen her mouth opened slightly she looked from horza to yalson then back again yalson was frowning deeply but balveda began what the hell are you talking about yalson said angrily you cant just you see horza smiled ive decided that we need to cut down on the numbers on board and what yalson exploded slapping the table with the palm of her hand thats six of us left what the hell are six of us meant to do her voice trailed off then came back lower and slower her head twisting to one side her eyes narrowing as she looked at him or have we just struck lucky in oh a game of chance perhaps and dont want to cut in more directions than absolutely necessary horza looked briefly at yalson again smiled and said no but you see ive just rehired one of our exmembers and that does alter the plans a bit the place i had intended to slot ms gravant into in the ships company is now filled you got jandraligeli to come back after what you called him laughed yalson stretching back in her seat horza shook his head no my dear he said as i would have been able to tell you if you hadnt kept interrupting i just met our friend mr gobuchul in evanauth and hes keen to rejoin horza yalson seemed to shake a little her voice on an edge of tension and he could see her trying to control herself oh gods a small voice inside him said why does this hurt so much yalson said is he alive are you sure it was him kraiklyn are you horza switched his gaze rapidly from one woman to the other yalson was leaning forward over the table her eyes glittering in the messroom light her fists clenched her lean body seemed tensed the golden down on her dark skin shining balveda looked uncertain and confused horza saw her start to bite her lip then stop i wouldnt kid you about it yalson horza assured her horza is alive and well and not very far away horza looked at the repeater screen on his suit cuff where the time showed as a matter of fact im meeting him at one of the port reception spheres in well just before the gsv takes off he said he had one or two things to work out in the city first he said to say ahhh he hoped you were still betting on him he shrugged something like that youre not kidding yalson said her face creasing with a smile she shook her head put a hand through her hair slapped the table softly a couple of times oh she said then sat back again in her seat she looked from the woman to the man and shrugged silent so you see gravant you just arent needed right now horza told balveda the culture agent opened her mouth but it was yalson who spoke first coughing quickly and then saying oh let her stay kraiklyn what difference does it make the difference yalson horza said carefully thinking hard about kraiklyn is that i am captain of this ship yalson seemed about to say something but instead she turned to balveda and spread her hands she sat back one hand picking at the edge of the table her eyes lowered she was trying not to smile too much well captain balveda said rising from her seat you do know best ill get my gear she walked quickly from the mess her footsteps merged with others and horza and yalson both heard some muffled words in a moment dorolow wubslin and aviger gaily dressed and looking flushed and happy piled into the mess the older man with his arm around the small plump woman our captain aviger shouted dorolow held one of his hands at her shoulder she smiled wubslin waved dreamily the stocky engineer looked drunk been at the wars i see aviger went on staring at horzas face which still showed signs of being in a fight despite his internal attempts to minimise the damage what has gravant done kraiklyn dorolow squeaked she seemed merry too and her voice was even higher than he remembered it nothing horza said smiling at the three mercenaries but were getting horza gobuchul back from the dead so i decided we didnt need her horza wubslin said his large mouth opening wide in an almost exaggerated expression of surprise dorolow looked past horza at yalson the look on her face saying is this true through her grin yalson shrugged and looked happily hopefully still slightly suspiciously at the man she thought was kraiklyn hell be coming aboard shortly before the ends leaves horza said he had some sort of business in the city maybe something shady horza smiled in the condescending way kraiklyn sometimes had who knows there wubslin said looking unsteadily at aviger over dorolows stooped frame maybe that guy was looking for horza maybe we should warn him what guy where horza asked hes seeing things aviger said waving one hand too much liverwine rubbish wubslin said loudly looking from aviger to horza and nodding and a drone he held both hands out in front of his face palms together then separated them by about a quartermetre little bugger no biggern that where horza shook his head why do you think somebody might be after horza out there under the traveltube aviger said while wubslin was saying way he came out of that capsule like he expected to be in a fight any second and aww i can just tell that guy was police or something what about mipp asked dorolow horza was silent for a second frowning at nothing and nobody in particular did horza mention mipp dorolow asked him mipp he said looking at dorolow no he shook his head no mipp didnt make it oh im sorry dorolow said look horza said staring at aviger and wubslin you think theres somebody out there looking for one of us a man wubslin nodded slowly and a little tiny really meanlooking drone with a chill horza recalled the insect which had settled momentarily on his wrist in the smallbay outside just before he had boarded the cat the culture he knew had machines artificial bugs that size hmm horza said pursing his lips he nodded to himself then looked at yalson go and make sure gravant gets off the ship quickly all right he stood up and got out of the way while yalson moved she went down the corridor to the cabins horza looked at wubslin and motioned the engineer forward towards the bridge with his eyes you two stay here he said quietly to aviger and dorolow slowly they let go of each other and sat down in a couple of seats horza went through to the bridge he pointed wubslin to the engineers seat and sat down in the pilots wubslin sighed heavily horza closed the door then quickly reeled through all he had learned about the procedures on the bridge during the first weeks he had been aboard the cat he was reaching forward to open the communicator channels when something moved under the console near his feet he froze wubslin peered down then bent with an audible effort and stuck his big head down between his legs horza smelled drink havent you finished yet wubslins muffled voice said they took me off to another job i only just got back wailed a small thin artificial voice horza sat back in his seat and looked under the console a drone about two thirds the size of the one which had escorted him from the elevator to the cats bay was disentangling itself from a jumble of tine cables protruding from an open inspection hatch what horza said is that oh wubslin said wearily belching same one thats been here you remember come on you he said to the machine the captain wants to do a communication test look the little machine said its synthesised voice full of exasperation i have finished im just tidying everything away well get a move on wubslin said he withdrew his head from underneath the console and looked apologetically at horza sorry kraiklyn never mind never mind horza waved his hand he powered up the communicator ah he looked at wubslin whos controlling traffic movements around here ive forgotten who to ask for what if i want the bay doors opened traffic doors opened wubslin looked at horza with a puzzled expression he shrugged and said well just traffic control i suppose like when we came in right horza said he flicked the switch on the console and said traffic control this is his voice trailed off hed no idea what kraiklyn had called the cat instead of its real name he hadnt got that as part of the information hed bought and it was one of the many things he had meant to learn once hed accomplished the most immediate task of getting balveda off the ship and with luck following a false trail but the news that there might be somebody looking for him in this bay or anybody for that matter had rattled him he said this is the craft in smallbay i want immediate clearance to leave the bay and the gsv well quit the orbital independently wubslin stared at horza this is evanauth port traffic control gsv temporary section one moment smallbay said the speakers set in horza and wubslins seat headrests horza turned to wubslin switching off the communicator send button this thing is ready to fly isnt it wha fly wubslin looked perplexed he scratched his chest looked down at the drone still working to stuff the wires back under the console i suppose so but great horza started switching everything on motors included he noticed the bank of screens carrying information about the bow laser flickering on along with everything else at least kraiklyn had had that repaired fly wubslin repeated he scratched his chest again and turned towards horza did you say fly yes were leaving horzas hands flicked over the buttons and sensor switches adjusting the systems of the waking ship as though he really had been doing it for years well need a tug wubslin said horza knew the engineer was right the cats antigravity was only strong enough to produce an internal field the warp units would blow so close to in fact inside a mass as great as the ends and you couldnt reasonably use the fusion motors in an enclosed space well get one ill tell them its an emergency ill say weve got a bomb aboard or something horza watched the main screen come on filling the previously blank bulkhead in front of him and wubslin with a view of the rear of the smallbay wubslin got his own monitor screen to display a complicated plan which horza eventually identified as a map of their level of the gsvs vast interior he only glanced at it at first then ignored the view on the main screen and looked more carefully at the plan and finally put a holo of the gsvs whole internal layout onto the main screen quickly memorising all he could what wubslin paused belched again rubbed his belly through his tunic and said what about horza well pick him up later horza said still studying the layout of the gsv i made other arrangements in case i couldnt meet him when i said horza punched the transmit button again traffic control traffic control this is smallbay i need emergency clearance repeat i need emergency clearance and a tug straight away i have a malfunctioning fusion generator i cant close down repeat nuclear fusion generator breakdown going critical what a small voice screeched something banged into horzas knee and the drone working under the console wobbled quickly into view festooned with cables like a streamerdraped party goer what did you say shut up and get off the ship now horza told it turning up the gain on the receiver circuits a hissing noise filled the bridge with pleasure the drone said and shook itself to get rid of the cables looped round its casing as usual im the last to be told whats going on but i know i dont want to stick around this it was muttering when the hangar lights went out at first horza thought the screen had blown but he slid the wavelength control up and a dim outline of the bay reappeared showing its appearance on infrared ohoh said the drone turning first to the screen then looking back at horza you lot did pay your rent didnt you dead wubslin announced the drone got rid of the last of its cables horza looked sharply at the engineer what wubslin pointed at the transceiver controls in front of him dead somebodys cut us off from traffic control a shudder ran through the ship a light blinked indicating that the main hold lift had just slammed up automatically a draught briefly stirred the air in the flight deck then died more lights started flashing on the console shit horza said now what well goodbye chaps the drone said hurriedly it shot past them sucked the door open and whooshed down the corridor heading for the hangar stairwell pressure drop wubslin said to himself scratching his head for a change and knotting his brows as he looked at the screens in front of him kraiklyn yalsons voice shouted from the seat headrest speakers a light on the console showed that she was calling from the hangar what horza snapped what the hells going on yalson shouted we were nearly crushed the airs going from the smallbay and the hangar lift just emergencied on us whats happening ill explain horza said his mouth was dry and he felt as though there was a lump of ice in his guts is ms gravant still with you of course shes still fucking with me right come back up to the mess room right away both of you kraiklyn yalson began then another voice cut in starting from a distance but quickly coming closer to the mike closed closed why is this lift door closed what is going on on this vessel hello bridge captain a sharp taptap noise came from the headrest speakers and the synthesised voice went on why am i being obstructed let me off this ship at get out of the way you idiot yalson said then its that goddam drone again you and gravant get up here horza repeated now horza closed down the hangar com circuit he wheeled out of the seat and patted wubslin on the shoulder strap in get us ready to roll everything then he swung through the open door aviger was in the corridor coming from the mess to the bridge he opened his mouth to speak but horza squeezed quickly past him not now aviger he put his right glove to the lock on the armoury door it clicked open horza looked inside i was only going to ask what the hells going on horza completed the old mans sentence for him as he lifted the biggest neural stun pistol he could see slammed the armoury doors shut and paced quickly down the corridor through the mess room where dorolow was sitting asleep in a chair and into the corridor through the accommodation section he switched the gun on turned its power control to maximum then held it behind his back the drone appeared first flying up the steps and darting along the corridor at eye level captain i really must prot horza kicked a door open caught the bevelled front of the drone as it came towards him and threw the machine into the cabin he slammed the door shut voices were coming up the steps from the hangar he held onto the handle of the cabin door it was pulled hard then thumped this is outrageous a distant tinny voice wailed kraiklyn yalson said as her head appeared at the top of the steps horza smiled readying the gun he held behind his back the door resounded again shaking his hand let me out kraiklyn what is going on yalson said coming along the corridor balveda was almost up the stairs carrying a large kitbag over her shoulder im going to lose my temper the door shook again a whine high and urgent came from behind yalson from balvedas kitbag then a staticlike crackle yalson didnt hear the highpitched whine which was an alarm horza though was distantly aware of dorolow stirring somewhere behind him in the mess room at the burst of static which was a highly compressed message or signal of some sort yalson started to turn back to balveda at the same moment horza leapt forward taking his hand off the cabin door handle and bringing the heavy stun gun round to bear on balveda the culture woman was already dropping the kitbag one hand flashing so fast even horza could hardly follow the movement down to her side horza threw himself into the space between yalson and the corridor bulkhead knocking the woman mercenary to one side at the same time with the big stun gun pointing straight at balvedas face he pulled the trigger the weapon hummed in his hand as he continued forward dropping he tried to keep the gun pointing at balvedas head all the way down he hit the deck just before the sagging culture agent did yalson was still staggering back after being thumped against the far bulkhead horza lay on the deck watching balvedas feet and legs for a second then he quickly scrambled up saw balveda move groggily her redhaired head scraping on the deck surface her dark eyes opening briefly he pulled the stungun trigger again keeping it depressed and pointing the gun at the womans head she shook spastically for a second saliva drooling from one corner of her mouth then went limp the red bandanna rolled off her head are you crazy yalson screamed horza turned to her her name isnt gravant its perosteck balveda and shes an agent in the cultures special circumstances section thats their euphemism for military intelligence in case you didnt know he said yalson was backed up almost to the messroom entrance her eyes full of fear her hands clutching at the surface of the bulkhead on either side of her horza went up to her she shrank from him and he sensed her getting ready to strike out he stopped short of her turned the stun gun round and handed it to her grip first if you dont believe me well probably all end up dead he said edging the gun forward towards her hands she took it eventually im serious he told her search her for weapons then get her into the mess and strap her into a seat tie her hands down tight and her legs then strap in yourself weve leaving ill explain later he started to go past her then he turned and looked into her eyes oh and keep stunning her every now and again on maximum power special circumstancers are very tough he turned and went towards the mess room he heard the stun gun click kraiklyn yalson said he stopped and turned round again she was pointing the gun straight at him holding it in both hands and level with his eyes horza sighed and shook his head dont he said what about horza hes safe i swear it but hell be dead if we dont get out of here now and if she wakes up he nodded past yalson at the long inert form of balveda he turned again then walked into the mess the back of his head and the nape of his neck tingling with anticipation nothing happened dorolow looked up from the table and said what was that noise as horza went past what noise horza said as he went through to the bridge yalson watched kraiklyns back as he walked through the mess room he said something to dorolow then he was through to the bridge she let the stun gun down slowly it hung in one hand she looked at the gun thoughtfully and said to herself quietly yalson my girl there are times when i think youre a little too loyal she raised the gun again as the cabin door opened just a crack and a small voice said is it safe out there yet yalson grimaced pushed the door open and looked at the drone which was retreating further into the cabin she nodded her head to the side and said get out here and give me a hand with this bod you liverless piece of clockwork wake up horza kicked wubslins leg as he swung back into his chair aviger was sitting in the third seat in the flight deck looking anxiously at the screens and controls wubslin jumped then looked round with bleary eyes eh he said then i was just resting my eyes horza pulled out the cats manual controls from their recess in the edge of the console aviger looked at them with apprehension just how hard did you knock your head he said to horza horza smiled coldly at him he scanned the screens as fast as he could and threw the safety switches on the ships fusion motors he tried traffic control once more the smallbay was still dark the outside pressure gauge registered zero wubslin was talking to himself as he checked over the crafts monitoring systems aviger horza said not looking at the older man i think youd better strap in what for aviger asked quietly measuredly we cant go anywhere we cant move were stuck here until a tug arrives to take us out arent we of course we are horza said adjusting the readying controls of the fusion motors and putting the ship leg controls on automatic he turned and looked at aviger tell you what why dont you go and get that new recruits kitbag take it down to the hangar and shove it into a vactube what aviger said his already creased face becoming more lined as he frowned i thought she was leaving she was but whoever is trying to keep us in here started evacuating the air from the smallbay before she could get off now i want you to take her kitbag and all the other gear she may have left lying around and stow it in a vactube all right aviger got up from the seat slowly looking at horza with a tense worried expression on his face all right he started to leave the bridge then hesitated looking back at horza kraiklyn why am i putting her kitbag in the vactube because theres almost certainly a very powerful bomb in it thats why now get down there and do it aviger nodded and left looking even less happy horza turned back to the controls they were almost ready wubslin was still talking to himself and hadnt strapped in properly but he seemed to be doing his part competently enough despite frequent belches and pauses to scratch his chest and head horza knew he was putting the next bit off but it had to be done he pressed the ident button this is kraiklyn he said and coughed identification complete the console said immediately horza wanted to shout or at least to sag in his seat with relief but he hadnt the time to do either and wubslin would have thought it a little strange so might the ships computer for that matter some machines were programmed to watch for signs of joy or relief after the formal identification was over so he did nothing to celebrate just brought the fusion motor primers up to operating temperature captain the small drone dashed back into the bridge coming to a halt between wubslin and horza you will let me off this ship at once and report the irregularities taking place aboard immediately or or what horza said watching the temperature in the cats fusion motors soar if you think you can get off this ship youre welcome to try probably culture agents would blow you to dust even if you did get out culture agents the small machine said with a sneer in its voice captain for your information this gsv is a demilitarised civilian vessel under the control of the vavatch hub authorities and within the terms laid down in the idiranculture war conduct treaty drawn up shortly after the commencement of hostilities how so who turned the lights off and let the air out idiot horza said turning to the machine briefly he looked back to the console turning the bow radar up as high as it would go and taking readings through the blank wall of the rear of the smallbay i dont know the drone said but i rather doubt it would be culture agents who or what do you think these supposed agents are after you what if they were horza took another look at the holo display of the gsvs internal layout he briefly magnified the volume around smallbay before switching the repeater screen off the drone was silent for a second then backed off through the doorway great im locked in an antique with a paranoid lunatic i think ill go and look for somewhere safer than this you do that horza yelled down the corridor after it he turned the hangar circuit back on aviger he said ive done it said the old mans voice right get to the mess fast and strap in horza killed the circuit again well wubslin said sitting back in his seat and scratching his head looking at the bank of screens in front of him with their arrays of figures and graphs i dont know what it is youre intending to do kraiklyn but whatever it is were as ready as well ever be to do it the stout engineer looked across at horza lifted himself slightly from his seat and pulled the restraining straps over his body horza grinned at him trying to look confident his own seats restrainers were a little more sophisticated and he just had to throw a switch for cushioned arms to swing over and inertia fields to come on he pulled his helmet over his head from the hinged position and heard it hiss shut oh my god wubslin said looking slowly away from horza to stare at the almost featureless rear wall of the smallbay shown on the main screen i sure as hell hope youre not going to do what i think you are horza didnt reply he hit the button to talk to the mess all right just about kraiklyn but yalson said horza killed that circuit too he licked his lips took the controls in his gloved hands sucked in a deep breath then flicked the thumb buttons on the cats three fusion motors just before the noise started he heard wubslin say oh my god you are the screen flashed went dark then flashed again the view of the smallbays rear wall was lit by three jets of plasma bursting from underneath the ship a noise like thunder filled the bridge and reverberated through the whole craft the two outboard motors were the main thrust vectored down for the moment they blasted fire onto the deck of the smallbay scattering the machinery and equipment from underneath and around the craft slamming it into walls and off the roof as the blinding jets of flame steadied under the vessel the inboard liftonly nose motor fired raggedly at first then settled quickly starting to burn its own hole through the thin layer of ultradense material which covered the smallbay floor the clear air turbulence stirred like a waking animal groaning and creaking and shifting its weight on the screen a huge shadow veered across the wall and the roof in front as the infernal light from the nose fusion motor burned under the ship rolling clouds of gas from burning machinery were starting to haze over the view horza was amazed that the walls of the smallbay had held out he flicked the bow laser at the same time as increasing the fusion motor power the screen detonated with light the wall ahead burst open like a flower seen in time lapse huge petals throwing themselves towards the ship and a million pieces of wreckage and debris flashing past the vessels nose on the shock wave of air bursting in from the far side of the lasered wall at the same time the clear air turbulence lifted off the legweight readouts stopped at zero then blanked out as the legs glowing red with heat stowed themselves inside the hull emergency undercarriage cooling circuits whined into action the craft started to slew to one side shaking with its own power and with the impact of debris swirling about it the view ahead cleared horza steadied the ship then gunned the rear motors flinging some of their power backwards towards the smallbay doors a rear screen showed them glowing white hot horza would dearly have liked to head that way but reversing and ramming the doors with the cat would have probably been suicidal and turning the craft in such a confined space impossible just going forward was going to be hard enough the hole wasnt big enough horza saw it coming towards him and knew straight away he used one shaking finger on the laser beamspread control set in the semiwheel of the controls turning the spread up to maximum then firing once more the screen washed out with light again all around the perimeter of the hole the cat stuck its nose and then its body into another smallbay horza waited for something to hit the sides or roof of the whitehot gap but nothing happened they sailed through on their three pillars of fire throwing light and wreckage and waves of smoke and gas before them the dark waves blasted out over shuttles the whole smallbay they were now moving slowly through was full of shuttles of every shape and description they were floating over them battering them and melting them with their fire horza was aware of wubslin sitting on the seat beside him his eyes locked onto the view ahead his legs drawn up as far as possible so that his knees stuck up above the edge of the console and his arms locked in a sort of square over his head each hand grasping the bicep of the other arm his face was a mask of fear and incredulity when horza turned round to glance at him and grinned wubslin pointed frenziedly at the main screen watch he shrieked over the racket the cat was shaking and bouncing rocked by the stream of superheated matter pouring from under its hull it would be using the atmosphere around it to produce plasma now that there was air available and in the relatively confined space of the smallbays the turbulence created was enough to shake the vessel bodily there was another wall ahead coming up faster than horza would have liked they were slewing slightly again as well he narrowed the laser angle again and fired pulling the ship round at the same time the wall flashed once around its edges the roof and floor of the smallbay flashed in loops of flame where the laser caught them and dozens of parked shuttles ahead of them pulsed with light and heat the wall ahead started to fall slowly back but the cat was coming up on it faster than it was crumpling horza gasped and tried to pull back he heard wubslin howl as the vessels nose hit the undamaged centre of the wall the view on the main screen tilted as the ship rammed into the wall material then the nose came down the clear air turbulence quivered like an animal shaking water from its fur and they were rocking and yawing into yet another smallbay it was totally empty horza gunned the engines a little more took a couple of bursts with the laser at the next wall then watched in amazement as this wall instead of falling back like the last one crashed down towards them like a vast castle drawbridge slamming in one fiery piece onto the deck of the empty smallbay in a fury of steam and gas a mountain of water appeared over the top of the collapsing wall and poured out in a huge wave towards the approaching ship horza heard himself shouting he rammed the motor controls full on and kept the laser fire button hard down the cat leapt forward it flashed over the surface of the cascading water enough of the plasma heat smashing into its liquid surface to instantly fill all the space of smallbays its passage had created with a boiling fog of steam as the tide of water continued to pour from the flooded smallbay and the cat screeched above it the air about the ship filled with superheated steam the external pressure gauge went up too quickly for the eye to follow the laser blasted even more vapour off the water in front and with an explosion like the end of the world the next wall blew out ahead of the vessel weakened by the laser and finally blasted away by the sheer pressure of steam the clear air turbulence shot out from the tunnel of linked smallbays like a bullet from a gun motors flaming in the middle of a cloud of gas and steam which it quickly outdistanced it roared into a canyon of airfilled space between towering walls of bay doors and opened accommodation sections lighting up kilometres of wall and cloud screaming with its three flamefilled throats and seemingly pulling after it a tidal wave of water and a volcanolike cloud of steam gas and smoke the water fell turning from a solid wave into something like heavy surf then spray then just rain and water vapour following the huge flapping card of the bay door tumbling through the air the cat wrenched itself round twisting and slewing through the air in an attempt to check its headlong rush towards the far wall of smallbay doors facing it across that vast internal canyon then its motors flickered and went out the clear air turbulence started to fall horza gunned the controls but the fusion motors were dead the screen showed the wall of doors to other bays on one side then air and clouds then the wall of bay doors on the other side they were in a spin horza looked over at wubslin as he fought with the controls the engineer was staring at the main screen with a glazed expression on his face wubslin horza screamed the fusion motors stayed dead aaah wubslin seemed to have woken up to the fact that they were falling out of control he leapt at the controls in front of him just fly it he shouted ill try the primers must have overpressured the motors horza wrestled with the controls while wubslin tried to restart the engines on the screen walls spun crazily about them and clouds beneath them were coming up fast beneath them really beneath them a dead flat layer of clouds horza shook the controls again the nose motor burst into life guttering wildly sending the spinning craft careering off towards one side of the artificial cliff of bay doors and walls horza cut the motor out he steered into the spin using the crafts control surfaces rather than the motors then he aimed the whole ship straight down and put his fingers on the laser buttons again the clouds flashed up to meet the vessel he closed his eyes and squeezed the laser controls the ends of invention was so huge it was built on three almost totally separate levels each over three kilometres deep they were pressure levels there because otherwise the differential between the very bottom and the very top of the giant ship would have been the difference between standard sea level and a mountain top somewhere in the tropopause as it was there existed a three and a half thousand metre difference between the base and roof of each pressure level making sudden journeys by traveltube from one to the other inadvisable in the immense open cave that was the hollow centre of the gsv the pressure levels were marked by force fields not anything material so that craft could pass from one level to another without having to go outside the vessel and it was towards one of those boundaries marked by cloud that the clear air turbulence was falling firing the laser did no good whatsoever though horza didnt know that at the time it was a vavatch computer which had taken over the internal monitoring and control from the cultures own minds which opened a hole in the force field to let the falling vessel through it did so in the mistaken assumption that less damage would be caused to the ends of invention by letting the rogue vessel fall through than having it impact in the centre of a sudden maelstrom of air and cloud in its own small hurricane the cat burst through from the thick air at the bottom of one pressure level and into the thin atmosphere at the top of the one below a vortex of ragclouded air blew out after it like an inverted explosion horza opened his eyes again and saw with relief the distant floor of the gsvs cavernous interior and the climbing figures on the main fusion motors monitor screens he hit the engine throttles again this time leaving the nose motor alone the two main engines caught shoving horza back in his seat against the cloying hold of the restrainer fields he pulled the nose of the diving craft up watching the floor far below gradually disappear from view as it was replaced by the sight of another wall of opened bay doors the doors were much larger than those of the smallbays in the level they had just left and the few craft horza could see either nosing into or appearing out of the lit lengths of the huge hangars were fullsize starships horza watched the screen piloting the clear air turbulence exactly like an aircraft they were travelling quickly along a vast corridor over a kilometre across with the layer of clouds about fifteen hundred metres above them starships were moving slowly through the same space a few on their own ag fields most towed by light lifter tugs everything else was moving slowly and without a fuss only the cat disturbed the calm of the giant ships interior screaming through the air on twin swords of brilliant flame pulsing from whitehot plasma chambers another cliffface of huge hangar doors faced them horza looked about him at the curve of main screen and pulled the cat over on a long banking left turn diving a little at the same time to head down an even broader canyon of space they flashed over a slowmoving clipper being towed towards a distant open mainbay rocking the starship in their wake of superheated air the wall of doors and opened entrances slanted towards them as horza tightened the turn ahead horza could see what looked like a cloud of insects hundreds of tiny black specks floating in the air far beyond them maybe five or six kilometres away a thousand metre square of blackness bordered with a slowly flashing strip of subdued white light was the exit from the ends of invention it was a straight run horza sighed and felt his whole body relax unless they were intercepted they had done it with a little luck now they might even get away from the orbital itself he gunned the engines heading for the inky square in the distance wubslin suddenly sat forward against the pull of acceleration and punched some buttons his repeater screen set in the console magnified the centre section of the main screen showing the view ahead theyre people he shouted horza frowned over at the man what people those are people they must be in ag harnesses were going to go right through them horza looked briefly over at wubslins repeater screen it was true the black cloud which almost filled the screen was made up of humans flying slowly about in suits or ordinary clothes there were thousands of them horza saw less than a kilometre ahead and closing quickly wubslin was staring at the screen waving his hand at the people get out the way get out the way he was shouting horza couldnt see a way round over or beneath the mass of flying people whether they were playing some curious mass aerial game or were just enjoying themselves they were too many too close too widespread shit horza said he got ready to cut the rear plasma motors before the clear air turbulence went into the cloud of humans with luck they might make it through before they had to relight them and so not incinerate too many people no wubslin screamed he threw the restraining straps off leapt across towards horza and dived at the controls horza tried to fend the bulky engineer off but failed the controls were wrenched from his hands and the view on the main screen tipped and swirled pointing the nose of the speeding ship away from the black square of the gsv exit away from the huge cloud of airborne people and towards the cliff of brightly lit mainbay entrances horza clouted wubslin across the head with his arm sending the man falling to the floor stunned he grabbed the controls back from the relaxing fingers of the engineer but it was too late to turn away horza steadied and aimed the clear air turbulence darted for an open mainbay it flashed through the open entrance and swept over the skeleton of a starship being rebuilt in the bay the light from the cats motors starting fires singeing hair smouldering clothes and blinding unprotected eyes horza saw wubslin lying unconscious on the floor out of the corner of his eye rocking gently as the cat careered through the half kilometre length of mainbay the doors to the next bay were open and the next and the next they were flying through a two kilometre tunnel racing over the repair and docking facilities of one of evanauths displaced shipbuilders horza didnt know what was at the far end but he could see that before they got there they would have to fly over the top of a large spaceship which almost filled the third bay along horza vectored the fusion fire ahead so that they started to slow twin beams of fire flashed on either side of the main screen as the fusion power kicked forward wubslins unrestrained body slid forward on the floor of the bridge wedging under the console and his own seat horza lifted the cats nose as the blunt snout of the parked spacecraft sitting in the bay ahead approached the clear air turbulence zoomed towards the ceiling of the mainbay flashed between it and the top surface of the ship then fell on the other side and although still slowing shot through the final mainbay and into another corridor of free air space it was too narrow horza dived the craft again saw the floor coming up and fired the lasers the cat burst through a rising cloud of glowing wreckage bumping and shaking wubslins squat frame sliding out from under the console and floating back up towards the rear door of the bridge at first horza thought they were out at last but they werent they were in what the culture called a general bay the cat fell once more then levelled out again it was in a space which seemed even larger than the main interior of the gsv it was flying through the bay they had stored the megaship in the same megaship horza had seen on the screen earlier being lifted out of the water by a hundred or so ancient culture lifter craft horza had time to look around there was plenty of space lots of room and time the megaship lay on the floor of the giant bay looking for all the world like a small city sitting on a great slab of metal the clear air turbulence flew past the stern of the megaship past tunnels full of propeller blades tens of metres across round the side of its rearmost outrigger where beached pleasure craft waited for a return to water over the towers and spires of its superstructure then out over its bows horza looked forward the doors if they were doors of the general bay faced him two kilometres away they were that same distance from top to bottom and twice that across horza shrugged and checked the laser again he was becoming he realised almost blasé about the whole thing what the hell he thought the lasers picked a hole in the wall of material ahead punching a slowly widening gap which horza aimed straight for a vortex of swirling air was starting to form around the hole as the cat rushed closer it was caught in a small horizontal cyclone of air and started to twist then it was through and in space in a quickly dispersing bubble of air and crystals of ice the craft burst from the body of the general systems vehicle swooping into vacuum and starwashed darkness at last behind it a force field slammed across the hole its passage had created in the doors of the general bay horza felt the plasma motors stutter as their supply of outside air disappeared then the internal tanks took up the slack he was about to cut them and slide gently into the startup procedure for the crafts warp engines when the speakers in his headrest crackled this is evanauth port police all right you son of a bitch just keep on that heading and slow right down evanauth port police to rogue craft halt on that heading a horza pulled on the controls taking the cat on a huge accelerating arc up over the stern of the gsv flashing past the outside of the kilometresquare exit he had been heading for earlier wubslin moaning now bumped around the inside of the bridge as the cat lifted its nose to head straight up towards the maze of abandoned docks and gantries that was evanauth port as it went it turned still twisting slightly from the spin it had picked up from the vortex of air bursting from the general bay horza let it twist steadying it only as they approached the top of the loop the port facilities coming up fast then sliding underneath as the craft levelled out rogue ship this is your last warning the speakers blared stop now or well blow you out of the sky god hes heading for the transmission cut off horza grinned to himself he was indeed heading for the gap between the underside of the port and the top of the gsy the clear air turbulence flashed through spaces between traveltube connections elevator shafts graving dock gantries transit areas arriving shuttle craft and crane towers horza guided the ship through the maze with the fusion motors still blazing at maximum boost throwing the small craft through the few hundred metres of crowded space between the orbital and the general systems vehicle the rear radar pinged picking up following echoes two towers hanging under the orbital like upsidedown skyscrapers between which horza was aiming the cat suddenly blossomed with light scattering wreckage horza cringed in his seat as he corkscrewed the ship into the space between the two clouds of debris those were across the bows crackled the speakers again the next ones will be straight up your ass boy racer the cat shot out over the dull grey plain of slanting material that was the start of the ends nose horza turned the cat over and dived down following the slope of the vast crafts bows the rear radar signal stopped briefly then reappeared he flipped the ship over again wubslin his arms and legs waving weakly was dumped onto the cats bridge ceiling and stuck there like a fly while horza did a section of an outside loop the ship was racing powering away from the orbital port area and the big gsv heading for space horza remembered about balvedas gear and quickly reached over to the console closing the vactube circuit from there a screen showed that all the vactubes had been rotated the rear screen showed something flame inside the twin plumes of plasma fire the rear radar pinged insistently goodbye stupid the voice in the headrest speakers said horza threw the ship to one side the rear screen went white then black the main screen pulsated with colours and broken lines the speakers in horzas helmet as well as the speakers set into the seat howled every instrument on the console flashed and wavered horza thought for a second they had been hit but the motors were still blasting the main screen was starting to clear and the other instruments were recovering too the radiation meters were bleeping and flashing the rear screen stayed blank a damage monitor indicated that the sensors had been knocked out by a very strong pulse of radiation horza started to realise what had happened when the rear radar didnt start pinging again after it recovered he threw back his head and laughed there had indeed been a bomb in balvedas kitbag whether it had gone off because it was caught in the cats plasma exhaust or because somebody whoever had been trying to keep the ship on board the gsv in the first place had detonated it remotely the instant the fleeing craft was far enough away from the ends not to cause too much damage horza didnt know whatever the explosion seemed to have caught the pursuing police vessels laughing uproariously horza angled the cat further away from the great circle of brilliantly lit orbital heading straight out towards the stars and readying the warp engines to take over from the plasma motors wubslin back on the deck one leg caught on the arm of his own chair moaned distantly mother he said mother say its only a dream horza laughed louder you lunatic breathed yalson shaking her head her eyes were wide that was the craziest thing ive ever seen you do youre mad kraiklyn im leaving i resign as of now shit i wish id gone with jandraligeli to ghalssel you can just drop me off first place we get to horza sat down wearily in the seat at the head of the messroom table yalson was at the far end under the screen which was switched into the bridge main screen the cat was proceeding under full warp two hours out on its journey from vavatch there had been no further pursuit following the destruction of the police craft and now the cat was gradually coming round to the course horza had set into the war zone towards the edge of the glittercliff towards schars world dorolow and aviger were sitting plainly still shaken to one side of yalson the woman and the elderly man were both staring at horza as though he was pointing a gun at them their mouths were open their eyes were glazed on the other side of yalson the slack form of perosteck balveda was leaning forward head down her body pulling against the restraining straps of the seat the mess room was chaotic the cat hadnt been readied for violent manoeuvring and nothing had been stowed away plates and containers a couple of shoes a glove some halfunravelled tapes and spools and various other bits and pieces now lay strewn about the floor of the mess yalson had been hit by something and a small trickle of blood had dried on her forehead horza hadnt let anybody move apart from brief visits to the heads for the last two hours hed told everybody to stay where they were over the ship pa while the cat headed away from vavatch on a twisting erratic course he had kept the plasma motors and laser warm and ready but no further pursuit came now he reckoned they were safe and far enough away to warp straight he had left wubslin on the bridge nursing the battered and abused systems of the clear air turbulence as best he could the engineer had apologised for grabbing at the controls and had become very subdued not meeting horzas eyes but tidying up one or two bits of loose debris on the bridge and stuffing some of the loose wires back under the console horza told wubslin he had nearly killed them all but on the other hand so had he so they would forget it this time theyd escaped intact wubslin nodded and said he didnt know how he couldnt believe the ship was virtually undamaged wubslin wasnt undamaged he had bruises everywhere im afraid horza said to yalson once he had sat down and put his feet up our first port of call is rather bleak and underpopulated im not sure youll want to be dropped off there yalson put the heavy stun pistol down onto the table surface and just where the hell are we going whats going on kraiklyn what was all that craziness back on the gsv whats she doing here why is the culture involved yalson nodded at balveda during this speech and horza kept looking at the unconscious culture agent when yalson stopped waiting for an answer aviger and dorolow were looking at him expectantly too before horza could answer the small drone appeared from the corridor leading from the accommodation section it floated in looked round the mess room then sat itself bodily on the table in the middle did i hear something about it being explanation time it said it was facing horza horza looked away from balveda to aviger and dorolow then to yalson and the drone well you might as well all know that we are now heading for a place called schars world its a planet of the dead yalson looked puzzled aviger said ive heard of those but we wont be allowed in this is getting worse the drone said if i were you captain kraiklyn i would turn back to the ends of invention and surrender yourself there im sure youd get a fair trial horza ignored the machine he sighed looking round at the mess stretched his legs and yawned im sorry youre all being taken perhaps against your will but ive got to get there and i cant afford to stop anywhere to let you off youve all got to come oh we do do we said the small drone yes horza said looking at it im afraid so but we wont be able to get anywhere near this place aviger protested they dont let anybody in theres some sort of zone around them they dont let people into well see about that when we get there horza smiled youre not answering my questions yalson said she looked at balveda again then down at the gun lying on the table ive been zapping this poor bitch every time she flicks an eyelid and i want to know why ive been doing it itll take a while to explain it all but what it boils down to is theres something on schars world which both the culture and the idirans want i have a contract a commission from the idirans to get there and find this thing you really are a paranoid the drone said incredulously it rose off the table and turned round to look at the others he really is a lunatic the idirans are hiring us you to go after something yalsons voice was full of disbelief horza looked at her and smiled you mean this woman dorolow said pointing at balveda was sent by the culture to join us infiltrate are you serious im serious balveda was looking for me also for horza gobuchul she wanted to get to schars world or to stop us from getting there horza looked at aviger there was a bomb in amongst her gear by the way it went off just after i rotated it out the tubes it blew the police ships away we all got a blast of radiation but nothing lethal and what about horza yalson said looking grimly at him was that just some trick or did you really meet him he is alive yalson and as safe as any of us wubslin appeared through the door from the bridge still with an apologetic look on his face he nodded at horza and sat down near by all looking fine kraiklyn good horza said i was just explaining to everybody else about our journey to schars world oh wubslin said yeah he shrugged at the others kraiklyn yalson said leaning forward on the table and looking intently at horza you just about got us all killed fuck knows how many times back there you probably did kill quite a few people during those indoor aerobatics youve saddled us with some secret agent from the culture youre practically kidnapping us to take us towards a planet in the middle of a war zone where nobodys even allowed in to look for something both sides want enough to well if the idirans are hiring a decimated bunch of secondrate mercenaries they must be pretty desperate and if the culture really was behind the attempt to keep us in that bay they must be scared stiff to risk violating the neutrality of the ends and breaking some of their precious rules of war you may think you know whats going on and think the risk is worth it but i dont and i dont like this feeling of being kept in the dark at all either your track record recentlys been crap lets face it risk your own life if you want to but you dont have any right to risk ours too not any more maybe we dont all want to side with the idirans but even if we did prefer them to the culture none of us signed up to start fighting in the middle of the war shit kraiklyn were neither equipped nor trained well enough to go up against those guys i know all that horza said but we shouldnt be encountering any battle forces the quiet barrier round schars world extends far enough out so that its impossible to watch it all we go in from a randomly picked direction and by the time were spotted theres nothing anybody could do about it no matter what sort of ship they have a main battle fleet couldnt keep us out when we leave itll be the same what youre trying to say is yalson said sitting back in her seat easy in easy out maybe i am laughed horza hey wubslin said suddenly looking at his terminal screen which he had just taken from his pocket its nearly time he got up and disappeared through the doors leading to the bridge in a few seconds the screen in the mess changed the view swivelling round until it showed vavatch the great orbital hung in space dark and brilliant full of night and day blue and white and black they all looked up at the screen wubslin came back in and sat in his seat again horza felt tired his body wanted rest and lots of it his brain was still buzzing from the concentration and the amount of adrenalin it had required to pilot the cat through and out of the ends of invention but he couldnt rest yet he couldnt decide what was the best thing to do should he tell them who he was tell them the truth that he was a changer that he had killed kraiklyn how loyal were any of them to the leader they didnt yet know was dead yalson the most perhaps but surely she would be glad to know that he was alive yet she was the one who had said that perhaps they werent all on the idirans side she had never shown any sympathy for the culture before when he had known her but perhaps she had changed her mind he could even change back there was a fairly long journey now during which it shouldnt be beyond him perhaps with the help of wubslin to change the fidelities in the cats computer but should he tell them should he let them know and balveda what was he going to do with her he had had some idea of using her to bargain with the culture but it looked as though they had escaped now and next stop was schars world where she would at best be a liability he ought to kill her now but he knew first of all that that might not go down well with the others especially yalson he also knew although he didnt like to admit it that he would find it personally painful to kill the culture agent they were enemies they had both been very close to death and the other had done little or nothing to intervene but actually to kill her would be very difficult or maybe he only wanted to pretend that he would find it very difficult maybe it would be no bother at all and the sort of bogus camaraderie of doing the same job though on different sides was just that a fake he opened his mouth to ask yalson to stun the culture agent again now wubslin said with that vavatch orbital started to disintegrate the view of it on the messroom screen was a compensated hyperspace version so that although they were already outside the vavatch system they were watching it virtually in real time right at the appointed hour the unseen unnamed very much still militarised general systems vehicle which was somewhere in the vicinity of the vavatch planetary system started its bombardment it was almost certainly an ocean class gsv the same one which had sent the message that they had all watched some days ago on the mess screen heading in towards vavatch that would make the warcraft very much smaller than the behemoth of the ends of invention which was for war purposes obsolete one ocean class could fit inside either of the ends general bays but while the larger craft by that time an hour out from the orbital was full of people the ocean class would be packed with other warships and weaponry gridfire struck the orbital horza paused and watched the screen as it lit up suddenly flashing once over its whole surface until the sensors coped with the sudden increase in brilliance and compensated for some reason horza had thought the culture would just splash the gridfire all over the massive orbital and then spatter the remains with cam but they didnt do that instead a single narrow line of blinding white light appeared right across the breadth of the day side of the orbital a thin fiery blade of silent destruction which was instantly surrounded by the duller but still perfectly white cover of clouds that line of light was part of the grid itself the fabric of pure energy which lay underneath the entire universe separating this one from the slightly younger slightly smaller antimatter universe beneath the culture like the idirans could now partially control that awesome power at least sufficiently to use it for the purposes of destruction a line of that energy plucked from nowhere and sliced across the face of the threedimensional universe was down there on and inside the orbital boiling the circlesea melting the two thousand kilometres of transparent wall annihilating the base material itself straight across its thirtyfivethousandkilometre breadth vavatch that fourteen million kilometre hoop was starting to uncoil a chain it had been cut there was nothing left now to hold it together its own spin the source of both its daynight cycle and its artificial gravity was now the very force tearing it all apart at about one hundred and thirty kilometres per second vavatch was throwing itself into outer space unwinding like a released spring the livid line of fire appeared again and again and again working its way methodically round the orbital from where the original burst had struck neatly parcelling the entire orbital into squares thirtyfive thousand kilometres to a side each containing a sandwich of trillions upon trillions of tonnes of ultradense base material water land and air vavatch was turning white first the gridfire seared the water into a border of clouds then the outrushing air spilling from each immense flat square like heavy fumes off a table turned its load of water vapour to ice the ocean itself no longer held by the spin force was shifting spilling with infinite slowness over one edge of every plate of ruptured base material becoming ice and swirling away into space the precise brilliant line of fire marched on going back in reversespin direction neatly dissecting the still curved still spinning sections of the orbital with its sudden lethal flashes of light light from outside the normal fabric of reality horza remembered what jandraligeli had called it back when lenipobra had been enthusing about the destruction the weaponry of the end of the universe the mondlidician had said horza watched the screen and knew what the man had meant it was all going all of it the wreck of the olmedreca the tabular berg it had collided with the wreck of the cats shuttle mipps body lenipobras whatever was left of fwisongs corpse mr firsts the living bodies of the other eaters if they hadnt been rescued or had still refused the damage game arena the docks and kraiklyns dead body the hovercraft animals and fishes birds germs all of it everything flashburned or flashfrozen suddenly weightless spinning into space going dying the relentless line of fire completed its circuit of the orbital back almost to where it had started the orbital was now a rosette of white flat squares backing slowly away from each other towards the stars four hundred separate slabs of quickly freezing water silt land and base material angling out above or underneath the plane of the systems planets like flat square worlds themselves there was a moment of grace then as vavatch died in solitary blazing splendour then at its dark centre another blazing star patch rose bursting white as the hub was struck with the same terrible energy which had smashed the world itself like a target then vavatch blazed just as horza thought that the culture would be content with that the screen lit up once more everyone of those flat cards and the hub of the exploded orbital blazed once with an icy sparkling brilliance as though a million tiny white stars were shining through each shattered piece the light faded and those four hundred expanses of flat worlds with their centre hub were gone replaced by a grid of diced shapes each exploding away from the others as well as from the rest of the disintegrating orbital those pieces flashed too bursting slowly with a billion pinpricks of light which when they faded left debris almost too small to make out vavatch was now a swollen and spiralled disc of flashing glittering splinters expanding very slowly against the distant stars like a ring of bright dust the glinting sparkling centre made it look like some huge lidless and unblinking eye the screen flashed one final time no single points of light could be made out this time it was as though the whole now vague but bloated image of the shattered circular world glowed with some internal heat making a torusshaped cloud out of it a halo of white light with a fading iris at its centre then the show was over and only the sun lit up the slowly blooming nimbus of the annihilated world on other wavelengths there would probably be a lot still to see but the messroom screen was on normal light only the minds only the starships would see the whole destruction perfectly only they would be able to appreciate it for all that it had to offer of the entire range of the electromagnetic spectrum the unaided human eye could see little more than one per cent a single octave of radiation out of an immense long keyboard of tones the sensors on a starship would see everything right across that spectrum in far greater detail and at a much slower apparent speed the whole display that was the orbitals destruction was for all its humanly perceivable grandeur quite wasted on the animal eye a spectacle for the machines thought horza that was all it was a sideshow for the damn machines chicel dorolow said wubslin exhaled loudly and shook his head yalson turned and looked at horza aviger stayed with his head turned to the screen amazing what one can accomplish when one puts ones mind to it eh horza at first stupidly he thought that yalson had said it but of course it was balveda she brought her head up slowly her deep dark eyes were open she looked groggy and her body still sagged against the webbing of the seat straps the voice had been clear and steady though horza saw yalson reaching for the stun gun on the table she reached out and brought the gun closer to her but left it lying on the table she was looking suspiciously at the culture agent aviger and dorolow and wubslin were staring at her too are the batteries on that stun gun running down wubslin said yalson was still looking at balveda her eyes narrowed youre a little confused gravant or whoever you are yalson said thats kraiklyn balveda smiled at horza he left his face blank he didnt know what to do he was exhausted worn out it was too much of an effort let what was going to happen happen hed had enough of deciding well balveda said to him are you going to tell them or shall i he said nothing he watched balvedas face the woman drew a deep breath and said oh all right ill tell them she turned to yalson his name is bora horza gobuchul and hes impersonating kraiklyn horzas a changer from heibohre and he works for the idirans has done for the last six years hes changed to become kraiklyn i imagine your real leader is dead horza probably killed him or at least left him somewhere in or around evanauth im very sorry she looked around the others including the small drone but unless im much mistaken were all taking a little trip to a place called schars world well you are anyway i have a feeling my own journey might be a little shorter and infinitely longer balveda smiled ironically at horza two the drone on the table said to nobody in particular im stuck in a leaky museumpiece with two paranoid lunatics youre not yalson was saying ignoring the machine and gazing at horza youre not are you shes lying wubslin turned and looked at him aviger and dorolow exchanged glances horza sighed and took his feet off the table sitting a little straighter in his seat he leaned forward and put his elbows on the table his chin in his hands he was watching feeling trying to gauge the mood of the various people in the room he was aware of their distances the tension in their bodies and how much time he would need to get to the plasma pistol on his right hip he raised his head and looked at all of them settling his gaze on yalson yes he said i am silence filled the mess room horza waited for a reaction instead the sound of a door opening came from down the corridor through the accommodation section they all looked at the doorway neisin appeared wearing only a pair of grubby stained shorts his hair was sticking out in every direction his eyes were slits his skin was patchy with dry and moist areas and his face was very pale a smell of drink gradually worked its way through the mess he looked round the room yawned nodded at them pointed vaguely at some of the still uncleared debris lying around and said this place is nearly in as big a mess as my cabin youd think wed been manoeuvring or something sorry thought it was time to eat think ill go back to bed he yawned again and left the door closed balveda was laughing quietly horza could see some tears in her eyes the others just looked confused the drone said well mr observant there is probably the only person on this mobile asylum with an untroubled mind at the moment the machine turned on the table scratching the surface as it faced horza are you really claiming to be one of these fabled human impersonators it asked with a sneer in its voice horza looked down the table then into yalsons wary frowning eyes thats what i am theyre extinct aviger said shaking his head theyre not extinct balveda told him her thin finely moulded head turning briefly to the old man but theyre part of the idiran sphere now absorbed some of them always did support the idirans the rest either left or decided they might as well throw in their lot with them horzas one of the first lot cant stand the culture hes taking you all to schars world to kidnap a shipwrecked mind for his idiran masters a culture mind so that the galaxy will be free from human interference and the idirans can have a free run at all right balveda horza said she shrugged youre horza yalson said pointing at him he nodded she shook her head i dont believe it im starting to come round to the drones way of thinking youre both crazy you took a nasty blow to the head kraiklyn and you lady she looked at balveda have had your brains scrambled by this thing yalson picked up the stun gun and then put it down again i dont know wubslin said scratching his head and looking at horza as though he was some sort of exhibit i thought the captain seemed a bit strange i couldnt imagine him doing what he just did in the gsv what did you do horza balveda said i seem to have missed something how did you get away i flew out balveda used the fusion motors and the laser and blasted out really balveda laughed again throwing her head back she went on laughing but her laughter was a little too loud and the tears were coming too quickly to her eyes ho ho well i am impressed i thought we had you when did you find out he asked her quietly she sniffed and tried to wipe her nose on her shoulder what that you werent kraiklyn she played her tongue along her top lip oh just before you came aboard we had a microdrone pretending to be a fly it was programmed to land on anybody approaching the ship while it was in the smallbay and take a skin cell or hair or something away with it we identified you from your own chromosomes there was another agent outside he must have used his effector on the bay controls when he monitored you starting to get ready to leave i was supposed to do whatever i could if you appeared kill you capture you disable the ship anything but they didnt tell me until too late they knew somebody might overhear if they warned me but they must have started to get worried that was the noise you heard from her kitbag horza told yalson just before i zapped her he looked back at balveda i got rid of the gear by the way balveda dumped it all through the vactubes your bomb went off balveda seemed to sag a little further in her seat he guessed that she had been hoping her gear was on board at the very least she might have been hoping the bomb had still to be triggered and that while she would die she would not die in vain or alone oh yes she said looking down at the table the vactubes what about kraiklyn yalson asked hes dead horza said i killed him oh well yalson tutted and rapped her fingers on the table surface thats that i dont know if you two really are mad or if youre telling the truth both possibilities are pretty awful she looked from balveda to horza raising her eyebrows at the man and saying by the way if you really are horza its a lot less pleasant to see you back than i thought it was going to be im sorry he told her she turned her head away from him i still think the best thing to do is to head back for the ends of invention and lay the whole thing before the authorities the drone rose fractionally above the surface of the table and looked round at them all horza leant forward and tapped its casing it faced him machine he said were going to schars world if you want to go back to the gsv ill gladly put you in a vactube and let you make your own way back but you mention returning and getting a fair trial one more time and im going to blast your synthetic fucking brains out understand how dare you speak to me like that the drone bellowed ill have you know i am an accredited free construct certified sentient under the free will acts by the greater vavatch united moral standards administration and with full citizenship of the vavatch heterocracy i am near to paying off my incurred generation debt when ill be free to do exactly what i like and have already been accepted for a degree course in applied paratheology at the university of will you shut your goddamn speaker and listen horza shouted breaking into the machines breathless monologue were not on vavatch and i dont care how goddamn smart you are or how many qualifications youve got youre on this ship and you do as i say you want to get off get off now and float back to whatevers left of your precious fucking orbital stay and you obey orders or get junked those are my choices yes use some of your accredited free will and decide right now i the drone rose from the table then sank again hmm it said very well i shall stay and obey all orders and obey all orders good at within reason machine horza said reaching for the plasma pistol oh good grief man the drone exclaimed what do you want a robot its voice sneered i dont have an off button on my reasoning functions i cant choose not to have free will i could quite easily swear to obey all orders regardless of the consequences i could vow to sacrifice my life for you if you asked me to but id be lying so that i could live i swear to be as obedient and faithful as any of your human crew in fact as the most obedient and faithful of them for pitys sake man in the name of all reason what more can you ask sneaky bastard horza thought well he said i suppose that will just have to do now can but i am obliged to serve immediate notice on you that under the terms of my retrospective construction agreement my incurred generation debt loan agreement and my employment contract your forcible removal of myself from my place of work makes you liable for the servicing of said debt until my return as well as risking civil and criminal proceedings fucking hell drone yalson interrupted sure it wasnt law you were going to study i take full responsibility machine horza told it now shut well i hope youre properly insured the drone muttered up horza balveda said yes perosteck he turned to her with a sense of relief her eyes were glittering she licked her top lip again then looked back at the surface of the table her head down what about me well he said slowly it did cross my mind to blow you out a vactube he saw her tense yalson too she turned in her seat to face him clenching her fists and opening her mouth horza went on but you may be of some use yet and oh call it sentiment he smiled youll have to behave of course balveda looked up at him there was hope in her eyes but also the piteousness of those who dont want to hope too soon you mean that i hope she said quietly horza nodded i mean it i couldnt possibly get rid of you anyway before i find out how the hell you got off the hand of god balveda relaxed breathing deeply when she laughed it was softly yalson was looking with a jaundiced expression at horza and still rapping her fingers on the table yalson horza said id like you and dorolow to take balveda and strip her take her suit and everything else off he was aware of them all looking at him balveda was arching her eyebrows with faked shock he went on i want you to take the surgery equipment and run every sort of test you can on her once shes naked to make sure she hasnt got any skin pouches implants or prosthetics use the ultrasound and the xray gear and the nmr and anything else weve got once youve done that you can find something for her to wear put her suit in a vactube and dump it also any jewellery or other personal possessions of any sort or size regardless of how innocent they may look you want her washed and anointed put in a white robe and placed on a stone altar too yalson said acidly horza shook his head i want her clean of anything anything at all that could be used as a weapon or that could turn into one the cultures latest gadgetry for the special circumstancers includes things called memoryforms they might looked like a badge or a medallion he smiled at balveda who nodded back wryly or anything else but do a certain something to them touch them in the right place make them wet speak a certain word and they become a communicator a gun or a bomb i dont want to risk there being anything more dangerous than ms balveda herself on board what about when we get to schars world balveda said well give you some warm clothes if you wrap up well youll be all right no suit no weapons and the rest of us asked aviger what are we supposed to do when you get to this place assuming theyll let you in which i doubt im not sure yet horza said truthfully maybe youll have to come with me ill have to see what i can do about the ships fidelities possibly youll all be able to stay on board perhaps youll all have to hit dirt with me however there are some other changers there people like myself but not working for the idirans they should be able to look after you if im to be gone for any amount of time of course he said looking at yalson if any of you want to come along with me im sure that we can treat this as a normal operation in terms of shareouts and so forth once im finished with the cat those of you who so desire may want to take it over for yourselves run it any way you like sell it if you want its up to you at any rate youll all be free to do as you wish once ive accomplished my mission on schars world or done my best to at least yalson had been looking at him but now she turned away shaking her head wubslin was looking at the deck aviger and dorolow stared at each other the drone was silent now horza said rising stiffly yalson and dorolow if you wouldnt mind seeing to ms balveda with a show of some reluctance yalson sighed and got up dorolow started to undo some of the restraining straps around the culture agents body and do be very careful with her horza continued keep one person well away from her with the gun pointed in her direction the whole time while the other does the work yalson muttered something under her breath and leaned to pick up the stun gun from the table horza turned to aviger i think somebody should tell neisin about all the excitement hes missed dont you aviger hesitated then nodded yes kraik he stopped spluttered then said no more he got up from his seat and went quickly down the corridor towards the cabins i think ill open up the forward compartments and have a look at the laser kraiklyn if thats all right with you wubslin said oh i mean horza the engineer stood frowning and scratching his head horza nodded wubslin found a clean undamaged beaker and took a cold drink from the dispenser then went down the corridor through the accommodation section dorolow and yalson had freed balveda the tall paleskinned culture woman stretched closing her eyes and arching her neck she ran a hand through her short red hair dorolow watched warily yalson held the stun gun balveda flexed her shoulders then indicated she was ready right yalson said waving balveda forward with the gun well do this in my cabin horza stood up to let the three women by as balveda passed her long easy stride unencumbered by the light suit he said how did you get off the hand of god balveda she stopped and said i killed the guard and then sat and waited horza the gcu managed to take the cruiser intact eventually some nice soldier drones came and rescued me she shrugged unarmed you killed an idiran in full battle armour and toting a laser horza said sceptically balveda shrugged again horza i didnt say it was easy what about xoralundra horza asked through a grin your old idiran friend must have escaped a few of them did at any rate he wasnt among the dead or captured horza nodded and waved her by followed by yalson and dorolow perosteck balveda went down the corridor to yalsons cabin horza looked at the drone sitting on the table think you can make yourself useful machine i suppose as you obviously intend to keep us all here and take us to this unattractivesounding rockball on the edge of nowhere i might as well do what i can to make the journey as safe as possible ill help with the vessels maintenance if you like i would prefer though if you called me by my name and not just by that word you manage to make sound like an expletive machine i am called unahaclosp is it asking too much for you to address me as such why certainly not unahaclosp horza said trying to look and sound sufficiently bogus in his abjection i shall most assuredly ensure that i call you that in future it might the drone said rising from the table to the level of horzas eyes seem amusing to you but it matters to me i am not just a computer i am a drone i am conscious and i have an individual identity therefore i have a name i told you id use it horza said thank you i shall go and see if your engineer needs any help inspecting the laser housing it floated to the door horza watched it go he was alone he sat down and looked at the screen down at the far end of the mess the debris that had been vavatch glowed with a barren glare that vast cloud of matter was still visible but it was cooling dead and spinning away becoming less real more ghostly less substantial all the time he sat back and closed his eyes he would wait a while before going to sleep he wanted to give the others time to think about what they had found out they would be easier to read then he would know if he was safe for the moment or whether he would have to watch them all he also wanted to wait until yalson and dorolow had finished with balveda the culture agent might be biding her time now she thought she had longer to live but she might still try something he wanted to be awake in case she did he still hadnt decided whether to kill her now or not but at least he too now had time to think the clear air turbulence completed its last programmed course correction swinging its nose towards the glittercliff face not in the precise direction of the schars world star but onto the general bearing behind it still expanding still radiating still slowly dissolving in the system to which it had given its name the unnumbered twinkling fragments of the orbital called vavatch blew out towards the stars drifting on a stellar wind that rang and swirled with the fury of the worlds destruction horza sat alone in the mess room a little longer watching the remnants dissipate light against the darkness a fat torus of nothing just debris an entire world just wiped out not merely destroyed the very first cut of the grid energies would have been enough to do that but obliterated taken carefully precisely artistically apart annihilation made into an aesthetic experience the arrogant grace of it the absolutezero coldness of that sophisticated viciousness it impressed almost as much as it appalled even he would admit to a certain reluctant admiration the culture had not wasted its lesson to the idirans and the rest of the galactic community it had turned even that ghastly waste of effort and skill into a thing of beauty but it was a message it would regret horza thought as the hyperlight sped and the ordinary light crawled through the galaxy this was what the culture offered this was its signal its advertisement its legacy chaos from order destruction from construction death from life vavatch would be more than its own monument it would commemorate too the final grisly manifestation of the cultures lethal idealism the overdue acknowledgement that not only was it no better than any other society it was much much worse they sought to take the unfairness out of existence to remove the mistakes in the transmitted message of life which gave it any point or advancement a memory of darkness swept through him and he shivered but theirs was the ultimate mistake the final error and it would be their undoing horza considered going to the bridge to switch the view on the screen to real space and so see the orbital intact again as it had been a few weeks before when the real light the cat was now travelling through had left the place but he shook his head slowly though there was nobody there to see and watched the quiet screen at the far end of the disordered and deserted room instead state of play two the yacht dropped anchor within a wooded bay the water was clear and ten metres beneath the sparkling waves the sandy floor of the anchorage was visible tall everblues were spread in a rough crescent around the small inlet their dustylooking roots sometimes visible on the ochre sandstone they clung to there were some small cliffs of the same rock sprinkled with bright flowers and overlooking golden beaches the white yacht its long reflection flickering on the water like a silent flame feathered its tall sails and swung slowly into the faint breeze coming through one arm of the woods and over the cupped bay people took small canoes or dinghies to the shore or jumped into the warm water and swam some of the ceerevells which had escorted the yacht on its voyage from its home port stayed to play in the bay their long red bodies slipped through the water under and around the vessels hull and their snorting breath echoed from the low cliffs facing the water sometimes they nudged the boats heading for the shore and a few of the swimmers played with the sleek animals diving to swim with them touch them hold onto them the shouts of the people in the boats drew gradually further away they beached the small craft and disappeared into the woods going to explore the uninhabited island the small waves of the inland sea lapped at the disturbed sand fal ngeestra sighed and after walking once around the yacht sat down near the stem on a padded seat she played absently with one of the ropes tied between the stanchions rubbing it with her hand the boy who had been talking to her during the morning when the yacht was sailing slowly out from the mainland towards the islands saw her sitting there and came to talk to her arent you going to look at the island he said he was very thin and light looking his skin was a deep almost golden yellow there was a sheen about it which made fal think of a hologram because it looked somehow deeper than his skinny arms and legs were thick i dont feel like it pal said she hadnt wanted the boy to talk to her earlier and she didnt want to talk to him now she was sorry shed agreed to come on the cruise why not the boy said she couldnt remember his name she hadnt been paying attention when he started talking to her and she wasnt even sure he had told her his name though she assumed he had i just dont she shrugged she wasnt looking at him oh he said he was silent for a while she was aware of the sunlight reflecting from his body but she still didnt turn to look at him she watched the distant trees the waves the ruddy bodies of the ceerevells humpbacking on the surface of the water as they rose to vent and then dive again the boy said i know how you feel do you she said and turned to look at him he looked a little surprised he nodded youre fed up arent you maybe she said looking away again a little bit why does that old drone follow you about everywhere she darted a glance at the boy jase was below decks just then getting a drink for her it had come aboard at the port with her and had stayed not too far away all the time the hovering protective way it usually did she shrugged again and watched a flock of birds rise from the interior of the island they called and dipped and wheeled in the air it looks after me she said she stared at her hands watching the sunlight reflect from her nails do you need looking after no then why does it look after you i dont know youre very mysterious you know he said she wasnt looking but she thought she heard a smile in his voice she shrugged soundlessly youre like that island he said youre strange and mysterious like it is fal snorted and tried to look scathing then she saw jase appearing from a doorway carrying a glass she got up quickly followed by the boy walked down the deck and met the old drone taking the glass from it and smiling at it gratefully she buried her face in the container and sipped at the drink looking out through the glass at the boy well hello young man jase said arent you going to have a look at the island fal wanted to kick the machine because of its hearty voice and the way it had said almost what the boy had said to her i might the boy said looking at her you should jase said starting to float towards the stern the old machine extended a curved field like a shadow without something to cast it out from its casing and round the boys shoulders by the way i couldnt help overhearing you when you were talking earlier it said gently guiding the boy down the deck his golden head turned over his shoulder to look at fal who was still drinking her drink very slowly and just starting to follow jase and the boy a couple of paces behind the boy looked away from her and towards the drone at his side which was saying you were talking about not getting into contact thats right the boys voice was suddenly defensive i was talking about that so fal continued to walk behind the drone and the boy she smacked her lips ice in the glass clinked you sounded bitter jase said im not bitter the boy said quickly i just think it isnt fair thats all that you werent picked jase asked they were approaching the seats round the stern where fal had sat a few minutes earlier well yes its all ive ever wanted and i think they made a mistake i know id be good i thought with the war and all that they would need more people well yes but contact has far more applicants than it can use but i thought one of the things that they considered was how much you wanted to get in and i know nobody could have wanted to get in as much as i do ever since i can remember ive wanted the boys voice trailed off as they came to the seats fal sat down so did the boy fal was looking at him now but not listening she was thinking perhaps they dont think youre mature enough yet i am mature hmm they very rarely take people so young you know for all i know theyre looking for a special sort of immaturity when they do take people your age well thats silly i mean how do you know what to do if they dont tell you what they want how can you prepare i think its all really unfair in a way i think its meant to be jase replied they get so many people applying they cant take them all or even just take the best because there are so many of them so they choose at random from them you can always reapply i dont know the boy said sitting forward and putting his elbows on his knees and his head into his hands staring at the polished wood of the deck sometimes i think they just tell you that so you wont feel bad when they reject you i think they do maybe take the very best but i think theyve made a mistake but because they wont tell you why youve failed what can you do about it she was thinking about failure too jase had congratulated her on her idea about finding the changer only that morning when they were on the ancient steam funicular down from the lodge they had heard about the events at vavatch when the changer called bora horza gobuchul had appeared and escaped on the pirate ship taking their agent perosteck balveda with him her hunch had been right and jase was effusive in its praise making the point that it wasnt her fault the man had got away but she was depressed sometimes being right thinking the correct thing predicting accurately depressed her it had all seemed so obvious to her it hadnt been a supernatural omen or anything silly like that when perosteck balveda suddenly turned up on the battledamaged but victorious gcu nervous energy which was towing most of a captured idiran cruiser but it had seemed so so natural that balveda ought to be the one to go in search of the missing changer by that time theyd had more information about what had been going on in that volume of space when that particular duel had been going on and the reported possible and probable movements of various ships had pointed again she thought fairly obviously to the privateer craft called the clear air turbulence there were other possibilities and they were followed up too as far as the already stretched resources of contacts special circumstances section would allow but she was always certain that if any of the branching possibilities was going to bear fruit it would be the vavatch connection the captain of the clear air turbulence was called kraiklyn he played damage vavatch was the most obvious site for a full damage game in years therefore the most likely place to intercept the vessel apart from schars world if the changer already had control was vavatch she had stuck her neck out by insisting that vavatch was the most likely place and that the woman agent balveda should be one of those to go there and now it had all come true and she realised it wasnt really her neck she had stuck out at all it was balvedas but what else could be done the war was accelerating throughout an immense volume there were many other urgent missions for the few special circumstances agents and anyway balveda was the only really good one within range there was one young man theyd sent in with her but he was only promising not experienced fal had known all along that if it came to it balveda would risk her own life not the mans if infiltrating the mercenaries was the only chance of getting to the changer and through him to the mind it was brave but fal suspected it was mistaken the changer knew balveda he might well recognise her no matter how much shed altered her own appearance and there hadnt been time for balveda to undergo radical physical change if the changer realised who she was and fal suspected he had balveda had far less chance of completing her mission than even the most callow and nervous but unsuspected rookie agent forgive me lady fal thought to herself id have done better by you if i could she had tried to hate the changer all that day tried to imagine him and hate him because he had probably killed balveda but apart from the fact that she found it hard to imagine somebody when she had no idea what he might look like the ships captain kraiklyn for some reason the hatred would not materialise the changer did not seem real she liked the sound of balveda she was brave and daring and fal hoped against hope that balveda would live that somehow she would survive it all and that one day maybe they would meet perhaps after the war but that didnt seem real either she couldnt believe in it she couldnt imagine it the way she had imagined say balveda finding the changer she had seen that in her mind and had willed it to happen in her version of course it was balveda who won not the changer but she couldnt imagine meeting balveda and somehow that was frightening as though she had started to believe in her own prescience so much that the inability to imagine something clearly enough meant that it would never happen either way it was depressing what chance had the agent of living through the war not a good one at the moment fal knew that but even supposing balveda did somehow save herself this time what were the chances shed wind up dead anyway later on the longer the war went on the more likely it was fal felt and the general concensus of opinion among the more cluedup minds was that the war would last decades rather than years plus or minus a few months of course fal frowned and bit her lip she couldnt see them getting the mind the changer was winning and she had all but run out of ideas all she had thought of recently was a way perhaps just maybe of putting gobuchul off probably not a way of stopping him completely but possibly a way of making his job harder but she wasnt optimistic even if contacts war command agreed to such a dangerous equivocal and potentially expensive plan fal jase said she realised she was looking at the island without seeing it the glass was growing warm in her hand and jase and the boy were both looking at her what she said and drank i was asking what you thought about the war the boy said he was frowning looking at her with narrowed eyes the sunlight sharp on his face she looked at his broad open face and wondered how old he was older than her younger did he feel like she did wanting to be older yearning to be treated as responsible i dont understand what do you mean think about it in what way well the boy said whos going to win he looked annoyed she suspected it had been very obvious that she hadnt been listening she looked at jase but the old machine didnt say anything and with no aura field there was no way of telling what it was thinking or how it was feeling was it amused worried she drank gulping down the last of the cool drink we are of course she said quickly glancing from the boy to jase the boy shook his head im not so sure he said rubbing his chin im not sure we have the will the will fal said yes the desire to fight i think the idirans are natural fighters we arent i mean look at us he smiled as though he was much older and thought himself much wiser than she and he turned his head and waved his hand lazily towards the island where the boats lay tilted against the sand fifty or sixty metres away fal saw what looked like a man and woman coupling in the shallows under a small cliff they were bobbing up and down the womans dark hands clasped round the mans lighter neck was that what the boy was being so urbane about good grief the fascination of sex no doubt it was great fun but then how could people take it so seriously sometimes she felt a sneaking envy for the idirans they got over it after a while it no longer mattered they were dual hermaphrodites each half of the couple impregnating the other and each usually bearing twins after one or occasionally two pregnancies and weanings they changed from their fertile breeder stage to become warriors opinion was divided on whether they increased in intelligence or just underwent a personality alteration certainly they became more cunning but less openminded more logical but less imaginative more ruthless less compassionate they grew by another metre their weight almost doubled their keratinous covering became thicker and harder their muscles increased in bulk and density and their internal organs altered to accommodate these powerincreasing changes at the same time their bodies absorbed their reproductive organs and they became sexless all very linear symmetrical and tidy compared to the cultures pickyourown approach yes she could see why this gangly idiot sitting in front of her with his nervously superior smile would find the idirans impressive young fool this is fal was annoyed enough to be a little stuck for words this is just us now we havent evolved weve changed a lot changed ourselves a lot but we havent evolved at all since we were running around killing ourselves i mean each other she sucked her breath in annoyed with herself now the boy was smiling tolerantly at her she felt herself blushing we are still animals she insisted were natural fighters just as much as the idirans then how come theyre winning the boy smirked they had a head start we didnt begin properly preparing for war until the last moment warfare has become a way of life for them were not all that good at it yet because its been hundreds of generations since we had to do it dont worry she told him looking down at her empty glass and lowering her voice slightly were learning quite fast enough well you wait and see the boy said nodding at her i think well pull out of the war and let the idirans get on with their expansion or whatever you want to call it the wars been sort of exciting and its made a change but its been nearly four years now and he waved one hand again we havent even won anything much yet he laughed all we keep doing is running away fal stood up quickly turning away in case she started to cry oh shit the boy was saying to jase i suppose ive gone and said something now did she have a friend or a relation she walked down the deck limping a little as the newly healed leg started to hurt again with a distant nagging ache dont worry jase was saying to the boy leave her alone and shell be all right she put her glass inside one of the dark empty cabins of the yacht then kept going heading for the forward superstructure she climbed up a ladder to the wheelhouse then up another ladder to its roof and sat there with her legs crossed the recently broken leg hurt but she ignored it and looked out to sea far away almost on the hazelimit a ridge of whiteness shimmered in the nearstill air fal ngeestra let out a long sad breath and wondered if the white shapes probably only visible because they were high up in clearer air were snowy mountain tops maybe they were just clouds she couldnt remember the geography of the place well enough to work it out she sat there thinking of those peaks she remembered when once high in the foothills where a small mountain stream levelled out onto a marshy plateau for a kilometre or so arcing and swerving and bowing over the sodden reedcovered land like an athlete stretching and flexing between games she had found something which had made that winter days walk memorable ice had been forming in clear brittle sheets at the side of the flowing stream she had spent some time happily marching through the shallows of the water crunching the thin ice with her boots and watching it drift downstream she wasnt climbing that day just walking she had waterproofs on and carried little gear somehow the fact she wasnt doing anything dangerous or physically demanding had made her feel like a young child again she came to a place where the stream flowed over a terrace of rock from one level of moor down to another and there a small pool had carved itself into the rock just beneath the rapids the water fell less than a metre and the stream was narrow enough to jump but she remembered that stream and that pool because there in the circling water caught beneath the splashing rapids floated a frozen circle of foam the water was naturally soft and peaty and a yellowwhite foam sometimes formed in the mountain streams of that area blown by the winds and caught in the reeds but she had never seen it collected into a circle like that and frozen she laughed when she saw it she waded in and carefully picked it up it was only a little greater in diameter than the distance between her outstretched thumb and little finger and a few centimetres thick not as fragile as she had at first feared the frothy bubbles had frozen in the cold air and almost freezing water making what looked like a tiny model of a galaxy a fairly common spiral galaxy like this one like hers she held the light confection of air and water and suspended chemicals and turned it over in her hands sniffing it sticking her tongue out and licking it looking at the dim winter sun through it flicking her finger to see if it would ring she watched her little rime galaxy start to melt very slowly and saw her own breath blow across it a brief image of her warmth in the air finally she put it back where she had found it slowly revolving in the pool of water at the base of the small rapids the galaxy image had occurred to her then and she thought at the time about the similarity of the forces which shaped both the little and the vast she had thought and which is really the most important but then felt embarrassed to have thought such a thing every now and again though she went back to that thought and knew that each was exactly as important as the other then later she would go back to her second thoughts on the matter and feel embarrassed again fal ngeestra took a deep breath and felt a little better she smiled and raised her head closing her eyes for a moment and watching the red sunhaze behind her eyelids then she ran a hand through her curly blonde hair and wondered again if the distant wavering unsure shapes over the shimmering water were clouds or mountains schars world imagine a vast and glittering ocean seen from a great height it stretches to the clear curved limit of every angle of horizon the sun burning on a billion tiny wavelets now imagine a smooth blanket of cloud above the ocean a shell of black velvet suspended high above the water and also extending to the horizon but keep the sparkle of the sea despite the lack of sun add to the cloud many sharp and tiny lights scattered on the base of the inky overcast like glinting eyes singly in pairs or in larger groups each positioned far far away from any other set that is the view a ship has in hyperspace as it flies like a microscopic insect free between the energy grid and real space the small sharp lights on the undersurface of the cloud cover are stars the waves on the sea are the irregularities of the grid on which a ship travelling in hyperspace finds traction with its engine fields while that sparkle is its source of energy the grid and the plain of real space are curved rather like the ocean and the cloud would be round a planet but less so black holes show as thin and twisting waterspouts from clouds to sea supernovae as long lightning flashes in the overcast rocks moons planets orbitals even rings and spheres hardly show at all the two killer class rapid offensive units trade surplus and revisionist raced through the hyperspace flashing underneath the web of real space like slim and glittering fish in a deep still pond they wove past systems and stars keeping deep beneath the empty spaces where they were least likely to be traced their engines were each a focus of energy almost beyond imagining packing sufficient power within their two hundred metres to equal perhaps one per cent of the energy produced by a small sun flinging the two vessels across the fourdimensional void at an equivalent speed in real space of rather less than ten lightyears per hour at the time this was considered particularly fast they sensed the glittercliff and sullen gulf ahead they twisted their headlong rush to angle them deep inside the war zone aiming themselves at the system which contained schars world far in the distance they could see the group of black holes which had created the gulf those flutes of plunging energy had passed through the area millennia before clearing a space of consumed stars behind them creating an artificial galactic arm as they headed in a long spiral closer towards the centre of the slowly spinning island of stars and nebulae that was the galaxy the group of black holes was commonly known as the forest so closely were they grouped and the two speeding culture craft had instructions to try to force their way between those twisted lethal trunks if they were seen and pursued the cultures field management was considered superior to the idirans so it was thought they would have a better chance of getting through and any chasing craft might even break off rather than risk tangling with the forest it was a terrible risk even to contemplate but the two rous were precious the culture had not yet built many and everything possible had to be done to make sure that the craft got back safely or if the worst came to the worst were destroyed utterly they encountered no hostile ships they flashed across the inward face of the quiet barrier in seconds and delivered their prescribed loads in two short bursts then twisted once and tore away at maximum speed out through the thinning stars and past the glittercliff into the empty skies of the sullen gulf they registered hostile craft stationed near the schars world system starting off in pursuit but they had been seen too late and they quickly outdistanced the probing beams of track lasers they set course for the far side of the gulf their strange mission completed the minds on board and the small crew of humans each vessel carried who were there more because they wanted to be than for their utility hadnt been told why they were blasting empty space with expensive warheads shooting off crewss at each others target drones dumping clouds of cam and ordinary gas and releasing odd little unpowered signalling ships which were little more than unmanned shuttles packed with broadcasting equipment the entire effect of this operation would be to produce a few spectacular flashes and flares and a scattering of radiation shells and wideband signals before the idirans cleared up the debris and blasted or captured the signal craft they had been asked to risk their lives on some damnfool panic mission which seemed designed to convince nobody in particular that there had been a space battle in the middle of nowhere when there hadnt and they had done it what was the culture coming to the idirans seemed to relish suicide missions you could easily form the impression that they considered being asked to carry out any other sort something of an insult but the culture where even in the war forces discipline was regarded as a taboo word where people always wanted to know why this and why that things had come to a pretty pass indeed the two ships raced across the gulf arguing on board heated discussions were taking place between members of their crews it took twentyone days for the clear air turbulence to make the journey from vavatch to schars world wubslin had spent the time carrying out what repairs he could to the craft but what the ship needed was another thorough overhaul while structurally it was still sound and life support functioned nearly normally it had suffered a general degradation of its systems though no catastrophic failures the warp units ran a little more raggedly than before the fusion motors were not up to sustained use in an atmosphere they would get them down to and up from schars world but not provide much more inairflying time and the vessels sensors had been reduced in numbers and efficiency to a level not far above operational minimum they had still escaped lightly horza thought with the cat under his control horza was able to switch off the computers identity circuits he didnt have to fool the free company either so as the days passed he changed slowly to resemble his old self a little more that was for yalson and the other members of the free company he was really striking two thirds of a compromise between kraiklyn and the self he had been on the cat before it had reached vavatch there was another third in there which he let grow and show itself on his face for nobody on board but for a redhaired changer girl called kierachell he hoped she would recognise that part of his appearance when they met again on schars world why did you think wed be angry yalson asked him in the cats hangar one day they had set up a target screen at one end and put their lasers onto practice the screens builtin projector flashed images for them to shoot at horza looked at the woman he was your leader yalson laughed he was a manager how many of them are liked by their staff this is a business horza and not even a successful one kraiklyn managed to get most of us retired prematurely shit the only person you needed to fool was the ship there was that horza said aiming at a human figure darting across the distant screen the laser spot was invisible but the screen sensed it and flashed white light where it hit the human figure hit in the leg stumbled but did not fall half marks i did need to fool the ship but i didnt want to risk somebody being loyal to kraiklyn it was yalsons turn but she was looking at horza not the screen the ships fidelities had been bypassed and now all that was needed to command it was a numeric code which only horza knew and the small ring he wore which had been kraiklyns he had promised that when they got to schars world if there was no other way off the planet he would set the cats computer to free itself of all fidelity limitations after a given time so that if he didnt come back out of the tunnels of the command system the free company would not be stranded you would have told us yalson said wouldnt you horza i mean you would have let us know eventually horza knew she meant would he have told her he put his gun down and looked her in the eyes once i was sure he said sure about the people sure about the ship it was the honest answer but he wasnt certain it was the best one he wanted yalson wanted not just her warmth in the ships red night but her trust her care but she was still distant balveda lived perhaps she wouldnt still be alive if horza hadnt wanted yalsons regard he knew that and it was a bitter thought making him feel cheap and cruel even knowing that it was a definite thing would have been better than being uncertain he couldnt say for sure whether the cold logic of this game dictated that the culture woman should die or be left alive or even if the former being comfortably obvious he could have killed her in cold blood he had thought it through and still he didnt know he only hoped that neither woman had guessed that any of this had gone through his mind kierachell was another worry it was absurd he knew to be concerned about his own affairs at such a time but he couldnt stop thinking about the changer woman the closer they came to schars world the more he remembered of her the more real his memories became he tried not to build it up too much tried to recall the boredom of the changers lonely outpost on the planet and the restlessness he had felt there even with kierachells company but he dreamt about her slow smile and recalled her low voice in all its fluid grace with some of the heartache of a youths first love occasionally he thought yalson might sense that too and something inside him seemed to shrink with shame yalson shrugged hoisted her gun to her shoulder and fired at a fourlegged shadow on the practice screen it stopped in its tracks and dropped seeming to dissolve into the line of shady ground at the bottom of the screen horza gave talks it made him feel like some visiting lecturer at a college but thats what he did he felt he had to explain to the others why he was doing what he was why the changers supported the idirans why he believed in what they were fighting for he called them briefings and ostensibly they were about schars world and the command system its history geography and so on but he always quite intentionally ended up talking about the war in general or about totally different aspects of it unrelated to the planet they were approaching the briefing cover gave him a good excuse to keep balveda confined to her cabin while he paced up and down on the deck of the mess talking to the members of the free company he didnt want his talks turning into a debate perosteck balveda had been no trouble her suit and a few items of harmlesslooking jewellery and other bits and pieces had been jettisoned from a vactube she had been scanned with every item the cats limited sickbay equipment could provide and had come up clean and she seemed quite happy to be a wellbehaved prisoner confined to the ship as they all were and apart from at night locked in her cabin only occasionally horza didnt let her near the bridge just in case but balveda showed no signs of trying to get to know the ship especially well the way he had done when he came on board she didnt even try to argue any of the mercenaries round to her way of thinking about the war and the culture horza wondered how secure she felt balveda was pleasant and seemed unworried but he looked at her sometimes and thought he saw briefly a glimpse of inner tension even despair it relieved him in one way but in another it gave him that same bad cruel feeling he experienced when he thought about exactly why the culture agent was still alive sometimes he was simply afraid of getting to schars world but increasingly as the voyage dragged on he came to relish the prospect of some action and an end to thought he called balveda to his cabin one day after they had all eaten in the mess the woman came in and sat down on the same small seat he had sat in when kraiklyn had summoned him just after he had joined the ship balvedas face was calm she sat elegantly in the small seat her long frame at once relaxed and poised her deep dark eyes gazed out at horza from the thin smoothly shaped head and her red hair now turning black shone in the lights of the cabin captain horza she smiled crossing her longfingered hands on her lap she wore a long blue gown the plainest thing she had been able to find on the ship something that had once belonged to the woman gow hello balveda horza said he sat back on the bed he wore a loose gown for the first couple of days he had stayed in his suit but while it stayed commendably comfortable it was bulky and awkward in the confines of the clear air turbulence so he had discarded it for the voyage he was about to offer balveda something to drink but somehow because that was what kraiklyn had done with him it didnt seem the right thing to do what was it horza balveda said i just wanted to see how you were he said he had tried to rehearse what he would say assure her she was in no danger that he liked her and that he was sure that this time the worst that would happen to her really would be internment somewhere and maybe a swap but the words would not come im fine she said smoothing her hand over her hair her eyes glancing around the cabin briefly im trying to be a model captive so you wont have an excuse for ditching me she smiled but again he thought he sensed an edge to the gesture yet he was relieved no he laughed letting his head rock back on his shoulders with the laugh ive no intention of doing that youre safe until we get to schars world she said calmly after that too he said balveda blinked slowly looking down hmm good she looked into his eyes he shrugged im sure youd do the same for me i think i probably would she said and he couldnt tell whether she was lying or not i just think its a pity were on different sides its a pity were all on different sides balveda well she said clasping her hands on her lap again there is a theory that the side we each think were on is the one that will triumph eventually anyway whats that he grinned truth and justice not either really she smiled not looking at him just she shrugged just life the evolution you talked about you said the culture was in a backwater a dead end if we are maybe well lose after all damn ill get you on the good guys side yet perosteck he said with just a little too much heartiness she smiled thinly she opened her mouth to say something then thought the better of it and closed it again she looked at her hands horza wondered what to say next one night six days out from their destination the systems star was fairly bright in the sky ahead of the ship even on normal sight yalson came to his cabin he hadnt expected it and the tap at the door brought him from a state between waking and sleep with a jarring coldness which left him disorientated for a few moments he saw her on the doorscreen and let her in she came in quickly closing the door after her and hugging him holding him tight soundless he stood there trying to wake up and work out how this had happened there seemed to be no reason for it no buildup of tension of any sort between them no signs no hints nothing yalson had spent that day in the hangar wired up with small sensors and exercising he had seen her there working away sweating exhausting herself peering at readouts and screens with her critical eyes as though her body was a machine like the ship and she was testing it almost to destruction they slept together but as though to confirm the exertions she had put herself through during the day yalson fell asleep almost as soon as they lay down in his arms while he was kissing and nuzzling her breathing in the scent of her body again after what seemed like months he lay awake and listened to her breathe felt her move very slightly in his arms and sensed her blood beat slower and slower as she fell into a deep sleep in the morning they made love and afterwards he asked her while he held her and their sweat dried why as their hearts slowed what changed your mind the ship hummed distantly around them she gripped him hugging tighter still and shook her head nothing she said nothing in particular nothing important he felt her shrug and she turned her head away from his face into his arm towards the humming bulkhead in a small voice she said everything schars world three days out in the hangar he watched the members of the free company work out and practise firing their guns at the screen neisin couldnt practise because he still refused to use lasers after what had happened in the temple of light he had stocked up on magazines of micro projectiles during his few sober moments in evanauth after firing practice horza had each of the mercenaries test their ag harnesses kraiklyn had purchased a cheap batch of them and insisted that the free company members who didnt already have an antigravity unit in their suit buy a harness from him at what he claimed was cost price horza had been dubious at first but the ag units seemed serviceable enough and certainly might be useful for searching the command systems deeper shafts horza was satisfied that the mercenaries would follow him in if they had to down into the command system the long delay since the excitement of vavatch and the boring routine of the life on the clear air turbulence had made them hanker after something more interesting as horza had honestly described it schars world didnt sound too bad at least it was unlikely they would find themselves in a firefight and nobody including the mind they might end up helping horza search for was going to start blowing things up not with a draazon to reckon with the sun of the schars world system shone brightly ahead of them now the brightest thing in the sky the glittercliff was not a visible feature of the sky ahead because they were still inside the spiral limb and looking out but it was noticeable that all the stars ahead were either quite close or very far away with none in the gap between horza had changed the cats course several times but kept it on a general heading which unless they turned wouldnt take it closer than two lightyears from the planet he would turn the craft and head in the following day so far the journey had been uneventful they had flown through the scattered stars without encountering anything out of the ordinary no messages or signals no distant flashes from battles no warp wakes the area around them seemed calm and undisturbed as though all that was happening was what always happened just the stars being born and dying the galaxy revolving the holes twisting the gases swirling the war in that hurried silence in their false rhythm of day and night seemed like something they had all imagined an inexplicable nightmare they had somehow shared even escaped horza had the ship watching though ready to alarm at the first hint of trouble they were unlikely to find out anything before they got to the quiet barrier but if everything was as peaceful and serene as that name implied he thought he might not go arrowing straight in ideally he would like to rendezvous with the idiran fleet units which were supposed to be waiting near by that would solve most of his problems he would hand balveda over make sure yalson and the rest of the mercenaries were safe let them have the cat and pick up the specialised equipment xoralundra had promised him that scenario would also let him meet kierachell alone without the distraction of the others being there he would be able to be his old self without making any concessions to the self the free company and yalson knew two days out the ships alarm went off horza was dozing in his bed he raced out of the cabin and forward to the bridge in the volume of space before them all hell seemed to have been let loose annihilation light washed over them it was the radiation from weapon explosions registering pure and mixed on the vessels sensors indicating where warheads had gone off totally by themselves or in contact with something else the fabric of threedimensional space bucked and juddered with the blast from warp charges forcing the cats automatics to disengage its engines every few seconds to prevent them being damaged on the shock waves horza strapped in and brought all the subsidiary systems up wubslin came through the door from the mess what is it battle of some sort horza said watching the screens the volume of affected space was more or less directly on the inward side of schars world the direct route from vavatch passed that way the cat was one and a half lightyears away from the disturbance too far away to be spotted on anything except the narrow beam of a track scanner and therefore almost certainly safe but horza watched the distant blasts of radiation and felt the cat ride the ripples of disturbed space with a sensation of nausea even defeat message shell wubslin said nodding at a screen there sorting itself out from the noise of radiation a signal gradually appeared the words forming a few letters at a time like a field of plants growing and flowering after a few repetitions of the signal and it was being jammed not simple interfered with by the battles background noise it was complete enough to read vessel clear air turbulence meet units ninety third fleet destinations mid all safe damn breathed horza whats that mean wubslin said he punched the figures on the screen into the cats navigational computer oh the engineer said sitting back its one of the stars near by i guess they mean to rendezvous halfway between it and he looked at the main screen yes horza said looking unhappily at the signal it had to be a fake there was nothing to prove it was from the idirans no message number code class ship originator signatory nothing genuine at all that from the guys with three legs wubslin said he brought a holo display onto another screen showing stars surrounded by spherical grids of thin green lines hey were not all that far away from there is that right horza said he watched the continuing blasts of battlelight he entered some figures into the cats control systems the vessel brought its nose round angling it further over towards the schars world system wubslin looked at horza you dont think it is from them i dont horza said the radiation was fading the engagement appeared to be over or the action broken off i think we might turn up there and find a gcu waiting for us or a cloud of cam cam what that stuff they dusted vavatch with wubslin said and whistled no thanks horza switched the screen with the message off less than an hour later it all happened again shells of radiation warp disturbance and this time two messages one telling the cat to ignore the first message the other giving a new rendezvous point both seemed genuine both were affixed with the word xoralundra horza still chewing the mouthful of food hed been eating when the alarm went off for the second time swore a third message appeared telling him personally to ignore those two signals and directing the cat to yet another rendezvous area horza shouted with anger sending bits of soggy food arcing out to hit the message screen he turned the wideband communicator off completely then went back to the mess when do we reach the quiet barrier a few more hours half a day perhaps are you nervous im not nervous ive been there before how about you if you say itll be all right i believe you it should be will you know any of the people there i dont know its been a few years they dont rotate personnel often but people do leave i dont know ill just have to wait and see you havent seen any of your own people for a long time have you no not since i left there arent you looking forward to it maybe horza look i know i told you we didnt ask each other about about everything before we came aboard the cat but that was before a lot of things changed but its the way weve been isnt it you mean you dont want to talk about it now maybe i dont know you want to ask me about no she put her hand to his lips he felt them there in the darkness no its ok its all right never mind he sat in the centre seat wubslin was in the engineers chair to horzas right yalson to his left the rest had crowded in behind them he had let balveda watch there was little that could happen which she could affect now the drone floated near the ceiling the quiet barrier was coming up it showed as a mirrorfield directly in front of them about a lightday in diameter it had suddenly appeared on the screen when they were an hour out from the barrier wubslin had worried it was giving their position away but horza knew that the mirrorfield existed only in the cats sensors there was nothing there for anybody else to see five minutes out every screen went black horza had warned the rest about it but even he felt anxious and blind when it happened youre sure this is meant to happen aviger said id be worried if it didnt horza told him the old man moved somewhere behind him i think this is incredible dorolow said this creature is virtually a god im sure it can sense our moods and thoughts i can feel it already actually its just a collection of selfreferencing balveda horza said looking round at the culture woman she stopped talking and clapped a hand over her mouth flashing her eyes he turned back to the blank screen whens this thing yalson began approaching craft the screen said in a variety of languages here we go neisin said he was shushed by dorolow i respond horza said in marain into the tightbeam communicator the other languages disappeared from the screen you are approaching the planet called schars world draazon planet of the dead progress beyond this point is restricted i know my name is bora horza gobuchul i wish to return to schars world for a short while i ask this with all respect smooth talker balveda said horza glared briefly at her the communicator would only transmit what he said but he didnt want the woman to forget she was a prisoner you have been here before horza couldnt tell if this was a question or not i have been to schars world before he confirmed i was one of the changer sentinels there seemed little point in telling the creature when the draazon called every time now even though their language used tenses the screen went blank then repeated you have been here before horza frowned and wondered what to say balveda muttered obviously hopelessly senile i have been here before horza said did the draazon mean that because he had already been there he could not return i can feel it i can feel its presence dorolow whispered there are other humans with you thanks a lot said the drone unahaclosp from somewhere near the ceiling you see dorolow said her voice almost whimpering horza heard balveda snort dorolow staggered slightly aviger and neisin had to hold onto her to stop her from falling i have not been able to set them down elsewhere horza said i ask your indulgence if need be they will stay on board this vessel they are not sentinels they are other humanoid species i alone need alight on schars world entry is restricted horza sighed i alone request permission to land why have you come here horza hesitated he heard balveda snort quietly he said i seek one who is here what do the others seek they seek nothing they are with me they are here they horza licked his lips all his rehearsing all his thoughts about what to say at this moment seemed to be useless they are not all here by choice but i had no alternative i had to bring them if you wish they will stay on board this craft in orbit around schars world or further away inside the quiet barrier i have a suit i can they are here against their will horza hadnt known draazon to interrupt before he couldnt imagine it was a good sign the circumstances are complicated certain species in the galaxy are at war choices become limited one does things one would not normally do there is death here horza looked at the words written on the screen he felt transfixed by them there was silence on the bridge for a moment then he heard a couple of people moving awkwardly what does that mean the drone unahaclosp said there there is horza said the words stayed on the screen written in marain wubslin tapped at a few buttons on his side of the console buttons which would normally control the display on the screens in front of him all of which now repeated the words on the main screen the engineer was sitting in his seat looking cramped and tense horza cleared his throat then said there was a battle a conflict near by just before we got here it might still be going on there may be death there is death here oh dorolow said and slumped into neisin and avigers arms wed better get her to the mess aviger said looking at neisin let her lie down oh all right neisin said glancing quickly at the womans face dorolow appeared to be unconscious i may be able to horza began then gave a deep breath if there is death here i may be able to stop it i may be able to prevent more death bora horza gobuchul yes horza said gulping aviger and neisin manhandled dorolows limp body out through the doorway into the corridor leading into the mess the screen changed you are looking for the refugee machine hoho said balveda turning away with a smile on her face and putting one hand to her mouth shit said yalson looks like our god isnt so stupid unahaclosp observed yes horza said sharply there seemed little point in trying to pretend now yes i am but i think you may enter what the drone said well yahoo yalson said crossing her arms and leaning back against the bulkhead neisin came back through the door he stopped when he saw the screen that was quick he said to yalson what did he say yalson just shook her head horza felt a wave of relief sweep through him he looked at each word on the screen in turn as though frightened that the short message could somehow conceal a hidden negation he smiled and said thank you shall i go down alone to the planet you may enter there is death here be warned what death horza said the relief waned the draazons words about death chilled him where is there death whose the screen changed again the first two lines disappearing now it simply said be warned i do not unahaclosp said slowly like the sound of that at all then the screens were clear wubslin sighed and relaxed the sun of the schars world system shone brightly ahead of them less than a standard lightyear away horza checked the figures on the navigation computer as its screen bickered back to normality along with the rest displaying numbers and graphs and holographics then the changer sat back in his seat were through all right he said were through the quiet barrier so nothing can touch us now huh neisin said horza gazed at the screen the single yellow dwarf star showing as a bright unwavering spot of light in the centre planets still invisible he nodded nothing nothing outside anyway great think ill have a drink to celebrate neisin nodded at yalson then swung his thin body out through the doorway do you think it meant only you can go down or all of us yalson asked still staring at the screen horza shook his head i dont know well go into orbit then broadcast to the changer base shortly before we try taking the cat in if mr adequate doesnt like it hell let us know youve decided its male then said balveda just as yalson said why not contact them now i didnt like that bit about there being death here horza turned towards yalson balveda was at her side the drone had floated down a little to eye level horza looked at yalson just as a precaution i dont want to give anything away too soon he turned his gaze to the culture woman last i heard the regular transmission was due from the base on schars world a few days ago i dont suppose you heard whether it had been received horza grinned at balveda in a way that was meant to show he didnt expect an answer or at least not a truthful one the tall culture agent looked at the floor seemed to shrug then met horzas eyes i heard she said it was overdue horza stayed looking at her balveda didnt take her eyes away yalson glanced from one to another eventually the drone unahaclosp said frankly none of this inspires confidence my advice would be to it stopped as horza glared at it hmm it said well never mind that for now it floated sideways to the door and went out seems to be ok wubslin said not apparently addressing anybody in particular he sat back from the console nodding to himself yes ships back to normal now he turned round and smiled at the other three they came for him he was in a gamehall playing floatball he thought he was safe there surrounded by friends in every direction they seemed to float like a cloud of flies in front of him for a second but he laughed that off caught the ball threw it and scored a point but they came for him there he saw them coming two of them from a door set in a narrow chimney of the spherical ribbed gamehall they wore cloaks of no colour and came straight towards him he tried to float away but his power harness was dead he was stuck in midair unable to make progress in any direction he was trying to swim through the air and struggle out of his harness so that he could throw it at them perhaps to hit certainly to send himself off in the other direction when they caught him none of the people around him seemed to notice and he realised suddenly they were not his friends that in fact he didnt know any of them they took his arms and in an instant without travelling past or through anything yet somehow making him feel they had turned an invisible corner to a place that was always there but out of sight they were in an area of darkness their nocolour cloaks showed up in the darkness when he looked away he was powerless locked in stone but he could see and breathe help me that is not what we are here for who are you you know i dont then we cant tell you what do you want we want you why why not but why me you have no one what you have no one what do you mean no family no friends no religion no belief thats not true how would you know i believe in what me that is not enough anyway youll never find it what find what enough lets do it now do what take your name i and they reached together into his skull and took his name so he screamed horza yalson shook his head bouncing it off the bulkhead at the top of the small bed he spluttered awake the whimper dying on his lips his body tense for an instant then soft he put his hands out and touched the womans furred skin she put her hands behind his head and hugged him to her breast he said nothing but his heart slowed to the pace of hers she rocked his body gently with her own then pushed his head away bent and kissed his lips im all right now he told her just a nightmare what was it nothing he said he put his head back to her chest nestling it between her breasts like a huge delicate egg horza had his suit on wubslin was in his usual seat yalson occupied the copilots chair they were all suited up schars world filled the screen in front of them the belly sensors of the cat staring straight down at the sphere of white and grey beneath and magnifying it one more time horza said wubslin transmitted the recorded message for the third time maybe they dont use that code any more yalson said she watched the screen with her sharpbrowed eyes she had cropped her hair back to about a centimetre over her skull hardly thicker than the down which covered her body the menacing effect jarred with the smallness of her head sticking out from the large neck of the suit its traditional more of a ceremonial language than a code horza said theyll know it if they hear it youre sure were beaming it at the right place yes horza said trying to remain calm they had been in orbit for less than half an hour stationary above the continent which held the buried tunnels of the command system almost the whole of the planet was covered in snow ice locked the thousandkilometre peninsula where the tunnel system lay fast into the sea itself schars world had entered another of its periodic ice ages seven thousand years previously and only in a relatively thin band around the equator between the slightly wobbling planets tropics was there open ocean it showed as a steely grey belt around the world occasionally visible through whorls of storm clouds they were twentyfive thousand kilometres out from the planets snowcrusted surface their communicator beaming down onto a circular area a few tens of kilometres in diameter at a point midway between the two frozen arms of sea which gave the peninsula a slight waist that was where the entrance to the tunnels lay that was where the changers lived horza knew he hadnt made a mistake but there was no answer there is death here he kept thinking a little of the planets chill seemed to creep along his bones nothing wubslin said right horza said taking the manual controls into his gloved hands were going in the clear air turbulence teased its warp fields out along the slight curve of the planets gravity well carefully edging itself down the slope horza cut the motors and let them return to their emergencyreadyonly mode they shouldnt need them now and would soon be unable to use them as the gravity gradient increased the cat fell with gradually increasing speed towards the planet fusion motors at the ready horza watched displays on the screens until he was satisfied they were on course then with the planet seeming to turn a little beneath the craft he unstrapped and went back to the mess aviger neisin and dorolow sat in their suits strapped into the messroom seats perosteck balveda was also strapped in she wore a thick jacket and matching trousers her head was exposed above the soft ruff of a white shirt the bulky fabric jacket was fastened up to her throat she had warm boots on and a pair of hide gloves lay on the table in front of her the jacket even had a little hood which hung down her back horza wasnt sure whether balveda had chosen this soft useless image of a space suit to make a point to him or unconsciously out of fear and a need for security unahaclosp sat in a chair strapped against its back pointing straight up at the ceiling i trust it said were not going to have the same sort of flyingcircus job we had to endure the last time you flew this heap of debris horza ignored it we havent had any word from mr adequate so it looks like were all going down he said when we get there ill go in by myself to check things out when i come back well decide what were going to do that is youll decide began the drone what if you dont come back aviger said the drone made a hissing noise but went quiet horza looked at the toylike figure of the old man in his suit ill come back aviger he said im sure everybody at the base will be fine ill get them to heat up some food for us he smiled but knew it wasnt especially convincing anyway he went on in the unlikely event there is anything wrong ill come straight back well this ships our only way off the planet remember that horza aviger said his eyes looked frightened dorolow touched him on the arm of his suit trust in god dorolow said well be all right she looked at horza wont we horza horza nodded yes well be all right well all be just fine he turned and went back to the bridge they stood in the high mountain snows watching the midsummer sun sink in its own red seas of air and cloud a cold wind blew her hair across her face auburn over white and he raised a hand without thinking to sweep it away again she turned to him her head nestling into his cupped hand a small smile on her face so much for midsummers day she said the day had been fair still well below freezing but mild enough for them to take their gloves off and push their hoods back the nape of her neck was warm against his palm and the lustrous heavy hair brushed over the back of his hand as she looked up at him skin white as snow white as bone that look again she said softly what look he said defensively knowing the faraway one she said taking his hand and bringing it to her mouth kissing it stroking it as though it was a small defenceless animal well thats just what you call it she looked away from him towards the livid red ball of the sun lowering behind the distant range thats what i see she told him i know your looks by now i know them all and what they mean he felt a twinge of anger at being thought so obvious but knew that she was right at least partly what she did not know about him was only what he did not know about himself but that he told himself was quite a lot still perhaps she even knew him better than he did himself im not responsible for my looks he said after a moment to make a joke of it they surprise me too sometimes and what you do she said the sunsets glow rubbing false colour into her pale thin face will you surprise yourself when you leave here why do you always assume im going to leave he said annoyed stuffing his hands into the thick jackets pockets and staring at the hemisphere of disappearing star i keep telling you im happy here yes she said you keep telling me why should i want to leave she shrugged slipped one arm through his put her head to his shoulder bright lights big crowds interesting times other people im happy here with you he told her and put his arm round her shoulders even in the bulky quilting of the jacket she seemed slim almost fragile she said nothing for a moment then in quite a different tone and so you should be she turned to face him smiling now kiss me he kissed her hugged her looking down over her shoulder he saw something small and red move on the trampled snow near her feet look he said breaking away stooping she squatted beside him and together they watched the tiny sticklike insect crawl slowly laboriously over the surface of the snow one more living moving thing on the blank face of the world thats the first one ive seen he told her she shook her head smiling you just dont look she chided he put out one hand and scooped the insect into his palm before she could stop him oh horza she said her breath catching on a tiny hook of despair he looked uncomprehending at her stricken expression while the snowcreature died from the warmth of his hand the clear air turbulence dropped towards the planet circling its icebright layers of atmosphere from day to night and back again tipping over the equator and tropics as it spiralled in gradually it encountered that atmosphere ions and gases ozone and air it swooped through the worlds thin wrapping with a voice of fire flashing like a large steady meteorite across the night sky then across the dawn terminator over steelgrey seas tabular bergs ice tables floes and shelves frozen coasts glaciers mountain ranges permafrost tundra more crushed pack ice and finally as it bellied down on its pillars of flame land again land on a thousandkilometre peninsula sticking out into a frozen sea like some monstrous fractured limb set in plaster there it is wubslin said watching the masssensor screen a bright winking light tracked slowly across the display horza looked over the mind he asked wubslin nodded right density five kilometres deep he punched some buttons and squinted at figures scrolling across the screen on the far side of the system from the entrance and moving the pinpoint of light on the screen disappeared wubslin adjusted the controls then sat back shaking his head sensor needs an overhaul its range is right down the engineer scratched his chest and sighed sorry about the engines too horza the changer shrugged had the motors been working properly or had the mass sensors range been adequate somebody could have remained on the cat flying it if necessary and relaying the minds position to the others in the tunnels wubslin seemed to feel guilty that none of the repairs hed tried to effect had significantly improved the performance of either motors or sensor never mind horza said watching the waste of ice and snow passing beneath them at least now we know the things in there the ship guided them to the right area though horza recognised it anyway from the times he had flown the single small flyer the base was allowed he looked for the flyer as they made their final approach in case somebody happened to be using it the snowcovered plain was ringed by mountains the clear air turbulence swept over a pass between two peaks shattering the silence tearing dusty snow from the jagged ridges and crags of the barren rocks on either side it slowed further coming in noseup on its tripod of fusion fire the snow on the plain beneath picked itself up and stirred as though uneasy at first then as the craft dropped lower and lower the snow was blown then ripped from the frozen ground beneath and thrown away in vast swirling rolls of heated air mixing snow and water steam and plasma particles in a howling blizzard which swept across the plain gathering strength as the vessel dropped horza had the cat on manual he watched the screen ahead saw the false created wind of stormy snow and steam in front and beyond it the entrance to the command system it was a black hole set in a rugged promontory of rock which fluted down from the higher cliffs behind like a piece of solidified scree the snowstorm broiled round the dark entrance like mist the storm was turning brown as the fusion flame heated the frozen ground of the plain itself melting it and plucking it out in an earthy spray with hardly a bump and only a little settling as the legs sank into the now soggy surface of the swept plain the cat touched the surface of schars world horza looked straight ahead at the tunnel entrance it was like a deep dark eye staring back the motors died the steam drifted disturbed snow fell back and some new flakes formed as the suspended water in the air froze once more the cat clicked and creaked as it cooled from the heat produced by both the friction of reentry and its own plasma jets water gurgled turning to slush over the scoured surface of the plain horza switched the cats bow laser to standby there was no movement or sign from the tunnel the view was clear now the snow and steam gone it was a bright sunny windless day well here we are horza said and immediately felt foolish yalson nodded still staring at the screen yup wubslin said checking screens nodding feet have sunk in half a metre or so well have to remember to run the motors for a while before we try to lift off when we leave theyll freeze solid in half an hour hmm horza said he watched the screen nothing moved there were no clouds in the light blue sky no wind to move the snows the sun wasnt warm enough to melt the ice and snow so there was no running water not even any avalanches in the distant mountains with the exception of the seas which still contained fish but no longer any mammals the only things which moved on schars world were a few hundred species of small insects slow spreading lichen on rocks near the equator and the glaciers the humanoids war or the ice age had wiped everything else out horza tried the coded message once more there was no reply right he said getting up from his seat ill step out and take a look wubslin nodded horza turned to yalson youre very quiet he said yalson didnt look at him she was staring at the screen and the unblinking eye of the tunnel entrance be careful she said she looked at him just be careful all right horza smiled at her picked up kraiklyns laser rifle from the floor then went through to the mess were down he said as he went through see dorolow said to aviger neisin drank from his hip flask balveda gave the changer a thin smile as he went from one door to the other unahaclosp resisted the temptation to say anything and wriggled out of the seat straps horza descended to the hangar he felt light as he walked they had switched to ambient gravity on their way over the mountains and schars world produced less pull than the standardg used on the cat horza rode the hangars descending floor to the now refreezing marsh where the breeze was fresh and sharp and clean hope everythings all right wubslin said as he and yalson watched the small figure wade through the snow towards the rocky promontory ahead yalson said nothing but watched the screen with unblinking eyes the figure stopped touched its wrist then rose in the air and floated slowly across the snows ha wubslin said laughing a little id forgotten we could use ag here too long on that damn o wont be much use in those fucking tunnels yalson muttered horza landed just to the side of the tunnel entrance from the readings he had already taken while flying over the snow he knew the tunnel door field was off normally it kept the tunnel within shielded from the snow and the cold air outside but there was no field there and he could see that a little snow had blown into the tunnel and now lay in a fan shape on its floor the tunnel was cold inside not warm as it should be and its black deep eye seemed more like a huge mouth now that he was close to it he looked back at the cat facing him from two hundred metres away a shining metal interruption on the white expanse squatting in a blastmark of brown im going inside he told the ship aiming a tight beam at it rather than broadcasting the signal ok wubslin said in his ear you dont want somebody there to cover you yalson said no horza replied he walked down the tunnel keeping close to the wall in the first equipment bay were some ice sleds and rescue gear tracking apparatus and signalling beacons it was all much as he recalled it in the second bay where the flyer should have been there was nothing he went on to the next one more equipment he was about forty metres inside the tunnel now ten metres shy of the rightangled turn which led into the larger segmented gallery where the living accommodation of the base lay the mouth of the tunnel was a white hole when he turned back to face it he set the tight beam on wide aperture nothing yet im about to look into the accommodation section bleep but dont reply otherwise the helmet speakers bleeped before going round the corner he detached the suits remote sensor from the side of the helmet and edged its small lens round the corner of sculpted rock on an internal screen he saw the short length of tunnel the flyer lying on the ground and a few metres beyond it the wall of plastic planking which filled the tunnel and showed where the human accommodation section of the changer base began by the side of the small flyer lay four bodies there was no movement horza felt his throat closing up he swallowed hard then put the remote sensor back on the side of the helmet he walked along the floor of fused rock to the bodies two were dressed in light unarmoured suits they were both men and he didnt recognise them one of them had been lasered the suit flashburned open so that the melted metals and plastics had mingled with the guts and flesh inside the hole was half a metre in diameter the other suited man had no head his arms were stuck out stiffly in front of him as though to embrace something there was another man dressed in light loose clothes his skull had been smashed in from behind and at least one arm was broken he lay on his side as frozen and dead as the other two horza was aware that he knew the mans name but he couldnt think of it just then kierachell must have been asleep her slim body was lying straight inside a blue nightgown her eyes were closed her face peaceful her neck had been broken horza looked down at her for a while then took one of his gloves off and bent down there was frost on her eyelashes he was aware of the wrist seal inside the suit gripping his forearm tightly and of the thin cold air his hand was exposed to her skin was hard her hair was still soft and he let it run through his fingers it was more red than he remembered but that might just have been the effect of the helmet visor as it intensified the poor light of the darkened tunnel perhaps he should take his helmet off too to see her better and use the helmet lights he shook his head turning away he opened the door to the accommodation section carefully after listening for any noise coming through the wall in the open vaulted area where the changers had kept their outdoor clothes and suits and some smaller pieces of equipment there was little to show that the place had been taken over further through the accommodation unit he found traces of a fight dried blood laser burns in the control room where the bases systems were monitored there had been an explosion it looked like a small grenade had gone off under the control panel that accounted for the lack of heating and the emergency light it looked as though somebody had been trying to repair the damage judging by some tools spare pieces of equipment and wiring lying around in a couple of the cabins he found traces of idiran occupation the rooms had been stripped bare religious symbols were burned onto the walls in another room the floor had been covered with some sort of soft deep covering like dry gelatin there were six long indentations in the material and the room smelt of medjel in kierachells room only the bed was untidy it had changed little otherwise he left it and went to the far end of the accommodation unit where another wall of plastic boards marked the beginning of the tunnels he opened the door cautiously a dead medjel lay just outside its long body seemingly pointing the way down the tunnel to the waiting shafts horza looked at it for a while monitored its body for a moment dead still frozen then prodded it and finally shot it once through the head just to be sure it was in standard fleetgroundforce uniform and it had been wounded some time ago badly it looked like it had suffered from frostbite earlier too before it had died of its wounds and frozen it was a male grizzled its greenbrown skin leathery with age its long muzzleface and small delicatelooking hands deeply lined he looked down the dark tunnel smooth fused floor smooth arched walls the tunnel went on into the mountain side blast doors made ribs along the tunnel sides their tracks and slots carved across the floor and roof he could see the elevatorshaft doors and the boarding point for the servicetube capsules he walked along past the sets of ancient blast door until he came to the access shafts the elevators were all at the bottom the transit tube was locked shut no power seemed to be running through any of the systems he turned and walked back to the accommodation section through it and past the bodies and the flyer without giving them a glance and eventually out into the open air he sat down at the side of the tunnel entrance in the snow his back to the rock they saw him from the cat and yalson said horza are you all right no he said turning the laser rifle off no im not whats wrong yalson said quickly horza took the suit helmet off putting it down on the snow beside him the cold air sucked heat from his face and he had to breathe hard in the thin atmosphere there is death here he said to the cloudless sky the command system batholith its called a batholith a granitic intrusion which rose up like a molten bubble into the sedimentary and metamorphic rocks already here a hundred million years ago eleven thousand years ago the locals built the command system in it hoping to use the rock cover as protection from fusion warheads they built nine stations and eight trains the idea was that the politicos and military chiefs sat in one train their secondsincommand and deputies in another and during a war all eight trains would be shuffled around the tunnels halting in a station to be linked via hardened communication channels to the transceiver sites on the immediate surface and throughout the state so they could run the war the enemy would have a hard time cracking the granite that deep anyway but hitting something as relatively small as a station would be even more difficult and they never could be sure there would be a train in it or that it would be manned and on top of that they had to knock out the backup train as well as the main one germ warfare killed them all off and some time between then and ten thousand years ago the draazon moved in pumping the air out of the tunnels and replacing it with inert gas seven thousand years ago a new ice age started and about four thousand years after that the place got so cold mr adequate pumped the argon out and let the planets own atmosphere back in its so desiccated nothings rusted in the tunnels for three millennia about three and a half thousand years ago the draazon came to an agreement with most of the rival galactic federations which allowed ships in distress to cross the quiet barriers politically neutral relatively powerless species were permitted to set up small bases on most of the planets of the dead to provide help for those in distress and i suppose to provide a sop to the people who had always wanted to know what the planets were like certainly on schars world mr adequate let us take a good look at the system every year and turned a blind eye when we went down unofficially however nobodys ever taken unscrambled recordings of any sort out of the tunnels the entrance were at is here at the base of the peninsula above station four one of the three main stations the others are one and seven where repair and maintenance facilities exist there are no trains parked in four three or five there are two trains in station one two in seven one train each in the rest at least thats where they ought to be the idirans may have moved them though i doubt it the stations are twentyfive to thirtyfive kilometres apart linked by twin sets of tunnels which only join up at each of the stations the whole system is buried about five kilometres down well take lasers and a neural stunner plus chaff grenades for protection nothing heavier neisin can take his projectile rifle the bullets he has are only light explosive but no plasma cannons or micronukes theyd be dangerous enough in the tunnels anyway god knows but they might also bring down mr adequates wrath and we dont want that wubslins rigged up our ship mass anomaly sensor into a portable set so we can spot the mind in addition ive got a mass sensor in my suit so we shouldnt have any problem actually finding what were after even if its hidden itself assuming the idirans dont have their own communicators theyll be using the changers our transceivers cover their frequencies and more so we can listen in on them but they cant hear us so those are the tunnels that mind is in there somewhere and so presumably are some idirans and medjel horza stood in the mess room at the head of the table under the screen on the screen a diagram of the tunnels was superimposed over a map of the peninsula the others looked at him the empty semisuit of the medjel he had found lay in the centre of the table you want to take us all in the drone unahaclosp said yes what about the ship neisin said it can take care of itself ill programme its automatics so that itll recognise us and defend itself against anybody else and youre going to take her yalson asked nodding at balveda who was sitting opposite her horza looked at the culture woman id prefer to have balveda where i can see her he said i wouldnt feel safe leaving her here with any of you i still dont see why i have to go unahaclosp said because horza told it i dont trust you on board here either besides i want you to carry stuff what the drone sounded angry i dont know that youre being completely honest here horza aviger said shaking his head ruefully you say that the idirans and medjel well that youre on their side but here they are and theyve killed four of your own people already and you think that theyre somewhere inside these tunnels wandering about and theyre supposed to be about the best groundtroops in the galaxy you want to send us up against them first of all horza sighed i am on their side were after the same thing secondly it looks to me as though they dont have many weapons of their own otherwise that medjel would certainly have been armed all they probably have here are the changers weapons also it looks from this medjel suit weve got he gestured at the webbed apparatus in the middle of the table which he and wubslin had been studying since they had brought it on board like a lot of their equipment is blown only the lights and the heaters on this thing were working everything else had fused my guess is all that happened when they came through the quiet barrier they were all zapped inside the chuyhirtsi and their battle gear was fucked up if the same thing happened to their weapons as happened to their suits theyre virtually unarmed and with a lot of problems with all these fancy new ag harnesses and lasers were much better equipped even in the unlikely event that it does come to a fight which is very likely considering they wont have any communicators left balveda said youll never get close enough to tell them and even if you did how are they supposed to know youre who you say you are if theyre the same lot you think they are they came in here just after the mind did they wont even have heard of you they certainly wont believe you the culture agent looked round the others your surrogate captain is leading you to your deaths balveda horza said im doing you a courtesy letting you in on all this dont annoy me balveda arched her eyebrows staying silent how do we know these are the same lot who got here inside this weird animal anyway neisin said he looked suspiciously at horza they cant be anybody else horza said they were damn lucky to survive what the draazon did to them and even the idirans wouldnt risk sending any other forces in after they saw what had happened to this lot but that means theyve been here for months dorolow said how are we supposed to find something if theyve been here all this time and havent found anything perhaps they have horza said spreading his arms wide and smiling at the woman a trace of sarcasm in his voice but if they havent its very possibly because they wont have any working gear with them theyd have to search the whole command system besides if that warp animal was as badly damaged as i heard it was they wont have had much control over it very likely they crashlanded hundreds of kilometres away and had to slog here through the snow in that case they might have only been here for a few days i cant believe the god would let this happen dorolow said shaking her head and looking at the surface of the table in front of her there must be something else to all this i could feel its power and and goodness when we came through the barrier it wouldnt let those poor people just be shot down like that horza rolled his eyes dorolow he said to her leaning forward and planting his knuckles on the table top the draazon are barely aware theres a war going on they dont really give a damn about individuals they recognise death and decay but not hope and faith as long as the idirans or we dont wreck the command system or blow the planet away they wont give a damn who lives or dies dorolow sat back silent but unconvinced horza straightened his words sounded fine he had the impression the mercenaries would follow him but inside deeper than where the words were coming from he felt no more caring no more alive than the snowcovered plain outside he wubslin and neisin had gone back into the tunnels they had investigated the accommodation section and found more evidence of idiran habitation it looked as though a very small force one or two idirans and maybe half a dozen medjel had stayed for a while at the changer base after they had taken it over they had apparently taken a lot of freezedried emergency food supplies with them the two laser rifles and the few small pistols the changer base was allowed and the four portable communication sets from the store room horza had covered the dead changers up with the reflector foil they had found in the base and removed the semisuit from the dead medjel they had looked at the flyer to see if it was serviceable it wasnt its micropile had been partially removed and badly damaged in the process like almost everything else in the base it was without power back on board the clear air turbulence horza and wubslin had dissected the medjels suit and discovered the subtle but irreparable damage which had been inflicted on it all the time whenever horza wasnt worrying about what their chances and their choices were each moment he stopped concentrating on what he was looking at or supposed to be thinking about he saw a hard and frozen face at right angles to the body it was attached to with frost on the eyelashes he tried not to think about her there was no point nothing he could do he had to go on he had to see this through even more so now he had thought for a long time about what he could do with the rest of the people on the clear air turbulence and decided he had no real choice but to take them all into the command system with him balveda was one problem he wouldnt feel safe even leaving the whole crew to guard her and he wanted the best fighters along with him not stuck on the ship he could have got round this problem just by killing the culture agent but the others had got too used to her had come to like her just a little too much if he killed her he would lose them well i think its insanity to go down into those tunnels unahaclosp said why not just wait up here until the idirans reappear with or without this precious mind first of all horza said watching the expressions on the others faces for any sign of agreement with the drone if they dont find it they probably wont reappear these are idirans and a carefully chosen crack squad of them at that theyll stay down there for ever he looked at the tunnel system drawn on the screen then back at the people and the machine around the table they could search for a thousand years in there especially if the powers off and they dont know how to bring it back up which im assuming they dont and you do of course the machine said yes horza said i do we can turn the power on at one of three stations this one number seven or number one it still works wubslin looked sceptical well it was working when i left deep geothermal producing electricity the power shafts are sunk about a hundred kilometres through the crust anyway as i say theres too much space down there for those idirans and medjel to have a hope of searching properly without some sort of detection device a mass anomaly sensor is the only one thatll work and they cant have one we have two thats why we have to go in and fight dorolow said probably not theyve taken communicators ill get in touch with them and explain who i am naturally i cant tell you the details but i know enough about the idiran military system about their ships even some of their personnel to be able to convince them i am who i say i am they wont know me personally but they were told a changer would be sent later liar balveda said her voice was cold horza felt the atmosphere in the mess change become tense the culture woman was looking at him her features set determined even resigned balveda he said softly i dont know what you were told but i was briefed on the hand of god and xoralundra told me the idiran ground force in the chuyhirtsi knew id been sent for he said it calmly ok that wasnt what i heard balveda said but he sensed she was not totally sure of herself she had risked a lot to say that probably hoping that he would at least threaten her or do something which would turn the others against him it hadnt worked horza shrugged i cant help it if the special circumstances section cant brief you accurately perosteck he said smiling thinly the culture agents eyes looked away from the changers face at the table then at each of the other people sitting around it as though testing them to see who they each believed look horza said in his most honestsounding and reasonable voice spreading his hands out i dont want to die for the idirans and god knows why but i have come to like you lot i wouldnt take you in there on a suicide mission well be all right if the worst comes to the worst we can always pull out well take the cat back through the quiet barrier and head for somewhere neutral you can have the ship ill have a captured culture agent he looked at balveda who was sitting in her seat with her legs crossed her arms folded and her head down but i dont think itll come to that i think well catch this glorified computer and be well rewarded for it what if the cultures won the battle outside the barrier and theyre waiting for us when we come out with or without the mind yalson asked she didnt sound hostile just interested she was the only one he felt he could rely on though he thought wubslin would follow too horza nodded thats unlikely i cant see the culture falling back all over this volume but holding out here but even if they did theyd have to be very lucky indeed to catch us they can only see into the barrier in real space dont forget so theyd have no warning of where wed be coming out no problem there yalson sat back apparently convinced horza knew he looked calm but inside he was tensed up waiting for the mood of the rest to make itself clear his last answer had been truthful but the rest were either not the whole truth or lies he had to convince them he had to have them on his side there was no other way he could carry out his mission and he had come too far done too much killed too many people sunk too much of his own purpose and determination into the task to back out now he had to track the mind down he had to go down into the command system idirans or no idirans and he had to have the rest of what had been kraiklyns free company with him he looked at them at yalson severe and impatient wanting the talking to stop and the job just to be got on with her shadow of hair making her look both very young almost childlike and hard at the same time dorolow her eyes uncertain looking at the others scratching one of her convoluted ears nervously wubslin slumped comfortably in his seat compressed his stocky frame radiating relaxation wubslins face had shown signs of interest when horza described the command system and the changer guessed the engineer found the whole idea of this gigantic trainset fascinating aviger looked very dubious about the whole venture but horza thought that now he had made it clear nobody was going to be allowed to stay on the ship the old man would accept this rather than go to the trouble of arguing about it neisin he wasnt sure about he had been drinking as much as ever been quieter than horza remembered him but while he didnt like being bossed around and told what he could and couldnt do he was obviously fed up being stuck on the clear air turbulence and had already been out for a walk in the snow while wubslin and horza were looking at the medjel suit boredom would make him follow if nothing else horza wasnt worried about the machine unahaclosp it would do as it was told like machines always did only the culture let them get so fancy they really did seem to have wills of their own as for perosteck balveda she was his prisoner it was as simple as that easy in easy out yalson said she smiled shrugged and looking round at the others said what the fuck its something to do isnt it nobody disagreed horza was reprogramming the cats fidelities once more entering the computers new instructions through a worn but still serviceable touchboard when yalson came onto the flight deck she slipped into the copilots seat and watched the man as he worked the touchboards illuminated display threw the shadows of marain characters over his face after a while she said looking at the markings on the illuminated board marain eh horza shrugged its the only accurate language i and this antique share he tapped some more instructions in hey he turned to her you shouldnt be in here when im doing this he smiled to show her he wasnt serious dont you trust me yalson said smiling back youre the only one i do horza said turning to the board again it doesnt matter anyway for these instructions yalson watched him for a little longer did she mean a lot to you horza he didnt look up but his hands paused over the touchboard he stared at the illuminated characters who horza yalson said gently he still didnt look at her we were friends he said as though talking to the touchboard yeah well she said after a pause i suppose it must be pretty hard anyway when its your own people horza nodded still not looking up yalson studied him for a little longer did you love her he didnt reply immediately his eyes seemed to inspect each of the precise compact shapes in front of him as though one of them concealed the answer he shrugged maybe he said once he cleared his throat looked briefly round at yalson then leant back to the touchboard that was a long time ago yalson got up then as he went back to his task and put her hands on his shoulders im sorry horza he nodded again and placed one hand over hers well get them she said if thats what you want you and he shook his head looked round at her no we go for the mind thats all if the idirans do get in the way i wont care but no theres no point in risking more than we have to thanks though she nodded slowly thats all right she bent kissed him briefly then went out the man gazed at the closed door for a few moments then turned back to the board full of alien symbols he programmed the ships computer to fire warning then lethal laser shots at anybody or anything approaching it unless they could be identified by the distinctive electromagnetic emission signature of their suit as one of the free company in addition it required horzas kraiklyns identity ring to make the cats elevator work and once on board to take control of the ship itself horza felt safe enough doing this only the ring would let them take over the ship and he was confident nobody could take that from him not without a greater risk to themselves than even a squad of mean and hungry idirans could provide but it was possible that he might be killed and the others might survive especially for yalson he wanted them to have some sort of escape route that didnt depend totally on him they took down some of the plastic boarding in the changer base so that if they did find the mind they would be able to get it through dorolow wanted to bury the dead changers but horza refused he carried each of them to the tunnel entrance and left them there he would take them with him when they left return them to heibohre the natural freezer of schars worlds atmosphere would preserve them until then he looked down at kierachells face for a moment in the waning light of late afternoon while a bank of clouds coming in from the frozen sea built over the distant mountains and the wind freshened he would get the mind he was determined to and he felt it in his bones but if it came to a firefight with the ones who had done this he wouldnt shrink from it he might even enjoy it perhaps balveda wouldnt have understood but there were idirans and idirans xoralundra was a friend and a kind and humane officer he supposed the old querl would be considered a moderate and horza knew others in the military and diplomatic missions whom he liked but there were idirans who were real fanatics who despised all other species xoralundra would not have murdered the changers it would have been unnecessary and inelegant but then you didnt send moderates on missions like this you sent fanatics or a changer horza returned to the others he got as far as the crippled flyer now surrounded with the plastic boarding they had removed and facing the hole in the accommodation section as though it was about to enter a garage when he heard firing he ran through the corridor leading to the rear of the section readying his gun what is it he said into his helmet mike laser down the tunnel from the shafts yalsons voice said he ran into the open storeroom area where the others were the hole they had opened in the plastic boarding was four or five metres wide as soon as horza came through from the corridor flame splashed from the wall alongside him and he saw the brief airglows of lasertracks just to one side of his suit leading back through the gap in the wall and down the tunnel obviously whoever was doing the shooting could see him he rolled to one side and came up by dorolow and balveda who were sheltering by a large portable winch holes burst through the wall of plastic boards burning brightly then going out the whoop of laserfire echoed down the tunnels what happened horza said looking at dorolow he looked around the storage area the rest were all there taking cover where they could apart from yalson yalson went dorolow began then yalsons voice cut in i came through the hole in the wall and got shot at im lying on the ground im ok but id like to know if its all right to fire back i wont damage anything will i fire horza yelled as another fan of glowing tracks spattered a line of burning craters over the inside wall of the store room fire back thanks yalson said horza heard the womans gun snap then the dopplered echo of sound produced by superheated air explosions crashed from down the tunnel hmm yalson said think thats got neisin said from the far side of the storage area his voice cut off as more fire slammed into the wall behind him the wall was pockmarked with dark bubbling holes bastard yalson said she fired back in short rapid bursts keep his head down horza told her im coming forward to the wall dorolow stay here with balveda he got up and ran to the edge of the hole in the plastic boards smoking holes in the material showed how little protection it afforded but he knelt there in its cover anyway he could see yalsons feet a few metres out into the tunnel spread on the smooth fused floor he listened to her gun firing then said right stop long enough to let me see where its coming from then hit it again ok yalson stopped firing horza stuck his head out feeling incredibly vulnerable saw a couple of tiny sparks far down the tunnel and off to one side he brought the gun up and fired continually yalsons started again as well his suit chirped a screen lit up by his cheek showing hed been hit on the thigh he couldnt feel anything the side of the tunnel far down at the elevator shafts pulsated with a thousand sparks of light neisin appeared at the other side of the gap in the boards kneeling like horza and firing his projectile rifle the side of the tunnel detonated with flashes and smoke shock waves blew up the tunnel shaking the plastic boarding and ringing in horzas ears enough he shouted he stopped firing yalson stopped neisin put in one final burst then stopped too horza ran out through the gap across the dark rock floor of the tunnel outside and over to the side wall he flattened himself there getting some cover from the slight protrusion of a blast doors edge further down the tunnel where their target had been there was a scatter of dull red shards lying on the tunnel floor cooling from the yellow heat of the laser fire which had torn them from the wall on the helmet nightsight horza could see a series of rippling waves of warm smoke and gas flowing silently under the roof of the tunnel from the damaged area yalson get over here he said yalson rolled over and over until she bumped into the wall just behind him she got quickly to her feet and flattened out beside him i think we got it horza broadcasted neisin still kneeling at the gap in the boarding looked out the rapidfire microprojectile rifle waving to and fro as though its owner expected a further attack from out of the tunnel walls horza started forward keeping his back to the wall he got to the edge of the blast door most of its metrethick bulk was stowed in its recess in the wall but about half a metre protruded horza looked down the tunnel again the wreckage was still glowing like hot coals scattered on the tunnel floor the wave of hot black smoke passed overhead wafting slowly up the tunnel horza looked to his other side yalson had followed him stay here he said he walked down the side of the wall to the first of the elevator shafts they had been firing at the third and last one judging by the grouping of the craters and scars all around its open buckled doors horza saw a halfmelted laser carbine lying in the middle of the tunnel floor he poked his head out from the wall frowning right on the very lip of the elevator shaft between the scarred and holed doors surrounded by a sea of dull redglowing wreckage he was sure he could see a pair of hands gloved stubbyfingered injured one finger was missing from the glove nearer him but hands without a doubt it looked like somebody was hanging inside the shaft by the tips of their fingers he focused the tight beam of his communicator aiming in the direction he was looking at hello he said in idiran medjel medjel in the elevator shaft do you hear me report at once the hands didnt move he edged closer what was it wubslins voice came through the speakers just a moment horza said he went closer rifle ready one of the hands moved slightly as though trying to get a better grip on the lip of the tunnel floor horzas heart thudded he went towards the tall open doors his feet crunching on the warm debris he saw semisuited arms as he went closer then the top of a long laserscarred helmet with a rasping noise he had heard medjel make when they charged during a battle another third hand he knew it was a foot but it looked like a hand and it was holding a small pistol flashed up from the elevator shaft at the same time as the medjels head looked up and out straight at him he started to duck the pistol cracked its plasma bolt missing him by only a few centimetres horza shot quickly ducking and going to one side fire blew out all around the lip of the elevator smashing into the gloves with a scream the gloved hands vanished light flickered briefly in the circular shaft horza ran forward stuck his head between the doors and looked down the dim shape of the falling medjel was lit by the guttering fire still burning on its suit gloves somehow it still held the plasma pistol as it fell screaming it fired the small weapon the cracks of its shots and the flashes from the bolts drawing further away as the creature holding it firing it whirled its six limbs flailing down into the darkness horza yalson shouted are you all right what the fuck was that im fine he said the medjel was a tiny wriggling shape deep in the shafts tunnel of vertical night its screams still echoed the microscopic sparks of its burning hands and the firing plasma pistol still flaring horza looked away a few small thuds recorded the hapless creatures contact with the sides of the shaft as it dropped whats that noise dorolow said the medjel was still alive it shot at me but i got it horza told them walking away from the open elevator doors it fell its still falling down the elevator shaft shit breathed neisin still listening to the faint fading echoing screams how deep is that ten kilometres if none of the blast doors are shut horza said he looked at the external controls for the other two lifts and the transit capsule entrance they had escaped more or less undamaged the doors leading to the transit tubes were open they had been closed when horza inspected the area earlier yalson shouldered her gun and walked down the tunnel towards horza well she said lets get this op on the road yeah neisin said what the hell these guys arent so tough after all thats one down already yeah deep down yalson said horza inspected the damage to his suit while the others came down the tunnel there was a burn on the right thigh a millimetre deep and a couple of fingerbreadths wide save for the unlikely chance of another shot falling on the same place it hadnt harmed the suit a fine start if you ask me the drone muttered as it started down the tunnels with the others horza went back to the tall buckled pitted doors of the lift shaft and looked down with the magnifier up full he could just make out a tiny sparkling deep deep below the helmets external mikes picked up a noise but from so far away and so full of echoes it sounded like nothing more than the wind starting to moan through a fence they clustered in front of the opened doors of an elevator shaft not the one the medjel had fallen down the doors were twice the height of anyone of them dwarfing them all as though they were children horza had opened those doors taken a good look floated down on the suits ag a little way then come back up it all looked safe ill go first he told the assembled group if we hit any trouble let off a couple of chaff grenades and get back up here were going to the main system level about five kilometres down once we get through the doors thats us more or less in station four from there well be able to turn on the power something the idirans havent been able to do after that well have transport in the form of transittube capsules what about the trains wubslin asked the transit tubes are faster horza said we might have to start a train up if we capture the mind depends exactly how big it is besides unless theyve moved them since i was here the nearest trains will be at station two or station six not here but there is a spiral tunnel at station one we could bring a system train up what about the transit tube up here yalson said if thats the way that medjel suddenly appeared whats to stop another one hiking up the tunnel horza shrugged nothing i dont want to fuse the doors closed in case we want to come back that way once we have the mind but if one of them does come up that way so what itll be one less down there for us to worry about anyway somebody can stay up here until were all safely down the lift shaft then follow us but i dont think there will be another one so close behind that one yes that one you didnt manage to talk into believing you were both on the same side the drone said testily horza squatted down on his haunches to look at the drone it was invisible from above because of the pellet of equipment it was carrying that one he said didnt have a communicator did it whereas any idirans down there certainly will have the ones they took from the base wont they and medjel do as idirans tell them to right he waited for the machine to reply and when it didnt he repeated right horza had the impression that had the drone been human it would have spat whatever you say sir the drone said and what do i do horza balveda said standing in her fabric jumpsuit wearing a fur jacket on top do you intend to throw me down the shaft and say you forgot i didnt have any ag or do i have to walk down the transit tunnel youll come with me and if we hit trouble youll what balveda asked i dont think well hit any trouble horza said youre sure there were no ag harnesses in the base aviger said horza nodded if there had been dont you think one of the medjel weve encountered so far would have had them on maybe the idirans are using them theyre too heavy they could use two aviger insisted there were no harnesses horza said through his teeth we were never allowed any we werent supposed to go into the command system apart from yearly inspections when we could power everything up we did go in we walked down the spiral to station four like that medjel must have slogged up but we werent supposed to and we werent allowed gravity harnesses theyd have made getting down there too easy dammit lets get down there yalson said impatiently looking at the others aviger shrugged if my ag fails with all this rubbish im carrying the drone began its voice muffled by the pallet over its top surface you drop any of that stuff down that shaft and youd be as well to follow it machine horza said now just save your energy for floating not talking youll follow me keep five or six hundred metres up yalson will you stay up here till we get the doors open yalson nodded the rest of you he looked round them come after the drone dont bunch up too much but dont get separated wubslin stay at the same level as the machine and have chaff grenades ready horza held his hand out to balveda madam he held balveda to him she rested her feet on his boots facing away from him then horza stepped into the shaft and they descended together into the nightdark depths see you at the bottom neisin said in the helmet speakers were not going to the bottom neisin horza sighed shifting his arm slightly round balvedas waist were going to the main system level ill see you there yeah ok wherever they fell on ag without incident and horza forced open the doors at the system level five kilometres below in the rock there had been only one exchange with balveda on the way down a minute or so after they had started out horza what if any shooting starts from down there or anything happens and you have to let go i mean drop me what balveda kill me im serious shoot me id rather that than fall all that way nothing horza said after a moments thought would give me greater pleasure they dropped into the chill stone silence of the tunnels black throat clasped like lovers goddamn it horza said softly he and wubslin stood in a room just off the dark echoing vault that was station four the others were waiting outside the lights on horza and wubslins suits illuminated a space packed with electric switching gear the walls were covered with screens and controls thick cables snaked over the ceiling and along the walls and metal floorplates covered conduits filled with more electrical equipment there was a smell of burning in the room a long black sooty scar had printed itself onto one wall above charred and melted cabling they had noticed the smell on their walk through the connecting tunnels from the shaft to the station horza had smelt it and felt gall rise in his throat the odour was faint and could not have turned the most sensitive of stomachs but horza had known what it meant think we can mend it wubslin asked horza shook his head probably not this happened once on a yearly test when i was here before we powered up in the wrong sequence and blew that same cablerun if theyve done what we did therell be worse damage further down in the deeper levels took us weeks to repair it horza shook his head damn he said i guess it was pretty smart of those idirans to figure out as much as they did wubslin said opening his visor to reach in and scratch his head awkwardly i mean to get this far yes horza said kicking a large transformer too goddamn smart they made a brief search of the station complex then gathered again in the main cavern and crowded round the juryrigged mass sensor wubslin had removed from the clear air turbulence wires and lightfibres were tangled about it and attached to the top of the machine was a cannibalised screen from the ships bridge now plugged directly into the sensor the screen lit up wubslin fiddled with its controls the screen hologram showed a diagrammatic representation of a sphere with three axes shown in perspective thats about four kilometres wubslin said he seemed to be talking to the mass sensor not the people around it lets try eight he touched the controls again the number of lines on the axes doubled one very faint smudge of light blinked near the edge of the display is that it dorolow said is that where it is no wubslin said fiddling with the controls again trying to get the little patch of light to become clearer not dense enough wubslin doubled the range twice more but only the single trace remained submerged in clutter horza looked round orienting himself with the grid pattern shown on the screen would that thing be fooled by a pile of uranium oh yeah wubslin said nodding the power were putting through it any radiation will upset it a bit thats why were down to roughly thirty kilometres maximum anyway see just because of all this granite yeah if theres a reactor even an old one itll show up when the sensors reader waves get to it but just like this as a patch if this minds only fifteen metres long and weighs ten thousand tonnes itll be really bright like a star on the screen ok horza said thats probably just the reactor down at the deepest service level oh wubslin said they had reactors too backup horza said that one was for ventilation fans if the natural circulation couldnt cope with smoke or gas the trains have reactors too in case the geothermal failed horza checked the reading on the screen with the builtin mass sensor in his suit but the faint trace of the backup reactor was out of its range should we investigate this one wubslin asked his face lit by the glowing screen horza straightened up shaking his head no he said wearily not for now they sat in the station and had something to eat the station was over three hundred metres long and twice the width of the main tunnels the metal rails the command system trains ran on stretched across the level floor of fused rock in double tracks appearing from one wall through an inverted u and disappearing through another towards the repair and maintenance area at either end of the station there were sets of gantries and ramps which rose almost to the roof those provided access to the two upper floors of the trains when they were in the station horza explained when neisin asked about them i cant wait to see these trains wubslin mumbled mouth full you wont be able to see them if theres no light aviger told him i think its intolerable that i have to go on carrying all that junk the drone said it had set the equipmentloaded pallet down and now im told i have to carry even more weight im not that heavy unahaclosp said balveda youll manage horza told the machine with no power the only thing they could do was use their suits ag to float along to the next station it would be slower than the transit tube but quicker than walking balveda would have to be carried by the drone horza i was wondering yalson said what how much radiation have we all soaked up recently not much horza checked the small screen inside his helmet the radiation level wasnt dangerous the granite around them gave off a little but even if they hadnt been suited up theyd have been in no real danger why nothing yalson shrugged just with all these reactors and this granite and that blast when the bomb went off in the gear you vacd from the cat well i thought we might have taken a dose being on the megaship when lamm tried to blow it apart didnt help either but if you say were ok were ok unless somebodys particularly sensitive to it we havent got much to worry about yalson nodded horza was wondering whether they should split up should they all go together or should they go in two groups one down each of the foot tunnels which accompanied the main line and the transit tube they could even split up further and have somebody go down each of the six tunnels which led from station to station that was going too far but it showed how many possibilities there were split up they might be better placed for a flanking attack if one group encountered the idirans though they wouldnt initially have the same firepower they wouldnt be increasing their chances of finding the mind not if the mass sensor was working properly but they would be increasing their chances of stumbling into the idirans in the first place staying together though in the one tunnel gave horza a feeling of claustrophobic foreboding one grenade would wipe them out a single fan of heavy laserfire would kill or disable all of them it was like being set a cunning but unlikely problem in one of the heibohre military academys term exams he couldnt even decide which way to head when theyd searched the station yalson had seen marks in the thin layer of dust on the foottunnel floor leading to station five which suggested the idirans had gone that way but ought they to follow or should they go in the opposite direction if they followed and he couldnt convince the idirans he was on their side theyd have to fight but if they went in the other direction and turned the electricity on at station one theyd be giving power to the idirans as well there was no way of restricting the energy to one part of the command system each station could isolate its section of track from the supply loop but the circuitry had been designed so that no single traitor or incompetent could cut off the whole system so the idirans too would have use of the transit tubes the trains themselves and the engineering workshops better to find them and try to parley settle the issue one way or the other horza shook his head this whole thing was too complicated the command system with its tunnels and caverns its levels and shafts its sidings and loops and crossovers and points seemed like some infernal closedcircuit flow chart for his thoughts he would sleep on it he needed sleep now like the rest of them he could sense it in them the machine might get run down but it didnt need sleep and balveda still seemed alert enough but all the rest were showing signs of needing a deeper rest than just sitting down according to their body clocks it was time to sleep he would be foolish to try to push them further he had a restrainer harness on the pallet that should keep balveda secure the machine could stand guard and he would use the remote sensor on his suit to watch for movement in the immediate area where they slept they ought to be safe enough they finished their meal nobody disagreed with the idea of turning in balveda was trussed in the restrainer harness and barricaded in one of the empty store rooms off the platform unahaclosp was told to sit itself up on one of the tall gantries and stay still unless it heard or saw anything untoward horza set his remote sensor near where he would sleep on one of the lower girders of a hoist mechanism he had wanted a word with yalson but by the time he had finished making all these arrangements several of the others including yalson had fallen asleep already lying back against the wall or laid out on the ground their visors blanked or their heads turned away from the weak lights of the others suits horza watched wubslin wander around the station for a bit then the engineer too lay down and everything was still horza switched the remote sensor on primed to alarm if it sensed anything above a certain low level of movement he slept fitfully his dreams woke him ghosts chased him in echoing docks and silent deserted ships and when he turned to face them their eyes were always waiting like targets like mouths and the mouths swallowed him so that he fell into the eyes black mouth past ice rimming it dead ice rimming the cold swallowing eye and then he wasnt falling but running running with a leaden pitchlike slowness through the bone cavities in his own skull which was slowly disintegrating a cold planet riddled with tunnels crashing and crumpling against a neverending wall of ice until the wreckage caught him and he fell burning into the cold eye tunnel again and as he fell a noise came from the throat of the cold iceeye and from his own mouth and chilled him more than ice and the noise said eeeeee state of play three fal ngeestra was where she liked being most on top of a mountain she had just made her first real climb since shed broken her leg it was a relatively unforbidding peak and she had taken the easiest route but now here at the summit drinking in the view she was dismayed at how unfit she had become the healed leg hurt a little deep inside of course but so did the muscles in both legs as though shed just climbed a mountain twice the height and with a full pack just out of condition she guessed she sat on the summit of the ridge looking out over smaller white summits to the sharp forested creases of the higher foothills and the rolling downs beyond where grassland and trees combined the distance was the plain rivers sparkling in the sunlight and marking its far side the hills where the lodge was her home birds wheeled far away in the high valleys beneath her and sometimes light glinted from the plain as some reflective surface moved a part of her listened to the distant boneache assessing it then switched the nagging sensation off she wanted no distractions she hadnt climbed all this way just to enjoy the view shed come up here for a purpose it meant something to climb to haul this sack of bones and flesh all this way and then look then think then be she could have taken a flyer here any time when shed been recovering but she hadnt even though jase had suggested it that was too easy being here wouldnt have meant anything she concentrated her eyelids drooping going through the quiet internal chant the unmagical spell that called up the spirits buried in her genofixed glands the trance came on with an initial rush of dizzying force that made her put her hands out to each side steadying herself when she didnt need steadying the sounds in her ears of her own blood coursing of her breaths slow tide loudened took on strange harmonies the light beyond her eyelids pulsed in time to the bloodbeat she felt herself frown imagining her brow creasing like the folding hills and one part of her still distant watching thought still not very good at this she opened her eyes and the world had changed the far hills were forever rolling brown and green waves with a crest of breaking white foam the plain fumed with light the pattern of pastureland and copses in the foothills looked like camouflage moving but not moving like a tall building seen against quick clouds the forested ridges were buckled divisions in some huge busy treebrain and the snow and icecovered peaks about her had become vibrating sources of a light that was sound and smell as well she experienced a dizzying sense of concentricity as though she was the nucleus of the landscape here in an insideout world an inverted hollowness part of it born here all she was each bone and organ cell and chemical and molecule and atom and electron proton and nucleus every elementary particle each wavefront of energy from here not just the orbital dizzy again touching snow with gloved hands but the culture the galaxy the universe this is our place and our time and our life and we should be enjoying it but are we look in from outside ask yourself just what are we doing killing the immortal changing to preserve warring for peace and so embracing utterly what we claimed to have renounced completely for our own good reasons well it was done those people in the culture who had really objected to the war were gone they were no longer culture they were not part of the effort they had become neutrals formed their own groupings and taken new names or claimed to be the real true culture yet another shading of confusion along the cultures inchoate boundaries but for once the names did not matter what did matter was the disagreement and the illfeeling produced by the split ah the contempt of it the glut of contempt we seem to have achieved our own disguised contempt for primitives the contempt of those who left the culture when war was declared for those who chose to fight the idirans the contempt so many of our own people feel for special circumstances the contempt we all guess the minds must feel for us and elsewhere the idirans contempt for us all of us humans and human contempt for changers a federated disgust a galaxy of scorn us with our busy busy little lives finding no better way to pass our years than in competitive disdain and what the idirans must feel towards us consider nearimmortal singular and unchanged fortyfive thousand years of history on one planet with one allembracing religionphilosophy whole steady aeons of contented study a calm age of devotion on that one worshipped place uninterested in anything outside then millennia ago in another ancient war invasion suddenly finding themselves pawns in somebody elses squalid imperialism from introverted peacefulness through ages of torment and repression a forging force indeed to extroverted militancy determined zeal who could blame them they had tried to keep themselves apart and been shattered almost made extinct by forces greater than those they could muster no surprise that they decided the only way to protect themselves was to attack first expand become stronger and stronger push their boundaries as far from the treasured planet of idir as possible and there is even a genetic template for that catastrophe change from meek to fierce in the step from breeder to warrior oh a savage and noble species justifiably proud of themselves and refusing to alter their genetic code not far wrong in claiming perfection already what they must feel for the swarming biped tribes of humankind repetition matter and life and the materials that could take change that could evolve forever repeating lifes food talking back to it and us just another belch in the darkness sound but not a word noise without meaning we are nothing to them mere biotomatons and the most terrible example of the type the culture must seem like some fiendish amalgam of everything the idirans have ever found repugnant we are a mongrel race our past a history of tangles our sources obscure our rowdy upbringing full of greedy shortsighted empires and cruel wasteful diasporas our ancestors were the lostandfound of the galaxy continually breeding and breeding and milling and killing their societies and civilisations forever falling apart and reforming there had to be something wrong with us something mutant in the system something too quick and nervous and frantic for our own good or anybody elses we are such pathetic fleshy things so short lived swarming and confused and dull just so stupid to an idiran physical repugnance then but worse to come we are selfaltering we meddle with the code of life itself respelling the word which is the way the incantation of being interfering with our own inheritance and interfering in the development of other peoples ha an interest we share and worse still worst of all not just producing but embracing and giving ourselves over totally to the ultimate anathema the minds the sentient machines the very image and essence of life itself desecrated idolatry incarnate no wonder that they despise us poor sick mutations that we are petty and obscene servants of the machinedevils that we worship not even sure of our own identity just who is culture where exactly does it begin and end who is and who isnt the idirans know exactly who they are purebred the one race or nothing do we contact is contact the core but after that the level of genofixing varies despite the ideal not everybody can mate successfully with everybody else the minds no real standards individuals too and not fully predictable precocious independent living on a culturemade orbital or in a rock another sort of hollowed world small wanderer no too many claiming some kind of independence no clear boundaries to the culture then it just fades away at the edges both fraying and spreading so who are we the buzz of meaning and matter about her the mountains song of light seemed to rise around her like a cauldron tide drenching and engulfing she felt herself as the speck she was a mote a tiny struggling imperfect chip of life lost in the surrounding waste of light and space she sensed the frozen force of the ice and snow around her and felt consumed by the skinburning chill of it she felt the sun beat and knew the crystals fracturing and melting knew the water as it dripped and slithered and became dark bubbles under ice and dewdrops on the icicles she saw the fronded trickles the tumbling streams and the cataracted rivers she sensed the winding and unwinding loops as the river slowed and oxbowed calm esturial into lake and sea where vapour rose once more and she felt lost within it dissolved within it and for the first time in her young life was truly afraid more frightened there and then than she had been when shed fallen and broken her leg during either the brief moments of falling the stunning instant of impact and pain or the long cold hours afterwards crumpled in the snow and rocks sheltering and shivering and trying not to cry that was something she had long before prepared herself for she knew what was happening she had worked out the effects it might have and the ways she might react it was a risk you took something you understood this was not because now there was nothing to understand and maybe nothing including her to understand it help something wailed inside her she listened and could do nothing we are ice and snow we are that trapped state we are water falling itinerant and vague ever seeking the lowest level trying to collect and connect we are vapour raised against our own devices made nebulous blown on whatever wind arises to start again glacial or not she could come out she felt the sweat bead on her brow sensed her hands create their own moulds in the crisp crunching snow and knew there was a way out knew she could come down but with nothing having found nothing done nothing understood nothing she would stay then she would fight it out the cycle began again her thoughts looping and she saw the water as it flowed down gorges and valleys or collected lower in trees or fell straight back to lakes and the sea she saw it fall on meadowland and on the high marshes and the moors and she fell with it terrace to terrace over small lips of rock foaming and circling she felt the moisture on her forehead start to freeze chilling her and knew the danger wondered again whether to come out of the trance wondered how long she had sat here whether they were watching over her or not she felt dizzy again and grabbed deeper at the snow around her her gloves pressuring the frozen flakes and as she did that she remembered she saw the pattern of frozen foam once more she stood again beside that ledge on the moors cold surface by the tiny waterfall and the pool where she had found the lens of frothed ice she remembered holding it in her hands and recalled that it did not ring when she flicked it with her finger that it tasted of water no more when she touched it with her tongue and that her breath blew across it in a cloud another swirling image in the air and that was her that was what it meant something to hold onto who are we who we are just what were taken as being what we know and what we do no less or more information being passed on patterns galaxies stellar systems planets all evolve matter in the raw changes progresses in a way life is a faster force reordering finding new niches starting to shape intelligence consciousness an order quicker another new plane beyond was unknown too vague to be understood ask a draazon perhaps and wait for the answer all just refining a process of getting it more right if right itself was right and if we tamper with our inheritance so what what is more ours to tamper with what makes nature more right than us if we get it wrong thats because we are stupid not because the idea was bad and if we are no longer on the breaking edge of the wave well too bad hand on the baton best wishes have fun everything about us everything around us everything we know and can know of is composed ultimately of patterns of nothing thats the bottom line the final truth so where we find we have any control over those patterns why not make the most elegant ones the most enjoyable and good ones in our own terms yes were hedonists mr bora horza gobuchul we seek pleasure and have fashioned ourselves so that we can take more of it admitted we are what we are but what about you what does that make you who are you what are you a weapon a thing made to deceive and kill by the longdead the whole subspecies that is the changers is the remnant of some ancient war a war so long gone that no one willing to tell recalls who fought it or when or over what nobody even knows whether the changers were on the winning side or not but in any event you were fashioned horza you did not evolve in a way you would call natural you are the product of careful thought and genetic tinkering and military planning and deliberate design and war your very creation depended on it you are the child of it you are its legacy changer change yourself but you cannot you will not all you can do is try not to think about it and yet the knowledge is there the information implanted somewhere deep inside you could you should live easy with it all the same but i dont think you do and im sorry for you because i think i know now who you really hate she came out of it quickly as the supply of chemicals from glands in her neck and brain stem shut off the compounds already in the girls brain cells began to break down releasing her reality blew around her the breeze freshening cold against her skin she wiped the sweat from her brow there were tears in her eyes and she wiped them too sniffing and rubbing her reddened nose another failure she thought bitterly but it was a young unstable sort of bitterness a kind of fake something she assumed for a while like a child trying on adult clothes she luxuriated in the feeling of being old and disillusioned for a moment then let it drop the mood did not fit time enough for the genuine version when she was old she thought wryly smiling at the line of hills on the far side of the plain but it was a failure nevertheless she had hoped for something to occur to her something about the idirans or balveda or the changer or the war or anything instead old territory mostly accepted facts the already known a certain selfdisgust at being human an understanding of the idirans proud disdain for her kind a reaffirmation that at least one thing was its own meaning and a probably wrong probably oversympathetic glimpse into the character of a man she had never met and never would meet who was separated from her by most of a galaxy and all of a morality little enough to bring down from the frozen peak she sighed the wind blew and she watched clouds mass far along the high range she would have to start down now if she was going to beat the storm it would seem like cheating not to get back down under her own steam and jase would scold her if conditions got so bad she had to send for a flyer to pick her up fal ngeestra stood the pain in her leg came back signals from her weak point she paused for a moment reassessing the state of that mending bone and then deciding it would hold up started the descent towards the unfrozen world below the command system stations he was being shaken gently wake up now come on wake up come on now up you get he recognised the voice as xoralundras the old idiran was trying to get him to wake up he pretended to stay asleep i know youre awake come on now its time to get up he opened his eyes with a false weariness xoralundra was there in a bright blue circular room with lots of large couches set into alcoves in the blue material above hung a white sky with black clouds it was very bright in the room he shielded his eyes and looked at the idiran what happened to the command system he said looking around the circular blue room that dream is over now you did well passed with flying colours the academy and i are very pleased with you he couldnt help but feel pleased a warm glow seemed to envelop him and he couldnt stop a smile appearing on his face thanks he said the querl nodded you did very well as bora horza gobuchul xoralundra said in his rumbling great voice now you should take some time off go and play with gierashell he was swinging his feet off the bed getting ready to jump down to the floor when xoralundra said that he smiled at the old querl who he laughed your friend gierashell the idiran said you mean kierachell he laughed shaking his head xoralundra must be getting old i mean gierashell the idiran insisted coldly stepping back and looking at him strangely who is kierachell you mean you dont know but how could you get her name wrong he said shaking his head again at the querls foolishness or was this still part of some test just a moment xoralundra said he looked at something in his hand which threw coloured lights across his broad gleaming face then he slapped his other hand to his mouth an expression of astonished surprise on his face as he turned to him and said oh sorry and suddenly reached over and shoved him back into the he sat upright something whined in his ear he sat back down again slowly looking round in the grainy darkness to see if any of the others had noticed but they were all still he told the remote sensor alarm to switch off the whine in his ear faded unahaclosps casing could be seen high on the far gantry horza opened his visor and wiped some sweat from his nose and brows the drone had no doubt seen him each time he woke up he wondered what it was thinking now what it thought of him could it see well enough to know that he was having nightmares could it see through his visor to his face or sense the small twitches his body made while his brain constructed its own images from the debris of an his days he could blank the visor out he could set the suit to expand and lock rigid he thought about how he must look to it a small soft naked thing writhing in a hard cocoon convulsed with illusions in its coma he decided to stay awake until the others started to rise the night passed and the free company awoke to darkness and the labyrinth the drone said nothing about seeing him wake up during the night and he didnt ask it he was falsely jolly and hearty going round the others laughing and slapping backs telling them theyd get to station seven today and there they could turn on the lights and get the transit tubes working tell you what wubslin he said grinning at the engineer as he rubbed his eyes well see if we cant get one of those big trains working just for the hell of it well wubslin yawned if thats all right why not horza said spreading his arms out i think mr adequates leaving us to it hes turning a blind eye to this whole thing well get one of those supertrains running eh wubslin stretched smiling and nodding well yeah sounds like a good idea to me horza smiled widely winked at wubslin and went to release balveda it was like going to release a wild animal he thought as he shifted the empty cable drum he had used to block the door he half expected to find balveda gone miraculously escaped from her bonds and disappeared from the room without opening the door but when he looked in there she was lying calmly in her warm clothes the harness making troughs in the fur of the jacket and still attached to the wall horza had fixed it to good morning perosteck he said breezily horza the woman said grumpily sitting slowly upright flexing her shoulders and arching her neck twenty years at my mothers side more than i care to think of as a gay and dashing young blade indulging in all the pleasures the culture has ever produced one or two of maturity seventeen in contact and four in special circumstances have not made me pleasant to know or quick to wake in the mornings you wouldnt have some water to drink would you ive slept too long i wasnt comfortable its cold and dark i had nightmares i thought were really horrible until i woke up and remembered what reality was like at the moment and i mentioned water a moment or two ago did you hear or arent i allowed any ill get you some he said going back to the door he stopped there youre right by the way you are pretty offputting in the morning balveda shook her head in the darkness she put one finger in her mouth and rubbed it around on one side as though massaging her gums or cleaning her teeth then she just sat with her head between her knees staring at the jetblack nothing of the cold rock floor beneath her wondering if this was the day she died they stood in a huge semicircular alcove carved out of the rock and looking out over the dark space of station fours repair and maintenance area the cavern was three hundred metres or more square and from the bottom of the scooped gallery they stood on to the floor of the vast cave littered with machinery and equipment was a thirtymetre drop great cradlearms capable of lifting and holding an entire command system train were suspended from the roof above another thirty metres up in the gloom in the middistance a suspended gantry lanced out over the cave from a gallery on one side to the other bisecting the caverns dark bulk they were ready to move horza gave the order wubslin and neisin each headed down small side tubes towards the main command system tunnel and the transit tubeway respectively using ag once in the tunnels they would keep level with the main group horza switched on his own ag rose about a metre from the floor and floated down a branch tunnel of the foot gallery then started slowly forward down into the darkness towards station five thirty kilometres away the rest would follow him also floating balveda shared the pallet with the equipment he smiled when balveda sat down on the pallet she suddenly reminded him of fwisong sitting on his heavyduty litter in the space and sunlight of a place now gone the comparison struck him as wonderfully absurd horza floated along the foot tunnel stopping to check the side tubes as they appeared and contacting the others whenever he did so his suit senses were turned as high as they would go any light the slightest noise an alteration in the air flow even vibrations in the rock around him all were catered for unusual smells would register too as would power flowing through the cables buried in the tunnel walls and any sort of broadcast communication hed thought about signalling the idirans as they went along but decided not to he had sent one short signal from station four without receiving a reply but to send more on the way would be to give too much away if as he suspected the idirans were not in a mood to listen he moved through the darkness as though sitting on an invisible seat the crews cradled in his arms he heard his heartbeat his breathing and the quiet slipstreaming of the cold halfstale air around his suit the suit registered vague background radiation from the surrounding granite punctuated by intermittent cosmic rays on the faceplate of the suits helmet he watched a ghostly radar image of the tunnels as they unwound through the rock in places the tunnel ran straight if he turned he could see the main group following half a kilometre behind him in other places the tunnel described a series of shallow curves cutting down the view provided by the scanning radar to a couple of hundred metres or less so that he seemed to float alone in the chill blackness at station five they found a battleground his suit had picked up odd scents that had been the first sign organic molecules in the air carbonised and burnt hed told the others to stop gone on ahead cautiously four dead medjel were laid out near one wall of the dark deserted cavern their burned and dismembered bodies echoing the formation of frozen changer corpses at the surface base idiran religious symbols had been burned onto the wall over the fallen there had been a firefight the station walls were pocked with small craters and long laser scars horza found the remains of one laser rifle smashed a small piece of metal embedded in it the medjel bodies had been torn apart by hundreds more of the same tiny projectiles at the far end of the station behind the halfdemolished remains of one set of access ramps he found the scattered components of some crudely manufactured machine a kind of gun on wheels like a miniature armoured car its mangled turret still contained some of the projectile ammunition and more bullets were scattered like windseeds about the flameseared wreck horza smiled slightly at the debris weighing a handful of the unused projectiles in his hand the mind wubslin said looking down at what was left of the small vehicle it made this thing he scratched his head must have horza said watching yalson poke warily at the torn metal of the wrecks hull with one booted foot gun ready there was nothing like this down here but you could manufacture it in one of the workshops a few of the old machines still work itd be difficult but if the mind still had some of its fields working and maybe a drone or two it could do it it had the time pretty crude wubslin said turning over a piece of the gun mechanism in his hand he turned and looked back at the distant corpses of the medjel and added worked well enough though no more medjel by my count horza said still two idirans left yalson said sourly kicking at a small rubber wheel it rolled a couple of metres across the debris and flopped over again near neisin who was celebrating the discovery of the demised medjel with a drink from his flask you sure these idirans arent still here aviger asked looking round anxiously dorolow peered into the darkness too and made the sign of the circle of flame positive horza said i checked station five hadnt been difficult to search it was an ordinary station just a set of points a chicane in the command systems double loop and a place for the trains to stop and connect themselves with the communication links to the planets surface there were a few rooms and storage areas off the main cavern but no powerswitching gear no barracks or control rooms and no vast repair and maintenance area marks in the dust showed where the idirans had walked away from the station after the battle with the minds crude automaton heading for station six you think therell be a train at the next station wubslin said horza nodded should be the engineer nodded too staring vacantly at the double sets of steel rails gleaming on the station floor balveda swung herself off the pallet stretching her legs horza still had the suits infrared sensor on and saw the warmth of the culture agents breath waft from her mouth in a dimly glowing cloud she clapped her hands and stamped her feet still not too warm is it she said dont worry grumbled the drone from underneath the pallet i may start to overheat soon that ought to keep you cosy until i seize up completely balveda smiled a little and sat back on the pallet looking at horza still thinking of trying to convince your tripedal pals youre all on the same side she said huh said the drone well see was all horza would say again his breathing his heartbeat the slow wash of stale air the tunnels led on into the deep night of the ancient rock like an insidious circular maze the war wont end aviger said itll just die away horza floated along the tunnel half listening to the others talk over the open channel as they followed behind him hed switched his suits external mikes from the helmet speakers to a small screen near his cheek the trace showed silence aviger continued i dont think the culture will give in like everybody thinks it will i think theyll keep fighting because they believe in it the idirans wont give in either theyll keep fighting to the last and they and the culture will just keep going at each other all the time all over the galaxy eventually and their weapons and bombs and rays and things will just keep getting better and better and in the end the whole galaxy will become a battleground until theyve blown up all the stars and planets and orbitals and everything else big enough to stand on and then theyll destroy all of each others big ships and then the little ships too until everybodyll be living in single suits blowing each other up with weapons that could destroy a planet and thats how itll end probably theyll invent guns or drones that are even smaller and therell only be a few smaller and smaller machines fighting over whatevers left of the galaxy and therell be nobody left to know how it all started in the first place well said unahaclosps voice that sounds like a lot of fun and what if things go badly thats too negative an attitude to battle aviger dorolows highpitched voice broke in you have to be positive contest is formative battle is a testing war a part of life and the evolutionary process in its extremity we find ourselves usually in the shit yalson said horza grinned yalson dorolow began even if you dont be hold it horza said suddenly the screen near his cheek had flickered wait there im picking up some sound from ahead he stopped sat still in midair and put the sound from outside through the helmet speakers a low noise deep and boomy like heavy surf from a long way off or a thunderstorm in distant mountains well theres something making a noise up there horza said how far to the next station yalson said about two kilometres think its them neisin sounded nervous probably horza said ok im going ahead yalson put balveda in the restrainer harness everybody check weapons no noise wubslin neisin go forward slowly stop as soon as you can see the station im going to try talking to these guys the noise boomed vaguely on making him think of a rockslide heard from a mine deep inside a mountain he approached the station a blast door came into view round a corner the station would be only another hundred metres beyond he heard some heavy clunking noises they came down the dark tunnel deep and resonant hardly muffled by the distance sounding like huge switches being closed massive chains being fastened the suit registered organic molecules in the air idiran scent he passed the edge of the blast door and saw the station there was light in station six dim and yellow as though from a weak torch he waited for wubslin and neisin to tell him they could see the station from their tunnels then he went closer a command system train stood in station six its rotund bulk three storeys tall and three hundred metres long half filling the cylindrical cavern the light came from the trains far end high at the front where the control deck was the sounds came from the train too he moved across the foot tunnel so he could see the rest of the station at the far end of the platform floated the mind he stared at it for a moment then magnified the image to make sure it looked genuine an ellipsoid maybe fifteen metres long and three in diameter silvery yellow in the weak light spilling from the trains control cabin and floating in the stale air like a dead fish on the surface of a still pond he checked the suits mass sensor it registered the fuzzy signal of the trains reactor but nothing else yalson he said whispering even though he knew it was unnecessary anything on that mass sensor just a weak trace a reactor i guess wubslin horza said i can see what looks like the mind in the station floating at the far end but its not showing on either sensor would its ag make it invisible to the sensors shouldnt wubslins puzzled voice came back might fool a passive gravity sensor but not a loud metallic breaking noise came from the train horzas suit registered an abrupt increase in local radiation holy shit he said whats happening yalson said more clicking snapping noises echoed through the station and another weak yellow light appeared from beneath the reactor car in the middle of the train theyre fucking about with the reactor carriage thats whats happening horza said god wubslin said dont they know how old all this stuff is what are they doing that for aviger said could be trying to get the train to run under its own power horza said crazy bastards maybe theyre too lazy to push their prize back to the surface the drone suggested these nuclear reactors they cant explode can they aviger said just as a blinding blue light burst from under the centre of the train horza flinched his eyes closed he heard wubslin shout something he waited for the blast the noise death he looked up the light still flashed and sparkled under the reactor car he heard an erratic hissing noise like static horza yalson shouted gods balls wubslin said i nearly filled my pants its ok horza said i thought theyd blown the damn thing up what is that wubslin welding i think wubslin said electric arc right horza said lets stop these crazies before they blow us all away yalson join me dorolow meet up with wubslin aviger stay with balveda it took a few minutes for the others to arrange themselves horza watched the bright flickering blue light as it sizzled away under the centre of the train then it stopped the station was lit only by the two weak lights from the control deck and reactor car yalson floated down the foot tunnel and landed gently at horzas side ready dorolow said over the intercom then a screen in horzas helmet flashed a speaker beeped in his ear something had transmitted a signal near by not one of their suits or the drone what was that wubslin said then look there on the ground looks like a communicator horza and yalson looked at each other horza wubslin said theres a communicator on the floor of the tunnel here i think its on it must have picked up the noise of dorolow setting down beside me that was what transmitted theyre using it as a bug sorry dorolow said well dont touch the thing yalson said quickly could be boobied so now they know were here aviger said they were going to know soon anyway horza said ill try hailing them everybody ready in case they dont want to talk horza cut his ag and walked to the end of the tunnel almost onto the level platform of the station another communicator lying there transmitted its single pulse horza looked at the great dark train and switched on his suit pa he drew a breath ready to speak in idiran something flashed from a slitlike window near the rear of the train his head was knocked back inside the helmet and he fell stunned his ears ringing the noise of the shot echoed through the station the suit alarm beeped frantically at him horza rolled over against the tunnel wall more shots slammed down on him flaring against the suit helmet and body yalson ducked and ran she skidded to the lip of the tunnel and raked fire over the window the shots were coming from then swivelled grabbed horza by one arm and pulled him further into the tunnel plasma bolts crashed into the wall hed been lying against horza she shouted shaking him command override level zero a small voice chirped in horzas buzzing ears this suit has sustained systemfatal damage automatically voiding all warranties from this point immediate total overhaul required further use at wearers risk powering down horza tried to tell yalson he was all right but the communicator was dead he pointed to his head to make her understand this then more shots from the nose of the train came bursting into the foot tunnel yalson dived to the floor and started firing back fire she yelled to the others get those bastards horza watched yalson shooting at the far end of the train laser trails flicked out from the left side of their tunnel tracer shells from the right as the others joined in the station filled with a spastic blazing light shadows leapt and danced across the walls and ceiling he lay there stunned dullheaded listening to the muffled cacophony of sound breaking against his suit like surf he fumbled with his laser rifle trying to remember how to fire it he really had to help the others fight the idirans his head hurt yalson stopped shooting the front of the train glowed red where shed been firing at it the explosive shells from neisins gun crackled round the window the first shots had come from short bursts of fire wubslin and dorolow had come out of the main tunnel past the slab of the trains rear the crouched near the wall firing at the same window as neisin the plasma fire had stopped the humans stopped shooting too the station went dark the gunfire echoed faded horza tried to stand up but somebody seemed to have removed the bones from his legs anybody yalson began fire cascaded around wubslin and dorolow lancing out from the lower deck of the last carriage dorolow screamed and fell hand spasming her gun blasted wildly over the cavern roof wubslin rolled along the ground shooting back at the idirans yalson and neisin joined in the carriages skin buckled and burst under the fusilade dorolow lay on the platform moving spasmodically moaning more shots came from the front of the train bursting around the tunnel entrances then something moved midway up the rear carriage near the rear access gantry an idiran ran from a carriage door and along the middle ramp he levelled a gun and fired down first at dorolow where she lay on the ground then at wubslin lying near the side of the train dorolows suit was blown tumbling and burning across the black floor of the station wubslins gun arm was hit then yalsons shots found the idiran scattering fire across his suit the structure of the gantry and the side of the train the ramp supports gave way before the idirans armoured suit softening and disintegrating under the stream of fire the gantry tubing sagged and collapsed sending the top platform of the ramp crashing down trapping the idiran warrior underneath the smoking wreckage wubslin cursed and shot onehanded at the nose of the train where the second idiran was still firing horza lay against the wall his ears roaring his skin cold and sweatslicked he felt numb dissociated he wanted to take his helmet off and gasp at some fresh air but knew he shouldnt even though the helmet was damaged it would still protect him if he was shot again he compromised by opening the visor sound assaulted his ears shockwaves thrummed at his chest yalson looked back at him motioned him further back down the tunnel as shots smacked into the floor near him he stood but fell blacking out briefly the idiran at the front of the train stopped firing for a moment yalson took the opportunity to look back at horza again he lay on the tunnel floor behind her moving weakly she looked out to where dorolow lay her suit ripped and smouldering neisin was almost out of his tunnel firing long bursts down the station scattering explosions all over the nose of the train the air boomed with the rasping noise of his gun ebbing and flowing through the cavern and accompanied by a pulsing wave of light that seemed to reach back from where the bullets struck and detonated yalson was aware of somebody shouting a womans voice yelling but she could hardly hear over the noise of neisins gun plasma bolts came singing down the platform from the front of the train again from high up near the forward access ramps she returned fire neisin poured shots in the same direction paused in stop the voice shouted in yalsons ears it was balveda theres something wrong with your gun itll the culture agents voice was drowned by the noise of neisin firing again crash yalson heard balveda scream despairingly then a line of light and sound seemed to fill the station from one end to the other ending at neisin the bright stalk of noise and flame blossomed into an explosion yalson felt through her suit bits of neisins gun were scattered across the platform the man was thrown back against the wall he fell to the ground and lay still motherfucker yalson heard herself say and she started running up the platform enfilading the front of the train trying to widen the angle of fire shots dipped to meet her then cut out there was a pause while she still ran and fired then the second idiran appeared on the top level of the distant access ramp holding a pistol in both hands he ignored both her and wubslins fire and shot straight across the breadth of the cavern at the mind the silvery ellipsoid started to move heading for the far foot tunnel the first shot seemed to go right through it as did a second a third bolt made it vanish completely leaving only a tiny puff of smoke where it had been the idirans suit glittered as yalson and wubslins shots struck home the warrior staggered he turned as though to start firing down at them again just as the armoured suit gave way he was blown back and across the gantry one arm disappearing in a cloud of flame and smoke he fell over the edge of the ramp and crashed down to the middle level the suit burning brightly one leg snagging over the guard rails on the middle ramp the plasma pistol was blown from his hand other shots tore at the wide helm fracturing the blackened visor he hung limp and burning and pummelled with laser fire for a few more seconds then the leg caught on the guard rail gave way snapping cleanly off and falling to the station floor the idiran slid crumpling to the deck of the ramp horza listened his ears still ringing after a while it was quiet acrid smoke stung his nose fumes of burned plastic molten metal roasted meat he had been unconscious then woken to see yalson running up the platform he had tried to give her covering fire but his hands shook too much and he hadnt been able to get the gun to work now everybody had stopped firing and it was very quiet he got up and walked unsteadily into the station where smoke rose from the battered train wubslin knelt by dorolows side trying with one hand to undo one of the womans gloves her suit still smouldered the helmet visor was smeared red covered with blood on the inside hiding her face horza watched yalson come back down the station gun still at the ready her suit had taken a couple of plasma bolts to the body the roughly spiralled marks showed as black scars on the grey surface she looked up suspiciously at the rear access ramps where one idiran lay trapped and unmoving then she opened her visor you all right she asked horza yes bit groggy sore head he said yalson nodded they went over to where neisin lay neisin was still just alive his gun had exploded riddling his chest arms and face with shrapnel moans bubbled from the crimson ruin of his face fucking hell yalson said she took a small medipack from her suit and reached through what was left of neisins visor to inject the semiconscious mans neck with painkiller whats happened avigers tiny voice came from yalsons helmet is it safe yet yalson looked at horza who shrugged then nodded yeah its safe aviger yalson said you can come in i let balveda use my suit mike she said she we heard yalson said something about a barrelcrash that right horza heard balvedas muffled voice affirming this she thought neisins gun might blow up or something well it did yalson said he looks pretty bad she glanced over at wubslin who was putting dorolows hand back down wubslin shook his head when he saw yalson looking at him dorolow got blown away aviger yalson said the old man was silent for a moment then said and horza took a plasma round on the headbox suit damage no communication hell live yalson paused sighed looks like we lost the mind though it disappeared aviger waited another few moments before saying his voice shaking well a fine little mess easy in easy out another triumph our changer friend taking over where kraiklyn left off his voice finished on a high pitch of anger he switched his transceiver off yalson looked at horza shook her head and said old asshole wubslin still knelt over dorolows body they heard him sob a couple of times before he too cut out of the open channel neisins slowing breath spluttered through a mask of blood and flesh yalson made the circle of flame sign over the red haze masking dorolows face then covered the body with a sheet from the pallet horzas ears stopped ringing the grogginess cleared balveda freed from the restrainer harness watched the changer tend to neisin aviger stood near by with wubslin whose arm wound had already been treated i heard the noise balveda explained it has a distinctive noise wubslin had asked why neisins gun had exploded and how balveda had known it was going to happen id have recognised it too if i hadnt been smacked on the head horza said he was teasing fragments of visor out of the unconscious mans face spraying skingel onto the places where blood oozed neisin was in shock probably dying but they couldnt even take him out of his suit too much blood had clotted between the mans body and the materials of the device he wore it would plug the many small punctures effectively enough until the suit was removed but then neisin would start to bleed in too many places for them to cope with so they had to leave him in the thing as though in that mutual wreckage the human and machine had become one fragile organism but what happened wubslin said his gun barrelcrashed horza said the projectiles must have been set to explode on too soft an impact so the shells started to detonate when they hit the blast wave from the bullets in front not the target he didnt stop firing so the blast front retarded right back into the muzzle of the gun the guns have sensors to stop it happening balveda added wincing with vicarious pain as horza drew a long sliver of visor from an eye socket i guess his wasnt working told him that gun was too damn cheap when he bought it yalson said coming over to stand by horza poor little bugger wubslin said two more dead aviger announced i hope youre happy mr horza i hope youre so pleased about what your allies have aviger yalson said calmly shut up the old man glared at her for a second then stamped off he stood looking down at dorolow unahaclosp floated down from the rear access ramp that idiran up there it said its voice pitched to betray mild surprise hes alive couple of tons of junk on top of him but hes still breathing what about the other one horza said no idea i didnt like to go too close its terribly messy up there horza left yalson to look after neisin he walked over the debrisstrewn platform to the wreckage of the rear access gantry he was bareheaded the suits helmet was ruined and the suit itself had lost its ag and motor power as well as most of its senses on backup energy the lights still worked as did the small repeater screen set into one wrist the suits mass sensor was damaged the wrist screen filled with clutter when linked to the sensor barely registering the trains reactor at all his rifle was still working for whatever that was worth now he stood at the bottom of the ramps and felt the dregs of heat seeping from the metal support legs where laser fire had struck he took a deep breath and climbed up the ramp to where the idiran lay his massive head sticking out of the wreckage sandwiched between the two levels of ramp the idiran turned slowly to look at him and one arm tensed against the wreckage which creaked and moved then the warrior brought his arm out from beneath the press of metal and unfastened the scarred battlehelm he let it fall to the floor the great saddleface looked up at the changer the greetings of the battleday horza said in careful idiran ho boomed the idiran the little one speaks our tongue im even on your side though i dont expect you to believe it i belong to the intelligence section of the first marine dominate under the querl xoralundra horza sat down on the ramp almost level with the idirans face i was sent in here to try to get the mind he continued really the idiran said pity i believe my comrade just destroyed it so i hear horza said levelling the laser rifle at the big face viced between the twisted metal planking you also destroyed the changers back up at the base i am a changer thats why our mutual masters sent me in here why did you have to kill my people what else could we do human the idiran said impatiently they were an obstacle we needed their weaponry they would have tried to stop us we were too few to guard them the creatures voice was laboured as it fought the weight of ramp crushing its torso and rib cylinder horza aimed the rifle straight at the idirans face you vicious bastard i ought to blow your fucking head off right now by all means midget the idiran smiled the double set of hard lips spreading my comrade has already fallen bravely quayanorl has started his long journey through the upper world i am captured and victorious at once and you offer me the solace of the gun i shall not close my eyes human you dont have to horza said letting the gun down he looked over through the darkness of the station at dorolows body then into the dim smokehazed light in the distance where the nose and control deck of the train glowed faintly illuminating an empty patch of floor where the mind had been he turned back to the idiran im taking you back i believe there are still units of the ninetythird fleet out beyond the quiet barrier i have to report my failure and deliver a female culture agent to the fleet inquisitor im going to report you for exceeding your orders in killing those changers not that i expect itll do any good your story bores me little one the idiran looked away and strained once more at the press of twisted metal covering him but to no avail kill me now you do smell so and your speech grates ours is not a tongue for animals whats your name horza said the saddlehead turned to him again the eyes blinked slowly xoxarle human now youll sully it by trying to pronounce it no doubt well you just rest there xoxarle like i said well take you with us first i want to check on the mind you destroyed a thought has just occurred to me horza got to his feet his head hurt abominably where the helmet had slammed into it but he ignored the pounding in his skull and started back down the ramp limping a little your soul is shit the idiran called xoxarle boomed after him your mother should have been strangled the moment she came on heat we were going to eat the changers we killed but they smelled like filth save your breath xoxarle horza said not looking at the idiran im not going to shoot you horza met yalson at the bottom of the ramp the drone had agreed to look after neisin horza looked to the far end of the station i want to see where the mind was what do you think happened to it yalson asked falling into step beside him he shrugged yalson went on maybe it did the trick it did earlier went into hyperspace again maybe it reappeared somewhere else in the tunnels maybe horza said he stopped by wubslin taking the mans elbow and turning him round from dorolows body the engineer had been crying wubslin horza said guard that bastard he might try and get you to shoot him but dont thats what he wants im going to take the son of a bitch back to the fleet so they can courtmartial him dirtying his name is a punishment killing him would be doing him a favour understand wubslin nodded still rubbing the bruised side of his head horza went off down the platform with yalson they came to where the mind had been horza turned the lights on his suit up and looked over the floor he picked up a small burnedlooking thing near the mouth of the foot tunnel leading to station seven whats that yalson said turning away from the body of the idiran on the other access gantry i think horza said turning the still warm machine over in his hand its a remote drone the mind left it behind yalson came over to look at it it was just a blackened slab of material some tubes and filaments showing through the lumpy irregular surface where it had been hit by plasma fire its the minds all right horza said he looked at yalson what exactly happened when they shot the mind when he eventually hit it it vanished it had started to move but it couldnt have accelerated that fast id have felt the shock wave it just vanished it was like somebody turning off a projection horza said yalson nodded yes and there was a bit of smoke not much do you mean to he got it eventually what do you mean i mean yalson said putting one hand on her hip and looking at horza with an impatient expression on her face that it took three or four shots the first few went straight through it are you saying it was a projection horza nodded and held up the machine in his hand it was this a remote drone producing a hologram of the mind must have had a weak force field as well so that it could be touched and pushed as though it was a solid object but all there was inside was this he smiled faintly at the wrecked machine no wonder the damn thing didnt show up on our mass sensors so the minds still around somewhere yalson said looking at the drone in horzas hand the changer nodded balveda watched horza and yalson walk into the darkness at the far end of the station she went over to where the drone floated above neisin monitoring his vital functions and sorting out some vials of medicine in the medkit wubslin kept his gun pointed at the trapped idiran but watched balveda from the corner of his eye at the same time the culture woman sat down crosslegged near the stretcher before you ask the drone said no theres nothing you can do i had guessed that unahaclosp balveda said hmm then you have ghoulish tendencies no i wanted to talk to you really the drone continued to sort the medicines yes she sat forward elbow on her knee chin cupped in her hand she lowered her voice a little are you biding your time or what the drone turned its front to her an unnecessary gesture they both knew but one it was used to making biding my time youve let him use you so far i just wondered how much longer the drone turned away again hovering over the dying man perhaps you hadnt noticed ms balveda but my choices in this matter are almost as limited as yours ive only got arms and legs and im locked away at night trussed up youre not i have to keep watch he has a movement sensor which he leaves switched on anyway so he would know if i tried to escape and besides where would i go the ship balveda suggested smiling she looked back up the dark station where the lights on their suits showed yalson and the changer picking something up from the ground i would need his ring do you want to take it from him you must have an effector couldnt you fool the ships circuits or even just that motion sensor ms balveda call me perosteck perosteck i am a generalpurpose drone a civilian i have light fields the equivalent of many fingers but not major limbs i can produce a cutting field but only a few centimetres in depth and not capable of taking on armour i can interface with other electronic systems but i cannot interfere with the hardened circuits of military equipment i possess an internal forcefield which lets me float regardless of gravity but apart from using my own mass as a weapon that is not really of much use either in fact i am not particularly strong when i needed to be for my job there were attachments available for my use unfortunately i was not employing them when i was abducted had i been i probably wouldnt be here now damn balveda said into the shadows no aces up your sleeve no sleeves perosteck balveda took in a deep breath and stared glumly at the dark floor oh dear she said our leader approaches unahaclosp said affecting weariness in its voice it turned and nodded its front towards yalson and horza returning from the far end of the cavern the changer was smiling balveda rose smoothly to her feet as horza beckoned to her perosteck balveda horza said standing with the others at the bottom of the rear access gantry and holding out one hand towards the idiran trapped in the wreckage above meet xoxarle this is the female you claim is a culture agent human the idiran said turning his head awkwardly to look down at the group of people below him pleased to meet you balveda muttered arching one eyebrow as she gazed up at the trapped idiran horza walked up the ramp passing wubslin who was training his gun on the trapped being horza still held the remote drone he came to the second level ramp and looked down at the idirans face see this xoxarle he held the drone up it glinted in the lights of his suit xoxarle nodded slowly it is a small piece of damaged equipment the deep heavy voice betrayed signs of strain and horza could see a trickle of dark purple blood on the floor of the ramp xoxarle lay squashed upon its what you two proud warriors had when you thought youd captured the mind this is all there was a remote drone casting a weak soligram if youd taken this back to the fleet theyd have thrown you into the nearest black hole and wiped your name from the records youre damn lucky i came along when i did the idiran looked thoughtfully at the wrecked drone for a short while you xoxarle said slowly are lower than vermin human your pathetic tricks and lies would make a yearling laugh there must be more fat inside your thick skull than there is even on your skinny bones you arent fit to be thrown up horza stepped onto the ramp which had fallen on top of the idiran he heard the beings breath suck in harshly through taut lips as he walked slowly over to where xoxarles face stuck out beneath the wreckage and you you goddamn fanatic arent fit to wear that uniform im going to find the mind you thought you had and then im going to take you back to the fleet where if theyve any sense theyll let the inquisitor try you for gross stupidity fuck the idiran gasped painfully your animal soul horza used the neural stunner on xoxarle then he and yalson and the drone unahaclosp levered the ramp off the idirans body and sent it crashing down to the station floor they cut the armour from the giants body then hobbled his legs with wire and tied down his arms to his sides xoxarle had no broken limbs but the keratin on one side of his body was cracked and oozed blood while another wound between his collar scale and right shoulder plate had closed up once the pressure was taken off him he was big even for an idiran over three and a half metres and not thin horza was glad the tall male a section leader according to the insignia on the armour he had been wearing was probably injured internally and going to be in pain it would make him less of a problem to guard once he had woken up he was too big for the restrainer harness yalson sat eating a rationfood bar her gun balanced on one knee and pointing straight at the unconscious idiran while horza sat at the bottom of the ramp and tried to repair his helmet unahaclosp watched over neisin as powerless as the rest of them to do anything to help the wounded man wubslin sat on the pallet making some adjustments to the mass sensor he had already taken a look round the command system train but what he really wanted was to see a working one in better light and without radiation stopping him looking through the reactor car aviger stood by dorolows body for a while then he went to the far access ramp where the body of the other idiran the one xoxarle had called quayanorl lay holed and battered limbs missing aviger looked around and thought nobody was watching but both horza looking up from the wrecked helmet and balveda walking round and stamping and shaking her feet in an attempt to keep warm saw the old man swing his foot at the still body lying on the ramp kicking the helmed head as hard as he could the helmet fell off aviger kicked the naked head balveda looked at horza shook her head then went on pacing up and down youre sure weve accounted for all the idirans unahaclosp asked horza it had floated about the station and through the train accompanying wubslin now it was facing the changer thats the lot horza said looking not at the drone but at the mess of fractured optic fibres lying bloated and fused together inside the outer skin of his helmet you saw the tracks hmm the machine said weve won drone horza said still not looking at it well get the power on in station seven and then it wont take us long to track the mind down your mr adequate seems remarkably unconcerned about the liberties were taking with his trainset the drone observed horza looked round at the wreckage and debris scattered near the train then shrugged and went back to tinkering with the helmet maybe hes indifferent he said of could it be hes enjoying all this unahaclosp said horza looked at it the drone went on this place is a monument to death after all a sacred place perhaps it is as much an altar as a monument and we are merely carrying out a service of sacrifice for the gods horza shook his head i think they left the fuse out of your imagination circuits machine he said and looked back at the helmet unahaclosp made a hissing noise and went to watch wubslin poking around inside the mass sensor what have you got against machines horza balveda said interrupting her pacing to come and stand near by she rubbed her hands on her nose and ears now and again horza sighed and put down the helmet nothing balveda as long as they stay in their place balveda made a snorting noise at that then went on pacing yalson spoke from further up the ramp did you say something funny i said machines ought to stay in their place not the sort of remark that goes down well with the culture yeah yalson said still watching the idiran then she looked down at the scarred area on the front of her suit where it had been hit by a plasma bolt horza she said can we talk somewhere not here horza looked up at her of course he said puzzled wubslin replaced yalson on the ramp yalson walked to where unahaclosp floated over neisin its lights dim it held an injector in one hazy field extension how is he she asked the machine it turned its lights up how does he look it said yalson and horza said nothing the drone let its lights fade again he might last a few more hours yalson shook her head and headed for the tunnel entrance which led to the transit tube followed by horza she stopped inside just out of sight of the others and turned to face the changer she seemed to search for words but could not find them she shook her head again and took off her helmet leaning back against the curved tunnel wall whats the problem yalson he asked her he tried to take her hand but she crossed her arms you having second thoughts about going on with this she shook her head no im going on i want to see this goddamned superbrain i dont care who gets it or if it gets blown up but i want to find it i didnt think you regarded it as that important its become important she looked away then back again smiling uncertainly hell id come along anyway just to try and keep you out of trouble i thought maybe youd gone off me a little lately he said yeah yalson said well i havent been ah she sighed heavily what the hell what horza said he saw her shrug the small shaved head dropped again silhouetted against the distant light she shook her head oh horza she said and gave a small grunting laugh youre not going to believe this believe what i dont know that i should tell tell me he said i dont expect you to believe me and if you do i dont expect you to like it not all of it im serious maybe i just shouldnt she sounded genuinely troubled he laughed lightly come on yalson he said youve said too much to stop now you just said you werent one for turning back what is it im pregnant he thought hed misheard at first and was going to make a joke about what he thought hed just heard but some part of his brain played the sounds her voice had made back doublechecking and he knew that that was exactly what shed said she was right he didnt believe it he couldnt dont ask me if im sure yalson said she was looking down again fiddling with her fingers and staring at them or the floor beyond in the darkness her ungloved hands protruding nakedly from the suit arms and pressing against each other im sure she looked at him though he couldnt see her eyes and she wouldnt be able to see his i was right wasnt i you dont believe me do you i mean it is by you thats why im telling you i wouldnt say anything if it if you werent if i just happened to be she shrugged i thought maybe youd guess when i asked about how much radiation wed all absorbed but now youre wondering how arent you well horza said clearing his throat and shaking his head it certainly shouldnt be possible were both but were from different species it ought not to be possible well there is an explanation yalson sighed still looking at her fingers as they picked and kneaded at each other but i dont think youll like that either try me itsits like this my mother my mother lived on a rock a travelling rock just one of the many you know one of the oldest it had been just tramping around the galaxy for maybe eight or nine thousand years and wait a minute horza said one of whose oldest my dad was some some man from a place a planet the rock stopped off at one time my mother said shed be back some time but she never did go back i told her id go back some time just to see him if hes still alive pure sentimentalism i guess but i said i would and i will some time if i live through this lot she gave that same small halflaugh halfgrunt and turned away from her picking fingers for a second to glance round the dark spaces of the station then her face again turned to the changer and her voice was suddenly urgent almost pleading im only half culture by birth horza i left the rock soon as i was old enough to aim a gun properly i knew the culture wasnt the place for me thats how i inherited the genofixing for transspecies mating i never thought about it before its supposed to be deliberate or at least youve got to stop thinking yourself into not getting pregnant but it didnt work this time maybe i let my guard slip somehow it wasnt deliberate horza it really wasnt it never occurred to me it just happened i how long have you known horza asked quietly since on the cat we were still a few days out from this place i cant remember exactly i didnt believe it at first i know its true though look she leaned closer to him and the note of pleading was in her voice again i can abort it just by thinking about it i can get rid of it if you want maybe id have done that already but i know youve told me about not having any family nobody to carry on your name and i thought well i dont care about my name i just thought you she broke off and suddenly put her head back and ran her fingers through her short hair its a nice thought yalson he said yalson nodded silently and went back to picking her fingers again well im giving you the choice horza she said without looking at him i can keep it i can let it grow i can keep it at the stage its at now its up to you maybe i just dont want to have to make the decision i mean maybe im not being all noble and selfsacrificing but there it is you decide fuck knows what sort of weird crossbreed i might have inside me but i thought you ought to know because i like you and because i dont know because it was about time i did something for somebody else for a change she shook her head again and her voice was confused apologetic resigned all at once or maybe because i want to do something to please myself as usual oh he had started to put his arms out to her and edge closer she suddenly came towards him wrapping her arms tight round him their suits made the embrace cumbersome and his back felt tight and strained but he held her to him and rocked her gently backwards and forwards it would only be a quarter culture horza if you want im sorry to leave it to you but if you dont want to know ok ill think again and make my own decision its still part of me so maybe i dont have any right to ask you i dont really want to she sighed mightily oh god i dont know horza i really dont yalson he said having thought about what he was going to say i dont give a damn your mother was from the culture i dont give a damn why what has happened has happened if you want to go through with it thats fine by me i dont give a damn about any crossbreeding either he pushed her away slightly and looked into the darkness that was her face im flattered yalson and im grateful too its a good idea like you would say what the hell he laughed then and she laughed with him and they hugged each other tightly he felt tears in his eyes though he wanted to laugh at the incongruity of it ail yalsons face was on the hard surface of his suit shoulder near a laser burn her body shook gently inside her own suit behind them in the station the dying man stirred slightly and moaned in the cold and darkness without an echo he held her for a little while then she pushed away to look into his eyes again dont tell the others of course not if thats what you want please she said in the dimmed glow of their suit lights the down on her face and the hair on her head seemed to shine like a hazy atmosphere round a planet seen from space he hugged her again unsure what to say surprise partly no doubt but in addition there was the fact that this revelation made whatever existed between them that much more important and so he was more anxious than ever not to say the wrong thing not to make a mistake he could not let it mean too much not yet she had paid him perhaps the greatest compliment he had ever had but the very value of it frightened him distracted him he felt that whatever continuity of his name or clan the woman was offering him he could not yet build his hopes upon it the glimmer of that potential succession seemed too weak and somehow also too temptingly defenceless to face the continuous frozen midnight of the tunnels thanks yalson lets get this over with down here then well have a better idea what we want to do but even if you change your mind later thank you it was all he could say they returned to the stations dark cavern just as the drone pulled a light sheet over neisins still form oh there you are it said i didnt see any point in contacting you its voice was hushed there wasnt anything you could have done satisfied aviger asked horza after they had put neisins body with dorolows they stood near the access gantry where yalson had resumed guard duty on the unconscious idiran im sorry about neisin and dorolow horza told the old man i liked them too i can understand you being upset you dont have to stay here now if you want go back to the surface its safe now weve accounted for them all youve accounted for most of us too havent you aviger said bitterly youre no better than kraiklyn shut up aviger yalson said from the gantry youre still alive and you havent done too badly either have you young lady aviger said to her you and your friend here yalson was quiet for a moment then said youre braver than i thought aviger just remember it doesnt bother me a bit youre older and smaller than me you want me to kick your balls in she nodded and pursed her lips still staring at the limp body of the idiran officer lying in front of her ill do it for you old boy balveda came up to aviger and slipped her arm through his starting to lead him away as she walked by aviger she said let me tell you about the time but aviger shrugged her away and went off by himself to sit with his back to the station wall opposite the reactor car horza looked down the platform to where the old man sat hed better watch his radiation meter he said to yalson its pretty hot down there near the reactor car yalson gnawed at another ration bar let the old bastard fry she said xoxarle woke up yalson watched him regain consciousness then waved the gun at him tell the big creep to head on down the ramp will you horza she said xoxarle looked down at horza and struggled awkwardly to his feet dont bother he said in marain i can bark as well as you in this miserable excuse for a language he turned to yalson after you my man i am a female yalson growled and waved the gun down the ramp now get your trefoil ass down there horzas suit ag was finished unahaclosp couldnt have taken xoxarles weight anyway so they would have to walk aviger could float so could wubslin and yalson but balveda and horza would have to take turns riding on the pallet and xoxarle would need to footslog the whole twentyseven kilometres to station seven they left the two human bodies near the doors to the transit tubes where they could collect them later horza threw the useless lump of the minds remote drone to the station floor then blasted it with his laser did that make you feel better aviger said horza looked at the old man floating in his suit ready to head up the tunnel with the rest of them tell you what aviger if you want to do something useful why dont you float up to that access ramp and put a few shots through the head of xoxarles comrade up there just to make sure hes properly dead yes captain aviger said and gave a mock salute he moved through the air to the ramp where the idirans body lay ok horza said to the rest lets go they entered the foot tunnel as aviger landed on the middle level of the access ramp aviger looked down at the idiran the armoured suit was covered with burn marks and holes the creature had one arm and one leg missing there was blood dried black all over the place the idirans head was charred on one side and where he had kicked it earlier aviger could see the cracked keratin just below the left eye socket the eye dead jammed open stared at him it looked loose in its bone hemisphere and some sort of pus had oozed out of it aviger pointed his gun at the head setting the weapon to single shot the first pulse blew the injured eye off the second punched a hole in the creatures face under what might have been its nose a jet of green liquid splashed out of the hole and landed on avigers suit chest he splashed some water from his flask over the mess and let it dribble off filth he muttered to himself shouldering his gun all of it filth look they were less than fifty metres into the tunnel aviger had just entered it and started floating towards them when wubslin shouted they stopped looking into the screen of the mass sensor almost at the centre of the closepacked green lines there was a grey smudge the reactor trace they were used to seeing the sensor being fooled by the nuclear pile in the train behind them right at the very edge of the screen straight ahead and over twentysix kilometres away there was another echo it was no grey patch no false trace it was a harsh bright pinpoint of light like a star on the screen the command system engines a sky like chipped ice a wind to cut you to the body core too cold for snow for most of the journey but once for eleven days and nights it came a blizzard over the field of ice we walked on howling like an animal with a bite like steel the crystals of ice flowed like a single torrent over the hard and frozen land you could not look into it or breathe even trying to stand was near impossible we made a hole shallow and cold and lay in it until the skies cleared we were the walking wounded straggled band some we lost when their blood froze in them one just disappeared at night in a storm of snow some died from their wounds one by one we lost them our comrades and our servants every one begged us make what use we could of their corpse once they were gone we had so little food we all knew what it meant we were all prepared name a sacrifice more total or more noble in that air when you cried the tears froze on your face with a cracking sound like a heart breaking mountains the high passes we climbed to famished in that thin and bitter air the snow was white powder dry as dust to breathe it was to freeze from inside flurries from the jagged slopes dislodged by feet in front stung in the throat like acid spray i saw rainbows in the crystal veils of ice and snow which were the product of our passing and grew to hate those colours that freezing dryness the starved high air and dark blue skies three glaciers we traversed losing two of our comrades in crevasses beyond sight or sound falling further than an echos reach deep in a mountain ring we came to a marsh it lay in that scoop like a cess for hope we were too slow too stupefied to save our querl when he walked out into it and floundered there we thought it could not be with air so cold around us even in that wan sunlight we thought it must be frozen and we saw what only seemed to be and our eyes would clear and he come walking back to us not slip beneath that dark ooze out of reach it was an oil marsh we realised too late after the tarry depths had claimed their toll from us the next day while we were still looking for a way across the chill came harder still and even that sludge locked itself to stillness and we walked quickly to the other side in the midst of frozen water we began to die of thirst we had little to heat the snow with save our own bodies and eating that white dust until it numbed us made us groggy with the cold of it slowing our speech and step but we kept on though the cold sucked at us whether awake or trying to sleep and the harsh sun blinded us in fields of glittering white and filled our eyes with pain the wind cut us snow tried to swallow us mountains like cut black glass blocked us and the stars on clear nights taunted us but on we came near two thousand kilometres little one with only the small amount of food we could carry from the wreck what little equipment had not been turned to junk by the barrier beast and our own determination we were fortyfour when we left the battle cruiser twentyseven when we began our trek across the snows eight of my kind nineteen of the medjel folk two of us completed the journey and six of our servants do you wonder that we fell upon the first place we found with light and heat does it surprise you that we just took and did not ask we had seen brave warriors and faithful servants die of cold watched each other wear away as thought the ice blasts had abraded us we had looked into the cloudless pitiless skies of a dead and alien place and wondered who might be eating who when the dawnlight came we made a joke of it at first but later when we had marched a thirtyday and most of us were dead in ice gullies mountain ravines or raw in our own bellies we did not think it so funny some of the last perhaps not believing our course was true i think died of despair we killed your humans friends these other changers i killed one with my own hands another the first fell to a medjel while he still slept the one in the control room fought bravely and when he knew he was lost destroyed many of the controls i salute him there was another who put up a fight in the place where they stored things he too died well you should not grieve too much for them i shall face my superiors with the truth in my eyes and heart they will not discipline me they will reward me should i ever stand before them horza was behind the idiran walking down the tunnel after him while yalson took a rest from guarding the tall triped horza had asked xoxarle to tell him what had happened to the raiding party which had come to the planet inside the chuyhirtsi animal the idiran had responded with an oration she horza said what human xoxarles voice rumbled down the tunnel he hadnt bothered to turn round when he talked he spoke to the clear air of the foot tunnel leading to station seven his powerful bassy voice easily heard even by wubslin and aviger who were bringing up the rear of the small motley band you did it again horza said wearily talking to the back of the idirans head the one killed while asleep it was a she a woman a female well the medjel attended to her we laid them out in the corridor some of their food proved edible it tasted like heaven to us how long ago was that horza asked about eight days i think it is hard to keep time down here we tried to construct a mass sensor immediately knowing that it would be invaluable but we were unsuccessful all we had was what was undamaged from the changer base most of our own equipment had been attacked by the beast of the barrier or had to be abandoned when we set off from the warp animal to come here or left en route as we died off you must have thought it was a bit of luck finding the mind so easily horza kept his rifle trained on the tall idirans neck watching xoxarle all the time the creature might be injured horza knew enough about the species to tell that the section leader was in pain just from the way he walked but he was still dangerous horza didnt mind him talking though it passed the time we knew it was injured when we found it in station six and it did not move or show any sign of noticing us we assumed that those were only the signs of its damage we already knew that you had arrived it was only a day ago we accepted our good luck without second thoughts and prepared to make our escape you only just stopped us another few hours and we would have had that train working more likely youd have blown yourselves into radioactive dust horza told the idiran think what you like little one i knew what i was doing im sure horza said sceptically why did you take all the guns with you and leave that medjel on the surface without a weapon we had intended to take one of the changers alive and interrogate him but failed our own fault no doubt had we done so we could have reassured ourselves there was nobody else down here ahead of us we were so late in getting here after all we took all the available weaponry down with us and left the servant on the surface with only a communicator so we didnt find the communicator horza interrupted good he was supposed to hide it when not checking in xoxarle said then went on so we had what little firepower we did possess where it might be needed most once we realised that we were in here by ourselves we sent a servant up with a weapon for our guard unhappily for him it would appear he arrived very shortly after you did dont worry horza said he did well damn nearly blew my head off xoxarle laughed horza flinched slightly at the sound it was not only loud it was cruel in a way xoralundras laugh had not been his poor slave soul is at rest then xoxarle boomed his tribe can ask for no more horza refused to pause until they were halfway to station seven they sat in the foot tunnel resting the idiran sat furthest down the tunnel horza across the tunnel from him and roughly six metres away gun ready yalson was by his side horza she said looking at his suit and then at her own i think we could take the ag of my suit it does detach we could rig it up to yours it might look a bit untidy but it would work she looked into his face his eyes shifted from xoxarle for a moment then flicked back im all right he said you keep the ag he nudged her gently with his free arm and lowered his voice youre carrying a bit more weight after all he grunted then rubbed the side of his suit in faked pain when yalson elbowed him hard enough to move him fractionally across the floor of the tunnel ouch he said i wish i hadnt told you now yalson said balveda xoxarle said suddenly turning his huge head slowly to look up the tunnel past horza and yalson over the pallet and the drone unahaclosp past wubslin watching the mass sensor and aviger to where the culture agent sat her eyes closed silent against the wall section leader balveda said opening her calm eyes looking down the tunnel to the idiran the changer says you are from the culture that is the part he has cast you in he would have me believe you are an agent of espionage xoxarle put his head on one side looking down the dark tube of tunnel at the woman sitting against the curved wall you seem like me to be a captive of this man do you tell me you are what he says you are balveda looked at horza then at the idiran her slow gaze lazy almost indolent im afraid so section leader she said the idiran moved his head from side to side blinked his eyes then rumbled most strange i cannot imagine why you should all be trying to trick me or why this one man should have such a hold over all of you yet his own story i find scarcely credible if he really is on our side then i have behaved in a way which may hinder the great cause and perhaps even aid yours woman if you are who you say most strange keep thinking about it balveda drawled then closed her eyes and put her head back against the tunnel wall again horzas on his own side not anybody elses aviger said from further up the tunnel he was speaking to the idiran but his gaze shifted to horza at the end of his sentence and he dropped his head looking down at a container of food at his side and picking a last few crumbs from it that is the way with all of your kind xoxarle said to the old man who wasnt looking it is how you are made you must all strive to claw your way over the backs of your fellow humans during the short time you are permitted in the universe breeding when you can so that the strongest strains survive and the weakest die i would no more blame you for that than i would try to convert some nonsentient carnivore to vegetarianism you are all on your own side with us it is different xoxarle looked at horza you must agree with that changer ally youre different all right horza said but all i care about is youre fighting the culture you may be gods gift or plague in the end result but what matters to me is that at the moment youre against her lot horza nodded at balveda who didnt open her eyes but did smile what a pragmatic attitude xoxarle said horza wondered if the others could hear the trace of humour in the giants voice whatever did the culture do to you to make you hate it so nothing to me horza said i just disagree with them my xoxarle said you humans never cease to surprise me he hunched suddenly and a crackling booming noise like rocks being crushed came from his mouth his great body shuddered xoxarle turned his head away and spat onto the tunnel floor he kept his head turned away while the humans looked at each other wondering how badly injured the idiran really was xoxarle became silent he leaned over and looked at whatever he had spat up made a distant echoing sort of noise in his throat then turned back to horza his voice was scratchy and hoarse when he spoke again yes mr changer you are a strange fellow allow a little too much dissention in your ranks mind you xoxarle looked up the tunnel to aviger who raised his head and glanced at the idiran with a frightened expression i get by horza told the section leader he got to his feet looking round the others and stretching his tired legs time to go he turned to xoxarle are you fit to walk untie me and i could run too fast for you to escape human xoxarle purred he unfolded his huge frame from its squatting position horza looked up into the dark broad v of the creatures face and nodded slowly just think about staying alive so i can take you back to the fleet xoxarle horza said the chasing and fighting are over were all looking for the mind now a poor hunt human xoxarle said an ignominious end to the whole endeavour you make me ashamed for you but then you are only human oh shut up and start walking yalson told the idiran she stabbed at buttons on her suit control unit and floated into the air level with xoxarles head the idiran snorted and turned he started to hobble off down the foot tunnel one by one they followed him horza noticed the idiran starting to tire after a few kilometres the giants steps became shorter he moved the great keratinous plates of his shoulders more and more frequently as though trying to relieve some ache within and every so often his head shook as if he was trying to clear it twice he turned and spat at the walls horza looked at the dripping patches of fluid idiran blood eventually xoxarle stumbled his steps veering to one side horza was walking behind him again having had a spell on the pallet he slowed down when he saw the idiran start to sway holding one hand up to let the others know as well xoxarle made a low moaning noise half turned then with a sideways stagger the wires on his hobbled feet snapping tight and humming like strings on an instrument he fell forward crashing to the floor and lying still oh somebody said stay back horza said then went carefully towards the long inert body of the idiran he looked down at the great head motionless on the tunnel floor blood oozed from under it forming a pool yalson joined horza her gun trained on the fallen creature is he dead she asked horza shrugged he knelt down and touched the idirans body with his bare hand at a point near the neck where it was sometimes possible to sense the steady flow of blood inside but there was nothing he closed then opened one of the section leaders eyes i dont think so he touched the dark blood gathering in its pool looks like hes bleeding badly inside what can we do yalson said not a lot horza rubbed his chin thoughtfully what about some anticoagulant aviger said from the far side of the pallet where balveda sat and watched the scene in front of her with dark calm eyes ours doesnt work on them horza said skinspray balveda said they all looked at her she nodded looking at horza if you have any medical alcohol and some skinspray make up an equal solution if hes got digestive tract injuries that might help him if its respiratory hes dead balveda shrugged at horza well lets do something rather than stand around here all day yalson said its worth a try horza said better get him upright if we want to pour the stuff down his throat that the drone said wearily from beneath the pallet no doubt means me it floated forward placing the pallet on the floor near xoxarles feet balveda stepped off as the drone transferred the load from its back to the tunnel floor it floated to where yalson and horza stood by the prone idiran ill lift with the drone horza told yalson putting his gun down you keep your gun on him wubslin now kneeling on the tunnel floor and fiddling with the controls of the mass sensor whistled quietly to himself balveda went round the back of the pallet to watch there it is wubslin smiled at her nodding at the bright white dot on the greenlined screen isnt that a beauty station seven you reckon wubslin balveda hunched her slim shoulders and shoved her hands deep into her jacket pockets she wrinkled her nose as she watched the screen she could smell herself they were all smelling all giving off animal scents after their time down there without washing wubslin was nodding must be he said to the culture agent horza and the drone struggled to get the slacklimbed idiran into a sitting position aviger went forward to help taking off his helmet as he went must be wubslin breathed more to himself than to balveda his gun fell off his shoulder and he took it off frowning at the jammed reel which was supposed to take up the slack on the weapons strap he placed the weapon on the pallet and went back to tinkering with the mass sensor balveda edged closer peering over the engineers shoulder wubslin looked round and up at her as horza and the drone unahaclosp slowly heaved xoxarle from the floor wubslin smiled awkwardly at the culture agent and moved the laser rifle he had placed on the pallet further away from balveda balveda gave a small smile in return and took a step backwards she took her hands out of her pockets and folded her arms watching wubslin work from a little further away heavy bastard horza gasped as he aviger and unahaclosp finally pulled and pushed xoxarles back against the side of the tunnel the massive head was angled limply forward over his chest liquid drooled from the side of his huge mouth horza and aviger straightened aviger stretched his arms grunting xoxarle seemed dead for a second maybe two then it was as though some immense force blasted him away from the wall he threw himself forward and sideways one arm whacking into horzas chest and sending the changer cannoning into yalson at the same time his partly buckled legs flicking straight the idiran pounced away from the group forward of the pallet past aviger thrown against the tunnel wall and unahaclosp slapped into the floor of the tunnel with xoxarles other hand towards the pallet xoxarle flew over the pallet his raised arm and massive fist coming down wubslins hand hadnt even started to move for his gun the idiran brought his fist down with all his strength shattering the mass sensor with a single crushing blow his other hand flashed out to snatch the laser wubslin threw himself back instinctively knocking into balveda xoxarles hand snapped shut round the laser rifle like a sprung trap round an animals leg he rolled through the air and over the disintegrating wreckage of the sensor the gun twirled in his hand pointing back down the tunnel to where horza yalson and aviger were still trying to recover their balance and unahaclosp was just starting to move xoxarle steadied briefly and aimed straight at horza unahaclosp slammed into the idirans lower jaw like a small badly streamlined missile lifting the section leader bodily from the pallet stretching his neck on his shoulders jerking all three of his legs together and throwing his arms out to each side xoxarle landed with a thud beside wubslin and lay still horza stooped and grabbed his gun yalson ducked and swivelled bringing her gun to bear wubslin sat up balveda had staggered back after wubslin had fallen against her a hand at her mouth she stood now staring down at where unahaclosp hovered in the air over xoxarles face aviger rubbed his head and looked resentfully at the wall horza went over to the idiran xoxarles eyes were closed wubslin tore his rifle from the idirans slack fist not bad drone horza said nodding the machine turned to him unahaclosp it said exasperatedly ok he sighed well done unahaclosp horza went to look at xoxarles wrists the wires had been snapped the wires on his legs were intact but those on his arms had been broken like threads i didnt kill him did i unahaclosp said horza the barrel of his rifle hard against xoxarles head shook his head xoxarles body started to tremble his eyes flicked open no im not dead little friends the idiran rumbled and the cracking scraping noise of his laughter echoed through the tunnels he levered his torso slowly from the ground horza kicked him in the side you little one xoxarle laughed before horza could say any more is this how you treat your allies he rubbed his jaw moving fractured plates of keratin i am injured the great voice announced then broke with laughter again the big v head rocking forward towards the wreckage lying on the back of the pallet but not yet in the same state as your precious mass sensor horza rammed his gun against the idirans head i ought you ought to blow my head off right now i know changer i have told you already you should why dont you horza tightened his finger round the trigger holding his breath then roared shouted without words or sense at the seated figure in front of him and strode off past the pallet tie that motherfucker up he bellowed and stamped by yalson who pivoted briefly to watch him go then she turned back with a small shake of her head to watch while aviger helped by wubslin who cast the occasional mournful look at the debris from the mass sensor trussed the idirans arms down tightly to his sides with several loops of wire xoxarle was still shaking with laughter i think it sensed my mass i think it sensed my fist ha i hope somebody told that threelegged scumbag we still have a mass sensor in my suit horza said when yalson caught up with him yalson looked over her shoulder then said well i told him but i dont think he believed me she looked at horza is it working horza glanced at the small repeater screen on his wrist controls not at this range but it will when we get closer well still find the thing dont worry im not worried yalson said you going to come back and join us she looked back at the others again they were twenty metres behind xoxarle still chording now and again was in front with wubslin walking behind guarding the idiran with the stun gun balveda sat on the pallet with aviger floating behind horza nodded i suppose so lets wait here he halted yalson who had been walking rather than floating stopped too they leant against the tunnel wall as xoxarle came closer how are you anyway horza asked the woman yalson shrugged fine how are you i meant horza began i know what you meant yalson said and i told you im fine now stop being such a pain in the ass she smiled at him ok ok horza said pointing the gun at xoxarle as the idiran went past lost your way changer the giant rumbled just keep walking horza told him he fell into step alongside wubslin sorry i put my gun down on the pallet the engineer said it was stupid never mind horza told him it was the sensor he was after the gun must just have been a pleasant surprise anyway the drone saved us horza gave a kind of snort through his nose like a laugh the drone saved us he repeated to himself and shook his head ah my soul my soul all is darkness now now i die now i slip away and nothing will be left i am frightened great one pity me but i am frightened no sleep of victory i heard merely my death darkness and death moment for all to become one instance of annihilation i have failed i heard and now i know failed death too good for me oblivion like release more than i deserve much more i cannot let go i must hold on because i do not deserve a quick willed end my comrades wait but they do not know how much i have failed i am not worthy to join them my clan must weep ah this pain darkness and pain they came to the station the command system train towered over the platform its dark length glistening in the lights of the small band of people entering the station well here we are at last unahaclosp said it stopped and let balveda slide off the pallet then put the slab with its supplies and material down on the dusty floor horza ordered the idiran to stand against the nearest access gantry and tied him against it well xoxarle said as horza strapped him to the metal what of your mind little one he looked down like a reproachful adult at the human wrapping the wire round his body where is it i dont see it patience section leader horza said he secured the wire and tested it then stepped back comfortable he asked my guts ache my chin is broken and my hand has pieces of your mass sensor embedded in it xoxarle said also my mouth is a little sore inside where i bit it earlier to produce all that convincing blood otherwise i am well thank you ally xoxarle bowed his head as much as he was able dont go away now horza smiled thinly he left yalson to guard xoxarle and balveda while he and wubslin went to the powerswitching room im hungry aviger said he sat on the pallet and opened a ration bar inside the switching room horza studied the meters switches and levers for a few moments then started to adjust the controls i uh wubslin began scratching his brow through the open visor of his helmet i was wondering about the mass sensor in your suit is it working lights came on in one control group a bank of twenty dials glowing faintly horza studied the dials and then said no i already checked its getting a low reading from the train but nothing else its been that way since about two kilometres back up the tunnel either the minds gone since the ship sensor was smashed or this one in my suit isnt working properly oh shit wubslin sighed what the hell horza said flicking some switches and watching more meters light up lets get the power on maybe well think of something yes wubslin nodded he glanced back out through the open doors of the room as if to see whether the lights were coming on yet all he saw was the dark shape of yalsons back out on the dim platform a section of shadowy train three storeys high showed beyond horza went to another wall and repositioned some levers he tapped a couple of dials peered into a bright screen then rubbed his hands together and put his thumb over a button on the central console well this is it he said he brought his thumb down on the button yes heyhey we did it about time too if you ask me hmm little one so thats how its done shit if id known it was this colour i wouldnt have started it horza heard the others he took a deep breath and turned to look at wubslin the stocky engineer stood blinking slightly in the bright lights of the power control room he smiled great he said he looked round the room still nodding great at last well done horza yalson said horza could hear other switches bigger ones automatics linked to the master switch he had closed moving in the space beneath his feet humming noises filled the room and the smell of burning dust rose like the warm scent of an awakening animal all around him light flooded in from the station outside horza and wubslin checked a few meters and monitors then went outside the station was bright it sparkled the greyblack walls reflected the strip lights and glow panels which covered the roof the command system train now seen properly for the first time filled the station from end to end a shining metal monster like a vast android version of a segmented insect yalson took off her helmet ran her fingers through her shortcropped hair and looked up and around squinting in the bright yellowwhite light falling from the station roof high above now then unahaclosp said floating over towards horza the machines casing glittered in the harsh new light where exactly is this device were looking for it came close to horzas face does your suit sensor register it is it here have we found it horza pushed the machine away with one hand give me time drone we only just got here i got the power on didnt i he walked past it followed by yalson still looking about her and wubslin also staring though mostly at the gleaming train lights shone inside it the station filled with the hum of idling motors the hiss of air circulators and fans unahaclosp floated round to face horza reversing through the air while keeping level with the mans face what do you mean surely all you have to do is look at the screen can you see the mind on there or not the drone came closer dipping down to look at the controls and the small screen on horzas suit cuff he swatted it away im getting some interference from the reactor horza glanced at wubslin well cope with it take a look round the repair area check the place out yalson said to the machine make yourself useful it isnt working is it unahaclosp said it kept pace with horza still facing him and backing through the air in front of him that threelegged lunatic smashed the mass sensor on the pallet and now were blind were back to square one arent we no horza said impatiently we are not well repair it now how about doing something useful for a change for a change unahaclosp said with what sounded like feeling for a change youre forgetting who it was saved all your skins back in the tunnels when our cute little idiran liaison officer over there started running amuck all right drone horza said through clenched teeth ive said thank you now why dont you take a look around the station just in case theres anything to be seen like minds you cant spot on wasted suit mass sensors for example and what are you lot going to be doing while im doing that resting horza said and thinking he stopped at xoxarle and inspected the idirans bonds oh great unahaclosp sneered and a lot of good all your thinking has done for fucks sake unahaclosp yalson said sighing heavily either go or stay but shut up i see right unahaclosp drew away from them and rose in the air ill just go and lose myself then i should have it was floating away as it spoke horza shouted over the drones voice before you go can you hear any alarms what unahaclosp came to a halt wubslin put a pained studious expression on his face and looked around the stations bright walls as though making an effort to hear above the frequencies his ears could sense unahaclosp was silent for a moment then said no no alarms im going now ill check out the other train when i think you might be in a more amenable mood ill come back it turned and sped off dorolow could have heard the alarms aviger muttered but nobody heard wubslin looked up at the train gleaming in the station lights and like it seemed to glow from within what is this is it light do i imagine it am i dying is this what happens am i dying now so soon i thought i had a while left and i dont deserve light it is light i can see again welded to the cold metal by his own dry blood his body cracked and twisted mutilated and dying he opened his one good eye as far as he could mucus had dried on it and he had to blink trying to clear it his body was a dark and alien land of pain a continent of torment one eye left one arm a leg missing just lopped off one numb and paralysed another broken he tested to make sure trying to move that limb a pain like fire flashed through him like a lightning flash over the shadowed country that was his body and his pain and my face my face he felt like a smashed insect abandoned by some children after an afternoons cruel play they had thought he was dead but he was not built the way they were a few holes were nothing an amputated limb well his blood did not gush like theirs when a leg or arm was removed he remembered a recording of a human dissection and for the warrior there was no shock not like their poor soft fleshflabby systems he had been shot in the face but the beam or bullet had not penetrated through the internal keratin brain cover or severed his nerves similarly his eyes had been smashed but the other side of his face was intact and he could still see it was so bright his sight cleared and he looked without moving at the station roof he could feel himself dying slowly an internal knowledge which again they might not have had he could feel the slow leak of his blood inside his body sense the pressure buildup in his torso and the faint oozing through cracks in his keratin the remains of the suit would help him but not save him he could feel his internal organs slowly shutting down too many holes from one system to another his stomach would never digest his last meal and his anterior lungsack which normally held a reserve of hyperoxygenated blood for use when his body needed its last reserves of strength was emptying its precious fuel being squandered in the losing battle his body fought against the falling pressure of his blood dying i am dying what difference whether it is in darkness or in light great one fallen comrades children and mate can you see me any better in this deeply buried alien glare my name is quayanorl great one and the idea was brighter than the pain when hed tried to move his shattered leg brighter than the stations silent staring glow they had said they were going to station seven it was the last thing he remembered apart from the sight of one of them floating through the air towards him that one must have shot him in the face he couldnt remember it happening but it made sense sent to make sure he was dead but he was alive and he had just had an idea it was a long shot even if he could get it to work even if he could shift himself even if it all worked a long shot in every sense but it would be doing something it would be a suitable end for a warrior whatever happened the pain would be worth it he moved quickly before he could change his mind knowing that there might be little time if he wasnt already too late the pain seared through him like a sword from his broken bloody mouth a shout came nobody heard his shout echoed in the bright station then there was silence his body throbbed with the aftershock of pain but he could feel that he was free the bloodweld was broken he could move in the light he could move xoxarle if you are still alive i may soon have a little surprise for our friends drone what horza wants to know what youre doing yalson spoke into her helmet communicator looking at the changer im searching this train the one in the repair section i would have said if id found anything you know have you got that suit sensor working yet horza made a face at the helmet yalson held on her knees he reached over and switched off the communicator its right though isnt it aviger said sitting on the pallet that one in your suit isnt working is it theres some interference from the trains reactor horza told the old man thats all we can deal with it aviger didnt look convinced horza opened a drink canister he felt tired drained there was a sense of anticlimax now having got the power on but not found the mind he cursed the broken mass sensor and xoxarle and the mind he didnt know where the damn thing was but hed find it right now though he just wanted to sit and relax he needed to give his thoughts time to collect he rubbed his head where it had been bruised in the firefight in station six it hurt distantly naggingly inside nothing serious but it would have been distracting if he hadnt been able to shut the pain off dont you think we should search this train now wubslin said gazing up hungrily at the shining curved bulk of it in front of them horza smiled at the engineers rapt expression yes why not he said on you go take a look he nodded at the grinning wubslin who swallowed a last mouthful of food and grabbed his helmet right yeah might as well start now he said and walked off quickly past the motionless figure of xoxarle up the access ramp and into the train balveda was standing with her back against the wall her hands in her pockets she smiled at wubslins retreating back as he disappeared into the trains interior are you going to let him drive that thing horza she asked somebody may have to horza said well need some sort of transport to take us round if were going to look for the mind what fun balveda said we could all just go riding round in circles for ever and ever not me aviger said turning from horza to look at the culture agent im going back to the cat im not going round looking for this damn computer good idea yalson said looking at the old man we could make you a sort of prisoner detail send you back with xoxarle just the two of you ill go alone aviger said in a low voice avoiding yalsons gaze im not afraid xoxarle listened to them talk such squeaky scratchy voices he tested his bonds again the wire had cut a couple of millimetres into his keratin on his shoulders thighs and wrists it hurt a little but it would be worthwhile maybe he was quietly cutting himself on the wire rubbing with all the force he could muster against the places where the wire held him tightest chafing the naillike cover of his body deliberately he had taken a deep breath and flexed all the muscles he could when he was tied up and that had given him just enough room to move but he would need a little more if he was to have any chance of working his way loose he had no plan no time scale he had no idea when he might have an opportunity but what else could he do stand there like a stuffed dummy like a good boy while these squirming softbodied worms scratched their pulpy skin and tried to work out where the mind was a warrior could do no such thing he had come too far seen too many die hey wubslin opened a small window on the top storey of the train and leaned out shouting to the others these elevators work i just came up in one everything works yeah yalson waved great wubslin the engineer ducked back inside he moved through the train testing and touching inspecting controls and machinery quite impressive though isnt it balveda said to the others for its time horza nodded gazing slowly from one end of the train to the other he finished the drink in the container and put it down on the pallet as he stood up yes it is but much good it did them quayanorl dragged himself up the ramp a pall of smoke hung in the station air hardly shifting in the slow circulation of air fans were working in the train though and what movement there was in the greyblue cloud came mostly from the places where open doors and windows blew the acrid mist out from the carriages replacing it with air scrubbed by the trains conditioning and filter system he dragged himself through wreckage bits and pieces of wall and train even scraps and shards from his own suit it was very hard and slow and he was already afraid he would die before he even got to the train his legs were useless he would probably be doing better if the other two had been blown off as well he crawled with his one good arm grasping the edge of the ramp and pulling with all his might the effort was agonisingly painful every time he pulled he thought it would grow less but it didnt it was as though for each of the too long seconds he hauled at that ramp edge and his broken bleeding body scraped further up the littered surface his blood vessels ran with acid he shook his head and mumbled to himself he felt blood run from the cracks in his body which had healed while he lay still and now were being ripped open again he felt tears run from his one good eye he sensed the slow weep of healing fluid welling where his other eye had been torn from his face the door ahead of him shone through the bright mist a faint air current coming from it making curls in the smoke his feet scraped behind him and his suit chest ploughed a small bow wave of wreckage from the surface of the ramp as he moved he gripped the ramps edge again and pulled he tried not to call out not because he thought there was anyone to hear and be warned but because all his life from when he had first got to his feet by himself he had been taught to suffer in silence he did try he could remember his nestquerl and his motherparent teaching him not to cry out and it was shaming to disobey them but sometimes it got too much sometimes the pain squeezed the noise from him on the station roof some of the lights were out hit by stray shots he could see the holes and punctures in the trains shining hull and he had no idea what damage might have been done to it but he couldnt stop now he had to go on he could hear the train he could listen to it like a hunter listening to a wild animal the train was alive injured some of its whirring motors sounded damaged but it was alive he was dying but he would do his best to capture the beast what do you think horza asked wubslin he had tracked the engineer down under one of the command system train carriages hanging upside down looking at the wheel motors horza had asked wubslin to take a look at the small device on his suit chest which was the main body of the mass sensor i dont know wubslin said shaking his head he had his helmet on and visor down using the screen to magnify the view of the sensor its so small id need to take it back to the cat to have a proper look at it i didnt bring all my tools with me he made a tutting noise it looks all right i cant see any obvious damage maybe the reactors are putting it off damn well have to search then horza said he let wubslin close the small inspection panel on the suit front the engineer leant back and shoved his visor up only trouble is he said glumly if the reactors are interfering there isnt much point in taking the train to look for the mind well have to use the transit tube well search the station first horza said he stood up through the window across the station platform he could see yalson standing watching balveda as the culture woman paced slowly up and down the smooth rock floor aviger still sat on the pallet xoxarle stood strapped to the girders of the access ways ok if i go up to the control deck wubslin said horza looked into the engineers broad open face yeah why not dont try to get it to move just yet though ok wubslin said looking happy changer said xoxarle as horza walked down the access ramp what these wires they are too tight they are cutting into me horza looked carefully at the wires round the idirans arms too bad he said they cut into my shoulders my legs and my wrists if the pressure goes on they will cut through to my blood vessels i should hate to die in such an inelegant manner by all means blow my head off but this slow slicing is undignified i only tell you because i am starting to believe you do intend to take me back to the fleet horza went behind the idiran to look at where the wires crossed over xoxarles wrists he was telling the truth the wires had cut into him like fence wire into tree bark the changer frowned ive never seen that happen he said to the motionless rear of the idirans head what are you up to your skins harder than that i am up to nothing human xoxarle said wearily sighing heavily my body is injured it tries to rebuild itself of necessity it becomes more pliable less hardy as it tries to rebuild the damaged parts oh if you dont believe me never mind but dont forget that i did warn you ill think about it horza said if it gets too bad shout out he stepped out through the girders back onto the station floor and walked towards the others i shall have to think about that xoxarle said quietly warriors are not given to shouting out because they are in pain so yalson said to the changer is wubslin happy worried he wont get to drive the train horza told her whats the drone doing taking its time looking through the other train well well leave it there horza said you and i can search the station aviger he looked at the old man who was using a small piece of plastic to prise bits of food from between his teeth what aviger said looking up suspiciously at the changer watch the idiran were going to take a look around the station aviger shrugged all right i suppose so not too many places i can go for the moment he inspected the end of the piece of plastic he reached out took hold of the end of the ramp and pulled he moved forward on a wave of pain he gripped the edge of the train door and hauled again he slid and scraped from the ramp and onto the interior floor of the train itself when he was fully inside he rested blood made a steady roar inside his head his hand was becoming tired now and sore it was not the aching grinding pain from his wounds but it worried him more he was afraid that his hand would soon seize up that it would grow too weak to grip and he would be unable to haul himself along at least now the way was level he had a carriage and a half to drag himself but there was no slope he tried to look back behind and down to the place he had lain but could manage only a brief glimpse before he had to let his head fall back there was a scraped and bloody trail on the ramp as though a broom laced with purple paint had been dragged through the dust and debris of the metal surface there was no point in looking back his only way was forward he had only a little while left in a half hour or less he would be dead he would have had longer just lying on the ramp but moving had shortened his life quickened the sapping forces steadily draining him of strength and vitality he hauled himself towards the longitudinal corridor his two useless shattered legs slithered after him on a thin slick of blood changer horza frowned he and yalson were setting out to look over the station the idiran called horza when he was only a few steps away from the pallet where aviger now sat looking fed up and pointing his gun in roughly the same direction as balveda while the culture agent continued pacing up and down yes xoxarle horza said these wires they will slice me up soon i only mention it because you have so studiously avoided destroying me so far it would be a pity to die accidentally due to an oversight please go on your way if you cannot be bothered you want the wires loosened the merest fraction they have no give in them you see and it would be nice to breathe without dissecting myself if you try anything this time horza told the idiran coming close to him gun pointed at his face ill blow both your arms and all three legs off and slide you home on the pallet your threatened cruelty has convinced me human you obviously know the shame we attach to prosthetics even if they are the result of battle wounds i shall behave just loosen the wires a little like a good ally horza loosened the wires slightly where they were cutting into xoxarles body the section leader flexed and made a loud sighing sound with his mouth much better little one much better now i shall live to face whatever retribution you may imagine is mine depend on it horza said if he breathes belligerently he told aviger shoot his legs off oh yes sir aviger said saluting hoping to trip over the mind horza balveda asked him she had stopped pacing and stood facing him and yalson her hands in her pockets one never knows balveda horza said tomb robber balveda said through a lazy smile horza turned to yalson tell wubslin were leaving ask him to keep an eye on the platform make sure aviger doesnt fall asleep yalson raised wubslin on the communicator youd better come with us horza told balveda i dont like leaving you here with all this equipment switched on oh horza balveda smiled dont you trust me just walk in front and shut up horza said in a tired voice and pointed to indicate the direction he wanted to go in balveda shrugged and started walking does she have to come yalson said as she fell into step beside horza we could always lock her up horza said he looked at yalson who shrugged oh what the hell she said unahaclosp floated through the train outside it could see the repair and maintenance cavern all its machinery lathes and forges welding rigs articulated arms spare units huge hanging cradles a single suspended gantry like a narrow bridge glinting in the bright overhead lights the train was interesting enough the old technology provided things to look at and bits and pieces to touch and investigate but unahaclosp was mostly just glad to be by itself for a while it had found the company of the humans wearing after a few days and the changers attitude distressed it most of all the man was a speciesist me just a machine thought unahaclosp how dare he it had felt good when it had been able to react first in the tunnels perhaps saving some of the others perhaps even saving that ungrateful changer by knocking xoxarle out much as it disliked admitting it the drone had felt proud when horza had thanked it but it hadnt really altered the mans view he would probably forget what had happened or try to tell himself it was just a momentary aberration by a confused machine a freak only unahaclosp knew what it felt only it knew why it had risked injury to protect the humans or it should know it told itself ruefully maybe it shouldnt have bothered maybe it should just have let the idiran shoot them it just hadnt seemed like the right thing to do at the time mug unahaclosp told itself it drifted through the bright humming spaces of the train like a detached part of the mechanism itself wubslin scratched his head he had stopped at the reactor car on his way to the control deck some of the reactor carriage doors wouldnt open they had to be on some sort of security lock probably controlled from the bridge or flight deck or footplate or whatever they called the bit at the nose the train was controlled from he looked out of a window remembering what horza had ordered aviger sat on the pallet his gun pointing at the idiran who stood stock still against the girders wubslin looked away tested the door through to the reactor area again then shook his head the hand the arm was weakening above him rows of seats faced blank screens he pulled himself along by the stems of the chairs he was almost at the corridor which led through to the front car he wasnt sure how he would get through the corridor what was there to hold onto no point in worrying about it now he grabbed at another chair stem hauled at it from the terrace which looked over the repair area they could see the front train the one the drone was in poised over the sunken floor of the maintenance area the glittering length of the train nestling in the scooped halftunnel which ran along the far wall looked like a long thin spaceship and the dark rock around it like starless space yalson watched the culture agents back frowning shes too damn docile horza she said just loud enough for the man to hear thats fine by me horza said the more docile the better yalson shook her head slightly not taking her eyes off the woman in front no shes stringing us along she hasnt cared up till now shes known she can afford to let things happen shes got another card she can play and shes just relaxing until she has to use it youre imagining things horza told her your hormones are getting the better of you developing suspicions and second sight she looked at him transferring the frown from balveda to the changer her eyes narrowed what horza held up his free hand a joke he smiled yalson looked unconvinced shes up to something i can tell she said she nodded to herself i can feel it quayanorl dragged himself through the connecting corridor he pushed open the door to the carriage crawled slowly across the floor he was starting to forget why he was doing this he knew he had to press on go forward keep crawling but he could no longer recall exactly what it was all for the train was a torture maze designed to pain him i am dragging myself to my death somehow even when i get to the end where i can crawl no more i keep going i remember thinking that earlier but what was i thinking of do i die when i get to the trains control area and continue my journey on the other side in death is that what i was thinking of i am like a tiny child crawling over the floor come to me little fellow says the train we were looking for something but i cant recall exactly what it they looked through the great cavern searching then climbed steps to the gallery giving access to the stations accommodation and storage sections balveda stood at the edge of the broad terrace which ran round the cavern midway between floor and roof yalson watched the culture agent while horza opened the doors to the accommodation section balveda looked out over the broad cavern slender hands resting on the guard rail the topmost rail was level with balvedas shoulders waist level on the people who had built the command system near where balveda stood a long gantry led out over the cavern suspended on wires from the roof and leading to the terrace on the other side where a narrow brightly lit tunnel led into the rock balveda looked down the length of the narrow gantry at the distant tunnel mouth yalson wondered if the culture woman was thinking of making a run for it but knew she wasnt and wondered then whether perhaps she only wanted balveda to try so she could shoot her just to be rid of her balveda looked away from the narrow gantry and horza swung open the doors to the accommodation section xoxarle flexed his shoulders the wires moved a little sliding and bunching the human they had left to guard him looked tired perhaps even sleepy but xoxarle couldnt believe the others would stay away for very long he couldnt afford to do too much now in case the changer came back and noticed how the wires had moved anyway though it was far from being the most interesting way things could fall there was apparently a good chance that the humans would be unable to find the supposedly sentient computing device they were all looking for in that case perhaps the best course of action would be no action he would let the little ones take him back to their ship probably the one called horza intended to ransom him this had struck xoxarle as the most likely explanation for being kept alive the fleet might pay for the return of a warrior though xoxarles family were officially barred from doing so and anyway were not rich he could not decide whether he wanted to live and perhaps redeem the shame of being caught and paid for by future exploits or to do all he could either to escape or to die action appealed to him most it was the warriors creed when in doubt do the old human got up from the pallet and walked around he came close enough to xoxarle to be able to inspect the wires but gave them only a perfunctory glance xoxarle looked at the laser gun the human carried his great hands tied together behind his back opened and closed slowly without him thinking about it wubslin came to the control deck in the nose of the train he took his helmet off and put it on the console he made sure it wasnt touching any controls just covering a few small unlit panels he stood in the middle of the deck looking round with wide fascinated eyes the train hummed under his feet dials and meters screens and panels indicated the trains readiness he cast his eyes over the controls set in front of two huge seats which faced over the front console towards the armoured glass which formed part of the trains steeply sloping nose the tunnel in front was dark only a few small lights burning on its side walls fifty metres in front a complex assembly of points led the tracks into two tunnels one route went dead ahead where wubslin could see the rear of the train in front the other tunnel curved avoiding the repair and maintenance cavern and giving a through route to the next station wubslin touched the glass stretching his arm out over the control console to feel the cold smooth surface he grinned to himself glass not a viewscreen he preferred that the designers had had holographic screens and superconductors and magnetic levitation they had used all of them in the transit tubes but for their main work they had not been ashamed to stick to the apparently cruder but more damagetolerant technology so the train had armoured glass and it ran on metal tracks wubslin rubbed his hands together slowly and gazed round the many instruments and controls nice he breathed he wondered if he could work out which controls opened the locked doors in the reactor car quayanorl reached the control deck it was undamaged from floor level the deck was metal seat stems overhanging control panels and bright ceiling lights he hauled himself over the floor racked with pain muttering to himself trying to remember why he had come all this way he rested his face on the cold floor of the deck the train hummed at him vibrating beneath his face it was still alive it was damaged and like him it would never get any better but it was still alive he had intended to do something he knew that but it was all slipping away from him now he wanted to cry with the frustration of it all but it was as though he had no energy left even for tears what was it he asked himself while the train hummed i was i was what unahaclosp looked through the reactor car much of it was inaccessible at first but the drone found a way into it eventually through a cable run it wandered about the long carriage noting how the system worked the dropped absorber baffles preventing the pile from heating up the wasted uranium shielding designed to protect the fragile humanoids bodies the heatexchange pipes which took the reactors heat to the batteries of small boilers where steam turned generators to produce the power which turned the trains wheels all very crude unahaclosp thought complicated and crude at the same time so much to go wrong even with all their safety systems at least if it and the humans did have to move around in these archaic nuclearsteamelectric locomotives they would be using the power from the main system the drone found itself agreeing with the changer the idirans must have been mad to try to get all this ancient junk working they slept in those things yalson looked at the suspended nets horza balveda and she stood at the end door of a large cavern which had been a dormitory for the longdead people who had worked in the command system balveda tested one of the nets they were like open hammocks strung between sets of poles which hung from the ceiling perhaps a hundred of them filled the room like fishing nets hung out to dry they must have found them comfortable i guess horza said he looked round there was nowhere the mind could have hidden lets go he said balveda come on balveda left one of the netbeds swinging gently and wondered if there were any working baths or showers in the place he reached up to the console he pulled with all his strength and got his head onto the seat he used his neck muscles as well as his aching feeble arm to lever himself up he pushed round and swivelled his torso he gasped as one of his legs caught on the underside of the seat and he almost fell back at last though he was in the seat he looked out over the massed controls through the armoured glass and into the broad tunnel beyond the trains sloped nose lights edged the black walls steel rails snaked glittering into the distance quayanorl gazed into that still and silent space and experienced a small grim feeling of victory he had just remembered why hed crawled there is that it yalson said they were in the control room where the station complexs own functions were monitored horza had turned on a few screens checking figures and now sat at a console using the stations remotecontrol cameras to take a final look at the corridors and rooms the tunnels and shafts and caverns balveda was perched on another huge seat swinging her legs looking like a child in an adults chair thats it horza said the station checks out unless its on one of the trains the mind isnt here he switched to cameras in the other stations flicking through in ascending order he paused at station five looking down from the cavern roof at the bodies of the four medjel and the wreckage of the minds crude gun carrier then tried the roof camera in station six they havent found me yet i cant hear them properly all i can hear is their tiny footsteps i know theyre here but i cant tell what theyre doing am i fooling them i detected a mass sensor but its signal vanished there is another they have it here with them but it cant be working properly maybe fooled as i hoped the train saving me how ironic they may have captured an idiran i heard another rhythm in their step all walking or some with ag how did they get in here could they be the changers from the surface i would give half my memory capacity for another remote drone im hidden but im trapped i cant see and i cant hear properly all i can do is feel i hate it i wish i knew what is going on quayanorl stared at the controls in front of him they had worked out a lot of their functions earlier before the humans had arrived he had to try to remember it all now what did he have to do first he reached forward rocking unsteadily on the alienshaped seat he flicked a set of switches lights blinked he heard clicks it was so hard to remember he touched levers and switches and buttons meters and dials moved to new readings screens flickered figures began blinking on the readouts small high noises bleeped and squeaked he thought he was doing the right things but couldnt be sure some of the controls were too far away and he had to drag himself halfway on top of the console being careful not to alter any of the controls he had already set to reach them then shove himself back into the seat again the train was whirring now he could feel it stir motors turned air hissed speakers bleeped and clicked he was getting somewhere the train wasnt moving but he was slowly bringing it closer to the moment when it might his sight was fading though he blinked and shook his head but his eye was giving out the view was going grey before him he had to stare at the controls and the screens the lights on the tunnel wall in front retreating into the black distance seemed to be dimming he could have believed that the power was failing but he knew it wasnt his head was hurting deep inside probably it was sitting that was causing it the blood draining he was dying quickly enough anyway but now there was even more urgency he hit the buttons moved some levers the train should have moved flexed but it stayed motionless what else was there left to do he turned to his blind side light panels flashed of course the doors he hit the appropriate sections of the console and heard rumbling sliding noises and most of the panels stopped flashing not all though some of the doors must have been jammed another control overrode their failsafes the remaining panels went dim he tried again slowly like an animal stretching after hibernation the command system train all three hundred metres of it flexed the carriages pulling a little tighter to each other taking up slack readying quayanorl felt the slight movement and wanted to laugh it was working probably he had taken far too long probably it was now too late but at least he had done what he had set out to do against all the odds and the pain he had taken command of the long silver beast and with only a little more luck he would at least give the humans something to think about and show the beast of the barrier what he thought of its precious monument nervously fearing that it would still not work after all his effort and agony he took hold of the lever he and xoxarle had decided governed the power fed to the main wheel motors then pushed it until it was at its limit for the starting mode the train shuddered groaned and did not move his one eye containing the grey view began to cry drowning in tears the train jerked a noise of metal tearing came from behind he was almost thrown from the seat he had to grab the edge of the seat then lean forward and take the power lever again as it flicked back to the off position the roaring in his head grew and grew he was shaking with exhaustion and excitement he pushed the lever again wreckage blocked one door welding gear hung under the reactor car strips of metal torn from the trains hull were splayed out like stray hairs from a badly groomed coat lumps of debris littered the tracks by the sides of both access gantries and one whole ramp where xoxarle had been buried for a while had crashed through the side of a carriage when it had been cut free groaning and moaning as though its own attempts at movement were as painful as quayanorls had been the train lurched forward again it moved half a turn of its wheels then stopped as the jammed ramp stuck against the access gantry a whining noise came from the train motors in the control deck alarms sounded almost too high for the injured idiran to hear meters flashed needles climbed into danger zones screens filled with information the ramp started to tear itself free from the train crumpling a jaggededge trench from the carriage surface as the train slowly forced its way forward quayanorl watched the lip of the tunnel mouth edge closer more wreckage ground against the forward access gantry the welding gear under the reactor car scraped along the smooth floor until it came to the lip of stone surrounding an inspection trough it jammed then broke clattering to the bottom of the trough the train rammed slowly forward with a grinding crash the ramp caught on the rear access assembly fell free snapping aluminium ribs and steel tubes flaying the aluminium and plastic skin of the carriage it had lodged in one corner of the ramp was nudged under the train covering a rail the wheels hesitated at it the linkages between the cars straining until the slowly gathering onward pull overcame the ramp it buckled its structures compressing and the wheels rolled over it thumping down on the far side and continuing along the rail the next wheels clattered over it with hardly a pause quayanorl sat back the tunnel came to the train and seemed to swallow it the view of the station slowly disappeared dark walls slid gently by on either side of the control deck the train still shuddered but it was slowly gathering speed a series of bangs and crashes told quayanorl of the carriages dragging their way after him through the debris over the shining rails past the wrecked gantries out of the damaged station the first car left at a slow walking pace the next a little faster the reactor carriage at a fast walk and the final car at a slow run smoke tugged after the departing train then drifted back and rose to the roof again the camera in station six where they had had the firefight where dorolow and neisin had died and the other idiran had been left for dead was out of action horza tried the switch a couple of times but the screen stayed dark a damage indicator winked horza flicked quickly through the views from the other stations on the circuit then switched the screen off well everything seems to be all right he stood up lets get back to the train yalson told wubslin and the drone balveda slipped off the big seat and with her in the lead they walked out of the control room behind them a powermonitoring screen one of the first horza had switched on was registering a massive energy drain in the locomotive supply circuits indicating that somewhere in the tunnels of the command system a train was moving the command system terminus one can read too much into ones own circumstances i am reminded of one race who set themselves against us oh long ago now before i was even thought of their conceit was that the galaxy belonged to them and they justified this heresy by a blasphemous belief concerning design they were aquatic their brain and major organs housed in a large central pod from which several large arms or tentacles protruded these tentacles were thick at the body thin at the tips and lined with suckers their water god was supposed to have made the galaxy in their image you see they thought that because they bore a rough physical resemblance to the great lens that is the home of all of us even taking the analogy as far as comparing their tentacle suckers to globular clusters it therefore belonged to them for all the idiocy of this heathen belief they had prospered and were powerful quite respectable adversaries in fact hmm aviger said without looking up he asked what were they called hmm xoxarle rumbled their name the idiran pondered i believe they were called the the fanch never heard of them aviger said no you wouldnt have xoxarle purred we annihilated them yalson saw horza staring at something on the floor near the doors leading back to the station she kept watching balveda but said what have you found horza shook his head reached to pick something from the floor then stopped i think its an insect he said incredulously wow yalson said unimpressed balveda moved over to have a look yalsons gun still trained on her horza shook his head watching the insect crawl over the tunnel floor what the hells that doing down here he said yalson frowned when he said that worried at a note of near panic in the mans voice probably brought it down ourselves balveda said rising hitched a ride on the pallet or somebodys suit ill bet horza brought his fist down on the tiny creature squashing it grinding it into the dark rock balveda looked surprised yalsons frown deepened horza stared at the mark left on the tunnel floor wiped his glove then looked up apologetic sorry he told balveda as though embarrassed couldnt help thinking about that fly in the ends of invention turned out to be one of your pets remember he got up and walked quickly into the station balveda nodded looking down at the small stain on the floor well she said arching one eyebrow that was one way of proving its innocence xoxarle watched the male and the two females come back into the station nothing little one he asked lots of things section leader horza replied going up to xoxarle and checking the wires holding him xoxarle grunted theyre still somewhat tight ally what a shame horza said try breathing out ha xoxarle laughed and thought the man might have guessed but the human turned away and said to the old man who had been guarding him aviger were going onto the train keep our friend company try not to fall asleep fat chance with him gibbering all the time the old man grumbled the other three humans entered the train xoxarle went on talking in one section of the train there were lit map screens which showed how schars world had looked at the time the command system had been built the cities and the states shown on the continents the targets on one state on one continent the missile grounds air bases and naval ports belonging to the systems designers shown on another state on another continent two small icecaps were shown but the rest of the planet was steppe savannah desert forest and jungle balveda wanted to stay and look at the maps but horza pulled her away and through another door going forward to the nose of the train he switched off the lights behind the map screens as he went and the bright surface of blue oceans green yellow brown and orange land blue rivers and red cities and communication lines faded slowly into grey darkness ohoh there are more on the train three i think walking from the rear now what xoxarle breathed in breathed out he flexed his muscles and the wires slipped over his keratin plates he stopped when the old man wandered over to look at him you are aviger arent you thats what they call me the old man said he stood looking at the idiran gazing from xoxarles three feet with their three slab toes and round ankle collars over his paddedlooking knees the massive girdle of pelvic plates and the flat chest up to the section leaders great saddlehead the broad face tipped and looking down at the human beneath frightened ill escape xoxarle rumbled aviger shrugged and gripped his gun a little tighter what do i care he said im a prisoner too that madmans got us all trapped down here i just want to go back this isnt my war a very sensible attitude xoxarle said i wish more humans would realise what is and what is not theirs especially regarding wars huh i dont suppose your lot are any better let us say different then say what you like aviger looked over the idirans body again addressing xoxarles chest i just wish everybody would mind their own business i see no change though itll all end in tears i dont think you really belong here aviger xoxarle nodded wisely slowly aviger shrugged and did not raise his eyes i dont think any of us do the brave belong where they decide some harshness entered the idirans voice aviger looked at the broad dark face above him well you would say that wouldnt you he turned away and walked back towards the pallet xoxarle watched and vibrated his chest quickly tensing his muscles then releasing the wires on him slipped a little further behind his back he felt the bonds around one wrist slacken fractionally the train gathered speed the controls and screens looked dim to him so he watched the lights on the tunnel walls outside they had slid by gently at first passing the side windows of the broad control deck more slowly than the quiet tide of his breathing now there were two or three lights running by for each time he breathed the train was pushing him gently in the back drawing him towards the rear of the seat and anchoring him there blood a little of it not much had dried under him sticking him there his course he felt was set there was only one thing left to do he searched the console cursing the darkness gathering behind his eye before he found the circuit breaker on the collision brake he found the lights it was like a little present from god the tunnel ahead flashed with bright reflections as the trains nose headlights clicked on the double set of rails glinted and in the distance he could see more shadows and reflections in the tunnel walls where access tubes slanted in from the foot tunnels and blast doors ribbed the black rock walls his sight was still going but he felt a little better for being able to see outside at first he worried in a distant theoretical way that the lights might give too much warning should he be lucky enough to catch the humans still in the station but it made little difference the air pushed in front of the train would warn them soon enough he raised a panel near the powercontrol lever and peered at it his head was light he felt very cold he looked at the circuit breaker and then bent down jamming himself between the rear of the seat cracking the blood seal beneath him and starting to bleed again and the edge of the console he shoved his face against the edge of the powercontrol lever then took his hand away and gripped the collision brake failsafe he moved his hand so that it would not slip out then just lay there his one eye was high enough off the console to see the tunnel ahead the lights were coming faster now the train rocked gently lulling him the roaring was fading from his ears like the sight dimming like the station behind slipping away and vanishing like the seemingly steady slowquickening stream of lights flowing by on either side he could not estimate how far he had to go he had started it off he had done his best no more finally could be asked of him he closed his eye just to rest the train rocked him its great wubslin grinned when horza yalson and balveda walked onto the control deck its all ready to roll all systems go well dont wet your pants yalson told him watching balveda sit down in a seat then sitting in another herself we might have to use the transit tubes to get around horza pressed a few buttons watching the readouts on the trains systems it all looked as wubslin had said ready to go wheres that damn drone horza said to yalson drone unahaclosp yalson said into her helmet mike what is it now unahaclosp said where are you im taking a good look through this antiquated collection of rolling stock i do believe these trains may actually be older than your ship tell it to get back here horza said he looked at wubslin did you check this whole train yalson ordered the drone back as wubslin nodded and said all of it except the reactor car couldnt get into bits of it which are the door controls horza looked around for a moment recalling the layout of the train controls that lot he pointed at one of the banks of buttons and light panels to one side of wubslin the engineer studied them ordered back told to return like it was a slave one of the idirans medjel as though it was a machine let them wait a little unahaclosp had also found the map screens in the train just down the tunnel it floated in the air in front of the coloured expanses of backlit plastic it used its manipulating fields to work the controls turning on small sets of lights which indicated the targets on both sides the major cities and military installations all of it dust now all of their precious humanoid civilisation ground to junk under glaciers or weathered away by wind and spray and rain and frozen in ice all of it only this pathetic mazetomb left so much for their humanity or whatever they chose to call it thought unahaclosp only their machines remained but would any of the others learn would they see this for what it was this frozen rockball would they indeed unahaclosp left the screens glowing and floated out of the train back through the tunnel towards the station itself the tunnels were bright now but no warmer and to unahaclosp it seemed as though there was a sort of revealed heartlessness about the harsh yellowwhite light which streamed from ceilings and walls it was operatingtheatre light dissectiontable light the machine floated through the tunnels thinking that the cathedral of darkness had become a glazed arena a crucible xoxarle was on the platform still trussed against the access ramp girders unahaclosp didnt like the way the idiran looked at it when it appeared from the tunnels it was almost impossible to read the creatures expression if he could be said to have one but there was something about xoxarle that unahaclosp didnt like it got the impression the idiran had just stopped moving or doing something he didnt want to be seen doing from the tunnel mouth the drone saw aviger look up from the pallet where he was sitting then look away again without even bothering to wave the changer and the two females were in the train control area with the engineer wubslin unahaclosp saw them and went forward to the access ramps and the nearest door as it got there it paused air moved gently hardly anything but it was there it could feel it obviously with the power on some automatic systems were circulating more fresh air from the surface or through atmospheric scrubbing units unahaclosp went into the train unpleasant little machine that xoxarle said to aviger the old man nodded vaguely xoxarle had noticed that the man looked at him less when he was speaking to him it was as though the sound of his voice reassured the human that he was still tied there safe and sound not moving on the other hand talking moving his head to look at the human making the occasional shrugging motion laughing a little gave him excuses to move and so to slip the wires a little further so he talked with luck the others would be on the train for a while now and he might have a chance to escape he would lead them a merry dance if he got away into the tunnels with a gun well they should be open horza was saying according to the console in front of him and wubslin the doors in the reactor car had never been locked in the first place are you sure you were trying to open them properly he was looking at the engineer of course wubslin said sounding hurt i know how different types of locks work i tried to turn the recessed wheel catches off ok this arm of mine isnt perfect but well it should have opened probably a malfunction horza said he straightened looking back down the train as though trying to see through the hundred metres of metal and plastic between him and the reactor car hmm theres not enough room there for the mind to hide is there wubslin looked up from the panel i wouldnt have thought so well here i am unahaclosp said testily floating through the door to the control deck what do you want me to do now you took your time searching that other train horza said looking at the machine i was being thorough more thorough than you unless i misheard what you were saying before i came in where might there be enough room for the mind to hide the reactor car wubslin said i couldnt get through some of the doors horza says according to the controls they ought to be open shall i go back and have a look then unahaclosp turned to face horza the changer nodded if it isnt asking too much he said levelly no no unahaclosp said airily backing off through the door it had entered by im starting to enjoy being ordered about leave it to me it floated away back through the front carriage towards the reactor car balveda looked through the armoured glass at the rear of the train in front the one the drone had been looking through if the mind was hiding in the reactor car wouldnt it show up on your mass sensor or would it be confused with the trace from the pile she turned her head slowly to look at the changer who knows horza said im not an expert on the workings of the suit especially now its damaged youre getting very trusting horza the culture agent said smiling faintly letting the drone do your hunting for you just letting it do some scouting balveda horza said turning away and working at some more of the controls he watched screens and dials and meters changing displays and readout functions trying to tell what was going on if anything in the reactor car it all looked normal as far as he could tell though he knew less about the reactor systems than about most of the trains other components from his time as a sentinel ok yalson said turning her chair to one side putting her feet upon the edge of one console and taking her helmet off so what do we do if theres no mind there in the reactor car do we all start touring round in this thing take the transit tube or what i dont know that taking a mainline train is a good idea horza said glancing at wubslin i considered leaving everybody else here and taking a transit tube by myself on a circular journey right round the system trying to spot the mind on the suit mass sensor it wouldnt take too long even doing it twice to cover both sets of tracks between stations the transit tubes have no reactors so it wouldnt get any false echoes to interfere with the sensors readings wubslin sitting in the seat which faced the trains main controls looked downcast why not send the rest of us back to the ship then balveda said horza looked at her balveda you are not here to make suggestions just trying to be helpful the culture agent shrugged what if you still cant find anything yalson asked we go back to the ship horza said shaking his head thats about all we can do wubslin can check the suit mass sensor on board and depending on what we find is wrong with it we might come back down or we might not now the powers on none of that should take very long or involve any hard slog pity wubslin said fingering the controls we cant even use this train to get back to station four because of that train in station six blocking the way it probably would still move horza told the engineer well have to do some shunting whichever way we go if we use the mainline trains oh well then wubslin said a little dreamily and looked over the controls again he pointed at one of them is that the speed control horza laughed crossing his arms and grinning at the man yes well see if we can arrange a little journey he leaned over and pointed out a couple of other controls showing wubslin how the train was readied for running they pointed and nodded and talked yalson stirred restlessly in her seat finally she looked over at balveda the culture woman was looking at horza and wubslin with a smile she turned her head to yalson sensing her gaze and smiled more widely moving her head fractionally to indicate the two men and raising her eyebrows yalson reluctantly grinned back and shifted the weight of her gun slightly the lights came quickly now they streamed by creating a flickering strobing pattern of light in the dint cabin he knew he had opened his eye and had seen it had taken all his strength just to lift that eyelid he had drifted off to sleep for a while he was not sure for how long he only knew he had been dozing the pain was not so bad now he had been still for some time just lying here with his broken body slanted out of the strange alien chair his head on the control console his hand wedged into the small flap by the power control fingers jammed under the failsafe lever inside it was restful he could not have expressed how pleasant it all was after that awful crawl through both the train and the tunnel of his own pain the trains motion had altered it still rocked him but a little faster now and with a new rhythm added as well a more rapid vibration which was like a heart beating fast he thought he could hear it too now the noise of the wind blowing through these deepburied holes far under the blizzardswept wastes above or maybe he imagined it he found it hard to tell he felt like a small child again on a journey with his year fellows and their old querlmentor rocked to sleep slipping in and out of a dozing happy sleep he kept thinking i have done all i could perhaps not enough but it was all i had in my power to do it was comforting like the ebbing pain it eased him like the rocking of the train it soothed him he closed his eye again there was comfort in the darkness too he had no idea how far along he was and was starting to think it did not matter things were beginning to drift away from him again he was just beginning to forget why he was doing all this but that didnt matter either it was done so long as he didnt move nothing mattered nothing nothing at all the doors were jammed all right same as the other train the drone became exasperated and slammed against one the reactor chamber doors with a force field knocking itself back through the air with the reaction the door wasnt even dented ohoh back to the crawlways and cableruns unahaclosp turned and headed down a short corridor then down a hole in the floor heading for an inspection panel under the floor of the lower deck of course i end up doing all the work i might have known basically what im doing for that bastard is hunting down another machine i ought to have my circuits tested ive a good mind not to tell him even if i do find the mind somewhere that would teach him it threw back the inspection hatch and lowered itself into the dim narrow space under the floor the hatch hissed shut after it blocking out the light it thought about turning back and opening the hatch again but knew it would just close automatically once more and that it would lose its temper and damage the thing and that was all a bit pointless and petty so it didnt that sort of behaviour was for humans it started off along the crawlway heading towards the rear of the train underneath where the reactor ought to be the idiran was talking aviger could hear it but he wasnt listening he could see the monster out of the corner of his eye too but he wasnt really looking at it he was gazing absently at his gun humming tunelessly and thinking about what he would do if somehow he could get hold of the mind himself suppose the others were killed and he was left with the device he knew the idirans would probably pay well for the mind so would the culture they had money even if they werent supposed to use it in their own civilisation just dreams but anything could happen out of this lot you never knew how the dust might fall he would buy some land an island on a nice safe planet somewhere hed have some retroageing done and raise some sort of expensive racing animals and hed get to know the betteroff people through his connections or hed get somebody else to do all the hard work with money you could do that you could do anything the idiran went on talking his hand was almost free that was all he could get free for now but maybe he could twist his arm out later it was getting easier all the time the humans had been on the train for a while how much longer would they stay the small machine hadnt been on for so long he had only just seen it in time appearing from the tunnel mouth he knew its sight was better than his own and for a moment he had been afraid it might have seen him moving the arm he was trying to get free the one on the far side from the old human but the machine had disappeared into the train and nothing had happened he kept looking over at the old man checking the human seemed lost in a daydream xoxarle kept talking telling the empty air about old idiran victories his hand was almost out a little dust came off a girder above him about a metre over his head and floated down through the near still air falling almost but not quite straight down gradually drifting away from him he looked at the old man again and strained at the wires over his hand come free damn you unahaclosp had to hammer a corner from a right angle to a curve to get into the small passage it wanted to use it wasnt even a crawlway it was a cable conduit but it led into the reactor compartment it checked its senses same amount of radiation here as in the other train it scraped through the small gap it had created in the cablerun deeper into the metal and plastic guts of the silent carriage i can hear something somethings coming underneath me the lights were a continuous line flashing past the train too quickly for most eyes to have distinguished them individually the lights ahead down the track appeared round curves or at the far end of straights swelled and joined and tore past the windows like shooting stars in the darkness the train had taken a long time to reach its maximum speed fought for long minutes to overcome the inertia of its thousands of tonnes of mass now it had done so and was pushing itself and the column of air in front of it as fast as it ever would hurtling down the long tunnel with a roaring tearing noise greater than any train had ever made in those dark passages its damaged carriages breaking the air or scraping the blastdoor edges to decrease its speed a little but increase the noise of its passage a great deal the scream of the trains whirling motors and wheels of its ruffled metal body tearing through the air and of that same air swirling through the open spaces of the punctured carriages rang from the ceiling and the walls the consoles and the floor and the slope of armoured glass quayanorls eye was closed inside his ears membranes pulsed to the noise outside but no message was transmitted to his brain his head bobbed up and down on the vibrating console as though still alive his hand shook on the collision brake override as if the warrior was nervous or afraid wedged there glued soldered by his own blood he was like a strange damaged part of the train the blood was dried outside quayanorls body as within it had stopped flowing how goes it unahaclosp yalsons voice said im under the reactor and im busy ill let you know if i find anything thank you it switched its communicator off and looked at the blacksheathed entrails in front of it wires and cables disappearing into a cablerun more than there had been in the front train should it cut its way in or try another route decisions decisions his hand was out he paused the old man was still sitting on the pallet fiddling with his gun xoxarle allowed himself a small sigh of relief and flexed his hand letting the fingers stretch then fist a few motes of dust moved slowly past his cheek he stopped flexing his hand he watched the dust move a breath something less than a breeze tickled at his arms and legs most odd he thought all im saying yalson told horza shifting her feet on the console a little is that i dont think its a good idea for you to come down here yourself anything could happen ill take a communicator ill check in horza said he stood with his arms crossed his backside resting on the edge of a control panel the same one wubslins helmet lay on the engineer was familiarising himself with the controls of the train they were pretty simple really its basic horza yalson told him you never go alone what stuff did they teach you at this goddamned academy if im allowed to say anything balveda put in clasping her hands in front of her and looking at the changer i would just like to say i think yalsons right horza stared at the culture woman with a look of unhappy amazement no you are not allowed to say anything he told her whose side do you think youre on perosteck oh horza balveda grinned crossing her arms i almost feel like one of the team after all this time about half a metre away from the gently rocking slowly cooling head of subordinatecaptain quayanorl gidborux stoghrle iii a small light began to flash very rapidly on the console at the same time the air in the control deck was pierced by a highpitched ululating whine which filled the deck and the whole front carriage and was relayed to several other control centres throughout the speeding train quayanorl his firmly wedged body tugged to one side by the force of the train roaring round a long curve could have heard that noise just if he had been alive very few humans could have heard it unahaclosp thought the better of cutting off all communication with the outside world and reopened its communicator channels nobody wanted to speak to it however it started to cut the cables leading into the conduit snipping them one by one with a knifeedged force field no point in worrying about damaging the thing after all that had happened to the train in station six it told itself if it hit anything vital to the normal running of the train it was sure horza would yell out soon enough it could repair the cables without too much trouble anyway a draught xoxarle thought he must be imagining it then that it was the result of some aircirculation unit recently switched on perhaps the heat from the lights and the stations systems once it was powered up required extra ventilation but it grew slowly almost too slowly to discern the faint steady current increased in strength xoxarle racked his brains what could it be not a train surely not a train he listened carefully but could hear nothing he looked over at the old human and found him staring back had he noticed run out of battles and victories to tell me about aviger said sounding tired he looked the idiran up and down xoxarle laughed a little too loudly even nervously had aviger been well enough versed in idiran gestures and voice tones to tell not at all xoxarle said i was just thinking he launched into another tale of defeated enemies it was one he had told to his family in ship messes and in attackshuttle holds he could have told it in his sleep while his voice filled the bright station and the old human looked down at the gun he held in his hands xoxarles thoughts were elsewhere trying to work out what was going on he was still pulling and tugging at the wires on his arm whatever was happening it was vital to be able to do more than just move his hand the draught increased still he could hear nothing a steady stream of dust was blowing off the girder above his head it had to be a train could one have been left switched on somewhere impossible quayanorl did we set the controls to but they hadnt tried to jam the controls on they had only worked out what the various controls did and tested their action to make sure they all moved they hadnt tried to do anything else and there had been no point no time it had to be quayanorl himself he had done it he must still be alive he had sent the train for an instant as he tugged desperately at the wires holding him talking all the time and watching the old man xoxarle imagined his comrade still back in station six but then he remembered how badly injured he had been xoxarle had earlier thought his comrade might still be alive when he was still lying on the access ramp but then the changer had told the old man this same aviger to go back and shoot quayanorl in the head that should have finished quayanorl but apparently it hadnt you failed old one xoxarle exulted as the draught became a breeze a distant whining noise almost too high pitched to hear started up it was muffled coming from the train the alarm xoxarles arm held by one last wire just above his elbow was almost free he shrugged once and the wire slipped up over his upper arm and spilled loose onto his shoulder old one aviger my friend he said aviger looked up quickly as xoxarle interrupted his own monologue what this will sound silly and i shall not blame you if you are afraid but i have the most infernal itch in my right eye would you scratch it for me i know it sounds silly a warrior tormented half to death by a sore eye but it has been driving me quite demented these past ten minutes would you scratch it use the barrel of your gun if you like i shall be very careful not to move a muscle or do anything threatening if you use the muzzle of your gun or anything you like would you do that i swear to you on my honour as a warrior i tell the truth aviger stood up he looked towards the nose of the train he cant hear the alarm he is old can the other younger ones hear is it too highpitched for them what of the machine oh come here you old fool come here unahaclosp pulled the cut cables apart now it could reach into the cablerun and try cutting further up so it could get in drone drone can you hear me it was the woman yalson again now what it said horzas lost some readouts from the reactor car he wants to know what youre doing damn right i do horza muttered in the background i had to cut some cables seems to be the only way into the reactor area ill repair them later if you insist the communicator channel cut off for a second in that moment unahaclosp thought it could hear something high pitched but it wasnt sure fringes of sensation it thought to itself the channel opened again yalson said all right but horza says to tell him the next time you think about cutting anything especially cables all right all right the drone said now will you leave me alone the channel closed again it thought for a moment it had crossed its mind that there might be an alarm sounding somewhere but logically an alarm ought to have repeated on the control deck and it had heard nothing in the background when yalson spoke apart from the changers muttered interjection therefore no alarm it reached back into the conduit with a cutter field which eye aviger said from just too far away a wisp of his thin yellowish hair was blown across his forehead by the breeze xoxarle waited for the man to realise but he didnt he just patted the hairs back and stared up quizzically at the idirans head gun ready face uncertain this right one xoxarle said turning his head slowly aviger looked round towards the nose of the train again then back at xoxarle dont tell youknowwho all right i swear now please i cant stand it aviger stepped forward still out of reach on your honour youre not playing a trick he said as a warrior on my motherparents unsullied name on my clan and folk may the galaxy turn to dust if i lie all right all right aviger said raising his gun and holding it out high i just wanted to make sure he poked the barrel toward xoxarles eye whereabouts does it itch here hissed xoxarle his freed arm lashed out grabbed the barrel of the gun and pulled aviger still holding the gun was dragged after it slamming into the chest of the idiran breath exploded out of him then the gun sailed down and smashed into his skull xoxarle had averted his head when hed grabbed the weapon in case it fired but he neednt have bothered aviger hadnt left it switched on in the stiffening breeze xoxarle let the unconscious human slide to the floor he held the laser rifle in his mouth and used his hand to set the controls for a quiet burn he snapped the trigger guard from the guns casing to make room for his larger fingers the wires should melt easily like a squirm of snakes appearing from a hole in the ground the bunched cables cut about a metre along their length slid out of the conduit unahaclosp went into the narrow tube and reached behind the bared ends of the next length of cables yalson horza said i wouldnt take you with me anyway even if i decided not to come back down alone he grinned at her yalson frowned why not she said because id need you on the ship making sure balveda here and our section leader didnt misbehave yalsons eyes narrowed that had better be all she growled horzas grin widened and he looked away as though he wanted to say more but couldnt for some reason balveda sat swinging her legs from the edge of the toobig seat and wondered what was going on between the changer and the dark downskinned woman she thought she had detected a change in their relationship a change which seemed to come mostly from the way horza treated yalson an extra element had been added there was something else determining his reactions to her but balveda couldnt pin it down it was all quite interesting but it didnt help her she had her own problems anyway balveda knew her own weaknesses and one of them was troubling her now she really was starting to feel like one of the team she watched horza and yalson arguing about who should accompany the changer if he came back down into the command system after a return to the clear air turbulence and she could not help but smile unseen at them she liked the determined nononsense woman even if her regard was not returned and she could not find it in her heart to think of horza as implacably as she ought it was the cultures fault it considered itself too civilised and sophisticated to hate its enemies instead it tried to understand them and their motives so that it could outthink them and so that when it won it would treat them in a way which ensured they would not become enemies again the idea was fine as long as you didnt get too close but once you had spent some time with your opponents such empathy could turn against you there was a sort of detached nonhuman aggression required to go along with such mobilised compassion and balveda could feel it slipping away from her perhaps she felt too safe she thought perhaps it was because now there was no significant threat the battle for the command system was over the quest was petering out the tension of the past few days disappearing xoxarle worked quickly the lasers thin attenuated beam buzzed and fussed at each wire turning each strand red yellow and white then as he strained against them parted each one with a snap the old man at the idirans feet stirred moaned the faint breeze had become a strong one dust was blowing under the train and starting to swirl around xoxarles feet he moved the laser to another set of wires only a few to go he glanced towards the nose of the train there was still no sign of the humans or the machine he glanced back the other way over his shoulder towards the trains last carriage and the gap between it and the tunnel mouth where the wind was whistling through he could see no light still hear no noise the current of air made his eye feel cold he turned back and pointed the laser rifle at another set of wires the sparks were caught in the breeze and scattered over the station floor and across the back of avigers suit typical me doing all the work as usual thought unahaclosp it hauled another bunch of cables out of the conduit the wire run behind it was starting to fill up with cut lengths of wire blocking the route the drone had taken to get to the small pipe it was now working in its beneath me i can feel it i can hear it i dont know what its doing but i can feel i can hear and theres something else another noise the train was a long articulated shell in some gigantic gun a metal scream in a vast throat it rammed through the tunnel like a piston in the biggest engine ever made sweeping round the curves and into the straights lights flooding the way ahead for an instant air pushed ahead of it like its howling roaring voice for kilometres dust lifted from the platform made clouds in the air an empty drink container rolled off the pallet where aviger had been sitting and clattered to the floor it started rolling along the platform towards the nose of the train hitting off the wall a couple of times xoxarle saw it the wind tugged at him the wires parted he got one leg free then another his other arm was out and the last wires fell away a piece of plastic sheeting lifted from the pallet like some black flat bird and flopped onto the platform sliding after the metal container now halfway down the station xoxarle stooped quickly caught aviger round the waist and with the man held easily in one arm and the laser in his other hand ran back down the platform towards the wall beside the blocked tunnel mouth where the wind made a moaning noise past the sloped rear of the train or lock them both away down here instead you know we can yalson said were close horza thought nodding absently at yalson not listening as she told him why he needed her to help him look for the mind were close im sure we are i can feel it were almost there somehow weve ive held it all together but its not over yet and it only takes one tiny error one oversight a single mistake and thats it fuckup failure death so far weve done it despite the mistakes but its so easy to miss something to fail to spot some tiny detail in the mass of data which later when youve forgotten all about it when your back is turned creeps up and clobbers you the secret was to think of everything or because maybe the culture was right and only a machine could literally do that just to be so in tune with what was going on that you thought automatically of all the important and potentially important things and ignored the rest with something of a shock horza realised that his own obsessive drive never to make a mistake always to think of everything was not so unlike the fetishistic urge which he so despised in the culture that need to make everything fair and equal to take the chance out of life he smiled to himself at the irony and glanced over at balveda sitting watching wubslin experimenting with some controls coming to resemble your enemies horza thought maybe theres something in it after all horza are you listening to me yalson said hmm yes of course he smiled balveda frowned while horza and yalson talked on and wubslin poked and prodded at the trains controls for some reason she was starting to feel uneasy outside the front carriage beyond balvedas field of view a small container rolled along the platform and into the wall alongside the tunnel mouth xoxarle ran to the rear of the station by the entrance to the foot tunnel leading off at right angles into the rock behind the stations platform was the tunnel which the changer and the two women had emerged from when they had returned from their search of the station it provided the ideal place from which to watch xoxarle thought he would escape the effects of the collision and would have the best opportunity for a clear field of fire right down the station to the nose of the train in the meantime he could stay there right up until the train hit if they tried to get off he would have them he checked the gun turning its power up to maximum balveda got down from the seat folding her arms and walked slowly across the control deck towards the side windows staring intently at the floor wondering why she felt uneasy the wind howled through the gap between the tunnel edge and the train it became a gale twenty metres away from where xoxarle waited in the foot tunnel kneeling there with one foot on the back of the unconscious aviger the trains rear carriage started to rock and sway the drone stopped in midcut two things occurred to it one that dammit there was a funny noise and two that just supposing there had been an alarm sounding on the control deck not only would none of the humans be able to hear it there was also a good chance that yalsons helmet mike would not relay the highpitched whine either but wouldnt there be a visual warning too balveda turned at the side window without looking out properly she sat against the console there looking back on how serious you still are about looking for this damn thing yalson was saying to horza dont worry the changer said nodding at yalson ill find it balveda turned round looked at the station outside just then yalson and wubslins helmets both came alive with the urgent voice of the drone balveda was distracted by a piece of black material which was sliding quickly along the floor of the station her eyes widened her mouth opened the gale became a hurricane a distant noise like a great avalanche heard from far away came from the tunnel mouth then up the long final straight which led into station seven from station six light appeared at the end of the tunnel xoxarle could not see the light but he could hear the noise he brought the gun up and aimed along the side of the stationary train the stupid humans must realise soon the steel rails began to whine the drone backed quickly out of the conduit it threw the cut discarded lengths of cable against the walls yalson horza it shouted at them through its communicator it dashed along the short length of narrow tunnel the instant it turned the corner it had hammered in to make passable it could hear the faint high insistent wailing of the alarm theres an alarm i can hear it whats happening there in the crawlway it could feel and hear the rush of air coursing through and around the train theres a gale blowing out there balveda said quickly as soon as the drones voice stopped wubslin lifted his helmet from the console where it had lain a small orange light was flashing horza stared at it balveda looked up at the platform clouds of dust blew along the station floor light equipment was being blown off the pallet opposite the rear access gantry horza balveda said quietly i cant see xoxarle or aviger yalson was on her feet horza glanced over at the side window then back at the light winking on the console its an alarm the drones voice shouted from the two helmets i can hear it horza picked up his rifle grabbed the edge of yalsons helmet while she held it and said its a train drone thats the collision alarm get off the train now he let go of the helmet which yalson quickly shoved over her head and locked horza gestured towards the door move he said loudly glancing round at yalson balveda and wubslin who was still sitting holding the helmet he had removed from the console balveda headed for the door yalson was just behind her horza started forward then turned as he went looked back at wubslin who was setting his helmet down on the floor and turning back to the controls wubslin he yelled move balveda and yalson were running through the carriage yalson looked back hesitated im going to get it moving wubslin said urgently not turning to look at horza he punched some buttons wubslin horza shouted get out now its all right horza wubslin said still flicking buttons and switches glancing at screens and dials grimacing when he had to move his injured arm and still not turning his head i know what im doing you get off ill get her moving youll see horza glanced towards the rear of the train yalson was standing in the middle of the forward carriage just visible through two open doors her head going from side to side as she looked first at the still running balveda heading for the second carriage and the access ramps and then at horza waiting in the control deck horza motioned her to get out he turned and strode forward and took wubslin by one elbow you crazy bastard he shouted it could be coming at fifty metres a second have you any idea how long it takes to get one of these things moving he hauled at the engineers arm wubslin turned quickly and hit horza across the face with his free hand horza was thrown back over the floor of the control deck more amazed than hurt wubslin turned back to the controls sorry horza but i can get it round that bend and out of the way you get out now leave me horza took his laser rifle stood up watched the engineer working at the controls then turned and ran from the place as he did so the train lurched seeming to flex and tighten yalson followed the culture woman horza had waved at her to go on so she did balveda she shouted emergency exits go down bottom deck the culture agent didnt hear she was still heading for the next carriage and the access ramps yalson ran after her cursing the drone exploded out of the floor and raced through the carriage for the nearest emergency hatch that vibration its a train another trains coming fast what have those idiots done i have to get out balveda skidded round a corner threw out one hand and caught hold of a bulkhead edge she dived for the open door which led to the middle access ramp yalsons footsteps pounded behind her she ran out onto the ramp into a howling gale a constant gustless hurricane instantly the air around her detonated with cracks and sparks light glared from all sides and the girders blew out in molten lines she threw herself flat sliding and rolling along the surface of the ramp the girders ahead of her where the ramp turned and sloped down to one side glittered with laser fire she got half up again and feet and hands scrabbling for purchase on the ramp threw herself back into the train fractionally before the moving line of shots blasted into the side of the ramp and the girders and guard rails beyond yalson almost tripped over her balveda reached up and grabbed the other womans arm somebodys firing yalson went forward to the edge and started firing back the train gave a lurch the final straight between station six and station seven was over three kilometres long the time between the point the racing machines lights would have become visible from the rear of the train sitting in station seven and the instant the train flashed out of the dark tunnel into the station itself occupied less than a minute dead body shaking and rocking but still wedged too tightly to be dislodged from the controls quayanorls cold closed eye faced a scene through sloped armoured glass of a nightdark space strung with twin bright lines of almost solid light and directly in front rapidly enlarging a halo of brightness a glaring ring of luminescence with a grey metallic core xoxarle cursed the target had moved quickly and hed missed but they were trapped on the train he had them the old human under his knee moaned and tried to move xoxarle trod down harder on him and got ready to shoot again the jetstream of air screamed out of the tunnel and round the rear of the train answering shots splashed randomly around the rear of the station well away from him he smiled just then the train moved get out horza said arriving at the door where the two women were one firing one crouched down risking the occasional look out the air was whirling into the carriage shaking and roaring it must be xoxarle yalson shouted above the noise of the storming wind she leant out and fired more shots rippled over the access ramp and thudded into the outer hull of the train around the door balveda ducked back as hot fragments blew in through the open door the train seemed to wobble then move forward very slowly what yalson yelled looking round at horza as he joined her at the door he shrugged as he leant out to fire down the platform wubslin he shouted he sent a hail of fire down the length of the station the train crept forward already a metre of the access ramp was hidden by the side of the trains hull near the open door something sparkled in the darkness of the distant tunnel where the wind screamed and the dust blew and a noise like neverending thunder came horza shook his head he waved balveda forward to the ramp now with only about half its breadth available from the door he fired again yalson leant out and fired too balveda started forward at that moment a hatch blew out near the middle of the train and from the same carriage a huge circular plug of train hull fell clanging out a great flat cork of thick wall tipping down to the station floor a small dark shape dashed from the broken hatch and from the great circular hole near by a silver point came swelling quickly to a fat bright reflecting ovoid as the wall section hit the platform the drone whizzed through the air and balveda started forward along the ramp there it is yalson screamed the mind was out of the train starting to turn and race off then the flickering laser fire from the far end of the station switched no longer smashing into the access ramp and girders it began to scatter flashing explosions of light all over the surface of the silvery ellipsoid the mind seemed to stop hang in the air shaken by the fusilade of laser shots then it fell sideways out over the platform its smooth surface suddenly starting to ripple and grow dim as it rolled through the rushing air falling towards the side wall of the station like a crippled airship balveda was across the ramp running down the sloped section almost at the lower level get out horza yelled shoving yalson the train was away from the ramps now motors growling but unheard in the raging hurricane which swept through the station yalson slapped her wrist switching on her ag then leapt out of the door into the gale still firing horza leant out having to fire through the girders of the access ramp he held onto the train with one hand felt it shaking like a frightened animal some of his shots smacked into the access ramp girders blasting fountains of debris out into the slipstream of air and making him duck back in the mind crunched into the side wall of the station rolling over to lodge in the angle between the floor and the curved wall its silver skin quivering going dull unahaclosp twisted through the air avoiding laser shots balveda reached the bottom of the ramp and ran across the station floor the fan of shots from the distant foot tunnel seemed to hesitate between her and the flying figure of yalson then swept up to close around the woman in the suit yalson fired back but the shots found her made her suit sparkle horza threw himself out of the train falling to the ground from the slowly moving carriage crashing into the rock floor winding himself being bowled over by the tearing blast of air he ran forward as soon as he could get to his feet bouncing up from the impact firing through the hurricane towards the far end of the station yalson still flew moving into the torrent of air and the crackling laser fire light blazed around the rear of the train now heading at a little over walking speed from the station the noise of the oncoming train drowning out every other sound even explosions and shots so that everything else seemed to be happening in a shocked silence within that ultimate scream rose in pitch yalson dropped her suit was damaged her legs started to work before she hit the ground and when she did she was running running for the nearest cover she ran for the mind dull silver by the wall side and changed her mind she turned just before she would have been able to dive behind the mind and ran on round it towards the doorways and alcoves of the wall beyond xoxarles fire slammed into her again the instant she turned and this time her suit armour could soak up no more energy it gave way the laser fire bursting through like lightning all over the womans body throwing her into the air blowing her arms out kicking her legs from under her jerking her like a doll caught in the fist of an angry child and throwing a bright crimson cloud from her chest and abdomen the train hit it flashed into the station on a tide of noise it roared from the tunnel like a solid metal thunderbolt seeming to cross the space between the tunnel mouth and the slowly moving train in front in the same instant as it appeared xoxarle closest of them all caught a fleeting glimpse of the trains sleek shining nose before that great shovel front slammed into the back of the other train he could not have believed there was a sound greater than that the train had made in the tunnel but the noise of its impact dwarfed even that cacophony it was a star of sound a blinding nova where before there had only been a dim glow the train hit at over one hundred and ninety kilometres per hour wubslins train had barely progressed a carriage length into the tunnel and was moving hardly faster than walking speed the racing train smashed into the rear coach lifting and crumpling it in a fraction of a second crushing it into the tunnel roof jackhammering its layers of metal and plastic into a tight wad of wreckage in the same instant as its own nose and front carriage caved in underneath shattering wheels snapping rails and bursting the trains metal skin like shrapnel from some vast grenade the train ploughed on into and under the front train skidding and crashing to one side as smashed sections of the two trains kicked out to the wall side of the tracks forcing them both into the main body of the station in a welter of tearing metal and fractured stone while the carriages bucked squashed telescoped and disintegrated all at once the whole length of the racing train continued to pour out of the tunnel coaches flashing by streaming into the chaos of disintegrating wreckage in front lifting and crashing and slewing flames burst and flickered in the detonating debris sparks fountained glass blew spraying out from the breaking windows flaying ribbons of metal beat at the walls xoxarle ducked in away from the pulverising sound of it wubslin felt the train hit it threw him back in the chair he knew already he had failed the train his train was going too slowly a great hand from nowhere rammed into his back his ears popped the control deck the carriage the whole train shook round him and suddenly in the midst of it the rear of the next train the one in the repair and maintenance cavern was racing towards him he felt his train jump the tracks on the curve that might have let him roll to safety the acceleration went on he was pinned helpless the rear carriage of the other train flashed towards him he closed his eyes half a second before he was crushed like an insect inside the wreckage horza was curled in a small doorway in the station wall with no idea how he had got there he didnt look he couldnt see he whimpered in a corner while the devastation bellowed in his ears pelted his back with debris and shook the walls and floor balveda had found a space in the wall too an alcove where she hid her back turned her face hidden unahaclosp had planted itself on the station ceiling behind the cover of a camera dome it watched the crash as it went on beneath it saw the last carriage leave the tunnel saw the crashing train smash into and through the one they had been in only seconds before pushing it forward in a skidding tangled mess of mangled metal carriages left the tracks skidding sideways over the station floor as the wreck slowed tearing the access ramps from the rock smashing lights from the ceiling debris flew up and the drone had to dodge it saw yalsons body beneath it on the platform hit by the slewing rolling carriages tumbling over the fused rock surface in a cloud of sparks they swept past just missing the mind scraped the womans torn body from the floor and buried it with the access ramps in the wall hammering into the black rock by the side of the tunnel where a squeezedout collar of wreckage swelled as the last of the impetus from the collision spent itself compressing metal and stone together fire burst out sparks flashed from the tracks the station lights flickered wreckage fell back and the quivering echo of the wreck reverberated through the station smoke started up explosions shook the station and suddenly from out of the ceiling surprising the drone water started to spray from holes all along the surface of rock beside the flickering lines of lights the water turned to foam and floated down through the air like warm snow the mangled wreckage hissed and groaned and creaked as it settled flames licked over it fighting against the falling foam as they found flammables in the debris then there was a scream and the drone looked down through a haze of smoke and foam horza ran from a doorway in the wall just up the platform from the near edge of the burning metal rubble the man ran up the wreckagelittered platform screaming and firing his gun the drone saw rock fracture and explode around the distant tunnel entrance xoxarle had been firing from it expected to see answering fire and the man fall but there was nothing the man kept on running and firing shouting incoherently all the time the drone couldnt see balveda xoxarle had stuck the gun round the corner as soon as the noise died away at the same time the man appeared and started firing xoxarle had time to take aim but not to fire a shot landed near the gun on the wall and something hammered into xoxarles hand the gun sputtered then went dead a splinter of rock protruded from the weapons casing xoxarle swore threw it away across the tunnel more shots burst around the tunnel mouth as the changer fired again xoxarle looked down at aviger who was moving weakly on the floor face down limbs shifting in the air and over the rock like somebody trying to swim xoxarle had kept the old one alive to use as a hostage but he was of little use now the woman yalson was dead he had killed her and horza wanted to avenge her xoxarle crushed avigers skull with his foot then turned and ran there were twenty metres to run before the first turn xoxarle ran as fast as he could ignoring the pains from his legs and body an explosion sounded from the station a hissing noise came from above xoxarles head and spurts of water from the sprinkler system stared to fall from the ceiling the air glowed with laser fire as he dived for the first side tunnel the wall blew out at him and something hit his leg and back he ran on limping there were some doors ahead to the left he tried to remember how the stations were laid out the doors ought to lead to the control room and accommodation dormitories he could cut through there cross the repair and maintenance cavern by the gantry bridge and get up a side tunnel to the transit tube system that way he could escape he hobbled quickly shouldercharging the doors the chargers steps sounded loud somewhere in the tunnels behind him the drone watched horza his gun still firing his legs pumping run up the platform like a madman screaming and howling and vaulting bits of wreckage he sprinted over the place where yalsons body had lain before it was brushed from the station floor by the tumbling carriages then ran on preceded by a cone of glowing light from his gun past where the pallet had been to the far end of the station where xoxarle had been firing from and disappeared into the side tunnel unahaclosp floated down the wreckage crackled and fumed the foam fell to sleet the ugly smell of some noxious gas started to fill the air the drones sensors detected mediumhigh radiation a series of small explosions burst from the wrecked carriages starting fresh fires to replace the ones smothered by the foam now coating the chaos of the mangled metal like snow on jagged mountains unahaclosp came up to the mind it lay by the wall its surface rippled and dark the colours of oil on water and dull bet you though you were smart didnt you unahaclosp said to it quietly perhaps it could hear maybe it was dead it had no way of telling hiding in the reactor like that i bet i know what you did with the pile too dumped it down one of those deep shafts near one of the emergency ventilation motors maybe even the one we saw on the screen of the mass sensor on the first day then hid in the train pleased with yourself ill bet look where it got you though the drone looked at the silent mind its top surface was collecting the falling foam the drone brushed its own casing clear with a force field the mind moved it lifted abruptly about half a metre one end at a time and the air hissed and crackled for a second the devices surface shimmered momentarily while unahaclosp backed off uncertain what was happening then the mind fell back and rested lightly on the floor again the colours on its ovoid skin shifting lazily the drone smelled ozone down but not quite out eh it said the station began to darken as the undamaged lights were clouded by the rising smoke somebody coughed unahaclosp turned and saw perosteck balveda staggering from an alcove she was bent double holding her back and coughing her head was gashed and her skin looked the colour of ashes the drone floated over to her another survivor it said more to itself than to the woman it went to her side and used a field to support her the fumes in the air were choking the woman blood leaked from her forehead and there was a wet patch of red glistening on the back of the jacket she wore what she coughed who else her footsteps were unsteady and the drone had to support her as she stumbled over scattered pieces of the trains carriages and sections of track rocks littered the floor torn from the walls of the station during the impact yalsons dead unahaclosp said matteroffactly wubslin too probably horzas chasing xoxarle dont know about aviger didnt see him the mind is still alive i think it was moving anyway they approached the mind it lay bobbing up and down at one end every now and again as though trying to get into the air balveda tried to go over to it but the drone held her back leave it balveda it told her forcing her to keep heading up the platform her feet skidding on the debris she went on coughing her face contorted with pain youll suffocate in this atmosphere if you try to stay the drone said gently the mind can look after itself or if not there isnt anything you can do for it im all right balveda insisted she stopped straightened her face became calm and she stopped coughing the drone stopped too looking at her she turned to face it breathing normally her face still ashen but her expression serene she brought her hand away from her back covered in blood and with the other hand wiped some of the red fluid from her forehead and eye she smiled you see then her eyes closed she doubled at the waist and her head came swooping down towards the rock floor of the station as her legs buckled unahaclosp caught her neatly in midair before she hit the floor and floated her out of the platform area through the first set of side doors it found leading towards the control rooms and accommodation section balveda started to come round in the fresh air before they had gone more than ten metres along the tunnel explosions boomed behind them and the air moved in pulses along the gallery like beats of a huge erratic heart the lights flickered water started to drip then pour from the tunnel roof just as well i dont rust unahaclosp said to itself as it floated along the tube to the control room the woman stirring in its forcefield grip it heard the noise of firing laser fire but it couldnt tell whereabouts the firing was because the noise came from ahead and behind and above through ventilation outlets see im fine balveda muttered the drone let her move they were nearly at the control room and the air was still fresh the radiation level decreasing more explosions rocked the station balvedas hair and the fur on her jacket moved in the air current releasing flakes of foam water streamed down pattering and splashing the drone moved through the doors into the control room the rooms lights did not flicker and the air was clear no water flowed from the ceiling and only the womans body and its own casing dripped on the plasticcovered floor thats better unahaclosp said it laid the woman down on a chair more muffled detonations shuddered through the rock and the air lights flickered and flashed throughout the room from every console and panel the drone sat the culture woman up then gently shoved her head down between her knees and fanned her face the explosions boomed shaking the atmosphere in the room like like like stamping feet dumdrumdum dumdrumdum unahaclosp hauled balvedas head up and was about to scoop her from the chair when the footsteps from beyond the far door no longer masked by the sound of explosions from the station itself suddenly swelled in volume the doors were kicked open xoxarle wounded limping as he ran water streaming from his body cannoned into the room he saw balveda and the drone and headed straight for them unahaclosp rammed forward right at the idirans head xoxarle caught the machine in one hand and slammed it into a control console smashing screens and light panels in a fury of sparks and acrid smoke unahaclosp stayed there jammed halfway into the fused and spluttering switch assembly smoke pouring out around it balveda opened her eyes stared round her face bloodied and wild and frightened she saw xoxarle and started forward towards him opening her mouth but only coughing xoxarle grabbed her pinning her arms to her side he looked round to the doors he had smashed through pausing for a second to draw breath he was weakening he knew his keratinous back plates were almost burnt through where the changer had shot him and his leg was hit too slowing him all the time the human would catch him soon he looked into the face of the female he held and decided not to kill her immediately perhaps youll stay the little ones trigger finger xoxarle breathed holding balveda over his back with one arm and hobbling quickly to the door leading to the dormitories and accommodation section and then to the repair area he kneed the doors open and let them close behind him but i doubt it he added and hobbled down the short tunnel then through the first dormitory under the swaying nets in a bickering uncertain light as the sprinklers started to come on above in the control room unahaclosp pulled itself free its casing covered in burning pieces of plastic wire covering filthy bastard it said groggily wavering through the air away from the smoking console you walking cellmenagerie unahaclosp turned unsteadily through the smoke and made for the doors xoxarle had come through it hesitated there then with a sort of shaking shrugging motion moved away down the tunnel gathering speed horza had lost the idiran he had followed him down the tunnel then through some broken doors there was a choice then left right or ahead three short corridors lights flickering water showering from the roof smoke crawling under the ceiling in lazy waves horza had gone right the way the idiran would have gone if he was heading for the transit tubes and if he had worked out the right direction and if he didnt have some other plan but hed chosen the wrong way he held the gun tight in his hands his face ran with the false tears of the showering water the gun hummed through his gloves a swollen ball of pain rose from his belly filling his throat and his eyes and souring his mouth weighing in his hands clamping his teeth he stopped at another junction near the dormitories in an agony of indecision looking from one direction to another while the water fell and the smoke crept and the lights guttered he heard a scream and set off that way the woman struggled she was strong but still powerless even in his weakened grasp xoxarle limped along the corridor towards the great cavern balveda screamed tried to wriggle her way free then use her legs to kick at the idirans thighs and knees but she was held too tightly too high on xoxarles back her arms were pinned at her sides her legs could only beat against the keratin plate which curved out from the idirans rump behind her the sleepnets of the command systems builders swayed gently in the tides of air which swept through the long dormitory with each fresh explosion from the platform area and the wrecked trains she heard firing from somewhere behind them and doors at the far end of the long room blew out the idiran heard the noise too just before they crashed through the exit from the dormitory his head turned to glance back in the direction the noise had come from then they were in the short corridor and out onto the terrace which ran round the deep cavern of the repair and maintenance area on one side of the huge cavern a fallen tangled heap of smashed carriages and wrecked machinery blazed the train wubslin had started moving had been rammed into the rear of the train already in the long scoopedout alcove which hung over the cavern floor parts of both the front trains had scattered like toys down to the cavern floor piled against the walls crushed into the roof the foam fell through the cavern sizzling on the hot debris of the wreck where flames spilled up from crumpled carriages and sparks flashed xoxarle slipped on the terrace and for one second balveda thought they would both skid off its surface over the guard rails and down to the jumble of machinery and equipment on the cold hard floor below but the idiran steadied himself turned and pounded along the broad walkway towards the metal catwalk which crossed the breadth of the cavern and led over the far edge of the terrace into another tunnel the tunnel which led to the transit tubes she heard the idiran breathe her ringing ears caught the crackle of flames the hiss of foam and the laboured wheeze of xoxarles breath he held her easily as though she weighed nothing she cried out in frustration heaved her body with all her strength trying to break his grip or even just get an arm free struggling weakly they came to the suspended catwalk and again the idiran almost slipped then again caught himself in time and steadied he started along the narrow gantry his limping unsteady tread shaking it making it sound like a metal drum her back hurt as she strained xoxarles grip stayed firm then he skidded to a halt brought her round in front of his huge saddleface he held her by both shoulders for a moment then took her right arm by the elbow with one hand keeping hold of her right shoulder with the other fist he brought one knee out holding his thigh level with the cavern floor thirty metres below held by elbow and shoulder her weight taken by that one arm her back aching her head hardly clear she suddenly realised what he was going to do she screamed xoxarle brought the womans upper arm down across his thigh snapping it like a twig her cry broke like ice he took her by the wrist of her good arm and swung her out over the side of the catwalk sweeping her down beneath him and positioning her hand on a thin metal stanchion then he left her it was done in a second or two she swung like a pendulum under the metal bridge xoxarle ran off limping each step shaking the suspended gantry vibrated through the stanchion to balvedas hand loosening her grip she hung there her broken arm dangled uselessly at her side her hand gripped the cold smooth foamsmeared surface of the thin stanchion her head spun waves of pain she tried to but could not shut off crashed through her the cavern lights blinked out then came back on again another explosion shook the wrecked carriages xoxarle crossed the catwalk and ran hobbling over the terrace on the other side of the great cave into the tunnel her hand started to slip going numb her whole arm was going cold perosteck balveda twisted in the air put her head back and howled the drone stopped now the noises were from behind it had taken the wrong direction it was still fuddled xoxarle hadnt doubled back after all im a fool i shouldnt be allowed out by myself it turned its body over in the air of the tunnel leading away from the control room and the long dormitories slowed and stopped then powered back down the way it had come it could hear laser fire horza was in the control room it was clear of water and foam though smoke was coming from a large hole in one console he hesitated then heard another scream the sound of a human a woman and ran through the doors leading to the dormitories she tried to swing herself make a pendulum of her body and so hook a leg onto the gantry but the already injured muscles in her lower back could not do it the muscle fibres tore pain swamped her she hung she couldnt feel her hand foam settled on her upturned face and stung her eyes a series of explosions wracked the mangled heap of carriages making the air around her quiver shaking her she felt herself slip she dropped fractionally her grip moving down the stanchion a millimetre or two she tried to hold on tighter but could feel nothing noise came from the terrace she tried to look round and in a moment she saw horza racing along the terrace for the catwalk holding the gun he skidded on the foam and had to reach out with his free hand to steady himself horza she tried to shout but all that came out was a croak horza ran along the catwalk above her staring ahead his steps shook her band it had started to slip again horza she said again as loud as she could the changer ran on past her his face set the rifle raised his boots hammering the metal deck above her balveda looked down her head dropping her eyes closed horza kraiklyn that geriatric outworld minister on sorpen no piece or image of the changer nothing and nobody the man had ever been could have any desire to rescue her xoxarle seemed to have hoped some panhuman compassion would make horza stop and save her and so give the idiran a few precious extra moments to make his escape but the idiran had made the same mistake about horza that his whole species had made about the culture they were not that soft after all humans could be just as hard and determined and merciless as any idiran given the right encouragement im going to die she thought and was almost more surprised than terrified here now after all thats happened all ive done die just like that her numb hand loosened slowly around the stanchion the footsteps above her stopped returned she looked up horzas face was above her staring down at her she hung there twisting in the air for an instant while the man looked into her eyes the gun near his face horza glanced round over the catwalk where xoxarle had gone help she croaked he knelt and taking her hand pulled her up arms broken she choked as he caught her by the neck of her jacket and pulled her onto the surface of the suspended gantry she rolled over as he stood up foam drifted down through the wavering light and dark of the huge echoing cavern and flames cast momentary shadows when the lights guttered thanks she coughed that way horza looked round the way he had been heading the way xoxarle had gone she did her best to nod horza she said let him go horza was already backing off he shook his head no he said then turned and ran balveda curled up her numbed arm going to the broken one towards it but not touching it she coughed and put her hand to her mouth feeling inside spluttering she spat out a tooth horza crossed the catwalk he felt calm now xoxarle could delay him if he liked he could even let the idiran get to the transit tube then he would just step into the tubeway and fire at the retreating end of the transit capsule or blast the power off properly and trap the idiran it didnt matter he crossed the terrace and ran into the tunnel it led straight into the distance for over a kilometre the way to the transit tubes was off to the right somewhere but there were other doors and entrances places where xoxarle could hide it was bright and dry in the tunnel the lights flickered only slightly and the sprinkler system had remained off he thought of looking at the floor only just in time he saw the drips of water and foam while he ran towards a pair of doors which faced each other on either side of the tunnel the line of drips stopped there he was running too fast to stop he ducked instead xoxarles fist flicked through the air out from the lefthand doorway over the changers head horza turned and brought the gun to bear xoxarle stepped from the doorway and kicked out his foot caught the gun sending its barrel up into the changers face slamming into horzas mouth and nose while the gun sprayed laser fire over the mans head into the ceiling bringing a hail of rock dust and splinters down over the idiran and the human xoxarle reached out while the stunned man was staggering back he took the gun tearing it from horzas hands he turned it round and pointed it at horza as the man steadied himself against the wall with one hand his mouth and nose bleeding xoxarle tore the trigger guard from the gun unahaclosp raced through the control room banked in the air flashed through the smoke and past the smashed doors then darted down the short corridor it flew down the length of the dormitory between the swaying nets through another short tunnel and out onto the terrace there was wreckage everywhere it saw balveda on the catwalk sitting up holding one shoulder with the other hand then putting her hand down to the floor of the gantry unahaclosp tore through the air towards her but just before it got to her as her head was coming up to look at it the noise of laser fire came from the tunnel on the far side of the cavern the drone banked again and accelerated xoxarle pressed the trigger just as unahaclosp hit him from behind the gun hadnt even started to fire as xoxarle was thrown forward down to the floor of the tunnel he rolled over as he fell but the guns muzzle staved into the rock taking all the idirans weight for a moment the barrel snapped cleanly in two the drone stopped just short of horza the man was lunging forward for the idiran who was already recovering his balance and rearing up in front of them unahaclosp rushed forward again diving then zooming attempting an uppercut like the one that had caught the idiran out once before xoxarle fended off the machine with one swiping arm unahaclosp bounced off the wall like a rubber ball and the idiran swatted it once more sending the drone spinning back dented and crippled along the corridor towards the cavern horza dived forward xoxarle brought his fist down on the humans head as he lunged the changer swerved but not fast enough the glancing blow he received hit the side of his head and he crashed onto the floor scraping along the side of the wall and coming to rest in a doorway across the tunnel sprinklers spat from the ceiling near where horzas gun had fired into it xoxarle rounded on the fallen human who was trying to get to his feet his legs wobbly and unsure arms scrambling for purchase over the smooth rock walls the idiran brought up his leg to stamp his foot into horzas face then sighed and put his leg down again as the drone unahaclosp riding unevenly in the air its casing dented leaking smoke wobbling as it advanced came slowly back up the tunnel towards the idiran you animal unahaclosp croaked its small voice broken and harsh xoxarle reached out grabbed the machines front raised it easily in both hands over his head over horzas head the man looked up eyes unfocused then brought it down scything towards the mans skull horza rolled almost tiredly to one side and xoxarle felt the whimpering machine connect with horzas head and shoulder the man fell sprawling on the tunnel floor he was still alive one hand moved feebly to try to protect his naked bleeding head xoxarle turned raised the helpless drone high over the mans head once more and so he said quietly as he tensed his arms to bring the machine down xoxarle he looked up between his upraised arms while the drone struggled weakly in his hands and the man at his feet moved one hand slowly over his bloodmatted hair xoxarle grinned the woman perosteck balveda stood at the end of the tunnel on the terrace over the cavern she was stooped and her face looked limp and worn her right arm dangled awkwardly at her side the hand hanging by her thigh turned outwards in her other hand her fist seemed closed around something small which she was pointing at the idiran xoxarle had to look carefully to see what it was it resembled a gun a gun made mostly of air a gun of lines thin wires hardly solid at all more like a framework like a pencil outline somehow lifted from a page and filled out just enough to grip xoxarle laughed and brought the drone swooping down balveda fired the gun it sparkled briefly at the end of its spindly barrel like a small jewel caught in sunlight and made the faintest of coughing noises before unahaclosp had been moved more than a halfmetre through the air towards horzas head xoxarles midriff lit up like the sun the idirans lower torso was blown apart blasted from his hips by a hundred tiny explosions his chest arms and head were blown up and back hitting the tunnel roof then tumbling down again through the air the arms slackening the hands opening his belly keratin plates ripped open flooded entrails onto the waterspattered floor of the tunnel as his whole upper body bounced into the shallow puddles forming under the artificial rain what was left of his trunk section the heavy hips and the three bodythick legs stayed standing for a few seconds by themselves while unahaclosp floated quietly to the ceiling and horza lay still under the falling water now colouring in the puddles with purple and red as it washed his own and the idirans blood away xoxarles torso lay motionless where it fell two metres behind where his legs still stood then the knees buckled slowly as though only reluctantly giving in to the pull of gravity and the heavy hips settled over the splayed feet water splashed into the gory bowl of xoxarles sliced open pelvis bala bala bala unahaclosp mumbled stuck to the ceiling dripping water bala labalabalabla ha ha balveda kept the gun pointing at xoxarles broken body she walked slowly up the corridor splashing through the dark red water she stopped near horzas feet and looked dispassionately at xoxarles head and upper torso lying still on the tunnel floor blood and internal organs spilling from the fallen giants chest she sighted the gun and fired at the warriors massive head blowing it from his shoulders and blasting shattered pieces of keratin twenty metres up the tunnel the blast rocked her the echoes sang in her ears finally she seemed to relax shoulders drooping she looked up at the drone floating against the roof here am are downly upfloat falling ceilingwards bala bala ha ha unahaclosp said and moved uncertainly so there look i am finished im just whats my name whats the time bala bala hey the ho water lots of downly upmost ha ha and so on balveda knelt down by the fallen man she put the gun in a pocket and felt horzas neck he was still alive his face was in the water she heaved and pushed trying to roll him over his scalp oozed blood drone she said trying to stop the man from falling back into the water again help me with him she held horzas arm with her one good hand grimacing with pain as she used her other shoulder to roll him further over unahaclosp damn you help me bla bala bal ho the hey here am are am here are how do you dont ceiling roof inside outside ha ha bala bala the drone warbled still fast against the tunnel roof balveda finally got horza onto his back the false rain fell on his gashed face cleaning the blood from his nose and mouth one eye then the other opened horza balveda said moving forward so that her own head blocked out the falling water and the overhead light the changers face was pale save for the thin tendrils of blood leaking from mouth and nostrils a red tide came from the back and side of his head horza she said you won horza said slurring the words his voice quiet he closed his eyes balveda didnt know what to say she closed her own eyes shook her head bala bala the train now arriving at platform one drone horza whispered looking up past balvedas head she nodded she watched his eyes move back trying to look over his own forehead xoxarle he whispered what happened i shot him balveda said bala bala throw your out arms come out come in one more once the same is there anybody in here with what horzas voice was almost inaudible she had to bend closer to hear she took the tiny gun from her pocket this she said she opened her mouth showing him the hole where a back tooth had been memoryform the gun was part of me looks like a real tooth she tried to smile she doubted the man could even see the gun he closed his eyes clever he said quietly blood flowed from his head mingling with the purple wash from xoxarles dismembered body ill get you back horza balveda said i promise ill take you back to the ship youll be all right ill make sure youll be fine will you horza said quietly eyes closed thanks perosteck thanks bala bala bala steckoper tsahhor ahaunclops ho the hey hey the ho ho for all that think on we apologise for any inconvenience caused whats the wheres the hows the who where when why how and so dont worry balveda said she reached out and touched the mans wet face water washed off the back of the culture womans head down onto the changers face horzas eyes opened again flicking round staring at her then back towards the collapsed trunk of the idiran next up at the drone on the ceiling finally around him at the walls and the water he whispered something not looking at the woman what balveda said bending closer as the mans eyes closed again bala said the machine on the ceiling bala bala bala ha ha bala bala bala what a fool horza said quite clearly though his voice was fading as he lost consciousness and his eyes stayed closed what a bloody stupid fool he nodded his head slightly it didnt seem to hurt him splashes sent red and purple blood back up from the water under his head and onto his face then washed it all away again the jinmoti of the man muttered what balveda said again bending closer still danatre skehellis unahaclosp announced from the ceiling ro vleh graampt na zhire sko tre genebellis ro binitshire nasko voross amptfeniran har bala suddenly the changers eyes were wide open and on his face there appeared a look of the utmost horror an expression of such helpless fear and terror that balveda felt herself shiver the hairs on the back of her neck rising despite the water trying to plaster them there the mans hands came up suddenly and grabbed her thin jacket with a terrible clawing grip my name he moaned an anguish in his voice even more awful than that on his face whats my name bala bala bala the drone murmured from the ceiling balveda swallowed and felt tears sting behind her eyelids she touched one of those white clutching hands with her own its horza she said gently bora horza gobuchul bala bala bala bala said the drone quietly sleepily bala bala bala the mans grip fell away the terror ebbed from his face he relaxed eyes closing again mouth almost smiling bala bala ah yes horza whispered bala of course la consider phlebas balveda faced the snowfield it was night the moon of schars world shone brightly in a black starscattered sky the air was still sharp and cold and the clear air turbulence sat partly submerged in its own snowdrift across the white and moonlit plain the woman stood in the entrance to the darkened tunnels looked out into the night and shivered the unconscious changer lay on a stretcher she had made from plastic sheets salvaged from the train wreck and supported with the floating babbling drone she had bandaged his head that was all she could do the medkits like everything else on the pallet had been swept away by the train crash and buried in the cold foamcovered wreckage which filled station seven the mind could float she had found it hanging in the air over the platform in the station it was responding to requests but could not speak give a sign or propel itself she had told it to stay weightless then pulled and shoved it and the dronestretcher with the man on it to the nearest transit tube once in the small freight capsule the trip back took only half an hour she had not stopped for the dead she had strapped her broken arm up and splinted it tranceslept for a short while on the journey then manhandled her charges from the service tubes through the wrecked accommodation section to the unlit tunnels entrance where the dead changers lay still in aspects of frozen death she rested there a moment in the darkness before heading for the ship sitting on the floor of the tunnel where the snow had drifted in her back ached dully her head throbbed her arm was numb she wore the ring she had taken from horzas hand and hoped his suit and perhaps the drones electrics would identify them to the waiting ship as friends if not quite simply it would be the death of all of them she looked again at horza the face of the man on the stretcher was white as the snow and as blank the features were there eyes nose brows mouth but they seemed somehow unlinked and disconnected giving a look of anonymity to a face lacking all character animation and depth it was as though all the people all the characterisations all the parts the man had played in his life had leaked out of him in his coma and taken their own little share of his real self with them leaving him empty wiped clean the drone supporting the floating stretcher babbled briefly in a tongue balveda couldnt recognise its voice echoing down the tunnel then it fell silent the mind floated still and dull silver its patchy mirrorrainbow surface reflecting her the dim light outside and the man and the drone from its ellipsoid shape she got to her feet and with one hand pushed the stretcher out over the moonlit snow towards the ship her legs sinking into the whiteness up to her thighs a steelblue shadow of the struggling woman was thrown to one side in the silence away from the moon and towards the dark and distant mountains where a curtain of storm clouds hung like a deeper night behind the woman her tracks led back deep and scuffed to the tunnels mouth she cried quietly with the effort of it all and the numbing pain of her wounds a couple of times on her way she raised her head to the dark form of the ship a mixture of hope and fear on her face as she waited for the blast and splash of warning laser light which would tell her that the crafts autoguard did not accept her that the drone and horzas suit were both too damaged to be recognisable to the ship that it was over and she was doomed to die here a hundred metres from safety and escape but held from it by a set of faithful automatic unconscious circuits the lift swung down when she applied the ring from horzas hand to the elevator controls she put the drone and the man into the hold the drone murmured the man was quiet and motionless as a fallen statue she had intended to switch off the ships autoguard and go back immediately for the mind but the mans icy stillness frightened her she went for the emergency medical kit and turned up the heating in the hold but when she got back to the stretcher the cold blankfaced changer was dead appendices the idiranculture war the following three pages have been extracted from a short history of the idiran war english languagechristian calendar version original text ad unaltered edited by parharengyisa listach jaandeesih petrain dam kotosklo the work forms part of an independent noncommissioned but contactapproved earth extroinformation pack reasons the culture it was the culture knew from the start a religious war in the fullest sense the culture went to war to safeguard its own peace of mind no more but that peace was the cultures most precious quality perhaps its only true and treasured possession in practice as well as theory the culture was beyond considerations of wealth or empire the very concept of money regarded by the culture as a crude overcomplicated and inefficient form of rationing was irrelevant within the society itself where the capacity of its means of production ubiquitously and comprehensively exceeded every reasonable and in some cases perhaps unreasonable demand its not unimaginative citizens could make these demands were satisfied with one exception from within the culture itself living space was provided in abundance chiefly on mattercheap orbitals raw material existed in virtually inexhaustible quantities both between the stars and within stellar systems and energy was if anything even more generally available through fusion annihilation the grid itself or from stars taken either indirectly as radiation absorbed in space or directly tapped at the stellar core thus the culture had no need to colonise exploit or enslave the only desire the culture could not satisfy from within itself was one common to both the descendants of its original human stock and the machines they had at however great a remove brought into being the urge not to feel useless the cultures sole justification for the relatively unworried hedonistic life its population enjoyed was its good works the secular evangelism of the contact section not simply finding cataloguing investigating and analysing other less advanced civilisations but where the circumstances appeared to contact to justify so doing actually interfering overtly or covertly in the historical processes of those other cultures with a sort of apologetic smugness contact and therefore the culture could prove statistically that such careful and benign use of the technology of compassion to use a phrase in vogue at the time did work in the sense that the techniques it had developed to influence a civilisations progress did significantly improve the quality of life of its members without harming that society as a whole by its very contact with a more advanced culture faced with a religiously inspired society determined to extend its influence over every technologically inferior civilisation in its path regardless of either the initial toll of conquest or the subsequent attrition of occupation contact could either disengage and admit defeat so giving the lie not simply to its own reason for existence but to the only justificatory action which allowed the pampered selfconsciously fortunate people of the culture to enjoy their lives with a clear conscience or it could fight having prepared and steeled itself and popular opinion through decades of the former it resorted eventually inevitably like virtually any organism whose existence is threatened to the latter for all the cultures profoundly materialist and utilitarian outlook the fact that idir had no designs on any physical pan of the culture itself was irrelevant indirectly but definitely and mortally the culture was threatened not with conquest or loss of life craft resource or territory but with something more important the loss of its purpose and that clarity of conscience the destruction of its spirit the surrender of its soul despite all appearances to the contrary the culture not the idirans had to fight and in that necessity of desperation eventually gathered a strength which even if any real doubt had been entertained as to the eventual result could brook no compromise reasons the idirans the idirans were already at war conquering the species they regarded as inferior and subjugating them in a primarily religious empire which was only incidentally a commercial one as well it was clear to them from the start that their jihad to calm integrate and instruct these other species and bring them under the direct eye of their god had to continue and expand or be meaningless a halt or moratorium while possibly making at least as much sense as continued expansion in military commercial and administrative terms would negate such militant hegemonisation as a religious concept zeal outranked and outshone pragmatism as with the culture it was the principle which mattered the war long before it was finally declared was regarded by the idiran high command as a continuation of the permanent hostilities demanded by theological and disciplinary colonisation involving a quantitative and qualitative escalation of armed conflict of only a limited degree to cope with the relatively equivalent technological expertise of the culture while the idirans universally assumed that having made their point the people in the culture would back down a few of the idiran policymakers anticipated that should the culture prove as determined as a worst possible scenario projected a politically judicious settlement might be arrived at which would save face and have advantages for both sides this would involve a pact or treaty in which the idirans would effectively agree to slow or limit their expansion for a time thus allowing the culture to claim some but not too much success and provide the idirans with a a religiously justifiable excuse for consolidation which would both let the idiran military machine draw breath and cut the ground from beneath those idirans who objected to the rate and cruelty of idiran expansion and b a further reason for an increase in military expenditure to guarantee that in the next confrontation the culture or any other opponent could be decisively outarmed and destroyed only the most fervent and fanatical sections of idiran society urged or even contemplated a war to the finish and even so merely counselled continuing the fight against the culture after and despite the backdown and attempt to sue for peace which they too believed the culture must inevitably make having drawn up these nolose formulations of the likely course of events the idirans joined battle with the culture without qualm or hesitation at worst they perhaps considered that the war was being begun in an atmosphere of mutual incomprehension they could not have envisaged that while they were understood almost too perfectly by their enemy they had comprehensively misapprehended the forces of belief need even fear and morale operating within the culture the war briefly abstract of main text the first idiranculture dispute occurred in ad the second in in the culture built its first genuine warship for five centuries in prototype form only the official excuse was that the generations of mindgenerated warship models the culture had kept in development had evolved so far from the last warcraft actually built that it was necessary to test the match of theory and practice in the third dispute resulted in machine fatalities war was publicly discussed in the culture as a likelihood for the first time in the peace section of the culture split from the majority population while the anchramin pit conference resulted in the agreed withdrawal of forces a move which the more shortsighted idirans and culture citizens respectively condemned and acclaimed the fourth dispute began in and continued with the culture using proxy forces until when the war officially began and culture craft and personnel were directly involved the cultures war council of resulted in several other parts of the culture splitting away renouncing the use of violence under any circumstances the idiranculture war conduct agreement was ratified in in the homomda joined the war on the idiran side the homomda another tripedal species of greater galactic maturity than either the culture or the idirans had sheltered the idirans who had made up holy remnants during the second great exile bc following the skankatrianidiran war the remnants and their descendants became the homomdans most trusted crack groundtroops and following the idirans surprise return and retaking of idir in bc the two tripedal species continued to cooperate on terms that came closer to equality as idiran power increased the homomda joined with the idirans because they distrusted the growing power of the culture they were far from alone in having this feeling though unique in acting on it overtly while having relatively few disagreements with the humans and none of them serious it had been homomdan policy for many tens of thousands of years to attempt to prevent anyone group in the galaxy on their technological level from becoming overstrong a point they decided the culture was then approaching the homomda at no point devoted all their resources to the idiran cause they used part of their powerful and efficient space fleet to fill the gaps of quality left in the idiran navy it was made clear to the culture that if the humans attacked homomdan home planets only then would the war become total indeed limited diplomatic and cultural relations were maintained and some trade continued between the homomda and the culture throughout the war miscalculations the idirans thought they could win alone and so with homomdan support assumed they would be invincible the homomda thought their influence would tip the balance in the idirans favour though would never have been prepared to risk their own future to defeat the culture anyway and the culture minds had guessed that the homomda would not join with the idirans calculations concerning the wars duration cost and benefits had been made on this assumption during the wars first phase the culture spent most of its time falling back from the rapidly expanding idiran sphere completing its warproduction changeover and building up its fleet of warships for those first few years the war in space was effectively fought on the culture side by its general contact units not designed as warships but sufficiently well armed and more than fast enough to be a match for the average idiran ship in addition the cultures field technology had always been ahead of the idirans giving the gcus a decisive advantage in terms of damage avoidance and resistance these differences to some extent reflected the two sides general outlooks to the idirans a ship was a way of getting from one planet to another or for defending planets to the culture a ship was an exercise in skill almost a work of art the gcus and the warcraft which gradually replaced them were created with a combination of enthusiastic flair and machineorientated practicality the idirans had no answer to even if the culture craft themselves were never quite a match for the better homomdan ships for those first years nevertheless the gcus were vastly outnumbered that opening stage also saw some of the wars heaviest losses of life when the idirans surpriseattacked many warirrelevant culture orbitals occasionally producing billions of deaths at a time as a shock tactic this failed as a military strategy it deflected even more resources from the already stretched idiran navys main battle groups which were experiencing great difficulty in finding and successfully attacking the distant culture orbitals rocks factory craft and general systems vehicles which were responsible for producing the cultures materiel at the same time the idirans were attempting to control the vast volumes of space and the large numbers of usually reluctant and often rebellious lesser civilisations the cultures retreat had left at their mercy in the war conduct agreement was amended to forbid the destruction of populated nonmilitary habitats and the conflict continued in a marginally more restrained fashion until near the end the war entered its second phase in the idirans were still struggling to consolidate their gains the culture was finally on a war footing a period of protracted struggle ensued as the culture struck deep into the idiran sphere and idiran policy oscillated between trying to defend what they had and build up their strength and mounting powerful but defenceweakening expeditions into the rest of the galaxy attempting to inflict hopedfor body blows upon a foe which proved frustratingly elusive the culture was able to use almost the entire galaxy to hide in its whole existence was mobile in essence even orbitals could be shifted or simply abandoned populations moved the idirans were religiously committed to taking and holding all they could to maintaining frontiers to securing planets and moons above all to keeping idir safe at any price despite homomdan recommendations the idirans refused to fall back to more rational and easily defended volumes or even to discuss peace the war toedandfroed for over thirty years with many battles pauses attempts to promote peace by outsiders and the homomda great campaigns successes failures famous victories tragic mistakes heroic actions and the taking and retaking of huge volumes of space and numbers of stellar systems after three decades however the homomda had had enough the idirans made as intransigent allies as they had obedient mercenaries and the culture ships were exacting too high a toll on the prized homomdan space fleet the homomda requested and received certain guarantees from the culture and disengaged from the war from that point on only the idirans thought the eventual result much in question the culture had grown to enormous strength during the struggle and accumulated sufficient experience in those thirty years to add to all the vicarious experience it had collected over the previous few thousand to rob the idirans of any real or perceived advantage in cunning guile or ruthlessness the war in space effectively ended in and the war on the thousands of planets left to the idirans conducted mostly with machines on the cultures side officially terminated in though small sporadic engagements on backwater planets conducted by idiran and medjel forces ignorant or scornful of the peace continued for almost three centuries idir was never attacked and technically never surrendered its computer network was taken over by effector weapons and freed of designedin limitations upgraded itself to sentience to become a culture mind in all but name of the idirans some killed themselves while others went into exile with the homomda who agreed to employ them but refused to help them prepare for further strikes against the culture or set up independent nominally nonmilitary habitats within other spheres of influence under the cultures eye or set off in escaped ships for littleknown parts of the clouds or for andromeda or accepted the
