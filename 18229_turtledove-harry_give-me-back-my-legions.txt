give me back my legions harry turtledove to gwyn morgan ron mellor and hal drake i rome brawled around publius quinctilius varus half a dozen stalwart lectiarii bore his sedan chair through the streets towards augustus house on the palatine hill the slaves wore matching red tunics their smooth skillful broken step kept him from feeling the bumps in the cobblestoned roadway varus could have lowered the sedan chairs curtains that would have given him privacy in the midst of untold tens of thousands but he didnt mind being seen not today anyone could tell at a glance that he was someone important a wagon full of sacks of grain drawn by two plodding oxen blocked his path the ungreased axles squealed and groaned a man could die of old age stuck behind something like that his slaves werent about to put up with it one of the pedisequi who accompanied the litter a roman aristocrat was too special to carry whatever he might need but had underlings to do it for him called out in greekaccented latin make way there make way for the litter of publius quinctilius varus in narrow winding streets packed with people on foot donkeys carts and other wagons making way for anybody wasnt easy the grayhaired man driving the wagon didnt even try to the crows with him whoever he is he shouted back his accent said he was a samnite or oscan by birth whoever he is how dare you you peasant you the pedisequus knew no worse abuse he was as furious as if hed been insulted himself the master was the sun the slave was the moon and shone his reflected light varus man went on i will have you know he was consul twenty years ago consul i tell you he is just returned to rome after governing the province of syria and he is married to augustus grandniece gods help you wretch if he has to ask your name the wagon driver lashed his oxen he also flicked the lash at a couple of middleaged women to make them get out of the way they screeched abuse at him but they moved the wagon slid into the space theyd occupied the litter and its retinue glided past nicely done aristocles varus said the pedisequus thrust out his chin and thrust out his chest and marched along as if he were ten cubits tall and eight cubits wide not a balding weedy little greek quinctilius varus smiled to himself as with anything else there were tricks to getting the most out of your slaves judicious praise at the right moment could do more good than a denarius aristocles did more shouting as the litter made its way toward the palatine too many people and not enough room for all of them that was rome musicians strummed citharae or played flutes hoping passersby would throw them enough coins to keep them fed scribes stood at streetcorners ready to write for people who lacked their letters hucksters shouted their wares figs candied in honey beads fine glass beads from egypt bread and cheese and oil kohl to make your eyes pretty roasted songbirds who wants roasted songbirds amulets will give you luck wine genuine falernian varus guffawed so did his bearers the pedisequi men who made much of their dignity only shook their heads no one but a fool would think a scrawny street merchant lugging an amphora had wine fit for augustus himself whatever was in that jug would taste like vinegar if it didnt taste like piss when the litter finally reached the palatine hill traffic thinned out this had been a prosperous part of town for many years important people proper romans lived here you didnt see so many trousered gauls and swarthy jews and excitable numidians on the palatine people from all over the empire swarmed to rome hoping to strike it rich no one had ever found a way to keep them out too bad varus thought and the palatine became all the more exclusive when augustus master of the roman world took up residence on the hillside he had dominated the empire for more than a third of a century now senators still pined for the days of the republic when they were the biggest fish in the pond most people didnt remember those days any more most of the ones who did remembered round after round of civil war hardly anyone except those senators would have traded augustus peace and prosperity for the chaos it replaced quinctilius varus knew he wouldnt he was part of the new order one of the many whod risen high by going along with the man who had whod won the power to bind and to loose he couldnt have done better under the republic rome couldnt have done better under the republic but rome mattered less to varus than varus did his father sextus quinctilius varus had thought differently hed killed himself at philippi along with brutus and cassius after they lost against antony and octavian who was not yet calling himself augustus almost fifty years ago now publius had been a boy he was lucky the victors hadnt proscribed the losers families he nodded solemnly he was lucky a lot of ways soldiers guarded augustus residence augustus was no fool he was about as far from a fool as a man could be he knew some people still resented his mastery of rome three cohorts of praetorian troops about men were stationed in the city to protect him six more cohorts were based in nearby towns the armored men in front of the doorway unmistakably separated his house from all the others on the palatine some of the guards were italians others tall and fair had to be gauls or germans in its way it was a sensible arrangement rome as rome meant nothing to the barbarians augustus as their paymaster and commander did who are you what do you want here the biggest and blondest of them asked his accent guttural as varus litter came up aristocles answered for varus my master is publius quinctilius varus the exconsul he is to meet with augustus this afternoon he didnt throw his masters rank in the germans face as he had with the wagon driver the praetorian after all served a man with a higher rank yet with the highest rank but even someone summoned to meet with augustus was a man of some consequence and his pedisequus therefore a slave of some consequence you wait here we check the guard said he spoke in his own sonorous tongue one of the other soldiers ducked inside it will be all right boys varus told the lectiarii you can put me down now gently the bearers lowered the sedan chair to the ground varus got out and stretched unlike his slaves he wore a toga not a tunic he rearranged the drape of the garment at the same time not quite accidentally he flashed the purple stripe that marked his status the soldier returned and said something in the germans language to the man in charge of the detachment that worthy inclined his head to varus you may go in now sir he said respect ousting practiced suspicion from his voice good varus left it at that he never knew how to talk to augustus guards they werent equals by the nature of things they couldnt be equals but they werent insignificant people either a puzzlement as soon as he and his two pedisequi went inside one of augustus civilian slaves took charge of them varus was sure someone else would bring his bearers into the shade and give them something cool to drink a great house and there was none greater took care of such things as a matter of course i hope you are well sir augustus slave said politely yes thank you varus enquired not about the slaves health but about his masters i hope augustus is too with a hint of a smile the slave answered he says a man who gets as old as he is is either well or dead that held considerable truth and truth told with augustus usual pith the ruler of the roman world was seventy an age many aspired to and few reached hed had several serious illnesses in his earlier days but recovered from them all and hed outlived the younger men hed expected to succeed him varus in his early fifties already felt the first hints that the proud strength of his youth would not last forever and might not last much longer and hed enjoyed good health most of his life the main exceptions being a couple of bad teeth that finally needed the dentists forceps he shuddered and tried to forget those times the slave led him and his attendants to a small room on the north side of a courtyard a roofed colonnade shielded it from direct sun but the broad doorway still let in plenty of light the slave darted in ahead of varus his voice floated out through the doorway sir quinctilius varus is here to see you well bring him in augustus voice was mushy over the years hed had more trouble with his teeth than varus had at the slaves gesture varus and his pedisequi walked into the room where augustus waited despite his years the ruler of the roman world moved very gracefully he stood so straight he seemed uncommonly tall although he wasnt he wore a toga of solid purple a luxury hed reserved for himself alone good day sir varus said bowing his slaves bowed deeper bending almost double as he straightened he went on how may i serve you today well get there dont worry augustus turned and waved towards a chair in the meantime sit down make yourself at home seen full on his broad face seemed mild and unassuming in profile though the harsh curve of his nose warned there was more to him than first met the eye thank you sir varus said the pedisequi stood on either side of his chair augustus eased himself down into a larger chair with a cushion on the seat one of his slaves brought in refreshments green figs sardines and watered wine hed always had simple taste in food as he and varus nibbled he asked how is claudia shes fine sir varus answered she sends her greatuncle her love if his wife hadnt sent it varus would have said she had anyhow thats good augustus smiled showing off his bad teeth a lock of hair almost entirely white now flopped down over his right eye varus whose hairline had retreated farther than aristocles was jealous of augustus smiling still the older man went on shes a pretty girl she is yes varus could say that in all sincerity his wife was called claudia pulchra claudia the goodlooking it made what had been a marriage of convenience more enjoyable hows your son augustus asked hes studying in athens right now varus smiled too whenever he writes he wants money what else do children want from their father augustus said with a wry chuckle still we have to civilize them if we can he spoke the last sentence in fluent greek thats the truth varus replied in the same language dropping back into latin he continued i couldnt have managed anything in syria if i didnt know greek only our soldiers there know any latin and some of them do better in greek too augustus sipped from his wine it was watered more than varus enjoyed augustus had always been a temperate man you did well in syria he said as he set down the cup thank you very much sir its a rich province varus had been staggered to discover how rich syria was places like that showed him italy was only a new land rome claimed to have been founded years earlier but it had been a prominent place for only three centuries some of the syrian towns went back thousands of years long before the trojan war and the wealth they held varus went into syria poor and came out prosperous without being especially corrupt you did so well there in fact that ive got another province for you augustus said sir varus leaned forward he had all he could do not to show too much of his excitement after youd been governor of syria where could you go achaea it wasnt so rich as syria but it held more cachet than any other province it was under senatorial administration not formally augustus to control but if he asked the conscript fathers to honor his kinsman by marriage how could they say no or maybe egypt egypt belonged to augustus he wouldnt dream of letting the senators get their hands on the place egypt made syria seem poor by comparison if you served as augustal prefect in egypt you were set for life and so were all your heirs yes the ruler of the roman world leaned forward too germany he said germany varus hoped his disappointment didnt show hed been thinking of civilized places comfortable places places where a man could enjoy himself could live its a long way from well everywhere sir that was as much of a protest as varus would allow himself i know it is and i know it will be a bit of a shock after syria no augustus was nobodys fool when he was very young antony made the fatal mistake of underestimating him everyone who made that mistake was sorry afterwards but afterwards was commonly too late of course augustus would have a good idea of what varus was thinking right now im sorry he said i am sorry but i need someone i can trust there it just hasnt shaped up the way i wish it would have ill do my best sir if thats what you want varus said gods how will i tell claudia he wondered the fit shed throw would make facing overgrown blond savages seem delightful it also made him give evasion another try shouldnt you perhaps think of someone with ah more military experience id send tiberius but hes busy putting down the uprising in pannonia augustus replied hes finally getting somewhere too why the pannonians couldnt see theyd be better off under roman rule but they couldnt and so he has to show them im glad to hear hes doing well varus said he wished tiberius were doing better still so he could deal with the germans plainly though that wouldnt happen which meant varus was stuck with it which meant he had to make the best of it if there was any best to be made when my father conquered gaul he did it in one campaign and the conquest stuck augustus said fretfully he was julius caesars sisters grandson but he was also caesars heir and adopted son and hed taken advantage of that for more than half a century now the comparison still had to weigh on him though for he went on ive been sending armies into germany the past twenty years they mostly win when they fight the germans but the country isnt subdued yet and it needs to be a frontier that runs from the elbe to the danube is much shorter and easier to garrison and cheaper to maintain than the one weve got now on the rhine and the danube i could hold it with far fewer soldiers yes sir varus suspected augustus had got to the root of things right there augustus had been cutting the army down to size ever since winning supreme power paying soldiers was the most expensive thing the roman government did a shorter frontier would mean he didnt have to pay so many of them besides augustus added the germans are a pack of troublemakers they sneak over the rhine and raid gaul they helped stir up the pannonian rebels theyve given them aid and comfort too i want them suppressed its about time weve played games with them for too cursed long a cold wind seemed to blow through the little room youll answer for it if you dont suppress them augustus didnt say that but varus knew he meant it the ruler of the roman world rewarded success he punished failure failure of every kind his own daughter julia had languished on a hot miserable island for years because of infidelity and vice no he didnt fancy people who couldnt live up to what he expected of them licking his lips varus asked what kind of force will i have to bring the germans into line three legions augustus answered the xvii the xviii and the xix theyre all solid outfits id give you even more if tiberius didnt have a fullsized war on his hands but three should be plenty for the job we have made progress in germany we just havent made enough three legions varus echoed after augustus cuts there were only thirty all through the empire excitement coursed through the younger man he would command close to twenty thousand elite soldiers once he pacified germany people might not think of him in the same breath as julius caesar but they would remember him theyd remember him forever he inclined his head to his wifes greatuncle i wont let you down sir i wouldnt give you the men if i thought you would augustus said arminius led half a cohort of german auxiliaries down a trail in western pannonia a town called poetovio lay not far away the roman legion to which his germans were attached had retaken it from the pannonian rebels a few days before deserters from the enemy said the pannonians wanted to take it back their warriors still prowled the neighborhood keep your eyes open arminius called in his own guttural language we dont want these barbarians giving us a nasty surprise some of the germans chuckled as far as the romans were concerned they were even more barbarous than the pannonians but theyd taken service with rome why not augustus was a good paymaster the pannonian rebels werent which meant that few germans had gone over to them one of the soldiers said nothing to fear in open woods like these the rebels couldnt set up a proper ambush even if they wanted to keep your eyes open anyway arminius answered the other german nodded but it was the kind of nod a man gave a chief he was humoring arminius recognized it hed used that kind of nod often enough himself and the other warrior had reason enough to use it here by german standards these woods were open pannonia lay south of the danube and also well to the east of the lands of the cherusci arminius tribe it was warmer drier country than he was used to woods here were full of oak and ash and other broadleafed trees they were nothing like the dark forests of germany with pines and spruces growing close together with a formidable understory of bushes and ferns and marshes and swamps and bogs ready to swallow up a traveler unwary enough to wander off the track rome had pushed her border up to the danube in these parts only a generation earlier not long after the legions reached the rhine tidy thrifty augustus wanted to push east to the elbe which would shorten the frontier by hundreds of miles and let him use fewer legions to garrison it the pannonians hadnt much minded at first not till they saw that permanent occupation went hand in hand with higher taxes than theyd ever known till they discovered they were enslaved in other words then they rose under two men named bato and a third called pinnes theyd put up a good fight but the romans were wearing them down at last augustus aimed to enslave germany too the german tribes hadnt yielded as much as the pannonians had before they rebelled they loved their freedom germans did even so quite a few of them would have welcomed slavery if it came with wine and silver drinking cups and gold coins to make them feel important and obviously quite a few of them took service in the roman auxiliaries some sought adventure some wanted to bring silver back to germany when they went home and some didnt aim to go home but to win roman citizenship after twenty years of service and to settle inside the empire most of the germans with arminius were dressed romanstyle he was himself he wore hobnailed caligae on his feet a jingling mailshirt covered by a kneelength wool cloak and an iron helmet whose crest which ran from ear to ear rather than front to back showed him to be an officer which he was and a chiefs son to boot the troopers he commanded had on cheap bronze versions of the standard legionary helmet they carried oval shields like his which covered less of them than the ones the romans used themselves their weapons though were the ones theyd brought from germany they all carried spears longer and stouter than the javelins roman soldiers used german spears were good for thrusting as well as throwing and german swords made for slashing were half again as long as the stubby thrustingswords the legionaries preferred since germans ran at least a palms breadth taller than romans and had correspondingly longer arms they had more reach with their blades than legionaries did but roman soldiers could do wicked work with those gladii of theirs arminius had seen as much in this campaign against the pannonian rebels and before that in clashes with the romans inside germany his own folk who fought to show off each warriors individual bravery often mocked the romans for slavish obedience to their officers they were no cowards though arminius had also seen that for himself and because they worked so well together the romans could do things in war that his own folk could not germans who hadnt come into the empire had no idea how vast it was or how smoothly it ran arminius had signed up as an auxiliary to learn the romans tricks of the trade so to speak and bring what he could back to germany hed got more of a military education than hed dreamt of before he left the forests of his homeland too the pannonians had also learned the roman style of fighting theyd made a point of it in fact when arminius and his followers came out of the woods and looked across the rolling meadow beyond he saw a few scrawny sheep grazing on the lush summer grass and beyond them a knot of eighty or a hundred men in chainmail and cloaks and helmets he peered at them frowning were they legionaries and allies or pannonians and enemies it wasnt easy to tell at first glance they seemed in no doubt about his men they started away from the germans as fast as they could go in their commanders caligae arminius would have done the same thing his force outnumbered theirs by about two to one after them boys he yelled good fighting good looting the auxiliaries raised a cheer and swarmed across the broad meadow after the pannonians and then about a quarter of a mile to the south a force of legionaries about the size of his also emerged from the woods they were the outliers of the legion to which arminius auxiliaries were attached as soon as the roman soldiers spotted the pannonians they also cheered and began to pursue one of their officers waved to the germans as if to make sure his force and theirs were on the same side arminius waved back not without resignation auxiliaries and legionaries together theyd make short work of the hapless pannonians but the germans would have to share whatever loot there was with the romans and whod ever heard of a roman who wasnt greedy an average pannonian was as quick on his feet as an average german or roman even though the romans had short legs they were formidable marchers but that wasnt what a pursuit was about if the pannonians wanted to stick together and not get cut down one at a time they had to move at the pace of their slowest men the romans and germans on their trail steadily chewed up the ground between the forces one of the pannonians shouted something arminius heard the words clearly but couldnt understand them that proved the enemy was the enemy like most of the auxiliaries with him arminius had grown fluent in latin he still sometimes muttered to himself going through a declension or conjugation but he made himself understood and he followed what romans said to him pannonian on the other hand was only gibberish to him and to the romans as well the rebels stopped retreating and formed a battle line long odds against them longer arminius thought than those against throwing a triple six in a dice game but sometimes long odds were better than sure ruin and sure ruin faced the pannonians if they kept trying to run away maybe a fierce charge would make their pursuers think twice maybe but arminius didnt believe it not for a moment be ready he called to his fellow germans theyre going to try to bull through us let them try one of the big fair men said several others nodded arminius smiled no his folk had never been one to back away from a fight that officer shouted something sure as demons the pannonians charged arminius band not the legionaries the germans looks bronze helmets and smaller shields all declared them auxiliaries rather than regulars the enemy officer had to think that made them the easier target well he could think whatever he pleased thinking it didnt make it so sedatus the pannonians yelled and succellus one of those was their fire god the other was a smith who carried a hammer they were using sharper tools now they showed almost roman discipline as they bore down on the germans his own men fought with better discipline than they would have back in their native forests past that arminius indulged in no comparisons with numbers on their side and with the legionaries swinging up to help them it shouldnt matter much of course even if the germans and romans would win in the end a man still might get killed in the middle of the fight the pannonians loosed a volley of javelins at arminius auxiliaries a german screamed when one of the light spears pierced his right arm another javelin thudded into arminius shield the pannonians had copied roman practice to the extent of using a long shank of soft iron on their javelins the shank bent when the javelin went home arminius couldnt throw it back and yanking it out of the shield would take time he didnt have he threw the fouled shield aside fighting without one would have bothered a roman it left arminius more vulnerable but it didnt bother him a bit he was used to going into battle with no more than spear and sword he jabbed at the man in front of him the pannonian used his big heavy legionarystyle shield well holding it between arminius spear and his vitals his stabbing sword flicked out like a vipers tongue but he couldnt reach arminius with it not when the germans spear made him keep his distance they might have danced like that for some little while each trying to figure out how to spill the others blood they werent alone on the battlefield though another german threw a fistsized rock that clanged off the pannonians helmet without the ironworks on his head it would have smashed in his skull as things were he staggered and lurched like a man whod just taken a fist to the chin he dropped his guard too arminius sprang forward and jabbed his spear into the fellows thigh just below his ironstudded leather kilt the pannonian howled in pain he crumpled like a discarded sheet of papyrus a comparison that never would have occurred to arminius before joining the auxiliaries the german chief stabbed again aiming to finish him but even wounded the pannonian was wily he used his shield like a turtles shell covering himself with it as best he could arminius went on to fight another man the wounded pannonian couldnt get away once the fight was over somebody would cut his throat or smash in his head all the wiliness in the world wouldnt save him then even among germans arminius was a big man the pannonian he came up against next was even bigger and much thicker through the shoulders the fellow screamed something at him since it was in the pannonian language arminius understood not a word of it seeing as much the warrior shouted again this time in latin futter your mother your mother was a dog and your father shat in her twat arminius retorted latin wasnt his language either which hadnt kept him from learning to swear in it roaring with rage the big burly pannonian rushed at him he aimed to knock arminius down with his heavy shield and then stab him or if he was furious enough kick him to death what he aimed for wasnt what he got arminius sidestepped like a dancer and then used a flick of his spearpoint to tear out the pannonians throat it was as pretty and precise a stroke as hed ever made he was proud of it for days afterwards blood fountained from the pannonians neck he clutched at his throat trying to stem the tide of gore it was no use arminius knew a killing stroke when he gave one the big mans knees went limp as overcooked cabbage he fell and his armor clattered about him romans liked to say things like that it was a line from a poem though arminius thought the poem was in greek not latin he knew there was such a thing as greek and that romans with a fancy education spoke it but it remained a closed scroll to him and he had no time to worry about poetry anyhow whether in greek latin or his own tongue another pannonian was trying to murder him the mans thrust almost pierced him the son of a whore even fought like a roman the fellow sheltered behind his own big scutum beating down his guard wouldnt be easy arminius slashes gashed the thick leather facing of the pannonians shield but that didnt harm it and certainly didnt harm him then the legionaries slammed into the rebels flank after that the fight wasnt a fight any more it was a rout the pannonians realized what they should have seen sooner they were desperately outnumbered out in the open and had no hope of reinforcement nor any strongpoint to which they might escape they were in a word trapped arminius foe suddenly had to face two other german auxiliaries as the men theyd been fighting took to their heels he had no trouble holding off one foe he couldnt turn enough directions at once to hold off three one of the other germans hamstrung him he went down with a wail arminius stroke across his throat finished him off this is the way its supposed to work said the auxiliary whod wounded him wiping blood from his blade on a grassy tussock by the gods it is arminius agreed lets finish the rest of them the looting should be good so it should we dont want to let those roman greedyguts take more than their share either the way they like to do the other man said i was thinking the same thing a little while ago arminius replied come on we dont want to let any of these cursed fools get away he loped after the pannonians who were frankly fleeing now the westering sun stretched his shadow out ahead of him the other germans followed war made a grand game when you were winning quinctilius varus stepped from the gangplank to the pier with a sigh of relief he didnt like traveling by ship which didnt mean he couldnt do it at need hed got from ostia romes port to massilia by sea faster than he could have by land the rest of the journey up to the legions base by the rhine would have to be by land he wished he could just close his eyes and appear there for that matter he wished he could close his eyes and have somebody else appear there but he was the man augustus wanted in that spot the man augustus wanted doing that job it was an honor all of his friends said so they all seemed glad it was an honor he had and they didnt none of them had shown the slightest desire to accompany him to the frontier neither had his wife if my greatuncle said you have to go to germany then you do claudia pulchra had said he didnt say anything about my going and i dont intend to shed made him very happy in bed till his sailing time came round he hoped she wasnt making someone else very happy in bed right now or if she was he hoped she was discreet about it if augustus could send his own daughter to an island for being too open too shameless with her adulteries he wouldnt think twice about banishing a grandniece no matter what claudia pulchra was doing varus had to make the best of things here he looked at massilia from the pier and found himself pleasantly surprised not too bad he said not too good either aristocles said darkly the pedisequus liked sailing even less than varus did his stomach rebelled on the water he didnt seem to realize he was on dry land again at last but varus meant what hed said massilia wasnt rome no other place came close not even alexandria or antioch or athens but it was a perfectly respectable provincial town greeks had settled the southern coast of gaul somewhere not long after rome was founded and gallia narbonensis had been a roman province much longer than the wilder lands farther north true caesars soldiers had besieged and sacked massilia a lifetime ago when it made the mistake of backing pompey it had recovered since though and was prosperous again the temple to apollo near the center of town was particularly fine dominating the view from the harbor who will you be sir a dockside lounger asked varus in greekaccented latin i can tell youre somebody and no mistake i am publius quinctilius varus the new governor of germany on my way from rome to take my post there varus answered grandly he nodded to aristocles who flipped the lounger a coin will you be good enough to let the local leaders know i have arrived the man popped the coin into his mouth most people carried small change between their cheek and jaw varus had himself in his younger days aristocles handled mundanities like money now i sure will your honor the massiliote said and hurried away if he took the silver and disappeared well what could varus do about it nothing much but the fellow proved as good as his word before long both of the towns duumvirs its paired executives as consuls were the paired executives in rome as a whole hurried to the harbor to greet their distinguished visitor by their latin they were italians not greeks one was tall and lean the other short and stocky varus forgot their names as soon as he heard them the tall one sold olive oil all over gaul the stocky one sold wine or maybe it was the other way around each duumvir invited him to a feast that evening by the way they glared at each other the one whose house he didnt choose would hate him forever after so he said ill stay a couple of days before going north why dont i have my slave toss a coin to see which of you i visit first as hed hoped that satisfied them both you know how to grease things dont you your excellency said the tall one yes quinctilius varus thought he was the one who sold oil i try varus answered can you grease things up in germany the squat one asked which confused varus all over again i intend to try he said can you gentlemen tell me what its like up by the rhine almost in unison they shook their heads they were italians sure enough a greek would have dipped his to show he meant no the tall one said you wouldnt catch me up there not unless augustus ordered me there i mean he made a quick recovery then he continued id rather stay here the weathers better not so chilly not so damp and there arent any savages around here my job is to turn them into provincials varus said good fortune go with you the two duumvirs said together it wasnt good luck and youll need it you poor sorry son of a whore but it might as well have been the germans do buy wine the stocky one added not much of a market there for oil im afraid they use butter instead he made a face to show what he thought of that since varus thought the same thing he made a face too if butter didnt mark a true barbarian what did and they drink beer the tall one said which answered that question he went on they like wine better though when they can get hold of it who wouldnt varus said both duumvirs nodded maybe you can teach them to like olive oil too the short one said the gauls use more of it than they did before caesar conquered them if i can pacify the germans theyre welcome to keep eating butter as far as im concerned varus exclaimed i can see that the stocky duumvir said judiciously maybe you dont have the biggest load on your shoulders this side of atlas holding up the heavens but not far from it eh varus thought the same thing though augustus didnt seem to he couldnt tell these fellows how he felt or it might get back to the ruler of the roman world things had an unfortunate way of doing that he wanted augustus to go on having confidence in him which meant he had to act like a man who had confidence in augustus he said by all the reports that have come down to rome theres been real progress the past few years ive got to put the stopper in the jug and seal it with pitch thats all the duumvirs glanced at each other for a moment varus had the feeling they didnt like each other much but they thought the same way good fortune go with you they chorused again and he was sure it meant the same thing this time as it had before ii vultures and ravens and carrion crows spiraled down from the sky the legions and auxiliaries had spread out a feast for the scavengers here near poetovio but the birds and the little foxes that peered out from the edge of the oak woods not far away couldnt fill their bellies quite yet romans and german auxiliaries still strode about the battlefield plundering corpses and making sure all the pannonians sprawled there were corpses not far from arminius another german auxiliary drove his spear into a feebly writhing mans throat when the man quit wiggling the german bent and took his helmet it was a fine piece of ironmongery far better than the cheap bronze helms the romans issued to auxiliaries the other german set the helm on his own head catching arminius eye he grinned fits like it was made for me he said a god made it so arminius said may you have better luck with it than the fellow who wore it before something glinted in the lateafternoon sunshine a dead pannonian wore a heavy gold ring in his left car stooping arminius pulled on the ring till it tore through the flesh of the earlobe it hardly got any blood on it the enemy warrior must have died early in the fight arminius weighed the bauble in the palm of his hand it had to be worth a couple of aurei he stuck it into a belt pouch somebody had driven a spear clean through the dead mans mailshirt arminius nodded to himself that stroke deserved respect he had no doubt he could have matched it in his early twenties he was at the peak of his strength and also though he didnt think of it that way at the peak of his arrogance but not many men could have a moment later he nodded again the way the pannonians had fought back against the germans and romans also deserved respect the romans were unlikely to give it arminius did hed seen not for the first time how the pannonians had imitated roman fighting methods till they could stand up against the toughest soldiers in the world do you think we could have fought this well chlodovegius he asked he made a point of learning the names of the men he led chlodovegius had taken off his new helmet and was admiring it he looked up that many of us against so many romans wedve licked em he made as if to draw his long straight sword for a bit of cut and thrust he was a few years older than arminius but he didnt lack for arrogance either arminius smiled well maybe we would have he didnt feel like arguing but he also didnt believe chlodovegius one german had an excellent chance against one roman ten romans had the edge on ten germans a hundred romans would massacre a hundred germans they would in open country like this anyhow in the forests and swamps of germany ambushes and harassment came easier the romans could send troops through germany theyd been doing that since arminius was a little boy but theyd never been able to hold down the countryside which didnt mean they didnt keep trying what will we do if the romans turn our country our homeland into one of their provinces arminius wasnt really asking chlodovegius he was thinking out loud but the other german heard him and laughing answered what are you worrying about were already halfway to turning into romans if we serve out our terms in the auxiliaries theyll make us citizens theyd already made arminius a citizen he came from a chieftains family theyd even made him a member of the equestrian order the social class one rank below the senators who helped their chieftain augustus rule rome while arminius was tolerably fluent in latin these days hed understood only a few words when he joined the auxiliaries a couple of years earlier he was a man with an itch to know he always had been hed joined the auxiliaries to learn how the romans did things hed also learned a lot not all of it what hed expected roman discipline looked different from the inside in germany hed always thought roman soldiers were slaves because of the way they let their superiors order them around no free german would have put up with that for even a moment when germans went to war though they fought as individuals or as members of a little band they went forward to show off their bravery to their kinsmen and friends how else would you fight how else the romans had another way a man in a legion or in a troop of auxiliaries was part of something bigger than himself he still needed to be brave but he also needed to remember he was only a part if all the parts did what they were supposed to do what their superiors told them to do the legion or troop was very hard to beat they also kept more freedom than they seemed to from the outside arminius knew what hed done in this latest clash with the pannonians so did the men around him but he hadnt done it to prove he was brave hed done it to help the larger unit the pannonians fought the same way theyd learned it from the romans arminius wondered if his folk could too he hoped so if they couldnt wouldnt they go down the way the gauls had the way the pannonians were now a wounded man nearby couldnt hold in a groan arminius finished him off then looked to see if he had anything worth taking to the germans annoyance the pannonian didnt had arminius known that ahead of time he might have let the foeman lie there and suffer but no orders were to make sure the wounded died and arminius could see the reason for those orders if legionaries and auxiliaries were parts of something larger than themselves so were enemy warriors the romans didnt just aim to kill individuals they wanted to kill the very idea of nationhood among their foes here arminius thought uneasily and back home in germany too he dogged his men till they finished cleaning up the field and left it to the birds and foxes even that thought made him uncomfortable as he marched them back to the encampment they and the legionaries with them had made the night before am i anything but the romans dog he wondered flavus his older brother was a roman dog flavus liked life in the auxiliaries he was fighting somewhere else in pannonia serving augustus as best he could arminius didnt know just where and didnt care to find out he couldnt decide whether flavus frightened or infuriated him more he dismissed his brother from his mind with nothing but relief yes back to the encampment only one thing ever changed about roman fortified camps the size which depended on how many men they needed to hold otherwise they were as much alike as two coins standardizing things was another idea the romans had had that was new to the germans arminius could see the advantages if you always did this and that the same way you just went ahead and did them you didnt have to wonder whether to do this first or how to take care of that or if you should bother with something else again the romans made each man one stick in the wattle of a house so to speak a roman centurion he showed his rank by the crosscrested helm he still wore waved to arminius as the german brought in his warriors your men fought like wolves today the veteran called my thanks you romans were fierce too arminius answered that wasnt quite the right word capable came closer but didnt seem praise enough ai the centurion snapped his fingers reminding himself of something theres a fellow from your tribe in camp hes looking for you thanks again did he say why whatever news the man brought from the land of the cherusci arminius feared it would be bad only bad news needed to travel fast good news could commonly wait are my father and mother hale i dont know sorry the roman spread his hands i didnt ask and your friend doesnt speak a whole lot of latin anyhow he never imagined that he might learn the germans language well this was a roman province so that wasnt unreasonable but if the romans held germany wouldnt latin come to dominate there too arminius pulled his mind back from such things to the business at hand thank you for telling me i find i will find him and see what the news is hope its nothing too awful the centurions rough sympathy said he knew how these things usually went thanks arminius said once more he hurried off with his men to the northwest corner of the encampment where then always pitched their tents in every roman camp ever made auxiliaries were quartered in the northwest and northeast corners the romans had done things that way for centuries they were a tidy folk everything had its place among them and once they found a way of doing things that worked they stuck with it he found his man there or rather his man found him arminius someone called hail chariomerus arminius answered recognizing him at once he hurried up and clasped the other mans hand why have you come are mother and father all right as far as i know chariomerus answered he and arminius werent close kin though theyd grown up in the same little village they were when i set out anyhow well thats the biggest load off my mind arminius said come on with me and get some supper youll be hungry after so long on the road youre right about that by the gods chariomerus and arminius got bowls of barley porridge and cups of wine from the cooks chariomerus wolfed his down im still hungry he said when it was gone i want some boiled meat to let my stomach know its got something in there he drank wines not bad though no it isnt arminius said the romans think eating a lot of meat makes you slow maybe theyre even right i dont know going without doesnt bother me the way it did i know that ive got used to doing things romanstyle i suppose you have to but chariomerus let his voice trail away then resumed better you than me im not flavus arminius snapped im he shook his head like a man bedeviled by gnats there were times when he didnt know what he was give me your news its not my parents and i thank the gods for that so what did bring you from home chariomerus drained the cup he looked as if he wanted more wine too to help grease his tongue at last with a sigh he said well it has to do with segestes arminius grunted segestes was another chief among the cherusci he liked and trusted the romans more than arminius did more to the point he was also arminius fiancées father what about him arminius demanded is he well he was when i left chariomerus said as he had when talking about arminius mother and father the newcomer didnt seem eager to go on after silence stretched arminius said if you keep me waiting any more youll make me angry you didnt come all this way not to tell me something youre right chariomerus sighed he still hesitated at last he brought the words out in a rush hes gone and betrothed thusnelda to somebody else people said you didnt always feel it right away when you got wounded arminius hadnt found that to be true every time a sword cut him or an arrow pierced his flesh it hurt like fire but now he just stared his mouth foolishly gaping hed heard the words but they didnt want to make sense inside his head who who he asked sounding like an owl an owl in daylight was the worst of omens everybody knew that what kind of omen was it though when someone took your woman away from you tudrus chariomerus said the grinding noise arminius heard was his own teeth clashing together like millstones he needed a distinct effort of will to make himself stop tudrus was a man of about segestes age he was also friendly to the romans all the same why arminius seemed to have trouble coming out with more than one word at a time i dont know for sure he doesnt tell me his reasons chariomerus replied my best guess is he doesnt think youll come back from this war he wants thusnelda to give him some grandchildren and tudrus has been one of his sworn companions for years he should never have promised her to me then arminius said does he think i have no honor to take an insult like this lying down what will you do chariomerus sounded apprehensive go home and set things right of course arminius answered what do you expect me to do when you bring me news like that just stand here and thank you for it and go about my business he looked around and dropped his voice do you take me for a roman no of course not had chariomerus said anything else arminius would have killed him the newsbringer also lowered his voice is it true what they say about roman women not enough roman women up here for me to know one way or the other the stories are pretty juicy but stories usually are arminius set a hand on his fellow tribesmans shoulder now i have to tell the romans i am leaving they will not be happy to hear it but he shrugged what can you do the senior roman officer with this detachment was a military tribune named titus minucius basilus he was short and lean and bald with pinched features a blade of a nose and eyes cold as a blizzard arminius interrupted him at supper which did nothing to improve his mood he redeemed some of his bad temper with reckless bravery you have to go you say he growled when arminius finished just like that in the middle of a campaign i am sorry sir arminius could use roman notions of politeness and subordination even though he scorned them it touches my honor what would you do if your betrotheds father gave her to another man he knew he was making a hash of his subjunctives and hoped minucius could follow him id start a lawsuit against the doubledealing wretch minucius answered hed be sorry by the time i got through with him too his supper companions nodded arminius had only a vague notion of what a lawsuit was a battle with words instead of swords was as close as he could come he didnt see the point we have not got this in my country he said no i suppose not the roman eyed arminius as he sipped from a silver winecup whatever else he was he was sharp if i tell you you cant go youll up and leave anyway wont you it is my honor sir arminius repeated talking to a different officer he might have asked if the fellow understood the word something told him that would be a very bad idea with titus minucius basilus he would make a dangerous enemy dangerous as a viper underfoot picking his words with care arminius went on how can i fight as well as i should sir when all i think about what this man does uh has done to me you wouldnt be the first man in that kind of mess or the last the military tribune drank more wine at last still without warming up he brusquely dipped his head go on go home if we cant whip the pannonians because were short one auxiliary officer we dont deserve to win by jupiter straighten out your woman troubles and then come back to us theyve already made you a roman citizen but well make you a real roman he meant it for a compliment arminius reminded himself of that he also reminded himself hed got what he wanted and more easily than hed expected too minucius was right he would have deserted had he heard no rather than yes since hed heard yes he bowed redgold locks spilling down off his shoulders as he bent forward my thanks sir my many thanks sir i am in your debt maybe you will pay it one day if not to me then to rome minucius said maybe i will arminius bowed again please excuse me i will not interrupt your supper anymore he turned and hurried off conscious as he went of minucius eyes boring into his back well chariomerus said when arminius got back to the auxiliaries tents it is very well in fact arminius said he will let me go he saw i would go whether he let me or not sometimes it is easier to lean in the direction the wind is already blowing chariomerus smiled in glad surprise i did not think it would be so simple neither did i some god must be looking kindly on me arminius answered and that can only mean the god is scowling at segestes how could it be otherwise he has broken faith but he wont get away with it thusnelda will be glad to have you instead of tudrus chariomerus said he is an old man he has to be fortyfive if hes a day so she will arminius didnt love thusnelda love as far as he could see was something the romans had invented to give themselves an excuse for infidelity but hed known her since they were children he liked her and thought she liked him segestes had no right to rob him of her no right at all when varus governed syria the immemorial antiquity of the countryside impressed him as hed thought while conferring with augustus it made italy where even the oldest towns had but a few centuries on them seem downright juvenile by comparison as he traveled north to the rhine frontier to take up his new province he thought about that often he didnt know whether to laugh or to cry oh gaul had had towns before the roman conquest but they hadnt been towns with civilized amenities no theaters for plays no amphitheaters for spectacles gladiators and beast shows no public baths no proper law courts no colonnaded and porticoed public squares and of course the barbarians had gabbled away at one another in their own incomprehensible language not in latin to say nothing of greek more than half a century of roman rule had brought some changes a few of the locals had forsaken tunic and trousers for the toga here and there a proper roman building stone with a tile roof sprouted amidst timber and wattleanddaub and thatch but it would be a long time before this country grew civilized if it ever did vetera on the west bank of the rhine had more than enough romans to make a goodsized town it was the headquarters of legions xvii xviii and xix but legionaries however necessary they were in the grand scheme of things werent interesting people varus had been used to gossip about matters of state gossip about augustus family his own family thanks to the marriage connection not that claudia pulchra was daft enough to come up to the edge of the world though shed gone with him to syria and gossip about the other great and powerful men and women of rome in vetera he got gossip about an ambitious military tribune jockeying for promotion gossip about a centurions drunken german mistress gossip about what happened when a prefects gallic mistress found out about his german mistress gossip about the outrageous way a wine merchant overcharged for the swill he swore was falernian no some things didnt change from rome to vetera not even a little bit power sex money what else was there to gossip about but when the power was minuscule when the sex was with women whose fair tresses reminded varus that whores in rome were required by law to wear blond wigs when the money was chicken feed how were you supposed to get excited about any of it people in vetera did varus imagined that people in any provincial town had their tiny squabbles and feuds and scandals and triumphs the trouble was the roman officers in vetera expected varus to be interested in theirs and so he had to be or at least to pretend to be hypocrisy wasnt the least important art a highranking roman needed to cultivate in syria soldiers always worried about parthia if rome had a real rival the successor to the persian empire was it roman armies had come to grief against parthia back around the time varus was born crassus got his force annihilated at carrhae and even lost legionary eagles what greater and more humiliating disgrace was possible and the parthian kings of kings werent afraid to invade the roman east when they thought they could get away with it in vetera soldiers and no one else there mattered worried about germany instead varus did not find that an improvement parthia was a more or less cultured country the king of kings and his nobles spoke greek as a matter of course they had elegant manners theyd learned from alexander the greats successors while they were beating them if the macedonians had learned their manners from the persians while they were beating them varus didnt dwell on that hearing that two german tribes were threatening to go to war with each other over some stolen pigs was not edifying neither was the news that some petty german noble as if there were any other kind was raising a row in his tribe by giving a girl previously promised to one suitor to another instead and that was the kind of thing varus had to listen to day after day he didnt take long to tire of it he summoned a meeting of the leading soldiers in legions xvii xviii and xix and spoke without preamble you already know augustus sent me here to bring germany all the way into the empire i aim to do that as fast as i can then ill go back to rome and let somebody else take charge of the miserable place the assembled officers nodded vala numonius the cavalry commander said it shouldnt be too hard sir by what ive heard since i got here weve softened up the germans a lot theyre getting used to our ways plenty of their nobles already see lining up with us is the smart way to go all they need is a show of force and theyll roll onto their backs and show their bellies like whipped dogs does anyone disagree varus put the question for forms sake hed said what he intended to do and one of his principal subordinates had declared that the assembled legions could do it what more did anyone want but to his surprise an officer named lucius eggius said i do sir the germans just arent that easy whenever we cross the rhine we own the land where we march and the land where we camp the rest still belongs to the barbarians its not so bad as that numonius said lucius eggius set his chin even when varus said i should hope not eggius still looked discontented varus wondered if the soldier found himself in this godsforsaken spot because of an unfortunate habit of speaking his mind regardless of whether anybody else wanted to listen to him i think youre right sir said yet another officer a prefect named ceionius unlike lucius eggius he knew the words a governor liked to hear better yet he came up with good reasons why varus was right quite a few of the germans are learning latin the better to spy on us eggius broke in oh nonsense ceionius said theyre using our coins too they buy wine and pottery and jewelry with them and they spend them among themselves little by little theyre turning into provincials once we finish the occupation give them twenty years and you wont be able to tell them from gauls eggius sent varus what the governor supposed was meant to be a look of appeal somehow it only made the man seem more stubborn than ever dont listen to him sir eggius said earnestly if these savages were going to lay down for us lie down you mean now ceionius interrupted to point out the other soldiers bad grammar varus of course had noticed it on his own if an officer couldnt express himself correctly how were his superiors supposed to take seriously anything he said if they were going to lay down for us lucius eggius repeated his chin jutting forward even farther than before they would have done it twenty years ago theyre rough customers thats all there is to it and there are swarms of them in those little villages sometimes we beat em when we fight sometimes they lick us if they didnt the country on the far side of the rhine wouldve made a proper province a long time ago several officers drew away from him as if he carried something catching and so he did tactlessness could kill off even a promising career varus almost dismissed him from the council at the last instant though he held back remembering how augustus had voiced some of the same worries anyone can do an easy job varus said you need uncommon men to handle a harder one augustus has decided that we are the men he needs for this particular job to my way of thinking thats a compliment to every one of us and to every single soldier in legions xvii xviii and xix will anyone tell me im wrong there he waited no one said a word not even the obstinate lucius eggius varus had expected nothing different a bold man could quarrel with a provincial governor no one had quarreled with augustus in any serious way for more than thirty years if you quarreled with augustus you lost rome had learned that lesson well since augustus gave us this job well find a way to do it varus continued nobody disagreed with that either the track wound through the woods arminius boots squelched in the mud he slipped and almost fell hed traded his roman caligae his hobnailed marching sandals to a farmer for the boots and a meal and a bed the caligae didnt fit the farmer very well but the iron hobnails made them valuable even if arminius got less traction on bad ground he preferred his native footgear he preferred the soft dirt track to a paved roman highway too march on stone from sunup to sundown and your legs felt like stone themselves when you finally stopped for the night arminius also preferred the way the track followed the contours of the land roman roads ran straight as stretched strings if the straight route was bad the romans built it up with stones or dug away hillsides they were as arrogant in their engineering as they were everywhere else he tried to explain that to chariomerus the other german didnt get it whats wrong with taking the short way if you can he asked how can the gods love anyone who tears up the landscape the way the romans do arminius returned he got only a stare and a shrug from his traveling companion who said if the gods dont love the romans how come theyre so stinking strong that question was good enough to keep arminius walking in silence for some little while at last he said to give us foes worth fighting that must be it if our enemies were weaklings what kind of glory would we win by beating them not much they have to be strong or they wouldnt make proper enemies chariomerus grunted but what happens if theyre too strong he asked what happens if they beat us then we turn into slaves arminius answered so do our mothers and our sisters and our daughters and our sweethearts that made chariomerus shudder arminius had known it would his folk had a greater horror of slavery for its women than for its men german minstrels sang of battles that had turned when the women on the side that was losing bared their breasts and warned their men they were about to be enslaved inspiring the warriors to fight with desperate ferocity a tribe that could claim hostages from among its neighbors noblewomen held those neighbors in a grip stronger than iron we mustnt lose then chariomerus said and we wont but arminius sounded more confident than he felt roman influence seemed stronger in germany than it had when he went off to learn how the legions fought it was much stronger than it had been when he was a boy people passed coins roman coins back and forth without even thinking about what they were doing in his younger days barter had been king of all hed gotten better wine from some of the nobles who had him as a guest than he had as a roman auxiliary when people found out hed fought for the romans they wanted to try out bits of latin on him if those werent the early marks of slavery what would be dogs barked up ahead theres your fathers steading chariomerus said its been a long road arminius replied my fathers steading at last here i will stay till i can see my way to avenging the insult segestes has given me when he and chariomerus came out into the open four or five dogs rushed toward them the big roughcoated wolfish beasts growled and snarled and bared their formidable fangs the romans had dogs like that what herdsman or farmer would want any other kind but the romans also had small fluffy mildmannered dogs to keep women and children company they turned good working dogs into toys they would do the same with to arminius folk if they got the chance he shouted at the dogs he didnt know if that would prove enough hed been away a long time his hand fell to the hilt of his sword if they kept coming he would do what he had to do to keep them from biting him chariomerus perhaps less sure of the animals temper drew his blade and widened his stance so he was ready to strike but shouting sufficed the dogs skidded to a stop a couple of them beasts arminius recognized cocked their heads to one side he had to laugh at their expressions they looked like men trying to remember something did they know his voice his scent something a roman had told him floated up into his thoughts there was a greek poem that had an old dog remembering its master in it he came home alter years and years away adventuring and the dog died after it realized who he was arminius didnt know much about the greeks he gathered that the romans thought them very clever since germans thought the same about romans that made these greeks clever indeed didnt it if they were so clever why didnt they run things instead of the romans hail lance hail speedy he said gravely and scratched the dogs he knew behind the ears they let him do it where they would have snapped at a stranger the other dogs young ones that had grown up or been born after he went away eyed speedy and lance as if wondering why they would betray a trust like that some germans were friendly to the romans arminius brother was one and segestes was another he always had been he thought germany stood to gain more than it lost by coming under the roman eagle arminius had thought he was wrong before now the younger man despised any opinion of segestes just because his betrayed fiancées father held it the commotion from the dogs brought a grayhaired man carrying an axe out to see what caused it a grayhaired man father arminius shouted and ran to him arminius his fathers name was sigimerus he definitely hadnt been so gray when arminius went off to learn what he could of roman fighting he hadnt been so stooped either he wasnt an old man not yet but the years had a grip on him as they embraced arminius forgot all about that its good to see you its good to be home he said and kissed sigimerus on both cheeks and then on the mouth how is flavus his father asked arminius mouth tightened the last i heard he was hale he said carefully that was let me think two months ago or maybe a little more the romans are fools not to put two brothers in the same band where you could spur each other on sigimerus said the romans are fools arminius agreed but he found he couldnt leave it there they dont care so much about men spurring each other on they want men who do as theyre told he grimaced again flavus has always been good at that his father coughed sometimes obeying is good i walloped you a lot more than i hit your brother yes i know this time arminius did leave it there taking it any further would have started a quarrel which he didnt want he did say flavus likes fighting for the romans as far as arminius could tell flavus wished hed been born a roman himself if anything flavus was even more proroman than segestes arminius respected the romans not least for their ruthlessness that didnt mean he wanted to be like them if anything it made him more determined to go on being what he was already his father heard the edge in his voice i know you two dont see eye to eye youre both still my boys yes father arminius didnt suppose sigimerus could say anything else despite their disagreements arminius didnt dislike flavus either but he also didnt trust him had flavus known how deeply arminius despised resented and feared the romans they would have found out about it in short order and in that case titus minucius basilus might not have been so willing to let him go back to germany and since youre home sigimerus went on come into the house and drink some wine with me to gladden your heart he nodded to arminius companion you too chariomerus of course i am in your debt for finding my son and bringing him back to germany i was glad to do it chariomerus stayed polite but he didnt denythat sigimerus did indeed owe him something one of these days he would call in the debt either from sigimerus or from arminius the farmhouse was a wooden building about forty cubits long and fifteen wide four posts running down the centerline supported a steeply pitched thatched roof that shed rain and snow stalls for the familys cattle and horses and pigs and sheep adjoined the eastern wall the hearth was against the western wall under a window so in good weather a lot of the smoke escaped on freezing winter nights the window was shuttered and the animals came inside with the people it made the place crowded and smoky and smelly but that was better than losing livestock sigimerus pulled the rawhide latch cord and shoved the door open veleda he called look whos here at last arminius mother was spinning wool into thread she sprang off the wooden stool where she sat a roman luxury bought from a trader and hurried over to hug and kiss him so good to see you home she said between kisses its good to be home too arminius answered i only wish i didnt have to come back for a reason like this his father who was pouring the wine growled down deep in his throat like an angry hunting hound segestes didnt just insult you when he took thusnelda away and swore her to this wretch of a tudrus he said he put the whole family in the shade and everyone who follows us whatever you want to do to pay him back youll have plenty of men behind you ive told him the same thing chariomerus said i would have known it even if you didnt say a word arminius replied ive been thinking about things all the way back from pannonia ah thank you father he took an earthenware cup from sigimerus a german potter had made the cup the sweetsmelling red wine inside came from some land the romans ruled your health sigimerus said lifting his own cup in salute yours arminius copied the gesture so did his mother and chariomerus he drank hed tasted better wine but also plenty worse he nodded appreciatively youve been thinking about what to do sigimerus prompted he fiddled with the brooch that held his cloak closed because he was wealthy the brooch was gold and decorated with garnets red as the wine an ordinary farmer would have closed his cloak with a bronze pin a poor man would have made do with a thorn if you go after segestes or tudrus well back you he tensed as he said the words arminius could see as much but he said them anyhow and didnt hesitate over them arminius loved him for that i dont want to start a bloody feud with segestes father he said we shouldnt fight one another now we should all march side by side to fight the romans you say this and i think you speak wisely sigimerus said not everyone will though segestes wont hed sooner march with the romans than against them i hear thats part of why he took thusnelda away from you and gave her to tudrus tudrus loves the romans too loves to lick their backsides you mean chariomerus said some of them would like it if he did arminius said chariomerus and sigimerus both made horrible faces so did veleda men who wanted to use other men as if they were women did what they did in secret among the germans you heard whispers about such things but that was all anyone caught doing them died slowly and painfully the romans didnt just talk openly about such things those who wanted to do them did them arminius had got one of his many shocks inside the empire when he learned that hed got another shock when he discovered it didnt make them effeminate not even the ones who were pierced rather than piercing they fought the pannonian rebels as bravely as anyone else he wouldnt have believed it if he hadnt seen it but he had if you dont aim to start a feud with segestes and his retainers what will you do to regain your honor his father brought the talk back to the business at hand and steered it away from what he didnt care to think about no flies on sigimerus well that depends arminius answered is thusnelda wed to tudrus or is she only promised to him she is promised veleda said she still lives in segestes steading arminius breathed a sigh of relief that makes things easier even killing tudrus wouldnt necessarily have got him thusnelda if shed already married segestes comrade widows often staved single the rest of their days with one as young and pretty as thusnelda that would have been a dreadful waste which didnt mean it couldnt happen sigimerus nodded you have more choices just so arminius said but i think i know what im going to try soldiers gossiped they didnt only gossip about who was screwing whom or who was feuding with whom although being human they did waste a lot of time gossiping about those eternal favorites and being human they also wasted a lot of time gossiping about the officials set over them legions xvii xviii and xix had served together for a long time octavian raised them during the civil war against antony and cleopatra a handful of senior centurions had been green kids scooped into the legions more than forty years before the rest of the men had joined since there were older legions and legions that had seen more fighting but xvii xviii and xix had nothing to be ashamed of this varus well hell never make a proper general lucius eggius said he knew all the men in the tavern with him and knew or was as sure as you could be about such things none of them would go telling tales to the new governor of germany his cavalry commanders not so bad said marcus calvisius a centurion from legion xviii he was in his early fifties a little too young to have been part of xviiis original complement doesnt go around making too much of himself anyway numonius mm maybe not lucius eggius weighed whether to give the other newcomer the benefit of the doubt alter draining his winecup he shook his head he wont tell his boss hes wrong varus says well whip the germans into shape in an hour and a half and vala numonius says we sure will an hour and a halt tops hes like a lap dog wagging his tail marcus calvisius ran a hand through his hair it was silver but his hairline hadnt retreated by even a digits breadth add that to a chin like a boulder and he made an impressivelooking man an hour and a half wont finish the job youre right about that gods know a year and a half isnt likely to finish the job either eggius said i tried to tell em so but did they want to listen he laughed bitterly i mean what the demon do i know all i am is the bastard on the spot that counts for nothing theyve got orders from augustus that counts for everything how come augustus cant see its not as easy as he thinks calvisius grumbled hes a smart guy right he is a smart guy lucius eggius said but even a smart guy can be dumb about places hes never seen augustus never came up here all he knows is germanys not a proper province yet hes mad about it too how can you blame him if you look at things from down in rome yeah well marcus calvisius ran a hand through his hair again if you look at things from down in rome you dont know anything about the germans all the roman officers nodded somebody said were up here and i dont think we know anything much about the germans the veterans nodded again they dont want to turn into a province its about that simple eggius said he shoved his cup over to the tapman who poured it full fancy aristocrats watered their wine like greeks or children he drank his neat so did his friends what point to drinking if you didnt feel it gauls didnt want to turn into a province either caesar walloped the snot out of them calvisius said now were here and they dont mind not like that on the other side of the rhine nobody told him he was wrong lucius eggius knew too well that he was right cross the rhine and you crossed into a different world even the trees and the rivers on the east side seemed to hate romans as for the people well eggius said dryly its not like they dont give us plenty of practice over there he got a laugh how many battles had legions xvii xviii and xix fought on the wrong side of the river on the far side of the river eggius corrected himself if augustus said they were going to bring it into the empire the land over there wasnt on the wrong side at all assuming they could do what augustus said of course yeah eggius thought assuming a centurion from legion xix said some of the germans are good guys some of them get along with us all right sure eggius nodded he could feel the wine all right but it hadnt made him stupid yet he didnt think it had anyhow he knew he wasnt stumbling over his own tongue that was good he took another pull at his cup and went on answer me this though how many of those germans whore good guys those germans who get along with us all right would you trust at your back when youve got other germans germans you know are enemies trying to do you in from the front a considerable silence followed lucius eggius considered it none of his considerations made him very happy the centurion from legion xix didnt look very happy either he got his mug refilled tilted his head back and took a big swig eggius watched his prominent larynx bob up and down as he swallowed at last he said well there are a few most of the romans who heard that nodded lucius eggius did himself yeah there are he agreed but weve been trying to turn that miserable mess of trees and swamps and fogs and frogs into a province for a demon of a long time now if we were going anywhere with it dont you figure thered be more than a few germans you could count on when your back was turned the centurion didnt reply to that nobody else did either not right away then marcus calvisius said well eggius there is one other way to deal with that oh yeah lucius eggius said like what kill all the barbarians we cant trust and make a province with whoevers left why do you think xvii xviii and xix are here eggius did some more considering when he was done he let out a grunt youve got something there he admitted i do wish we still had tiberius in command though hes a sour bastard sure but nobody ever said he doesnt know what hes doing this varus well who can tell gods rot the stinking pannonian rebels anyway he set about the business of getting seriously drunk amo amas amat segestes muttered amamum amatis amant he was currying a horse the beast snorted perhaps at the unfamiliar sounds segestes went right on conjugating the latin verb to love then he muttered under his breath in his native tongue plenty of germans would have said plenty of germans did say he was currying favor with the romans too he didnt see it that way if he had seen it that way he wouldnt have done it how many folk had gone up against rome lots how many had lost all of them you could look west across the rhine or southeast across the danube to see the latest examples oh the pannonians were still kicking and bellowing like a bull before it went all the way into the stall that wouldnt last much longer though the romans were tough and they had their whole vast empire to draw upon he ran his hand over the horses flank and nodded to himself that was better like most horses in germany his was a small shaggy roughcoated beast if you didnt go over it with a curry comb pretty often it would be all over tangles the horse made a snuffling expectant noise he laughed and gave it a carrot it crunched up the treat then it nuzzled his hand hoping for another one he laughed youre no horse youre a pig with a mane and a hairy tail he patted the horse and fed it another carrot when it tried for a third he shook his head and stepped out of the stall as soon as he did he wished he hadnt thusnelda was out there playing with a puppy that would have been bad enough any time spoiling a horse was one thing but segestes wanted his dogs mean why have them if not toward the steading with things between him and thusnelda as prickly as they were he was more inclined to spoil his horse than his daughter he didnt see it that way of course fathers never do thusnelda had been laughing as she tickled the pups stomach when she saw segestes her face closed like a clenching fist she straightened up and turned her back on him if a man used me like that i would kill him segestes remarked his daughter spun toward him but not out of respect and you dont think youre killing me she retorted what are you talking about for a moment segestes was honestly confused then he wasnt but wished he still were theres nothing wrong with tudrus he growled they had this argument at least once a day he was sick of it even if thusnelda didnt seem to be why hadnt he set an earlier date for the wedding then shed be out of his hair and tudrus would have to worry about her something had changed though that wasnt just fury in her gray eyes it was something very much like triumph arminius is back hes out of the fight in pannonia and hes hale she spat the words in his face he already knew that hed heard a couple of days earlier he hadnt said a word but bad news always got where you didnt want it to he might have known it would here how did you find out he asked wearily by the way thusncldas eyes sparked hed hear about knowing and not telling her but that would be later for now she could score more points off him with the news itself one of the slaves brought word she answered he said it was everywhere except here so she wouldnt waste time making him pay for keeping it from her not now anyway he sighed it doesnt matter it doesnt change a thing you dont think so his daughter laughed at him if she werent of his own flesh and blood but she was so he had to hold his temper down it wasnt easy he was a proud man i dont he said shaking his head and i dont want a family connection with arminius any more he hates the romans too much to make it safe you didnt think so when you pledged me to him thusnelda jeered and how can you say that anyway he joined the roman army you never did the man who best knows how to break a cart is one who makes carts segestes said his daughter stared at him as it hed suddenly started spouting greek he couldnt have even had he wanted to knowing greek existed put him a long jump ahead of most germans with another sigh he went on arminius joined the romans to learn how to beat them he wants us to be free thusnelda said free to brawl among ourselves free to run through the woods and no farther free to be as wild as the wends and the finns segestes named the most savage peoples the germans knew the finns tip their arrows with bone they live on the ground or in huts woven like baskets they sleep on the ground thusnelda sounded disgusted to the romans we look the way the finns look to us segestes said then the romans are stupid segestes shook his head they arent you know they arent they have all kinds of things we dont and they dont fight one another the way we do he said i want us to live the way they do so does tudrus is that so bad we should be free thusnelda might have been listening to arminius before he left she probably had on the sly what good does that do us knowing things living in peace those do us some good segestes said thusnelda stuck her nose in the air segestes wondered if tudrus could charm or beat the nonsense out of her he hoped so iii back before publius quinctilius varus was born two german tribes invaded gaul if not for julius caesar they might have taken it away from the natives before the romans could if not for my wifes greatuncles greatuncle varus thought bemused that his father had killed himself rather than yielding to his wifes greatuncles greatuncle he forgot for the moment he remembered little about sextus quinctilius varus augustus he knew very well indeed and he knew very well what julius caesar had done with characteristic energy caesar bundled the usipetes and the tencteri back into the german forests and then he went after them in ten days his engineers bridged the rhine the german tribes fled before him he stayed on the east bank of the rhine for eighteen days then went back and finished conquering gaul and he left the problem of conquering germany for another day for another generation as it turned out for me as it turned out varus thought marching through germany was easy enough holding the place down really subjecting it wasnt plenty of romans had proved that too one of his servants intertwined the fingers of both hands forming a cup into which varus could step with help from the legup he swung over his horses back and straightened in the saddle a mounting stone would have served as well although a legup from a man better suited a commanders dignity if he had to varus thought he could vault into the saddle with no help at all like a proper cavalryman but only a barbarian and a stupid barbarian at that would do things the hard way when he didnt have to once seated on the horse varus nodded to vala numonius lets cross he said yes sir the cavalry commander nodded they both urged their mounts forward the rest of the cavalry detachment followed the horses hooves drummed on the bridge over the rhine it was built on exactly the same principle as caesars roman engineers had fixed two sets of piles in the riverbed the upstream piles leaned with the current the downstream against it they were about twentyfive cubits apart trestles slanting against the current on the downstream side helped support the structure upstream a timber breakwater protected the bridge from logs or fire rafts or anything else the barbarians might aim at it once we subdue the germans well get a proper bridge with stone piers not this military makeshift varus said that would be splendid sir numonius replied a sign of civilization you might say civilization yes once again varus fondly remembered syria he remembered rome he remembered athens where hed stopped on the way back from syria and where he like his son had studied as a young man he remembered seeing for the first time the parthenon and all the other wonderful buildings up on the acropolis by the gods that was civilization for you this the day was cool the sky was a grayish watery blue the sun seemed half ashamed to shine he was riding away from a legionary camp which in these parts counted as an outpost of civilization he was heading for the gloomy forests that stretched on and on east of the rhine warned him what he was heading for foot soldiers followed the cavalrymen one thing the romans had learned from painful experience wherever they went in germany they went in force small parties of men were all too likely to disappear better not to tempt the barbarians into doing what they werent supposed to varus horse stepped off the bridge and onto the muddy ground on the east bank of the rhine its hooves stopped echoing they made the usual thumping and squelching noises instead vala numonius had dropped back by half a length to let varus precede him now he caught up again welcome to germany sir he said germany varus echoed he didnt seen any germans here on their side of the river he didnt particularly miss them hed seen plenty in vetera big fair noisy men with an exaggerated sense of their own importance some of the soldiers women were pretty in an exotic way though they had plenty to hold on to that was for sure the cavalry commander pointed toward the trees which had been cut down for several stadia around the bridgehead a lot of the timber from them probably went into the bridge theyre watching us from in there numonius said let them watch it will teach them respect varus said no sooner were the words out of his mouth than a german stepped into the cleared ground from among the trees the man turned around bent over undid his cloak and waggled his pale bare backside at the romans then he straightened wrapped the cloak around himself again and loped off into the woods some of the horsemen behind varus laughed others swore so much for respect sir vala numonius said biting his lip in rage varus pointed out to where the german had vanished seize him crucify him he shouted sir theres no hope said a cavalry officer whod been on the frontier for a while in the forests theyre like animals they have dens to lay up in or they can climb trees like wall lizards wish they could and he might be trying to lure a detachment right into an ambush he spoke respectfully as a man had to do when trying to talk a provincial governor out of an order varus muttered still steaming but he could see that the soldier made good sense if he fought on this side of the rhine he needed to fight on his terms not the barbarians very well varus said heavily very well well let him get away with that for now but the time will come when this whole province learns better and that time will come soon by the gods numonius clapped his hands well said sir he exclaimed from the other cavalry officer came an unmistakable sigh of relief a pale moon shone down on segestes steading arminius stood at the edge of the trees looking things over the steading seemed quiet the way it should at night if things werent as they seemed chances were he would die inside the hour he shrugged if he died he would die doing what was right doing what was important no one would say hed let segestes dishonor him he knew the woman hed sent here had talked with thusnelda shed told him so herself after she came away she wasnt from his fathers steading so segestes would have had no reason to suspect her but arminius didnt know how thusnelda felt the woman who served him hed hired her with the fat gold earring hed taken from the dead pannonian hadnt been able to tell what she thought shed kept her own counsel if she liked this tudrus or if she obeyed her father without thinking if any of that was true arminius would have a thin time of it tonight one of segestes dogs let out a tentative bark a couple of others joined in a moment later they trotted toward him he wore a fat leather sack on his belt he reached for that instead of his sword come on boys come here he called as if the beasts belonged to his own father they werent so fierce as they might have been that was plain arminius hopes soared through the woman hed told thusnelda to feed them as much as they would hold and now he pulled more chunks of raw meat from the sack and tossed them in front of the dogs greedy as swine they dug in arminius gave them more meat he kept some in the sack though he was certain segestes had more dogs than these and sure enough two big brutes met him halfway to segestes house he bribed them the same way as he had the others they hadnt made much noise and quieted down at once anybody who gave them meat had to be a friend the door arminius tapped it lightly with a forefinger that tiny noise shouldnt bother anyone sleeping in there but if someone was awake and waiting for it was someone awake and waiting in there arminius tapped again a tiny bit harder ii thusnelda had fallen asleep in spite of everything wouldnt that make the bitterest joke of all when the door opened his hand fell to the hilt of his sword if shed betrayed him to her father if warriors boiled out through the doorway what could he do but take some of them with him arminius no warriors only a tiny ghost of a voice from the darkness inside segestes house thusnelda she came out into the moonlight then it shone oil her lair hair and glittered from the jewels roman jewels probably set into the brooch that closed her cloak he touched her hand he hadnt done that since they were both children her fingers were chilly not the night which was mild but fear lets get away he said whispering himself she nodded slowly and carefully she closed the door behind her you got past the dogs no they ate me arminius answered thusnelda stared at him in blank incomprehension it was he realized a roman kind of thing to say he could explain it another time if he decided to bother for now he just went on as if he hadnt spoken before yes im here yes im fine lets get away you do want to come with me dont you he wished he had the last question back as soon as it came out of his mouth which was of course exactly too late but thusnelda said yes and that made it stop mattering they hurried away from segestes house when they went past the two dogs arminius had met halfway there one of them yawned while the other thumped its tail against the ground the dogs had to be full to bursting and thusnelda was with him now so they were bound to be sure everything was fine the other three the beasts closer to the edge of the clearing had also had plenty to eat thusnelda paused to pat one of them blackie was always my favorite she said in a strangely muffled voice arminius realized the muffling was swallowed tears she wasnt leaving only blackie behind she was leaving everything shed ever known chances were she would never see this place or her kinsfolk again no wonder she had trouble sounding steady he slipped an arm around her waist everything will be all right he promised i will make sure everything is all right for you from now on you are my woman now thusnelda you are my wife in the germans language woman and wife were the same word arminius repeated himself for emphasis sake latin had two separate words for the two notions when he asked a legionary why the fellowhad chuckled and said so we can think about women who arent our wives why else hed poked arminius in the ribs too a familiarity the german wouldnt have put up with from one of his own countrymen germans took their wives fidelity seriously they took few things more seriously romans joked about it when arminius showed how shocked he was they laughed at him for a greenhorn after a bit he learned to stop showing it so they stopped laughing but the shock didnt go away they really thought like that their men were seducers their women sluts they made lewd jokes about what should have been one of the most important things in the world and they talked about how they were making the gauls and pannonians like them and about how they would do the same for the germans once they turned the land between rhine and elbe into a province to arminius way of thinking the romans would be doing it to the germans that was when he decided he had to fight them come what might thusnelda took his hands in hers and brought him back from the campaigns in pannonia to this quiet moonlit night i am your woman she said i will be your woman and your woman only as long as we both live thats why im taking you away arminius said if he was also doing it to stick a finger in segestes eye and in tudrus that was nothing thusnelda needed to worry about she looked up at him he looked down at her he bent to kiss her her arms came up and went around his neck one of the dogs blackie let out a questioning growl that didnt surprise arminius even if it did annoy him hed seen it before animals often thought people were fighting when they were doing something very different evidently thusnelda had seen it before too its all right it really is she told the dog and stroked it again then she turned back to arminius come on they hurried away along the track by which arminius had come he looked back toward segestes steading once or twice the dogs didnt come after him and he heard no shouts or cries to make him think anyone but thusnelda had awakened joy glowed in his heart hed got away with it thusnelda didnt look back even once shed made up her mind and she was sticking with what shed decided the moon went down darkness enfolded the world spirits thusnelda asked nervously before they take you theyll have to take me first arminius said hed never seen or never been sure hed seen a nighttime spirit which didnt mean he didnt believe they were there some of the romans not all but some even laughed at gods and ghosts if that didnt prove they were a depraved folk plenty of other things did something hooted thusnelda started is that only an owl it must have been no spirits swooped out of the sky to strike no demons came snarling out of the trees where they commonly hid nothing to fear arminius said and slid his arm around her waist with a small sigh she pressed herself against him her body felt so warm he marveled that she didnt light the way ahead like a torch since she didnt his eyes had to get used to starlight little by little darkness seemed less absolute wotans wandering star blazed high in the south shining brighter than any of the fixed stars the romans had the arrogance to believe they could figure out why and how the wandering stars moved as they did what answer did any proper man need but that the gods willed it so the dim gray light was at last enough to show him the place he remembered passing on the way to segestes steading here he said softly he led thusnelda off the path and out onto the little meadow hed found here you will become my woman in truth yes she said even more quietly than he no going back from this not for her once shed lost her maidenhead she was either a wife or a trull nothing in between the romans might joke about womens appetites but not arminius folk he undid the brooch fastening his cloak and spread the warm wool garment on the grass then he also unfastened thusneldas he spread it on top of his the best bed i can make for you he said and the grass is soft it will do because you are here with me she said he quickly shed his shoes and tunic and trousers under his clothes he wore tightfitting linen drawers which proved he came from a wealthy family bv the time he pulled down the drawers thusnelda was naked too he wished the moon still shone he wanted to see her better foulmouthed as the romans were they had a point about that it added something well touch would have to do they lay down together he explored her with hands and lips then when he couldnt stand to wait any longer he poised himself above her oh she said in a low voice when he went into her he met resistance she was a maiden oh she said again louder and less happily this time as he pushed hard youre splitting me in half no he said breaking through its like this the first time for women my mother told me the same thing i thought she was trying to frighten me so i wouldnt do anything i wasnt supposed to arminius hardly heard her intent on his own building delight he drove home again and again soon he gasped and groaned and spent himself stroking her check he said you are my woman now and your carrion crow of a father wont take you back no matter what varus had thought vetera was the back of beyond and it was to a cosmopolitan man a man used to athens to syria to rome vetera had seemed the edge of the world now that varus found himself in mindenum he would have given a considerable sum to go back to vetera once more vetera was on the ragged edge of civilization no two ways about it when you went from vetera to mindenum when you traveled from the frontier between gaul and germany into the heart of the german wilderness you fell off the edge the soldiers and a handful of sutlers who traded with both them and the germans were the only men from the empire for many miles in all directions but for the encampment on the visurgis this was germany pure and simple some other fortified camps aliso was the strongest along the westflowing lupia led back toward the rhine from mindenum one of these days legionaries could press on toward the elbe augustus ultimate goal for now varus thought it no small miracle that this roman island persisted in the midst of the german sea the endless woods stretching away to north and south east and west the tops of the trees rhythmically stirred by the wind put him in mind of waves scudding across the mediterranean when he spoke that conceit aloud the officers from legions xvii xviii and xix didnt quite laugh in his face but they came close when you see waves on the north sea sir you forget everything you thought you knew about em before said a bluff prefect named lucius caedicius the ones on the mediterranean well theyre nothing but babies alongside of these several other men nodded absurdly varus felt compelled to defend the honor of the sea that was a roman lake well but we dont sail on the mediterranean half the year for fear of what it might do thats so sir caedicius agreed and varus smugly thought hed made his point but the prefect continued you can get waves like that the year around in the north sea and bigger ones come winter oh the roman governor of germany felt obscurely punctured varus discovered to his dismay that the germans around mindenum paid their taxes in grain and cattle and fruit when they paid them at all that made a painful contrast to syria where the tax collectors used a system older than the roman occupation older than the greek occupation that preceded it and probably older than the persian occupation that preceded the greek in syria the empire took every copper it was entitled to here they need to use coins with us varus told anyone who would listen to him and since he was the governor everyone had to listen to him coins by the gods how do we know what a cow is worth or a basket of apples or a local measure of barley the natives must go home laughing at the way they cheat us sir the germans are only just learning about coins i think youve heard that before lucius caedicius said they mostly swap back and forth like i dont care what they do amongst themselves thats not my worry varus would gladly have sacrificed an ox in thanksgiving that it wasnt his worry too but this is supposed to be a roman province now when the germans deal with us they should act like proper provincials you said it sir this is supposed to be a roman province the prefect replied but theres a difference between what its supposed to be and what it is a dog is supposed to be your friend but sometimes hell bite you anyhow a lot of the other roman officers seemed to feel the same way their attitude left varus fuming how was he going to do the job augustus had given him if the men who were tasked with helping him tried to thwart him instead whenever he rounded on them they denied with oaths that they intended doing any such thing but what they intended and what they did or didnt do seemed very different to him he found he preferred dealing with the germans to his own folk with the natives at least he knew where he stood they seemed to lack the refined hypocrisy with which too many romans armored themselves against the world when a german said he would do something he would when a roman said he would do something he would if he felt like it or if he decided it was to his advantage and when a german had a problem it was commonly a simple kind of problem one a man could easily deal with a chieftain paid a call at mindenum the german didnt come alone of course one measure of a mans status here was the size of his retinue one of the fiercelooking men in his retinue a certain tudrus was also an aggrieved party varus received the two of them in the fancy tent that did duty for a governors palace here he served them wine as if conferring with equals in a way he was segestes had been granted roman citizenship on advice from his officers varus didnt water the germans wine to the barbarians such moderation was only roman foolishness segestes did handle the thick neat vintage well enough tudrus drank a good deal but said little content to let his chieftain speak for him which segestes did in slow accented but perfectly comprehensible latin i come to you leader of the romans because my sworn man and i have been wronged by another man who is a roman citizen go on please varus said if he remembered rightly hed learned about this quarrel back in vetera i will do that segestes had impressive natural dignity he was tall and lean his fair hair graving and his bushy mustache also streaked with snow you may have heard that my daughter thusnelda was betrothed to tudrus here the other german stirred yes it is so he spoke much less latin than segestes did i have heard something of this varus sipped from his cup hed had his wine mixed halfandhalf with water to his way of thinking even that was strong thusnelda was betrothed before to a man named arminius segestes went on as i say i bring this matter before you not least because he is also a roman citizen i see varus wasnt sure he did but he asked what seemed the next reasonable question what did this uh arminius do to make you break off the connection he aims to rebel against rome because of this i want nothing to do with him segestes spoke with care he had to pause now and then to remember an ending for a noun or verb he went on i have been a friend to the romans ever since you began to bring your power into germany that is more than twenty years ago now i think our folk will gain by coming under the empire ask any of your longserving officers they will tell you i speak truth i believe you varus did not even a german would be silly enough to spout a lie so easily checked varus took another sip from his winecup it bought him a few heartbeats in which to ponder why do you say arminius is a rebel that is a serious charge what will he say when i ask him about it he will give you whatever lies he thinks he needs the chieftain replied he will say he joined the auxiliaries because he wanted to help rome but he is like a snake he colors himself like grass so you do not see him before he strikes he spoke in his native tongue to tudrus who nodded vehemently how old is he how old is your daughter varus asked is she past the age of consent segestes looked unhappy thusnelda has twenty years he said reluctantly arminius has four or five more but i am the father here you romans know what it means to be the father in theory a roman paterfamilias had all but absolute power over his descendants in theory yes in practice the law whittled away at that power year by year varus had no idea whether a german father was also in essence a paterfamilias his interest in what passed for law among the barbarians was greater than his interest in falling on his sword but not a lot greater meaning no disrespect to you or your friend he said but sometimes a woman will do what she will do whether her father wants her to or not sometimes shell do it because her father doesnt want her to did this arminius kidnap her or did she go with him willingly tudrus asked a question in the germans language probably wondering what varus had said segestes answered in the same speech before returning to latin she went of her own will he admitted even more reluctantly well then my dear fellow varus spread his hands what do you expect me to do i am only a governor i am not a god to make her undo what she has already done you are the governor yes segestes said you can order arminius to give her up you can punish him for sneaking on to my land and stealing her yes i supposed i could do those things varus said but then what would her match with your friend here go forward as if uh thusnelda never left your home hed heard the germans valued their womens chastity far more than romans did that struck him as something which would have been admirable if it werent so futile segestes and tudrus went back and forth in their language in his bad latin tudrus said it to go forward anyhow i see varus wondered if he did was tudrus so loyal to his chieftain that he would accept damaged goods from him or was he so eager to lie in a young girls arms that he didnt care if he wasnt the first with a roman varus would have judged the second more likely with one of these savages who could say tudrus is of my tribe he is of my clan he is of my band segestes said as if that explained everything maybe to him it did and this arminius varus inquired he is of my tribe segestes said i would not have sent thusnelda away from the cherusci the choking guttural with which he began the tribes name sounded badly out of place in a sentence intended to be latin he went on but past that no tudrus is far closer to me another reason i like this match better well i will summon arminius i will hear what he has to say varus said but if he does not want to give up your daughter and if she does not want to leave him the roman spread his hands again there are such things as accomplished facts you may not like them i cant blame you if you dont sometimes though you have to accept them and go on from there life is like that segestes looked unhappy when he translated for tudrus his companion looked unhappier yet i think you are making a mistake sir he said if you romans are going to rule in germany you cannot be so mild you must be strong he and tudrus got to their feet they bowed and then left the tent without waiting for varus permission strong varus murmured he led three legions of course he was strong of course rome was strong segestes didnt understand the difference between strength and restraint or more likely the barbarian simply didnt care arminius had never imagined he could be so happy hed taken thusnelda from her father for his honors sake what hed felt about her didnt have much to do with it he hadnt had any strong feelings about her for her own sake how could he when he hadnt known her well but he knew her now hed lain with her once to seal the bargain of her giving herself to him rather than to her father or to tudrus and hed lain with her every chance he got after that just for the sake of lying with her hed never dreamt anyone could be so beautiful or give him so much pleasure hed never realized that anyone who gave him so much pleasure would naturally seem beautiful to him he was still very young and thusnelda was as delighted with him as he was with her he knew hed hurt her the first time a man couldnt help it after that though after that she was as eager as he was which said a great deal the two of them amused his father i ought to throw a bucket of cold water over you the way i would with dogs coupling in front of the door sigimerus said why arminius protested we dont do it in public we always put our cloaks up around the bed no one can see us nobody in any german household had more privacy than that his father chuckled no one can see you maybe but that doesnt mean no one can hear you your woman yowls like a wildcat well what if she does arminius had noticed that too he took pride in it as reflecting well on his own manhood before sigimerus could tell him anything different one of the house slaves dashed in from outside calling lord lords son half a dozen romans are riding up the path toward the steading romans arminius exclaimed half a dozen romans might ride some distance through germany in a time without overt war the locals might not want to try to ambush them too great a chance one or more would get away and roman retribution was something the germans had learned to be wary of sigimerus cursed segestes as foully as he knew how what will you bet hes complained of you to their chief he said arminius hadnt expected that but he was a roman citizen and so was segestes if thusneldas father had found a way to use that against him if so segestes really was a devious roman where arminius wore his citizenship as a disguise what do you want to do son sigimerus asked we can kill them if we have to we arent ready to stand against rome if we do arminius replied and his father didnt try to tell him he was wrong he grimaced let me go talk with them and see how serious this is he stepped outside the day was cool and gray a usual enough german day the romans had almost reached the steading they were not big men but the horses they rode were large by german standards they could look down on him as few romans on foot could do their faces were all planes and angles and imperious noses their dark eyes showed him no more than polished jet might have i am arminius sigimerus son he said in latin i am a roman citizen what do you want of me his father and the slave stood behind him sigimerus hand rested near his swordhilt but not on it hail arminius one of the romans said shooting out his clenched fist in the salute his folk used publius quinctilius varus the governor of germany summons you to his lodging at mindenum so that you may explain your conduct in the matter of the abduction of the daughter of another roman citizen all those genitives thrown in his face one after another the horseman was trying to make things difficult for him but arminius followed though he wasnt sure his father did am i under arrest he asked if the roman told him yes he might have to fight by german standards roman notions of justice were harsh and arbitrary but the fellow shook his head no i am to inform you that this is an inquiry only do you take oath by your gods that you tell me the truth do you take oath by the eagle of your legion that you tell me the truth by my gods and by the eagle of legion xviii arminius son of sigimerus i tell you the truth the roman horseman replied without the least hesitation romans were born deceitful not many of them though were depraved enough to swear falsely an oath like that arminius had seen that roman soldiers put their legions eagle the symbol of their comradeship even above their gods warriors who could be skulkers and villains in other ways would lay down their lives without a murmur to keep their eagle safe do you swear i will go free afterwards he asked i cannot do that it is for the governor to judge but he has a name for fair dealing the cavalryman replied arminius considered he knew how badly segestes had wronged him any fool could see as much if this varus even half deserved the reputation the roman said he had arminius noted that the fellow had not tried to cozen him with a lying promise that argued that he did take his oath seriously it also helped arminius make up his mind i will go with you he said your governor will use me justly i hope he is not only my governor he is the governor of all of germany the roman said no one did or could govern all of germany the very idea made arminius want to laugh but he didnt all he said was let us go iv when lucius eggius was in mindenum he drank more beer than wine the locals brewed beer so it was cheap every amphora of wine came crosscountry from vetera sutlers made you pay through the nose varus could afford fancy vintages whenever he pleased maybe as a prefect eggius was a long way from poor but he wasnt made of money like a provincial governor either you know what else he said after a blond german barmaid brought him a fresh mug once you get used to it this horse piss isnt so bad it isnt so good either another roman said and heres the proof even the cursed germans buy wine when they can afford to wines in fashion thats why eggius said same way as every roman who thinks hes anybody has to learn greek so everybody else can see how clever he is thats how the germans drink wine it lets em think theyre as good as we are so they do it it must get em mighty drunk too if theyre dumb enough to think like that the other officer came back and got a laugh from the soldiers who filled the drink shop oh come on give me a break they do like to ape us everybody knows that lucius eggius said sometimes it even comes in handy like when they go to varus on account of their womanstealing instead of starting their own private war wed just get sucked in if they did were liable to get sucked in any which way said a young soldier named caldus caelius her fathers a big shot and so is the guy she was promised to and the guy who ran off with her too its like something out of homer vala numonius said had eggius seen him in the tavern he might not have made his crack about uppercrust romans learning greek the cavalry commander was a roman like that he showed he knew the iliad continuing what turned the greeks against troy paris running off with helen thats what and what made achilles angry agamemnon keeping briseis when he had no right to her and they all fought a bloody big war on account of it eggius knew that much anyhow who didnt we dont want em doing that here me i wouldnt mind if they did the more they kill each other off the better far as im concerned caldus caelius said i wished theyd all do each other in he eyed the statuesque barmaid and appeared to have second thoughts well the men anyway there you go son eggius said think with your crotch and youll always know where you stand everybody groaned someone threw a barley roll at him showing a soldiers quick reflexes he caught it out of the air and ate it he would have liked to dip it in olive oil but not much of that made it to mindenum either the germans used butter instead eggius might have acquired a taste for beer but he drew the line at butter the father is a roman citizen so is the fellow who ran away with the girl vala numonius said an upstanding roman citizen another officer put in and drew more groans numonius ignored him proceeding down his own track so it must be proper for quinctilius varus to sort out the rights and wrongs whatever they happen to be hed come to germany with varus he was going to assume the man from whom hed got the command was right no matter what that was how the world worked eggius understood such things perfectly well who didnt who hadnt been born yesterday eggius could still get in a jab or two so what will he do then tell them to cut the wench in half so they both get a share thats what the jews did once upon a time only with a baby vala numonius said lots of those crazy jews in syria hed been with varus before then lucius eggius had figured as much jews and germans two sets of crazy barbarians they deserve each other he said no doubt numonius said they arent just crazy either theyre two of the stubbornest sets of barbarians anybody ever saw too he sighed furies take me if i know how well ever turn either lot into proper romans but i suppose weve got to try sure eggius finished his latest mug of beer he looked around for the barmaid there she was trying to talk to caldus caelius except for what had to do with her trade she knew next to no latin caelius spoke none of her tongue either eggius didnt know whether the barmaid would ever make a proper roman but caldus caelius with or without the germans language was doing his best to turn her into an improper one when he reached under her shift she poured a mug of beer over his head he swore spluttering like a seal he started to get angry but the rest of the romans laughed at him if they all thought it was funny he couldnt very well slap the barmaid around trying might not have been such a good idea anyhow she was an inch taller than caelius and almost as wide through the shoulders if she had a knife shed be deadly dangerous and as eggius knew all too well germans always had knives or a way to get hold of them sighing he waved to the barmaid himself she came over and refilled his mug he didnt try to feel her up she nodded acknowledging that he didnt in germany winning a nod like that came close to a triumph lucius eggius sighed again and proceeded to get very drunk arminius ground his teeth when he got a good look at mindenum it wasnt that the legionary camp didnt look familiar it did hed seen plenty just like it when he campaigned in pannonia this one was bigger because it held more men otherwise it was as much like any of the others as two grains of barley no what infuriated him was that this enormous encampment sat on german soil the romans had built it as if they had every right to do so theyd thought the same thing in pannonia the locals there were trying to throw them out but arminius didnt think theyd be able to do it the romans had already got too well established and if they got well established here the germans would have a demon of a time throwing them out too arminius scowled he was cursed if hed let some slabfaced roman sealstamper tell him and his folk what to do he was cursed if hed let the romans crucify his kinsmen who presumed to disobey too careful he told himself you cant show what you think if you do you wont get free of this place dissembling didnt come naturally to germans his folk were more likely to trumpet what they aimed to do than to hide it but the romans themselves had taught him that lying had its uses he needed to show this quinctilius varus what a good student he made he urged his mount forward it let out a manlike sigh it was a small horse and he was a large man carrying his weight couldnt have been easy well carrying romes oppressive weight wouldnt be easy for germany either he rode down toward the porta praetoria the encampments northern gate varus tent would lie closer to that one than to any of the others supply wagons came in from the west the romans would have brought their goods as far up the lupia as they could easier and cheaper to move anything massive by water than by land but mindenum lay east of the lupias headwaters right in the heart of germany if i were at war with the romans now i could cut off their supplies as easily as i snap my fingers arminius thought how much good would that do him though the legionaries would fight their way back toward the rhine plundering as they went the forts along the lupia and the ships that sailed it could help them too they had a formidable force here people said three legions and the camp looked big enough to hold them cutting their supply line would infuriate them but probably wouldnt destroy them the worst of both worlds halt who comes a sentry called first in latin and then with a horrible accent in the germans speech the romans were alert well in this country they had to be or theyd start talking out of new mouths cut in their throats they made good soldiers they wouldnt have been so dangerous if they didnt arminius reined in i am arminius sigimerus son he answered in army latin not only am i a roman citizen i am also a member of the equestrian order i have come in answer to a summons from publius quinctilius varus the governor of germany the chief thief among all you thieves was how he translated that in his own mind a minutes worth of muffled talk followed whatever the sentries had expected that wasnt it arminius advanced no farther roman citizen or not he would have been asking for trouble if he had he knew how sentries minds worked they were like dogs who carried spears they had to decide for themselves whether hed thrown them meat when one of them showed himself arminius knew hed won you are expected son of sigimerus the man said somebody might have expected him but these fellows hadnt not right away anyhow the sentry went on one of us will escort you to the governors quarters come ahead i thank you arminius urged the horse toward the entranceway inside the fortified encampment roman soldiers went about their business they seemed as much at home as they would have inside the empire as far as they were concerned they were inside the empire they brought it with them wherever they went arminius hands gripped the reins till his knuckles whitened the gall they had the arrogance a few germans fetched and carried for the soldiers slaves servants hired men it hardly mattered they were traitors to their folk a pretty woman stepped out of an officers tent her fair hair blew in the breeze when she saw arminius she squeaked and drew back in a hurry she wasnt quite dead to shame then she didnt want a fellow german to know she was giving herself to an invader the legionary leading arminius was blind to the byplay here yare he said you can tie your nag up in front of his tent the roman also used army latin equus was the formal word for horse he said caballus instead arminius would have too and a german pony was a nag by roman standards going into the tent didnt mean arminius got to see quinctilius varus right away he hadnt thought it would the roman governor might be busy with someone else even if he wasnt he would make arminius wait anyhow to impress on the german his own importance the tent was big enough to be divided into several rooms by cloth partitions the man perched scribbling on a stool near the entry flap had to be a secretary not varus himself because he was a prominent mans secretary he reflected his masters glory and you are he asked though he had to know by his tone he seemed to expect the answer nothing but a sheep turd arminius might have tried to kill a german who sneered like that but he knew how to play roman games too arminius son of sigimerus a roman citizen and a member of the equestrian order he replied as he had to the sentries who are you aristocles pedisequus to the governor the secretary sounded prouder of being a slave than arminius did of being his fathers son no german no matter how debased would have done that arminius wouldnt have known what to make of it if he hadnt seen it before among roman slaves the pedisequus added the governor will see you soon good thank you arminius swallowed his anger you had to when you dealt with these folk if you didnt you threw the game away before you even started playing aristocles went back to his scribbles arminius knew what writing was for though he didnt have his letters he also knew aristocles was subtly insulting him by working while he was there and he had to keep standing while the slave sat that was an insult too but then as if by magic another slave appeared with wine and bread and a bowl of olive oil for dipping arminius liked butter better he didnt say so to the romans eating butter branded any man a savage he and plenty of other german auxiliaries had heard the chaffing in pannonia maybe this aristocles was waiting for him to complain the skinny little man would glance at him sidelong every so often arminius ate and drank with the best roman manners he had maybe they werent perfect by the slaves standards but they proved good enough voices rose and fell in one of those back rooms one of them had to belong to varus arminius listened while pretending he was doing nothing of the kind a german whod never had anything to do with romans would have cupped a hand behind his ear to hear better so would a lot of legionaries but roman chieftains played the game by different rules having claimed the status of a roman chieftain himself arminius had to show he knew those rules the romans were talking about keeping mindenum supplied they didnt seem to see any problems no that wasnt necessarily so they didnt want arminius to hear about any problems they saw they were bound to know he was waiting out here they were bound to know he was listening to them too whether he showed it or not he hid his curiosity they hid the truth romans used silence and misdirection far more than germans did after a while the voice arminius guessed to be varus said well that should about cover it eh numonius yes sir the other voice replied ill add to the patrols nobody will get away with anything i promise you that i wasnt worried i know how you take care of things the first voice said now ive got to talk with that fellow who ran off with the girl the voices owner sighed as if arminius wasnt worth bothering with im sure youll set things straight sir numonius said arminius fought not to gag roman underlings flattered those who ranked above them in ways the germans found disgusting so much of what the romans spewed forth was obvious nonsense if their superiors believed it they had to be fools but fools couldnt have conquered so much of the world fools couldnt have built up the army in which arminius had served the army that held this fortified encampment deep inside germany which argued that highranking men couldnt truly believe all the flattery they got why insist on it then the only answer he could find was that romans didnt think they were great unless others acclaimed them a german knew what he was worth all by himself a roman needed somebody else to tell him what a splendid fellow he was then he would nod and smile modestly of course and say well yes so i am how good of you to notice numonius came out he was short and skinny and bowlegged he looked like a cavalry officer in other words the nod he gave arminius was somewhere between matteroffact and friendly the governor told me he would see you in a little while he said thank you arminius replied admitting hed overheard the conversation would have been rude even if the roman had to know he had the rule among the germans was much the same aristocles bustled into the back of the tent he and varus went back and forth in greek arminius had learned a couple of curses in that language but didnt speak it then the pedisequus returned i have the honor of escorting you into the governors illustrious presence he told arminius good the german said about time he thought some of his folk would have come right out and said so he might have himself before he went off to pannonia to learn roman ways having learned them he tried to use them to advantage publius quinctilius varus sat in a chair with a back which proved him a very important personage indeed he didnt rise when arminius came before him arminius stiffened to attention as he would have to a senior roman officer on campaign and shot out his right arm with his fist clenched varus smiled he waved arminius to a stool so youre the chap whos too fond of his lady love are you he said was he laughing at arminius or with him the german couldnt tell he often had trouble figuring out what romans meant straight ahead then no sir it wasnt that segestes hurt my honor when he took her away from me and tried to give her to tudrus tried to give yesss varus stretched out the last word he frowned at arminius this segestes says some hard things about you arminius weighed the words and the frown varus was about his fathers age but a very different man sigimerus was tough and hard like seasoned timber romans could be like that arminius had met plenty who were varus wasnt he didnt seem like a fighting man to the german the romans had people who did nothing but gather supplies for their armies quartermasters they called them the notion had never occurred to the germans but it worked maybe varus was stamped from that mold or maybe he really was a fighting man no matter how he looked with the romans you never could tell arminius had met one military tribune who acted more like a woman than a proper man had any business doing but the fellow was a terror a demon on the battlefield how to reply with a smile and a shrug he used like a shield to hide what he was really thinking arminius said well he would wouldnt he if he can make me look bad he doesnt seem like a fool and a liar and an oathbreaker himself this uh thusnelda varus pronounced the name badly he put this in front of a lot of germans names as if they were things not people she is happy with you yes sir this time arminius didnt hesitate at all quinctilius varus noticed he might not be a fighting man but he wasnt stupid amusement glinted in his dark eyes i see he said and youre happy with her too arent you yes sir i am how could arminius explain it to the roman i did not take her because i thought we would be happy but i am glad we are the glint became a smile a small smile but a smile even so how old are you arminius before the german answered he had to count on his fingers i am twentyfour sir why because you make me jealous varus said it is so easy to be happy with a woman almost any woman when youre twentyfour when youre thirtyfour or fortyfour or fiftyfour he sighed arminius mother and father took each other for granted they were content with each other anyhow happy hed never wondered about it he knew the romans laws let them change wives and for that matter husbands almost as readily as they changed clothes his folk did things differently maybe that meant german men and women had to make the best of each other as for fiftyfour to twentyfour fiftyfour was a journey greater than the one from germany to pannonia and back again fiftyfour was a journey greater than one from germany to rome itself and back again arminius could imagine going down to rome hed seen roman towns in pannonia and along the rhine he imagined the imperial capital as something like a bigger version of one of those something like an outsized legionary encampment he couldnt imagine fiftyfour at all an old man aching with bad teeth and short wind varus didnt seem as ancient as all that but he was graying and balding hed seen better days all right at the height of his own strength arminius felt a sudden startling sympathy almost pity for the roman he also knew what varus had to be thinking varus wouldnt want trouble from the germans a governor who wasnt a soldier wouldnt want anything but peace and quiet if arminius gave them to him i do not seek a blood feud with segestes arminius said this i swear by my gods and yours i have thusnelda she is enough she satisfies my honor i do not need to spike her fathers head to a tree quinctilius varus mouth twisted too late arminius realized he might have left off that last sentence the romans worshiped effete gods who drank blood but not mans blood how strong could they be if they turned their backs on strong food then varus chuckled and then he smiled a broad smile you may be a roman citizen but some of your ways are still german he observed it is so arminius said simply but you do pledge that this matter is over now as far as you are concerned the roman official persisted i said it i meant it arminius answered varus smiled again wistfully no you are not altogether a roman what we say and what we mean too often have little to do with each other a pity but the truth when you say something i believe i can rely on it i am glad of that sir arminius said and so he was when he spoke to his own folk he was indeed the soul of truth when he spoke to romans hed learned enough from the invaders to know how to turn their own arts against them he could dissemble and never let on he could not to put too fine a point on it lie he could and he did all right then go home stay there quietly enjoy your woman this uh thusnelda no varus couldnt come close to pronouncing the german name he went on i will tell this segestes that there is to be no feud he will hearken to me he is your dog arminius thought again what went through his mind didnt show on his face it is good he said i thank you varus waved that aside its all right son he said and paused thoughtfully do you know you remind me a little of my own son youre bigger youre fairer but something about the way you hold your head he laughed something about the way you hold back too so you dont tell me off arminius was alarmed but only for a moment this roman hadnt looked into his heart and seen his hatred for the empire no varus an older man had looked at a young man and seen one eager to be free from the restraints older men put on him varus didnt need to be a wizard to do that he only needed to be a man who remembered what being young was like sure enough he went on gaius is in athens now finishing up his education he paused again come to think of it youve had a bit of an education in roman ways yourself havent you not the same kind of education but an education even so what kind of education was gaius quinctilius varus getting in athens arminius had no real notion carefully he said i learned much in the roman army i learned how dangerous you people really are ill bet you did varus said but he was still smiling so he couldnt suspect what lessons arminius had drawn from his service nothing like roman discipline here in germany now is there no sir arminius spoke nothing but the truth there it worried him unless he caught the romans by surprise that discipline made them formidable foes and how could he surprise them when they sent out scouts in all directions when you germans gain discipline i wouldnt be surprised if you show the world a thing or two varus said you need us to teach you what you should know your folk taught me a lot when i served again arminius didnt specify what hed learned the roman governor of his homeland nodded to him good thats good little by little germans will pick up roman ways that kind of thing has been happening for a while now on the other side of the rhine some of the gauls use latin more than their own language they really do some of them may the gods strike me dead if i lie some of them i say are even starting to write latin poetry arminius tried to imagine germans writing latin poetry if ever anyone from his own folk undertook such a thing germany would be a very different place it would also be a place he had no desire to see nodding again quinctilius varus went on well i didnt call you here to have you listen to me going on about how things wrill be a lifetime from now as long as your woman is with you willingly this complaint from segestes can go by the board but he is a citizen and you are a citizen and so it was up to me to get to the bottom of things i trust you understand yes sir arminius said all right then you may go after another hesitation varus added i hope i see you again sometime may it be so may i see you on your knees begging for the mercy youll never find but none of that showed on arminius face he rose from the stool bowed and left the closedoff space that served as varus office he also left the enormous tent as fast as he could never give somebody the chance to change his mind was another thing hed learned from the romans he jumped onto his horse without needing a legup he would rather have died than asked a favor from a passing legionary he swung the animals head around and left the encampment at mindenum by the gate through which hed come in hes just a boy varus said in slightly surprised tones rather a large and muscular boy sir aristocles replied just a boy varus repeated as if the pedisequus hadnt spoken a boy besotted with one of those blond german girls he leered he couldnt help himself german women always reminded him of roman whores in a mostly darkhaired land those wigs made the whores stand out and every time he saw or even thought about the naturally fair german wenches he couldnt keep lewd imaginings out of his mind so you are going to let him keep her his slave inquired yes of course i am id have to start a war to take her away im sure shes no helen and im just as sure im no agamemnon varus said unpleasant place to be in you know either i make this arminius angry or i do the same to that segestes arminius has the girl and she seems happy enough to be had as long as she does her father will just have to find something else to worry about theyre all barbarians up here aristocles said with a discreet shudder will uh segestes be so offended you ruled against him that hell try to kill you without worrying about what will happen to him the next heartbeat pleasant thought varus sent the pedisequus a sour stare the worst of it was he couldnt even rebuke the greekling because it was a legitimate question i dont think so varus said after a moment for a german segestes seemed fairly civilized arminius struck me as more likely to imitate achilles if i took the woman away except hed fight instead of sulking in his tent not an achilles when it comes to looks aristocles said that about every german he set eyes on the northerners blunt features didnt appeal to him that was why he surprised varus when he added ive seen worse though i will say that dont tell me hes gone and turned your head the roman exclaimed with a laugh aristocles tossed his head in an emphatic negative oh no too big and hairy to be really interesting but not bad better than i expected to find in this godsforsaken wilderness the germans frown on such sports same as the gauls do better not to let arminius know varus said savages aristocles said sniffing he smiled crookedly ill get by sir im not one who cant make do with women like a lot of roman aristocrats varus had a boy now and then for varietys sake he strongly preferred the other side of the coin though i rather fancy arminius myself he said one of aristocles eyebrows leaped toward his hairline like any sensible slave he knew his masters states chuckling varus went on not that way but i like him he puts me in mind of gaius youre joking aristocles blurted even a slave could occasionally be guilty of saying the first thing that popped into his head a slave who did say the first thing that popped into his head could regret it for a long time afterwards too but quinctilius varus was not a vicious or vindictive man he had his vices but that wasnt one of them i dont aim to adopt him for heavens sake the roman governor said he does remind me of my boy though the way one puppy will remind you of another hes all big paws and curiosity trying to see how the world works he happened to study with centurions not philosophers but you could do worse this time the pedisequus had his wits about him again and said nothing at all the slightest twitch at the left corner of his mouth the tiniest flare of his nostrils gave some hint of what he thought of the men who were the backbone of the roman army varus missed those while a slave had to or had better pay close attention to his masters expressions the converse did not apply varus changed the subject pretty soon well start sending soldiers out to collect taxes about time the germans find out what they need to do to make proper provincials oh theyll love that they will irony soured aristocles voice his master only shrugged if you climb onto a halfbroken horse hell do his best to throw you off on your head but if you dont break him youll never be able to get up on his back if we dont show the germans that this province belongs to us now and has to follow our rules then we might as well have stayed on the other side of the rhine i wish we would have sir aristocles said vetera was bad enough but mindenum is worse than bad enough meaning no offense to our gallant troops and their stalwart officers by his tone aristocles aimed to affront every military man in the entire roman empire well well be back in vetera come fall varus said by then i want the natives to get it through their thick heads that this is our land now and things will go the way they would anywhere else rome rules the sooner you set this place in order the sooner we can get back to rome or any other civilized place the happier ill be no sarcasm now the pedisequus spoke with deep and obvious sincerity there are other places id rather be too quinctilius varus said when augustus summoned me i thought hed send me somewhere else you know that aristocles this was a surprise and not a nice one but being here is also a compliment of sorts one i could do without aristocles muttered i understand that varus told him believe me i do if augustus needs me here though how can i refuse him this is an important assignment more important than governing syria was syria is a broken horse as i said we still have to break germany i still have to break germany he thrust out his chin breaking this country is the best thing anyone could do to it the pedisequus said if augustus wanted a horse trainer here he should have sent a general not an administrator tiberius is stuck in pannonia im sure hed be here if not for the uprising varus replied his ties to augustus are tighter than mine and hes proved himself a soldier which i havent done yet plenty of other sprats in the sea plenty of other officers in the army aristocles observed but not plenty augustus trusts in command of three legions varus said remember all the civil wars when we were young weve had thirty years with none of that a general who rebelled with three legions at his back could set the empire aflame again augustus gave me this command not least because he knows im loyal to him he pulled a denarius from his belt pouch and stared at the profile of his wifes greatuncle gleaming in silver what would it be like to have his own face on money so the whole world knew what he looked like hed had varus stamped on some of the coins hed issued to the legionaries here but that wasnt the same he shook his head if he challenged augustus he would lose everyone who challenged augustus lost varus had no stomach for war against his benefactor anyway he had little stomach for war against the germans either but he would do what he had to do he wondered if arminius would help him he hoped so nothing made subduing a province easier than willing native stooges v caldus caelius led a column of romans through the german woods people spoke of the woods as trackless but they werent really all kinds of narrow tracks ran through them deer had made some aurochs others men still others deciding which kind was which wasnt always easy not if you were a roman orders from mindenum were to be careful whatever that meant caelius knew what it would have meant in more open country vanguard rear guard and flanking parties out to both sides to make sure nobody could sneak up on the main body of troops only one trouble that kind of due diligence was impossible in this terrain traveling along a path was pretty simple as long as you marched in single file or on what was unquestionably a manmade track perhaps two abreast a vanguard too far ahead or a rear guard too far behind could be ambushed and slaughtered before the main force came to its rescue in this thick forest flank guards were simply impossible they hadnt a prayer of keeping up and so caelius had a vanguard and rear guard of sorts but not the sorts he would have wanted instead of flank guards he had extra buccinatores he had to hope blaring trumpets would make up for lack of protection the hope wasnt altogether forlorn other roman columns were pushing through these woods too one of these days well have proper roads here caelius said his sword was sheathed but he could grab it in a hurry if he had to fat lot of good that does us now one of the legionaries said several other men laughed that meant caelius couldnt blister the mouthy soldier the way he wanted to a clown could get away with all kinds of things instead of swearing caelius imagined a proper roman road broad and solid well paved and well drained the trees cut back on both sides to make way for it that would be a demon of a lot better than this narrow miserable meandering track if rome needs money so bad weve got to squeeze it out of places like this were all in big trouble the wit went on hed got away with one joke so he thought he could get away with two oh put a plug in it lucius caelius said these germans are ours now see so theyve got to get used to acting like they belong in the empire and that means paying up when its time to pay simple right youre pretty simple yourself right lucius said nothing when a superior got on you nothing was the smartest thing you could say caldus caelius wished again for a roman highway the legions could really move down roads like those and better yet they could see what was moving against them a raven croaked up in a tree did that mean the romans had disturbed it or had it seen some germans sneaking through the woods how could you know before you found out the hard way you couldnt when you boiled everything down that was what you had left caelius made sure the sword was loose in its scabbard if a big enough mob of barbarians jumped his troop he and all the men he led would die he knew that but theyd take a bunch of germans with them the natives knew that it had to be about the only thing that kept them from rising up somebody not lucius caelius was glad to note asked wheres this lousy village were heading for not far now caelius said i hope its not far now if its where people say it is and we are where i think we are it shouldnt be far in germany you couldnt take either of those for granted you couldnt take anything for granted not if you wanted to go on breathing caldus caelius was in favor of breathing he aimed to go on doing it for a long time less than a quarter of an hour later the track came out into a clearing behind caelius the legionaries muttered in glad surprise the sunshine was cool and watery nothing like the savage sun of southern italy that had baked caelius when he was a naked little boy even so he had to blink several times against the unexpected glare pigs with a tall ridge of hair on their backs ran for the woods pigs werent so dumb they knew trouble when they smelled it a couple of small roughcoated ponies and several shaggy cows and scrawny sheep grazed on the meadow men and women worked in the fields with scythes and sickles harvest time was here they planted in the spring and reaped in the fall that seemed unnatural to caelius whod grown up in a country where summer rain was a prodigy one by one the germans stopped working they stared at the roman soldiers deploy caelius said quietly maybe he could forestall trouble by showing he was ready for it he had orders which he didnt much like not to antagonize the natives but he was here in the field and varus greek slave whod relayed those orders bloody well wasnt caelius figured he could interpret them as he thought best if the germans decided hed kill them for getting uppity theyd stay quiet as far as he was concerned that was the same as not antagonizing them he did advance toward the people working in the fields without a weapon in his right hand that made him feel naked but not nearly so naked as he would have felt without a bunch of legionaries at his back hail he called in what came fairly close to being the language the germans used he knew a handful of other words but hed picked them up from joy girls these large somber men wouldnt want to hear them he went on in his own tongue do any of you speak latin i do said a mustachioed barbarian not far from his own age dont good speak but speak you what want taxes caldus caelius answered what is are taxes the german asked he overtopped caelius by half a head a great big sword hung from his left hip why would you wear a sword to work in the fields because some other savages were liable to jump you that was the only answer the roman saw and this fellow didnt know what taxes were well hed find out oh sure wouldnt he just youre a roman subject now caelius explained he sounded sympathetic he couldnt help it what were taxes oh my shaking his head he went on you have to pay to keep things going pay another word that meant little or nothing to the natives the germans mostly didnt deal in silver and gold or even in copper they made no coins of their own and were just learning to use the ones from roman mints they traded sheep for barley or beer tor boards or honey for blankets this year quinctilius varus had said the legions could collect taxes in kind next year the germans would have to start forking over silver like everybody else one thing that would make payments a demon of a lot easier to carry away caldus caelius stopped woolgathering although hed be doing just that literally soon enough pay he repeated you give me some of what you have and the empire lives on it one of the other men an older fellow asked the one who spoke latin something the younger man with the mustaches answered in the germans incomprehensible guttural language the older fellow growled like a mean hound his hand dropped to the hilt of his sword tell your kinsman that isnt a good idea caelius advised he turned and waved at the hardfaced roman soldiers behind him we dont want any trouble but were ready for it the mustachioed man spoke again the graybeards hand fell away from the sword hate still smoldered in his pale eyes the younger man the one who spoke latin didnt exactly look thrilled either you say we taxes pay you mean you us rob no caelius said yes he thought robbers take whatever they want we take only a little only so much from each steading the law tells us how much we are supposed to get law this is not law this is robbery the german said could you from my village take without soldiers behind you no of course not robbing in the empire the tax collector comes without soldiers behind him caelius said people give him what they owe and he goes away sometimes some places when the harvest was good two or three years in a row but it could happen then your men are without penises born the german said it was a funnysounding insult but caelius had no trouble understanding what it meant the barbarian went on and what do your penisless men get for these taxes your robbers from them steal roads baths courts soldiers who keep the peace so they dont have to worry about getting robbed and murdered things they cant do for themselves things you people here dont have yet but they lose their freedom that was not a question caldus caelius shrugged who cares if youre free if youre stuck in the middle of the woods and nobody ten miles away even knows youre there the empire reaches from gaul to syria you could go trading to any of those places you could be a soldier and serve anywhere augustus has german bodyguards even now dogs the german said and spat on the ground i am no dog i am wolf look friend i dont care if youre a dog or a wolf or a purple hedgehog youve got to pay any which way caldus caelius said thats what my orders are and thats whats going to happen and if i want to fight instead the german asked caelius glanced behind him the natives gaze followed his the legionaries looked tough and ready for anything caelius mailshirt jingled on his shoulders as he shrugged well you can do that you wont like what comes of it but you can the german weighed the odds unless caelius missed his guess the fellow was also weighing his pride was getting his whole clan slaughtered worth it to him he spoke in harsh gutturals to his countrymen they went back and forth in that grunting coughing language at last the german asked how much you make us pay now they were at the stage of doing business caelius tried to hide his relief he didnt want the barbarian to think he was gloating even if he was sounding as matteroffact as he could he answered for a village of this size two cows or eight sheep or eight denarii if youve got em no denarii the german said as if the idea was ridiculous in his mind it probably was he went on we give you you take you away go you us alone leave thats the idea caldus caelius agreed he didnt say the romans would be back to collect the tax next year too and the year after that and the year after that one thing at a time and with any luck at all he wouldnt be the one who came back to this village more backandforth in the germans language the barbarians didnt like it well who in his right mind did like paying taxes you did it and you thanked your gods you didnt have to cough up more we give you eight sheep then said the man with the mustache you take them and you go what is your name im caldus caelius caelius answered whats yours friend and why do you want to know caldus caelius the german said it two or three times tasting it fixing it in his memory well caldus caelius i myself call ingaevonus maybe we meet again the two of us we see who then remembers anywhere you please ingaevonus caelius knew he made a mess of the big mans name but he didnt care any time you please with your friends or without them with mine or without them too ingaevonus looked at him in surprise it could be after your own fashion you have the makings of a man before caelius could even get mad at him for doubting it the german turned away and started yelling in his own language a couple of pimplefaced brats yelled back at him he shouted them down caelius didnt know what he said but it sounded like a storm roaring through barebranched winter trees the older fellow behind ingaevonus put in his coppers worth too the young punks stopped arguing they trotted off rounded up the sheep and brought them back to caldus caelius here you take one of them said in fragmentary latin thanks caelius answered dryly the kid by the look on his face wanted the romans liver the way the vulture wanted prometheus he probably hated all romans on general principles hate them or not though hed picked up some of their language just about all the gauls spoke some latin these days even if they still used their own tongue when they talked among themselves oldtimers in the legions said a lot fewer people on the west side of the rhine had known latin when they were first stationed there it would probably work the same way in germany over the next thirty years that wasnt caldus caelius worry you have paid the tax for this village ingaevonus he said in loud formal tones to his own men he added now we take the tax back to mindenum they would look like a pack of fools doing it too all these legionaries escorting eight skinny sheep but overwhelming force had its advantages the germans werent going to try to take back their miserable beasts you know whatd be funny a soldier said as they headed off toward their camp whats that septimus caelius asked if another bunch of our guys hit that village by mistake and try to squeeze eight more sheep out of those natives you think that big fellow with the fur on his lip wouldnt go up like mount etna caldus caelius thought about it then he chuckled crucify me if he wouldnt laughing and joking the romans trudged back to mindenum arminius scowled in black fury as roman soldiers led a horse and two sheep away from his fathers steading sigimerus and the other men there were also angry but there were too many legionaries to fight trying would have meant throwing german lives on the dungheap this is why the pannonians rose up against rome father arminius said even before the last legionary went off into the woods yes i understand that sigimerus said i always understood it here he tapped the side of his head with his left forefinger then added now i understand it here too he cupped his testicles with his right hand well then arminius exclaimed the looks on the faces of the other men at the steading were bad enough the expressions his mother and thusnelda and the other women wore seemed ten times worse their scorn burned like the mix of oil and brimstone and pitch roman armies used to fire forts that held out against them if men couldnt protect their chattels could thev protect their women if they couldnt protect their women did they really have any balls but his father asked and how are the pannonians doing in this war of theirs automatically arminius answered with the truth theyre losing it will all be over in a year or two and you think we would do better because sigimerus let the question hang in the air by the way he asked it he didnt think his son had any good reply because the romans had plenty of time to rope down the land before the people who live there rebelled arminius said there were already roman towns in pannonia towns full of retired roman soldiers and their families roman traders were everywhere too the colonists helped the legions and the traders heard about the rebels moves even before they made them if we give rome the same chance shell rope us down the same way then well lose when we do try to fight he watched sigimerus gnaw on his lower lip his fathers unhappy gaze traveled to the women again and grew more unhappy still if we rise and we lose were worse off than if we hadnt risen at all it will spoil our strength for years maybe forever if we dont rise we become the romans slaves arminius said by the gods if we dont rise we deserve to become the romans slaves we deserve to pay taxes every year that made sigimerus flinch arminius had thought it would taxes his father spat using the latin word as arminius had this is nothing but a fancy roman name for stealing they havent had the nerve to try collecting them before and what did that fellow mean when he said they wouldnt take animals next year was he talking about barley or did he mean they would grab a slave or maybe one of our own folk neither one i think arminius said he meant we would have to pay in denarii in silver thats even worse sigimerus said he was a chief he had silver and even gold but the germans got their coins in trade from the romans and now the legionaries would expect people to give them back you see what i mean then arminius said but youve fought for them flavus is still fighting for them sigimerus mouth twisted all of a sudden he didnt like reminding himself of that at all arminius grimaced too my brother is like segestes the romans have seduced them both he was careful to keep his voice down so thusnelda wouldnt hear him he didnt run down her father when she was in earshot he saw no point in stirring up trouble when he didnt have to but when he did i wasnt finished sigimerus said you and your brother have fought for them ive fought against them call them as many names as you please but they make deadly foes if we rise even now before the land is roped down as you say we are too likely to lose and to lose would be our great misfortune that only made arminius grimace again hed seen the legions in action in germany and in pannonia he knew from the inside out how formidable they were wellequipped and orderly to a degree no highhearted german would have tolerated for a moment the romans had plenty of practice holding down folk who didnt want to be held pannonia was giving them even more as if thev needed it we have to take them on when they arent at their best he said thinking aloud how his father asked bluntly it was an important question however much the younger man wished it werent it was in fact the important question i dont know yet arminius admitted well youd better walk small till you figure it out if you ever do sigimerus said otherwise the romans will make you sorry not just you either theyll make all the cherusci all the germans sorry arminius tried to imagine a catastrophe that would affect all the german tribes from the chamavi and tencteri pressed hard against the rhine to his own cherusci in the german heartland to the marcomanni under king maroboduus north of the danube maroboduus quietly encouraged the pannonian rebels but only quietly he didnt want roman legions marching after him next to the gotones far away in the east the gotones had kings too but they were so far away that arminius didnt know the names of any of them what kind of catastrophe would be big enough to make all those tribes feel it the question suggested its own answer a roman province stretching from the rhine east to the elbe would bring most of the german tribes under augustus rule would enslave them in other words the gotones would still lie beyond romes reach but they would need to change their way of doing things too and if no when the eagles decided to lunge forward again i have to find a way father we all have to arminius said if we dont theyll own us have you seen that camp of theirs that mindenum ive heard about it sigimerus said thats not enough arminius said i saw plenty of legionary camps in pannonia i lived in one fought in one while i learned what they did and how they did it but mindenum by all the gods mindenum is the biggest one i ever set eyes on none of the ones in pannonia comes close and in pannonia at least the romans can say they already rule the place were still free or we think we are mindenum says something different if we rise and we lose that would be worse than not rising at all bec sigimerus said yes you told me that before arminius interrupted impatiently his father went on as if he hadnt spoken because it would geld us at the same time as it gave them the excuse to tighten the shackles on our fatherland we cant afford that i think were lucky to have held out against them as long as we have i promise father when i set us in motion against them we wont fail arminius said or if we do i wont live to see it i gladly accept the first part of that oath may the second part not come to pass sigimerus said yes may it not but we must fight the romans even the gauls fought the romans though they lost like most germans arminius looked down his straight nose at the folk who lived in gaul gallic tribes had settled a good part of germany till germans drove them out of it germans would have occupied the west bank of the rhine had the romans not the natives not driven them back against the roman legions honors were about even so far that thought brought arminius back to his main idea the gauls fought well enough to keep their honor if we roll over to show our bellies like whipped dogs we will have none and deserve none dead men may have honor but they cannot eat of it sigimerus said true enough but those who come after them will remember them for aye their names will live in song and deserve to arminius said better that than to live a long life and be forgotten like any other slaves and deserve to be his father sighed i cannot persuade you to set this aside i was not the only one who felt his manhood threatened when the romans robbed us here they have more ways to make men eunuchs than just by cutting as sigimerus had before him arminius cupped his right hand over his genitals sigimerus sighed again if you will not set this aside i had better give you all the help i can by the gods son youll need it and more besides i only hope you find everything you need thats all a smile like the sun coming out from behind storm clouds lit arminius face if we struggle together how can we lose there are ways sigimerus replied there are always ways quinctilius varus looked at the accounts his secretaries had compiled he knew how much the roman provincial administration took from syria every year germany had yielded barely a twentieth part of that yes this land was poor how could it be anything else when it had scant gold or silver of its own and when neither the olive nor the vine wanted to grow here even if the natives werent so barbarous those would have been important entries in the ledgers debit columns varus understood as much anyhow varus had seen germany with his own eves now that he and the legions were abandoning mindenum for the winter he could put seeing germany with his own eyes in the same place all his other memories went yes hed come back next spring he didnt have to dwell on that just yet though he didnt have to and he didnt intend to augustus hadnt seen germany with his own eyes though augustus fortunate soul had never crossed the rhine what would the ruler of the roman empire think when he saw the paltry sum varus had extracted from this province how angry would he be were varus but a little bolder a little nervier he would have cooked the books before his wifes greatuncle ever set eves on them but he didnt have the guts didnt have the balls to risk it his greatest fear one that by the nature of things he had to keep to himself was that augustus had a spy or more than one secreted somewhere within his own retinue if he gave augustus one set of figures himself while the spy delivered a different and significantly worse set the mere idea made quinctilius varus shudder all sorts of nasty little desert islands scattered through the mediterranean varus didnt want to spend the rest of his days on one and he might if he got caught telling that big a lie being married to claudia pulchra wouldnt pull his chestnuts out of the fire not if augustus got angry enough augustus grandnieces husband so what augustus own daughter had spent five years on the island of pandataria forbidden wine and all male company not specifically approved by her father before winning a slightly milder exile in rhegium on the toe of the italian boot of course julia was guilty of gross immorality where varus would only have embezzled after being used like a game piece in augustus dynastic plans none of which worked out the way he wanted julia hadnt cared what she did as long as it scandalized her father varus for better or worse was far less flamboyant he sighed are you all right sir aristocles asked letting the pedisequus hear what was on his mind wouldnt do i suppose so he said gods know ill be glad to get away from mindenum who that wasnt crazy wouldnt be youre right about that usually varus had to wonder whether a slave was sincere not this time aristocles couldnt stand germany or the germans and didnt bother trying to hide how he felt veteras not exactly a triple six either varus said rome would have been the best throw at dice so would athens or alexandria antioch the capital of roman syria came pretty close vetera didnt better than mindenum aristocles wave encompassed what was left of the legionary encampment troops didnt overwinter here not yet when they left for land more firmly in roman hands they made sure they either took along or destroyed everything the locals could use they took all the iron in the camp everything from surgeons scalpels to horse trappings to hobnails to spoons anything left behind german smiths would pound into spearheads or knives or swords the soldiers burned all the timber in the camp they would cut more next spring when they were on the march they built a fresh encampment every day they didnt mind wrecking this semipermanent place one of these days this will be a roman city in its own right varus said plenty of towns in africa and spain and gaul started out as legionary camps theyre respectable enough now i suppose so his pedisequus didnt sound convinced those werent stuck out in the middle of nowhere though instead of arguing quinctilius varus hid a smile aristocles was determined to despise mindenum no matter what back when the empire was younger and smaller plenty of towns that now seemed comfortable and near the center of things would have been frontier posts fit only for soldiers vala numonius came up and saluted varus were ready to head back to the rhine sir the cavalry commander said i wont be sorry to see the last of this place for a while and thats the truth varus glanced over at aristocles the slave radiated agreement the way a redhot piece of iron on an anvil radiated heat varus pretended not to notice but he couldnt help saying well neither will i before long the legionaries would slog through the mud and the muck to the headwaters of the lupia after that the going would get easier boats would take many of them down the river to the rhine roman forts on the banks would make sure the germans could only watch the arrangement worked well enough but it didnt strike varus as suitably triumphant we ought to march through germany he said we ought to show the natives we can go where we want whenever we care to yes sir aristocles said resignedly whats the matter you dont like the idea quinctilius varus was sensitive to his slaves shifts of inflection sir i am delighted to march out of germany the pedisequus replied as for marching through germany theres nowhere in this miserable country i care to go to as far as im concerned the barbarians are welcome to every last inch of it since varus held a similar opinion he couldnt exactly tell aristocles he was wrong one of these days this will make a fine province he said hoping he sounded as if he meant it we just have to finish bringing it into the empire thats all aristocles took an incautious step back and squelched in mud that tried to suck the sandal off his foot clothes that would have been perfect anywhere around the mediterranean proved less than ideal here tunics and togas were drafty no wonder the germans wore trousers under their swaddling cloaks the ones who could afford to wear anything under those cloaks anyhow and boots stayed on and protected the feet better than sandals muttering in disgust aristocles cleaned his sandal and his foot as best he could with a tuft of grass he pulled up from the ground it would serve the germans right if we left them to their own barbarous devices he said they dont deserve to be part of the empire again varus felt the same way his opinion however wasnt what mattered here augustus wants this province he has his reasons and what augustus wants augustus gets that had been true for almost as long as varus was alive and varus as he knew too well was no longer young it might as well have been a law of nature augustus has never seen this country hes never seen these barbarians aristocles pulled up more grass he swiped it across a muddy spot hed missed before by the gods sir if he had seen them he wouldnt want them quinctilius varus laughed he imagined augustus surveying the outpost at mindenum it wasnt that augustus had never taken the field hed beaten romes finest marshals during the civil war after julius caesars murder but augustus was without a doubt a creature of the mediterranean imagining him here in these gloomy woods was like imagining a fish in the egyptian desert the picture didnt want to form well i am a creature of the mediterranean too varus thought and i still wish augustus had sent me to egypt or to greece or anywhere but here i dont belong here and i never will vetera he said aloud when hed first set eyes on the military town on the left bank of the rhine hed thought it the most godsforsaken place in the world then hed crossed over into germany and found out how little he knew about places the gods had forsaken if indeed theyd ever come here at all next to mindenum vetera seemed like antioch next to germany even the frontier of gaul seemed like civilization vetera aristocles echoed varus heard the longing in the slaves voice as hed heard it in his own well be back here come spring you know varus said yes sir aristocles replied with a martyred sigh he was part of the price of empire himself prominent romans needed clever greeks to help run their affairs the pedisequus was better off than he would have been as a free man in poor but proud greece well he was except for the mud on his ankle and between his toes we can leave the savages to their own devices for a while varus said we made a decent beginning here anyhow he clucked like a worried hen i do hope augustus will see it that way no augustus had never set eyes on germany but his will would be done here all the same vi arminius had seen that inside the roman empire steadings tended to clump together in villages and towns in germany holdings were more evenly spread here was a steading in itself in the woods here were three or four together perhaps formed by the descendants of someone who had farmed by himself a few generations earlier here were a pair of brothers and their households side by side here another lone farm here six or eight steadings in a large clearing his folk did have villages though not large ones by roman standards hed never seen a town till he took service with the auxiliaries towns had their advantages he understood that if you brought news to a town you had to tell it only once everybody in town or in the market square anyhow would hear it at the same time so would farmers whod come into town to sell whatever they had and then they would spread the news through the countryside towns were efficient the word and the idea existed in latin but not in the germans tongue roman armies were efficient too arminius wished his own people grasped the concept tor it was as much a weapon as the edge of the sword but the world was as it was not as he wished it were it he wanted to spread news he couldnt do it by traveling to a few towns he had to go to one steadily alter another talk with one farmer or minor chieftain after another and persuade or cajole or jolly the man and the lesser followers at each place to his own way of thinking that way of thinking was simple enough very often so was getting the germans to his side all he had to ask was did the romans collect taxes from you this past fall more often than not someone would say or snarl the word yes more often than not that same man or someone else would curse the romans then arminius would ask and do you want to pay taxes again next year that commonly produced gasps of horror or fury or most often both commingled they were lucky to get it from me once they caught me by surprise demons drag me down if theyll do that again was an answer he heard again and again in almost identical words but they intend to he would say it was no less than the truth either they intend to and they will try to kill you if you dont let them rob you what do you propose to do about that people didnt always say the same thing then a lot of them didnt believe him or didnt want to believe him the notion was as far outside their ken as efficiency was he had the advantage over them though hed seen how things in pannonia worked he knew the romans collected taxes there every year and he knew something else the pannonians have given the romans as much fight as thev ever wanted and then some he would say to anyone who wanted to listen are the pannonians stronger than we are no anyone he talked to would say that the germans were convinced they were the strongest folk in the world arminius would nod and agree youre right i fought them theyre strong enough but theyre no stronger than we are are they braver no that question was guaranteed to affront any german ever born his folk prided themselves on their courage and he would nod again thats right theyre not theyre plenty brave no doubt about it but thev arent any braver than we are either so if theyre brave enough to take on the romans why cant we do the same hardly any germans whod been taxed by the romans plundered by the romans saw any reason why they shouldnt go to war against the legions arminius began to think his biggest problem would be holding the tribesmen back not leading them forward they wanted to march on the rhine and burn every roman fortification on this side of the river strangely enough much of the help he got in restraining the germans came from segestes and others who were proroman there werent that many of them but they had influence beyond their numbers one of the things the romans did to win the land to their side was to get chieftains to go along with them the chieftains and the retinues of warriors they supported helped sway the views of ordinary folk quite a few of them told the germans what an idiot arminius was he didnt mind not many germans whod been taxed thought arminius was an idiot but the ordinary tribesmen did hesitate instead of rebelling too soon arminius found that blackly funny irony was one more concept hed learned among his enemies and he had weapons against the proroman chieftains weapons they couldnt match the romans did this in pannonia too he would say i saw them do it by the gods i helped them do it so i could learn their ways it is what they do whenever they enslave a new folk our old men will tell you they did the same thing in gaul most of a lifetime ago and now the people over there are their slaves one graybeard said well those are only gauls we used to beat them too they arent so tough let quinctilius varus keep collecting taxes from you then arminius replied fifty years from now some roman master will say well those are only germans they arent so tough people nodded taking the point the graybeard bit his lip but he didnt argue any more anyone who argued against arminius soon wished he hadnt varus was drunk when a courier brought a letter from augustus in summer the weather in this northerly part of the world got warm enough for cultured romans to drink watered wine during the winter though everybody took his neat to stoke the fires inside himself varus thought the habit barbarous till he tried it when he found how well it worked he became as enthusiastic as a convert to judaism a servant gave the courier a cup of neat wine much obliged the man said and drank it down without blinking how many winters up here had he gone through enough to get him used to strong wine anyhow the man led him away for something to eat what does augustus say sir aristocles asked i dont know varus wondered if he wanted to know but his right thumbnail lived a life of its own it automatically dug under and flipped off the wax seal that held the sheet of papyrus closed varus held the letter out at arms length his sight was lengthening the same thing must have happened to augustus of course but the letter was in his own hand varus recognized it at once when he didnt go on right away his pedisequus prompted him well aristocles was still sober or close enough he went on watering his wine and wore a long thick wool tunic and two pairs of socks for warmth my dear varus i am glad to hear your first summer in germany went well varus read and breathed a sigh of relief that smoked in the air despite a charcoal brazier he swigged from his goblet before going on you seem worried when you tell me what your tax collectors brought in that made him swig again drain the goblet dry and fill it once more with the dipper plunged into the wine jar hed done his best not to sound worried to treat the roman soldiers sorry performance as nothing but routine his best proved not good enough augustus hadnt ruled the roman world for more than a generation because he was blind to what lay below the surface quinctilius varus drank once more his eves crossed he knew he would have a thick head come morning but morning seemed a million miles away his slave made a wordless impatient noise varus didnt want to find out what augustus said next but knew he had no choice lose no sleep over it the idea is to get the barbarians used to paving taxes once they see thev have to collecting more and more will grow easier year by year keep up the good work he really says that sir aristocles sounded astonished he really does varus couldnt get angry at the greek he sounded astonished too augustus was a notorious cheeseparer he always had been to have him write that he didnt care how much varus collected in germany proved he was also a statesman what else does he say the pedisequus inquired who cares varus said and he laughed raucously augustus wasnt angry at him next to that everything else shrank to insignificance but he finished the letter the weather here is tolerable better i daresay than what you have the harvest was good for which i thank ceres and the other gods no danger of hunger this year tiberius seems to be bringing order to pannonia at last and that is also good news i am as well as a man of my years can be i hope the same holds true for you next year you will go on breaking the germans to the saddle below that was nothing but a scrawled signature it sounded like augustus straightforward to the point with hardly a wasted word the closing that got back to the business at hand was verymuch augustus style too he never left anyone in doubt about what he expected unless doubt worked to his advantage of course here it didnt let it snow aristocles exclaimed we are warmed from the south so let it snow as much as it please thats right varus said as long as augustus is pleased the whole world is pleased no matter how cold it was it felt like spring already varus was not a small man not by roman standards all the same he thought hed get a crick in his neck from staring up at one enormous visiting german after another this particular fellow who gave his name as masua was even bigger than most he stood several digits above six feet he wore a bearskin cloak with shaggy hair unshaven cheeks and chin and upper lip and blunt features he looked like a bear himself sit down sit down varus waved him to a stool not least so he wouldnt need to keep looking up at him i thank you sir masua spoke slow deliberate guttural latin the stool creaked under his weight he was bearwide through the shoulders too a servant brought in wine masua took a cup with murmured thanks so did varus he didnt mix in water but he did sip cautiously he didnt want to get drunk so early by the way masua gulped he didnt care you are one of segestes men you told my aides varus said that is right masuas big head bobbed up and down i am one of his sworn band i fight for him and do what he needs one of the things he needs now is someone to deliver you a message he chose me pride rang in the tremendous germans voice i see varus said though he didnt not yet with luck he would soon and this message is this is message is you are not to trust arminius for any reason sir masua said he goes up and down in germany everywhere he goes he speaks against the romans he speaks against roman rule beyond the rhine i see quinctilius varus said again have you heard arminius say these things with your own ears no masua answered i would not walk as far as i can spit to listen to that womanstealing swinehound that last had to be some german insult translated literally varus rather liked it all the same he went on has segestes heard arminius say these things with his own ears segestes would not walk as far as he could piss to listen to arminius masua paused considering segestes might walk far enough to piss on arminius corpse he might not even do that in spite of himself varus had to smile but he also had to ask an important question in that case how do you know what arminius is supposed to be saying how does segestes know everyone knows what arminius is saying masua replied as if to a halfwitted child varus thought an oafish barbarian had no business taking that tone with him no matter what he thought the oafish barbarian went on arminius makes no secret of it like i tell you he goes up and down in germany he says what he says to anyone who will hear him many men do too many men i have met arminius he did not seem antiroman then varus said masua snorted he would not he was in your power you could have killed him you should have he fought as a roman auxiliary he is a roman citizen he has been made a member of the equestrian order a rare and important honor for one who was not born to our people for a barbarian he thought he is a viper if you clutch him to you like a woman he will bite you in the balls masua said segestes sent you to me quinctilius varus said the german nodded varus went on segestes is arminius enemy of course he is masua broke in would you not be if arminius carried off your daughter if arminius hadnt carry thusnelda off varus was convinced she would have done more to try to get away on her own a roman woman certainly would have no the truth was that she preferred arminius to the middleaged man to whom her father had tried betrothing her instead segestes might not didnt like that which made it no less true no point explaining any of that to masua who naturally saw things his patrons way instead varus said segestes naturally wants me to believe bad things about arminius yes indeed masua didnt even try to deny it he wants you to believe them because they are true and segestes remember is a roman citizen too the enmity comes first i think varus liked arminius and found segestes tedious almost a character out of an old comedy without more proof than you have given me i dont know what you expect me to do arminius will give you proof masua said see how you like that varus face froze i have no doubt that you have now conveyed to me everything your principal imparted to you that being so you are excused please convey my respects to segestes even a lout like masua couldnt mistake his meaning there get out of my sight and dont ever let we see you again that was what it came down to the german got to his feet that meant he looked down at looked down on varus i go you would have done better to heed me i will tell segestes you are too blind to listen too deaf to see he turned his back the cloak made him seem even more bearish from behind than from before he should have gone through polite formulas of leave taking arminius would have varus was sure of that masua didnt bother varus didnt demand them of him either the roman governor was still trying to decide whether the german had been foolish or profound or both at once lucius eggius watched legionaries march and countermarch if you didnt keep them working through the winter they wouldnt be worth a moldy grain of barley come spring i cant hear you eggius bawled pitching his voice to carry through the bawdy ballad the soldiers were singing they made more noise yet the song bragged about the havoc varus would make in germany and among the blond german women as far as eggius knew the general was pretty moderate when it came to wenching maybe the legionaries knew that too it didnt matter one way or the other you needed a good bouncy song to keep you picking them up and laying them down the tune for this one went back to julius caesars day eggius had heard some of the old words when he was newcome to the army they were raunchy too the men divided in half and went at one another with pointless spears and wooden swords you couldnt get killed in drills like those not unless you were mighty unlucky but you could get knocked around pretty well a broken arm a banged knee a sprained ankle assorted bruises and cuts about what youd expect from a good afternoons workout everyone seemed spirited enough in the mock combat that wasnt what bothered eggius about it as the surgeons tended to men whod got hurt he said the trouble with this is the germans dont fight the way we do well you cant expect us to fight like germans another officer said then our men who were aping the barbarians would learn all the wrong things i suppose so eggius said but now our men who are fighting as romans are learning all the wrong things no theyre not the other man insisted theyre fighting the way were supposed to fight the way weve always fought yes but theyre not fighting the enemies were going to tight ceionius lucius eggius said a defense that works fine against a roman with a scutum and a gladius will leave you shorter by a head if you go up against a german and his whacking great slashing sword as long as we fight the way were supposed to the other buggers can do whatever the demon they want ceionius said well beat em we always have were romans i expect we always will eggius started to say something pungent then he hesitated no doubt the other fellow was a fool but he was a fool who spouted stuff they tried to ram clown your throat every day of the month best to go at him with care all i can tell you is that weve been screwing around here for twenty years and we arent much closer to putting them into the yoke than we were when we started oh i think youre wrong ceionius said were wearing them down a little at a time they have a lot of savage customs to unlearn like killing roman soldiers by the wagonload eggius said dryly the other roman looked pained theyre holding markets those will turn into towns one day he said theyre holding assemblies some of them with men from more than one tribe coming together so they can plot against us better eggius said have you heard what that one bastard who used to be an auxiliary is doing going all over everywhere and trying to tire up all the barbarians against us at once ive heard it i dont believe it pointedly ceionius added his excellency the governor doesnt believe it either so there eggius thought if varus didnt believe something it didnt behoove any of his officers to believe it which most of the time was all very well but what if something varus didnt believe turned out to be true well in that case weve got a problem i hear the fellow who accused this german has a family squabble with him ceionius said in lofty tones yeah i heard that too so what eggius said suppose somebody ran off with jour daughter would you give him a big kiss or would you give him one where itd do the most good he cupped his hands over his privates well of course id pay back an enemy as soon as i saw the chance the other officer replied but thats the point because theyre enemies we cant trust anything the one barbarian says about the other segestes wouldnt lie about something that big even in the wintertime weve got people in germany lucius eggius said we can get a pretty good notion of whos trying to pull a fast one did the governor ask any of our people about that not so far as i know he doesnt think its necessary ceionius said eggius sigh made fog spring forth from his mouth and nose heres hoping he knows what hes thinking about segestes clasped masuas hand when the younger german came back to his steading welcome welcome by the gods segestes said come in rest yourself i hope your journey went well im here again masuas voice was harsh and flat a slave hurried up with a mug of beer masua nodded thanks took it and drained half of it at one long pull after sucking foam out of his mustache he said varus wouldnt believe me wouldnt believe you and arminius friends tried to waylay me on the way home but i gave them the slip he spoke with somber pride why wouldnt the roman believe you segestes scratched his head trying to fathom that have evil spirits stolen his wits he wouldnt believe you about thusnelda either his sworn man got to the bottom of the mug roman work bought from a trader coming out of gaul in a hurry the slave looked at segestes who nodded the slave took the mug from masua and carried it away to refill it no he wouldnt the thought of thusnelda lying in arminius arms still filled segestes with rage he made himself push that rage aside even though it was the heaviest burden hed ever set himself against not believing me there is one thing if a man steals a woman its a family affair it is important to the people involved and to their friends but if a man goes through germany calling for a rising against the romans how can varus not believe that he does not believe arminius would ever do such a wicked thing by the expression on masuas face he might have been smelling bad meat the slave came back with the freshened mug again masua drank eagerly he might have been trying to get the taste of bad meat out of his mouth too ha segestes said a noise that was anything but the laugh it sounded like arminius will do anything he thinks he can get away with and we know what he thinks of rome and of roman rule in germany we do yes this quinctilius varus he will not see it masua sounded disgusted for which segestes could hardly blame him strange he does not seem to be a stupid man segestes said the roman king this augustus whose face is on their coins would not send a stupid man to do such an important job as this he is stupid enough otherwise he would hearken to you as a sworn man should be masua was loyal segestes scratched his chin have you ever known a man who cannot tell red from green there they are plain as can be in your eyes but they look the same to him masua nodded yes a man on the next farm over was like that when i was growing up his belly griped him all the time because he would eat berries and apples before they got ripe but for that he was a fine fellow he was bold in the fight i remember that good for him segestes said a german who wasnt bold in the fight wasnt a man not in the eyes of his tribesmen the chieftain came back to the point at hand i think this is whats wrong with varus when he looks at arminius he cant see what is plain to everyone else it could he so masua said after some thought arminius will gripe his belly it he isnt careful though or even if he is yes he will segestes remembered something else his retainer had said his men tried to ambush you they did masuas big head went up and down one of them showed himself too soon though it was early morning and foggy maybe he thought i would not see him but i did and i went back to the steading where id passed the night the men there are your friends they told me of another way east next morning one of those men started up the path id taken the day before he was near my size about my coloring and he had on a cloak much like mine meanwhile i used the side way they showed me the hope was that the ambushers would think the local man was me and so it proved i pray the gods let him get back to his steading safe may it be so segestes said good to know i do still have friends here and there with arminius making such a racket its hard to be sure these days that he witch masua scowled he has bespelled the roman governor i dont know how but he has oh i know how segestes sighed the fire had died down to embers and his breath smoked arminius is young and handsome and bold i seem old and grumpy by comparison he can say he loves thusnelda maybe he even does but i think his course is a disaster tor germany that is why i tried to give the girl to tudrus who has belter sense i would have done the same masua said none of my girls is old enough to wed yet though i know wait till you see how lucky you will remember yourself as being segestes said women cause trouble they cant help it its part of what they are oh and men dont i have learned something masua said the chieftain laughed then sighed again and shook his head arminius causes trouble no doubt about that why would he not want to become part of rome such foolishness without rome where would we get our wine our fine pottery our own potters make junk good enough to use but not good enough to look at where would we get rich jewelry or coins or all kinds of other good things you dont need to tell me all this masua said gently i already know yes yes anyone with sense enough to cover a mustard seed would know segestes said but that leaves arminius out and it leaves a lot of young germans out they dont think of anything but fighting and killing fighting is good killing is good masua said of course when youre young you dont think you might get killed instead thats not so good no it isnt segestes agreed his voice dry if we rise up against the romans how many will get killed lots chances are masua said wars are like that segestes came over and kissed him first on the right cheek then on the left you can see this you are not a blockhead i can see this too i hope i am not a blockhead of course you arent masua said quickly as a sworn retainer should have done for his chieftain well i thank you for that segestes said but arminius cant see this hes going here and there and everywhere telling people we can drive out the romans without breaking a sweat what kind of blockhead is he those runty little dark bastards dont fight the way we do but that doesnt mean they cant fight i have seen them do it the younger man replied you are right they know how why does he think we can beat them so easily then why segestes said even if we win a battle they will just bring in more soldiers that is what they are doing in pannonia their king this fellow augustus is as stubborn a man as ever was born he will not let go because he burns a finger isnt it better to ride the way the horse is already going instead of trying to turn the stupid beast around i think so masua said i told you you are no blockhead and we have a lot to learn from the romans too this whole business of writing segestes regretfully spread his hands i wish i would have come to it when i was young enough to learn it it seems to me a very large idea it could be said masua who had no interest whatever in writing but i will tell you something else segestes made a questioning noise his retainer explained that varus he has a lot to learn from us serving as an officer in the roman auxiliaries made arminius a sophisticated man in germany command meant more among the romans than it did with his own folk in germany a chieftain had to persuade to lead if his retainers didnt like what he was doing they wouldnt follow him a roman officer who gave an order expected to be obeyed because of his rank if the men under him said no the romans made them pay having authority like that made arminius more persuasive even if he couldnt use it all if you tried to give a german an order he didnt fancy he would up and tell you no either that or he would walk away and ignore you from then on arminius the german chieftain didnt have the coercive tools arminius the officer of auxiliaries had enjoyed but he still spoke as if he expected to be obeyed because he did he got more germans to follow him than he would have if hed begged for support the way a lot of wouldbe leaders did you sound like a man who knows what he wants to do was something he heard again and again i am a man who knows what he wants to do he would say whenever he heard that i want to throw the romans out of our country the more men who follow me the better but if i have to fight them by myself i will he would do no such thing fighting the legions singlehanded was exactly the same as falling on his sword it sounded bold though it sounded better than bold it sounded heroic and the more he said it the more he repeated it the less likely it became that he would have to follow through on it the romans had been pushing german customs in their direction a little at a time so slowly that only old men noticed things werent done now as they had been in the days of their youth had the invaders kept on with that slow steady pressure they might have turned a lot of germans into willing even eager imitators of their ways without the locals even noticing but paying taxes the way roman subjects did was not to the germans liking arminius seized on that who knows what this varus will want from you next who knows what he will take from you next he asked again and again you cant trust him you dont dare trust him if you give him a finger hell take an arm if you give him an arm hell take all of you then youll be one more roman slave he wanted to talk about roman soldiers stealing german women he wanted to but soon found out he couldnt it would have been lovely if he could to the germans every roman alive was a naturalborn lecher a threat to their womens virtue whenever arminius tried that tack though a proroman german would sing out what about thusnelda a man whod stolen a woman himself couldnt very well accuse others of wanting to do the same thing oh he could but he got no profit from it if he did and so arminius a practical man soon stopped trying he found plenty of other bad things to say about varus and the romans that didnt leave him open to heckling his own folk were glad enough to listen to him when he steered clear of talk about women hed just finished another harangue when a man he knew came up to him and spoke in a low voice masua got away we couldnt nab him and hes been seen at segestes steading well never get him there thunderweather arminius said so he went and told lies to varus and made it back did he thats not good sorry the other german hung his head and spread his hands hes a sneaky bastard that must be why segestes chose him to go to the roman in the first place he gave our friends the slip some kind of way we still dont know how they thought they were going to catch him and give him what he deserved but they didnt too bad oh too bad arminius said has anyone we know come back from vetera have you heard whether varus paid any attention to him no i havent his acquaintance answered the only way to find out will be how the romans behave come spring yes arminius drew out the word till it sounded uncommonly gloomy he could picture varus summoning him to mindenum he would have to go if the roman governor called him not going would show mistrust and would make varus mistrust him if he didnt already but if varus did already mistrust him chains and the headsmans axe might be waiting for him when he came to the legionary encampment i am a roman citizen arminius thought if varus does try to take my head i can appeal to augustus the romans king that would put off the inevitable but how likely was augustus to spare a rebel chieftains life if he was as canny as people said he would want to nail arminius head to a tree or do whatever the romans did with their sacrificial victims you keep telling people varus likes you the other german said if he does he wouldnt have listened to masua yes arminius stretched the word again if a foreigners fondness was liable to decide his fate and his countrys a slender twig to have to trust but the only one he had vii quinctilius varus got the feeling that hed never properly appreciated spring before that was what came of living his life around the mediterranean winters were mild there snows uncommon winter was the rainy season the growing season the season that led toward spring harvest not here not on the rhine varus had seen more snow in one winter than in all his previous life so he told himself anyhow though it might not have been strictly true he was sure hed never seen more snow deeper snow than the drifts that whitened field and forest around vetera and hed never seen a greater rebirth than the one that came when the sun at last swung north and melted all the snow the barebranched trees enrobed themselves in greenery fresh new grass surged up through the dead wispy yellow stuff the snowdrifts had hidden butterflies flying jewels flitted from one magically sprouted flower to the next bees began to buzz flies and gnats and mosquitoes also came back to life and were rather less welcome with the insects came swarms of birds sparrows and carrion crows and a few others had stayed through the winter but now the woods and fields were full of music swallows swooped thrushes hopped swifts darted robins sang varus appreciated them the more because hed done without them for so long aristocles was less impressed if things werent so awful before they wouldnt seem so much better now the slave said darkly id rather look on the bright side of things varus said the pedisequus sniffed the bright side of things would be going back to rome are we going to do that his woebegone expression answered the question without words then he used a few more no were going into germany dont remind me quinctilius varus said even with the broadleafed trees across the rhine getting new foliage the german forests looked dark and forbidding varus had never seen them look any other way the bright side of things was hard to find he did his best maybe this years campaigns will bring the province under the yoke once for all gods grant it be so aristocles exclaimed in that case you can turn it over to somebody else and go back to rome after all nothing id like better varus lowered his voice the company of soldiers begins to pall after a while bloody bores aristocles muttered which was just what his master was thinking the pedisequus went on is there any chance we could send the legions across the river to do what needs doing while we stay here ourselves vetera is bad but i dont suppose its impossible not next to mindenum anyhow regretfully varus shook his head augustus put me in charge of the three legions here if im going to command them i have to command them if you know what i mean and commanding means being seen to command you have a strong sense of duty aristocles said varus would have liked that better had the slave not contrived to make it sound more like reproach than praise however much varus wished he could he couldnt avoid the company of soldiers practically everyone in vetera was a soldier or a retired soldier or someone who sold things to soldiers or someone who slept with soldiers some of the legionary officers seemed enthusiastic about the prospects for the coming campaigning season one more good push and weve got em i think ceionius said at a supper of roast boar heres hoping varus said by now hed got used to drinking neat wine or he thought he had anyhow its still germany theyre still germans lucius eggius said weve been banging heads with them for a long time like a couple of aurochs in rutting season how do we pull a miracle out of our helmet now we have a fine new leader ceionius said thats how you flatter me varus said which was bound to be true augustuss courtiers were smoother at it than these provincial bumpkins to keep from thinking about that varus added aurochs are a disappointment not if you boil em long enough eggius said after a while the meat will turn tender youve got to be patient though that isnt what i meant varus said in the gallic war caesar makes them out to be fearsome monsters and they arent theyre nothing but wild oxen with long horns caesar likes to tell stories eggius said with a shrug sometimes theyre true sometimes they just sound good how do you know which are which varus asked sometimes you can tell sometimes like with the aurochs you can really find out sometimes the legionary officer shrugged its the same way with the stories about caesar i guess hes what fifty years dead who knows which ones are true and which ones are just crap any old way though theyll be telling tales about him forever yes i suppose they will quinctilius varus said in tones more bitter than he would have expected lucius eggius wasnt wrong julius caesars fame would last as long as men endured so would augustus varus had no doubt of that but what about my own he wondered not for the first time if he was the man who brought germany into the empire his name would live some historian would write an account of augustus reign the way sallust had written about the war against jugurtha the numidian and about catilines plot against the senate or the way caesar himself wrote about the war against the gauls nobody could talk about augustus reign without talking about the conquest of germany and so to some degree people would remember that there had been such a man as publius quinctilius varus but it wouldnt be the same everyone would always know who julius caesar and augustus were people would always tell stories about them the stories wouldnt shrink in the telling either stories never did if a man two hundred years from now wanted to learn the name of the man who conquered germany though so many books were written and then forgotten never recopied after the author put in the labor of composing them in the first place still these were important times and would surely attract an important historian one whose works would be reproduced often enough to last somewhere the library at alexandria was supposed to keep at least one copy of every work in greek and latin it had been damaged in the fighting in caesars day but say it did what it was supposed to do that would give the future scholar a chance to discover the name of publius quinctilius varus if he could find the scroll he needed among the thousands in the library and if he could afford to go to alexandria to do his research in the first place immortality then but a shadowy immortality rather like the one homer gave the spirits of the dead in the odyssey better than nothing less than enough something wrong your excellency eggius asked you look a little peaked like no no no varus denied it not only to the soldier but also to himself just thinking about what germany will be like when its been roman for a couple of hundred years thats all that wasnt exactly what hed been thinking but it came close enough to let him bring the lie out smoothly lucius eggius made a face itll still be the back woods you ask me the gauls now the gauls are picking things up pretty quick but these godscursed germans theyre stubborn bastards no two ways about it i wouldnt be surprised if they were still mumbling to themselves in their own language even after all that time struck by an odd thought varus asked have you learned any of it me eggius laughed just a tiny bit sir so i can talk a little with the german girls i bed they like that you know you can tell em what you want em to do and they can let you know what feels good to them i suppose so varus had slept with some german women too what else was he going to do when claudia pulchrad stayed down in rome but hed made sure his bedwarmers understood enough latin to get by the other approach hadnt even occurred to him eggius chuckled again hate to talk business instead of pussy sir but when do you aim to cross the rhine again how soon can the men be ready varus asked an hour from now if they have to be professional pride rang in eggius voice if youre not in a hurry though a few days to get organized wont hurt all right do that then i dont think theres any great rush varus said right you are sir lucius eggius nodded then he raised a curious eyebrow you sure this arminius fellow isnt as much trouble as people say he is im not losing any sleep over him varus answered i dont think anybody else needs to either the romans had cut back the woods on the right bank of the rhine opposite vetera far enough to make it impossible to bushwhack them when they crossed their bridge into germany that didnt mean arminius couldnt watch them cross without being seen himself this wasnt the first roman army on the march hed seen of course hed fought alongside the legions in pannonia and before that hed fought against them here in germany he didnt think the romans knew about that they wouldnt have granted him citizenship if they did back in those days hed been nothing to them but another shouting barbarus with a spear and a sword and a shield barbarus his mouth twisted it didnt just mean someone who wasnt a roman the way hed once thought it meant somebody who couldnt talk like a human being someone who made barbarbar noises instead hed learned latin he spoke it pretty well not perfectly but pretty well hed never yet met a roman who came close to speaking the germans tongue anywhere near so well romans had an almost perfect contempt for anyone from beyond their borders he often wondered why feeling the way they did they wanted to rule other folk at all he supposed perfect greed outweighed almost perfect contempt no denying they made a brave show though cavalrymen crossed the rhine first he envied them their big horses germans big men rode ponies so small they often jumped off them to fight mounts from the roman side of the rhine were great prizes there werent many horsemen here enough to smoke out an ambush and hold it off till the foot soldiers deployed behind the cavalry came one of the legions the romans were using to try to hold down germany as a fighting man arminius had nothing but respect for the soldiers tramping forward into his country they were tough they were brave in a fight in the open field they could beat more than their number of germans arminius didnt like that but hed seen it was true the romans worked together so much better than his own folk did he muttered something guttural under his breath if the germans were ever going to beat the legionaries they would have to do it on a battlefield where the romans couldnt deploy to advantage the germans would have to spring a trap in other words still the romans werent stupid they sent scouts ahead of their force and out to either flank they were more careful than germans too arminius did some more muttering camp surveyors and engineers followed the first legions then came varus baggage and that of the leading roman officers with plenty of horsemen to protect it arminius chuckled the roman governor wasnt about to let anything happen to what belonged to him varus and his slaves and flunkies came next the warm breeze fluttered the soldiers scarlet capes the slaves in plain white tunics were easy to distinguish from their masters the horsemen who werent in the vanguard followed the commanders even with their fine mounts the romans got less from their cavalry than they might have their foot soldiers were so good they hardly seemed to care about their riders more wagons rattled and creaked after the cavalry seeing them made arminius scowl they carried catapults that could hurl immense arrows or stone balls or pots full of burning oil farther than a bowshot hed seen what they were worth in pannonia the rebels there couldnt match them neither could his own folk being struck by weapons to which you couldnt hope to reply naturally spread fear and the catapults could easily flatten the stockade that warded even the strongest german village arminius had talked about casting the romans out of his land talking was easy seeing a roman army on the march reminded him that actually doing it would be anything but behind the engines marched the other two legions the aquilifer who had the honor of carrying each legions eagle marched in front of it surrounded by the lesser standard bearers and the buccinatores with their gleaming brazen horns the aqulifers mailshirts were likewise gilded and blazed under the bright spring sun camp followers loose women sutlers ragtag and bobtail made up a disorderly train that straggled along behind the legionaries there at least arminius felt superior and virtuous germans did without such folderol they also probably would have done without a rear guard again though the romans didnt believe in taking chances the legionaries brayed out a bawdy marching song arminius smiled before he quite knew he was doing it hed sung that one himself tramping through pannonia but the smile didnt last long the romans aimed to enslave his land and his folk he wasnt sure how to stop them only that he had to try lucius eggius head went back and forth back and forth like a ball in a bathhouse game of catch all he saw were fields and beyond them just out of bowshot the dark endless german forests fields and forests were all he saw yes but that failed to reassure him theyre out there he said theyre watching us cant you feel the eyes he scratched at his arm as if he were complaining of flea bites well what if they are vala numonius said let them watch all they please by the gods three legions marching through their heartland will give them something to think about yes sir eggius said resignedly numonius outranked him he didnt want to argue too hard but he also didnt want the cavalry commander to think he agreed completely so he went on im worried about what theyre thinking to give numonius his due he didnt put on airs hed always been a quiet respectable fellow he said if they arent thinking we could carve them into mincemeat theyre stupid even for barbarians heres hoping eggius answered but theyd have another go at us if they ever saw the chance in gaul the natives are licked they know we walloped their granddads and they dont want to try their own luck with us it isnt like that here you come into germany youre in a country where the people dont think theyre whipped well if theyre fools enough to take on three legions at once thatll change in a hurry numonius said i almost wish they would know what i mean that would settle things and then we could get on with the business of turning this miserable place into a proper province thatd be good eggius said wouldnt need such a big garrison then maybe theyd send me somewhere with decent weather instead i wouldnt mind that myself numonius agreed with a rueful chuckle if i never see another winter like this last one there were a couple of nights when i thought theyd freeze right off and leave me a eunuch i know what you mean sir eggius said in a high squeaky falsetto both soldiers laughed letting his voice fall back to his usual gruff baritone eggius continued wed be better off if we could chop the balls off some of these godsdespised germans i wont quarrel with you not even a little bit the cavalry commander said a geldings easier to ride than a stallion and an ox wont gore you or trample you the way a bull will we could make the germans peaceable and and sell them for a nice price once we take their family jewels eggius broke in if we have to sell all the germans into slavery we can resettle the place with people who wouldnt give us a hard time it worked in carthage why not here i wouldnt complain numonius replied now if only the germans wouldnt they always complain seems like lucius eggius head swung from left to right and back once more nothing was going to take him by surprise not if he could help it and he could whatshisname segestes wants us to skin arminius for him because arminius is spreading his little girls legs and if you believe even half of what you hear that arminius spends all the time when he isnt pumping thusnelda complaining about us his excellency believes thats all moonshine and vapors vala numonius said when segestes sent that other barbarian to accuse arminius a couple of months ago varus set a flea in his ear and told him to go away segestes is lull of sour grapes if you know your aesop i know that one anyhow eggius said have to tell you though i sure hope the governors right were liable to wind up in a peck of trouble if hes wrong he paused and brushed an early fly away from his horses mane then he went on and you can tell him i said so i dont care he knows what i think ive told him so to his face so hes said to me he respects you for your forthrightness numonius answered lucius eggius didnt believe that for a minute nobody nobody liked it when someone came right out and told him he was wrong but eggius had risen from the ranks he wouldnt go any higher than camp prefect quinctilius varus might bust him down to centurions rank but no further he could live with that since varus couldnt destroy his career he was free to speak his mind all that flashed through his mind in a couple of heartbeats meanwhile numonius continued i happen to think the governors right this time segestes is acting like an outraged father in one of plautus comedies you cant believe somebody like that you really cant why not eggius said seems to me like hes got a pretty good reason to be mad well i dont know numonius shrugged he seemed at home on horseback he might have been the human half of a centaur eggius could ride but he wasnt enthusiastic about it when somebody gave him a legup he felt much too far off the ground and he didnt have enough to hold on to either well that was also true for numonius but numonius didnt seem to care the cavalry commander continued his excellency has talked to all these people remember if anybody can judge whos telling the truth and whos up in arms over nothing varus is the one eggius grunted thats so no doubt about it and it was he wished it made him feel better unfortunately it didnt it only made him fear arminius was pulling the wool over the governors eyes that had something to do with where he was his head went to the left once more and then to the right the army had flank guards out to both sides of course no great swarm of howling german barbarians would catch the legions unawares he kept peering this way and that anyhow he might have been in a small detachment that needed every working eyeball it had hed been in detachments like that often enough to give him habits almost impossible to break numonius also looked now one way now the other eggius nodded to himself when he noticed that the other officer had also learned caution in enemy country then and this was enemy country no two ways about it no wonder caesar had made more of the aurochs than it deserved after first plunging into the german forests and he talked about the moose as if it were so large it made trees fall over when it leaned against them and it couldnt get up again afterwards because its legs had no joints and caesar spoke of another weird beast with a single branching horn growing out of its forehead lucius eggius hadnt the slightest idea what that was supposed to be he suspected caesar couldnt have told him either old julius had listened to a few yarns too many all right the bad news was the german forests remained as full of germans as they were in caesars day and germans remained more dangerous than all the aurochs and moose mooses and onehorned whatsits put together lucius eggius had no trouble seeing that he wondered why varus had so much with it into germany again quinctilius varus could have done without that indeed he would gladly have done without it leaving the empire behind was harder the second time than it had been the first the year before he hadnt really realized what he was abandoning now he did do you know what i dont understand he said to aristocles as the legions made camp one night no sir the pedisequus answered but youre about to tell me arent you too right i am if varus recognized the irony lurking in his slaves voice he didnt show it instead intent on his own thoughts he went on i dont understand why the germans arent dropping down on their knees and knocking their heads against the ground to thank us for taking them into the empire the way they live now he shuddered is it so bad aristocles asked you didnt take me along this afternoon when you visited that what do they call it sir a steading they call it a steading varus brought out the terminus technicus with sour relish and no its not that bad its worse much worse if you want to know what i think the germans and their farm animals all shared the same miserable room the germans oh yes and the chickens were the ones who walked on two legs past that it was hard to tell them from the beasts of burden aristocles giggled then he tried to pretend he hadnt then he gave up pretending and giggled some more thats wicked sir wicked what you think im joking by the gods i wish i were fetch me some wine from the cooks will you maybe itll wipe the taste of what i saw out of my mouth varus said of course sir aristocles hurried away when he came back to varus tent he had a cup of wine for the governor and one for himself varus didnt say anything about that naturally a slaw would look out tor himself after pouring a small libation onto the squashy german soil the governor asked where was i what you saw at the steading sir aristocles did not bother with a libation whatever he could gather he kept oh yes thats right of course and this barbarian was one of the rich ones as they reckon such things here poor dog he and his werent hungry i will say past that i suppose they insist they would sooner be free aristocles lip curled in a bravura display of scorn freedom is over rated i assure you it is eh varus said thinking a man from the great days of greece would have said no such silly thing so youd turn it down if i offered it to you i am confident you will offer it to me sir in your will the pedisequus replied till then and the gods grant that time be far in the future i am content with my lot a slave not lucky enough to have such a kind and generous master might see things differently i confess of course slaves flattered a slave who didnt flatter might find his master less kind and generous than he would otherwise but varus had heard the same thing from other men he owned no matter how much he discounted each individual flattery they added up to something when taken all together hed even heard the same thing from women he owned and not all of those women had been too old or too ugly to keep him from bedding them slavery was harder on women than on men well what in this life wasnt if a nicelooking woman happened to be your property why wouldnt you enjoy her your own property couldnt very well refuse you and if a slave conceived that was pure profit still varus didnt want his slave women hating him afterwards he was a cautious moderate man and didnt want anybody hating him people who hated sometimes struck out without worrying about what it would cost them afterwards some men varus knew didnt care some of them took extra pleasure from laying a slave girl who would have spit in their face were she free some men liked hunting lions and bears and crocodiles too and quite a few hunters died younger than they would if they didnt go after dangerous game how many men died sooner than they would have if theyd kept their hands off slave girls who couldnt stand them horrible things happened to slaves who murdered openly that was necessary it kept other slaves from getting nasty ideas but not all poisonings for instance were easy to detect if someone came down deathly ill or slowly wasted away maybe it was fate on the other hand maybe it was somebody elses revenge quinctilius varus didnt want to worry about things like that he also didnt want aristocles brooding that he might not be manumitted and so he murmured youre quite right ive provided for you im sure youll do well aristocles might have dispraised freedom but he blossomed like these german flowers in springtime when varus affirmed he would gain it your excellency is very kind very kind he said in greek falling into his native tongue was often a sign hed been touched i thank you so much you are welcome varus answered also in greek as far as grammar went varus spoke it perfectly but his accent still proclaimed him a foreigner romans reckoned everyone but themselves and greeks barbarians as far as aristocles was concerned varus was as much a barbarian as arminius or segestes the pedisequus probably wouldnt say that out loud his sense of selfpreservation worked varus had talked with plenty of other greeks free men though he knew what they thought even if respect for romes might made them mind their manners things are different for you and the germans varus said you understand freedom you know what it really means the germans are free like so many wolves in the woods we have to be good shepherds and make sure they dont slaughter our flocks and run wild a nice figure sir aristocles said that might have been flattery too if it was quinctilius varus didnt notice because he also thought it a nice figure he would have thought of the germans as wolves even if they werent fond of draping themselves in pelts like aquilifers and buccinatores since they were the comparison sprang even more naturally to his lips except for his visit to the friendly chieftain he hadnt seen many of them since legions xvii xviii and xix plunged into germany that didnt surprise him even in provinces the romans had ruled for years locals made themselves and their livestock scarce when legionaries marched by no doubt the farmers in pericles greece had done their best to disappear when phalanxes full of hoplites came near their holdings varus laughed back when the pyramids and sphinx were new egyptian peasants must have tried to steer clear of the pharaohs soldiers some things never changed whats funny sir aristocles asked varus told him the pedisequus dipped his head in agreement i expect youre right he said i suppose pharaohs armies went through syria every now and then varus said musingly thats old old country there in the east maybe not so old as egypt but older than greece and rome yes aristocles mouth tightened as if hed bitten into an unripe persimmon pride in their own antiquity was one of the few edges greeks had on romans varus slave couldnt even complain because the roman had already admitted that syria was older than his own homeland too then quinctilius varuss mouth also tightened but for a different reason from a land as old as time to one where time doesnt seem to have started yet a bit of a change isnt it just a bit yes sir aristocles looked around at the oaks and elms and beeches and chestnuts coming into leaf and at the pines and firs and other conifers whose needles darkened the german forests aspect it is a pity augustus didnt name you augustal prefect then you could have seen the egyptian antiquities at first hand as you say theres nothing old here except the woods yes indeed varus mouth got tighter yet a clever slave could get back at his master as the greek had just proved augustal prefect of egypt was the most important administrative post in the empire after the one augustus held himself of course it was also the post varus had craved after governing syria and it was the post his wifes greatuncle had chosen not to give him i have to do the best i can where augustus decided to send me varus said the decision was his everything in the empire was augustus to give or to withhold as he saw fit that was what winning all those civil wars meant oh hed built up a fine republican facade to operate behind but it was a facade as anyone with eyes to see knew aristocles sighed if only the pannonians hadnt rebelled if if if varus said not because the pedisequus was wrong but because he was right if tiberius werent putting down the rising within the empires borders he would hold this post now and if stern unsmiling tiberius were whipping the germans into line augustus might well have sent varus to egypt had augustus sent varus there aristocles would have gone along the greek sighed again this time on a more resigned note oh well what can you do eh your excellency that question looked for the answer not a thing but varus surprised his slave if im to make this a roman province i will make it a roman province the better the notion the natives have of whats expected of them the better roman subjects theyll make er yes aristocles blinked no he hadnt been looking for that or anything like that may your efforts be crowned with success i hope they will i think they will centuries from now i hope this will be as much roman land as say spain or cisalpine gaul well need hard work to make that happen but i dont believe any roman here fears hard work varus said plenty of legionaries worked no harder than they had to varus took that for granted legionaries were men like any others but he also took for granted that their superiors would keep them working hard enough to do what needed doing what else were officers for in his minds eye varus saw towns growing out of legionary encampments in germany as theyd done so many other places in the empire he saw gleaming marble temples to romes gods and to germanys for druids and jews aside the romans didnt meddle with religion he saw bathhouses and colonnaded market squares where citizens in togas talked over the latest news he saw amphitheaters for chariot races and gladiatorial games and beast shows he saw theaters where the locals could watch plautus and terence and mime shows he saw schools and shoemakers millers and scribes it could happen it would happen once the germans got used to the idea of being part of something larger than themselves what would stop it then nothing he could see true the germans still nailed the heads of men theyd slain to trees as an offering to the spirits inside but the gauls had done the same thing till caesar conquered them for that matter the untamed tribes in britannia and hibernia still did the ones within the empires borders were surprisingly civilized these days the germans could be too all they needed was a firm hand and a little time viii arminius had found himself another forestscreened vantage point from which to watch the romans encroach on germany this one didnt lie hard by the rhine the border between germany and gaul since caesar checked the germans westward wandering this one was in the heart of his own folks fatherland now that spring had returned so had the storks rebuilding their old nests in dead trees and so had the romans rebuilding their old encampment at mindenum this time sigimerus had come with arminius for a firsthand look at the men who aimed to despoil the germans of their freedom what arminius father saw impressed him against his will but it did arminius understood that grudging respect it was a large part of what he felt about the romans too they work hard dont they sigimerus said and they work fast so they do both arminius agreed his father scowled if you go behind a tree to ease yourself and them come back to watch them again the palisade will have grown some while you were pissing they wouldnt be so dangerous if they didnt have a good notion of what they were doing arminius said theyve conquered many other folk they know how to go about it if they dont make any mistakes i fear theyll win here too theyre winning in pannonia no matter howstrong and how stubborn the rebels are there and you helped them sigimerus sounded reproachful i did arminius nodded one man more or less made no difference in how the war would have turned out a hero his father began no arminius cut him off even if that was rude one of the things i learned is that heroes dont matter much not the way they fight their soldiers might as well be farmers or potters everyone has his particular job to do and he does it and their armies mostly win not here by the gods sigimerus exclaimed weve taken plenty of roman heads i know father arminius said gently but theyve won their share of fights too if they hadnt would they be running up this encampment again its a long way from the rhine to here isnt it though sigimerus sounded glum arminius couldnt blame him roman matteroffactness at work had a daunting quality to it the romans went about their business no matter what as if convinced nothing could withstand them as long as they kept at it no not as if they were convinced of that arminius hitch as an auxiliary had taught him as much along with many other things here some romans felled trees others trimmed them others hoisted them into position on the palisade others dug a trench around the ring of sharpened tree trunks others took the spoil from the diggers work and shaped it into a rampart and still others stood to arms ready to ward the laboring legionaries against surprise attack how can we stop them sigimerus seemed gloomier still theyre like ants or bees arent they a big hive of romans he ruefully shook his head they can sting all right arminius said but you put your finger on it yourself so can we somehow we have to arrange it so we meet them on ground that gives us the edge then we strike that sounds good son but a lot of things that sound good arent so easy to bring off sigimerus said just look at the swinehounds theyre ready for anything you can tell theyd almost thank us for wading into them itd give them the chance to make us sorry we were ever born too right i remember an ambush in pannonia the pannonians thought they were ambushing us while we made camp but it turned out to work the other way around arminius said minucius the military tribune who led us picked a spot near some woods so the enemy could gather there and think he was safe but we figured they were in there and we were out in the open so we had plenty of room to deploy when they showed themselves oh we made them pay he smiled at the memory hed fought well and his side had won even if it was also the romans side his fathers expression came closer to despair if they always take such pains how will we ever beat them i said it before they have to make a mistake arminius answered they arent gods father theyre men and little men at that they make mistakes all the time just like us we have to get them to make the kind of mistake that serves our need yes you said that before too sigimerus sounded like a man talking to a young foolish son trying to get him to see his foolishness what you havent told me is how you propose to do it i havent told you how because i dont know arminius sounded like the young foolish son admitting what he would sooner deny but there has to be a way why sigimerus asked relentlessly you want the romans to be stupid and youve just spent all this time explaining to me how clever they are clever people are clever because they mostly dont do stupid things mostly arminius seized on the word like a drowning man grabbing hold of a log that doesnt mean theyre perfect they arent no one is smart all the time no one is smart all the time his father agreed but he wasnt looking at the romans as they built their fortresscamp right in the middle of germany no he was looking straight at arminius the younger mans cheeks and ears might have caught fire we can beat them arminius insisted we have to beat them if we let them go on the way theyre going they will enslave us he stuck out his chin in defiance of sigimerus of the romans of everything in the world that dared opposed his will go ahead tell me im wrong sigimerus sighed but this time he looked at the roman soldiers chopping and sawing and hauling and digging and building he sighed again his face said a great many things none of them happy all he said though was if we try and we fail germany wears the chains of slavery forever she wears them if we dont try too arminius answered shes bound to wear them then but if we fight and win shes free free forever his father looked at the romans once more this time he said not a word quinctilius varus didnt like to sit up when he dined but even a chair with a back was a luxury in mindenum a couch a whole set of couches would have made these bluff straightforward soldiers grumble varus knew that no matter how little he cared for it he also knew he had to get along with the officers it was not only that they were the men who carried out his orders if he didnt stay on good terms with them he had no one but his slaves to talk to in this straitened place that wasnt enough under the chief cooks watchful and anxious eyes two kitchen slaves hulking germans carried a covered silver tray into the tent doing duty for a dining hall and set it on the table one of them protected his hand with a big of rag as he grabbed the covers handle and pulled it off steam and savory smells filled the tent varus and the other diners exclaimed in delight a couple of the soldiers even clapped their hands what could you expect from such people relief in his voice the cook said roast boar your excellencies with forest mushrooms on a bed of cabbage and turnips id never get bored with that lucius eggius called out for a moment varus heard it as a hungry mans commonplace then he caught the pun he sent eggius a look half respectful half reproachful was the wordplay just luck or was there more to the officer than met the eye varus decided he didnt have to worry about it now he was the highestranking man here so he was entitled to feed himself first and take the choicest gobbet he did seizing a smoking chunk of pork generously outlined with dripping fat his mouth watered it tasted as good as it looked and smelled varus could imagine no higher praise smiling chewing he nodded to the cook that worthy bowed in delight vala numonius chose next the cavalry commanders right hand closed on a slice even bigger and fatter than varus good numonius said with his mouth full wonderful the cook beamed one by one in order of rank the roman officers fed themselves begging your pardon friends one of them said as he took food with his left hand we know you sinistrus varus said the nickname told how thoroughly lefthanded the legionary was his right hand was as clumsy and useless as most peoples left good only for wiping himself varus had known a few other men like that they always apologized when they fed themselves with what was usually the wrong hand the mushrooms were different from the familiar italian varieties and also different from the ones varus had eaten in syria not better or worse the governor judged but different one of the officers spoke to the cook you tried these out on beasts before you tried them on us right oh yes sir the cook said so quickly that the legionaries laughed some good news anyway lucius eggius voice was dry the roman officers laughed again so did quinctilius varus he liked mushrooms but he also knew you could make mistakes with them and a mistake with a mushroom was much too likely to be the last mistake you ever made another officer raised a winecup heres to putting germany under our thumb once and for all varus was glad to drink to that toast the rest of the diners followed his lead all the same he heard somebody mutter what id really like is to put germany behind me he looked around trying to make out whod spoken but he couldnt he didnt recognize the voice and no ones face gave him away besides how angry could he get he would have liked nothing better than going back to gaul going back to italy going anywhere but here no matter what he would have liked he had to stay by the gods gentlemen we will whip this province into shape he declared and if we have to resort to the lash thats what well do the germans need to know who their rightful masters are hear hear several officers loudly supported him others though sat quietly as if trying to pretend they hadnt heard what he said most of the ones who made a point of agreeing had come north with him the year before most of the ones who stayed quiet had been fighting the germans longer than that were the newcomers too hopeful am i too hopeful varus wondered or were the veterans of this frontier jaded and frustrated because things here hadnt gone better quinctilius varus decided it had to be the latter the germans had stayed pretty quiet even though hed started accustoming them to taxation why wouldnt they turn into proper roman subjects if he kept on traveling the road hed begun and he was sure augustus wouldnt have sent him up here if the job werent doable if anyone had ever had an instinct for such things augustus was the man the veterans had made a hash of things that was all and so they built the germans up to be bigger and fiercer and stubborner than they really were hed made progress he would make more if augustus thought he could do it he did too sometimes the germans would attack a roman army without the slightest hesitation sometimes a couple of roman soldiers could amble through the countryside and get nothing but friendly treatment you never could tell caldus caelius and two or three buddies were ambling through the countryside now the legionaries werent stupid about it theyd told their friends back at mindenum where they were going if anything happened to them the legionaries would make the barbarians pay and the germans around mindenum had figured that out knocking off a roman soldier here was more expensive than it was worth caelius and his friends wore helmets and swords on their belts you didnt want to beg the germans to jump you but he wasnt what youd call anxious hard to worry about anything with spring burgeoning all around new bright grass pushed up out of the ground new shiny leaves were on all the trees that werent conifers and in weather like this mild and mostly sunny you could ignore the gloomy needles on the pines and spruces flowers blazed across the meadows like stars in the night sky the air smelled sweet and green birds sang in the trees throwing out music for anyone who walked by germany wouldnt be a bad place caelius remarked listening to a blackbirds clear notes if it stayed this way the year around he came from a farming village south of neapolis down near the toe of the boot he knew the difference between summer and winter there winter was the rainy season and it did get cooler than the blazing summer heat but it rarely snowed and far fewer trees lost their leaves than they did here life down there had a more even pace he missed it one of his friends peered into the woods germany wouldnt be a bad place the other legionary said if it didnt have germans in it all the other romans laughed caelius wondered why youve got that right sextus he said only way to get rid of them is to kill em all though dont remind me sextus said and how many of us would they bump off before we finished with em the sun ducked behind a cloud some of the brightness would have gone out of the day even if it hadnt too stinking many caelius said theyre tough no two ways about it a rabbit bounded across the trail and disappeared into tall grass sextus pointed after it the barbarians hide just like that the buggers theres a difference caelius said whats that his friend liked being contradicted no more than any other mortal when rabbits hide they dont take along spears and swords and bows caldus caelius said sextus grunted well so they dont and all kinds of things eat them i wish something would eat up the germans a local wrapped in his cloak rounded a stand of trees up ahead watch your mouths boys caelius said quietly some of these bastards know latin we dont want to be calling them dogs to their faces why not another legionary demanded its what they are but the officersll have our guts for sandal straps if we start a fight for no reason caelius said the other soldier a younger man not that caelius was very old muttered under his breath but subsided caelius showed the german up ahead a raised empty right hand slowly the native returned the gesture even more slowly he came toward the romans he was tall and proud and skinny his cloak had a bronze clasp in the shape of a beast the creatures eye was of stone or perhaps glass paste that said the german was a man of some substance though probably not a chief a real leader would have had a gold or silver clasp for his cloak and would have worn breeks under it too this fellows hairy shanks stuck out below the bottom of his cloak his spear was made for thrusting it was longer and stouter than the javelins caelius and his friends used we have no quarrel with you caelius said in latin then he said what he hoped was the same thing using his scraps of the germans language no then go back where you came from the barbarians latin wasnt much better than caelius command of his language he looked at his spear he looked at the romans several of them and one of him if he started a fight hed regret it but not for long and hed never do anything else that stupid afterwards with a sigh he nodded i have no quarrel with you now caldus caelius gave his pal a look that said see he might have understood you after all the one the other roman returned said something like yes mother they grinned at each other caelius gave his attention back to the german theres a little village down this path isnt there he said why you want to know from the anger and alarm in the natives voice he was wondering whether the legionaries aim to burn the place first and then rape the women or the other way round i thought maybe wed buy some of that uh beer you people brew caelius answered he liked wine better what roman in his right mind wouldnt by all the signs the germans liked wine better too when they could get it but all the wine that came to mindenum started from vetera there was usually enough to give each legionary his fair share but not enough to get drunk on and so beer would do ach the german said a deep guttural noise he nodded again visibly relaxing yes there is a village yes there is beer good thats good caldus caelius turned to the other romans come on boys they sidled past the german both they and he stepped out of the path while they did it so neither side admitted to giving way to the other caelius had done that dance of pride before if you respected a germans manhood he wouldnt feel he had to prove it to you most of the time anyway caelius looked back over his shoulder once to make sure the barbarian wasnt trying to get cute the german was looking back at the romans their eyes met locked slowly and deliberately caelius nodded so did the german they both looked away trouble sextus asked nah caelius said after a moments pause for thought not now anyhow he was just checking you know same as me sextus nodded sure my necks on a swivel every time we leave the encampment you arent the only one caldus caelius assured him the village such as it was lay not quite half a mile down the path five or six farmhouses stood close together in the middle of the fields the natives worked caelius didnt sneer at it that much hed seen cities sure but hed grown up in a place not a whole lot bigger than this one watching the germans hoeing and planting at this season instead of harvesting still startled him but what could you expect in a land where it rained in the summertime women tended the vegetable plots the way they would have in italy a lot of the vegetables were familiar too onions lettuces the indispensable turnips and beets but the germans had never heard of garlic fools that they were barbarians that they were they thought it smelled bad they grew some roots and leaves the romans didnt use back home caldus caelius had tried a few of them he supposed he could eat them again if he had to but hoped he wouldnt have to the legionaries didnt try to get fresh with the gardening women the germans hated unwelcome advances at least as much as italians would have one squeal from a girl and all the barbarians out in the fields would have come running with mattocks and adzes and whatever else they had out there a grayhaired man bent and stiff with age as old men always were hobbled out of one of the farmhouses leaning on a stick caelius eyed it it was carved from top to bottom with little animals and men hunting clever work if you had the time to sit down and do it like a lizard the oldtimer soaked up sunshine he stretched and straightened a little scars seamed his arms and legs hed seen his share of fighting and then some back in the day a cataract clouded one of his eyes the other had stayed clear pax he said to the romans not only his accent but two missing upper front teeth made his voice mushy pax caelius answered the old man cupped his free hand behind his ear peace the legionary repeated louder this time still in latin the old man went on you come for the beer yes he could make himself understood all right how much of his fighting had been against the romans how much against germans from other tribes or from this one some questions might be better left unasked besides the barbarians query needed answering thats right caldus caelius said eagerly the other legionaries seemed happy enough to let him do the talking but they added smiling nods you have silver the graybeard went on sure do caelius dug a denarius out of his belt pouch his friends could pay their share later no matter how much he drank he wouldnt forget that they owed him a denarius was close to a days salary for him ach the old man made that guttural noise germans liked he held the denarius out at arms length so he could examine it with his good eye the silver coin shone in the sun he was looking at the reverse because caelius could see augustus rightfacing profile on the other side a slow smile spread across the barbarians face it is good sure caelius said a denarius might be worth a good bit to him but it was worth a lot more to the native since the germans didnt mint their own money they made a big deal of the coins they got from the romans the german said something in his own language caelius thought it meant something like bring it out ive got the cash that was about as far as his knowledge of the germans tongue stretched two women close by left off gardening and went into the farmhouse one of them rolled out a goodsized oaken barrel the barbarians often preferred barrels where romans would have used pottery the other woman carried earthenware cups and a dipper carved from wood she handed each legionary a cup thank you caelius said in her language she blinked then smiled at him she wasnt pretty and she was at least fifteen years older than he was but the smile turned her from a crone to somebody who might be a nice person down into the barrel went the dipper the woman whod handed caelius his cup filled it for him your health she said thanks he said again the roman salute was the same though he thought it sounded better in latin a greek doctor attached to the legion had once told him greeks said the same thing too that was pretty funny when you got right down to it he drank as soon as he tasted the stuff he had to remind himself not to screw up his face however much he wished beer were sweet like wine it wasnt you couldnt do anything about that but if you drank enough beer would do something to you ive been up on over i mean this miserable frontier too long sextus said gods help me im starting to like beer tell the doctors helpers next sick call caldus caelius said maybe they can cure you then he laughed if you like it enough to drink a lot you will need to see the doctors helpers at sick call so what sextus said ill be happy while im drinking and thats what counts he dipped his mug full again then started emptying it caldus caelius filled his mug again too why not they were off duty they might get teased for coming back to the encampment drunk but they wouldnt get in trouble you know another roman said when you look at em the right way these german gals arent so ugly theyve got a lot to hold on to you know what i mean he eyed the girl whod rolled out the barrel caelius hadnt drunk himself stupid yet not that stupid anyhow careful he said you dont want to get too pushy with them or youll bring their menfolk down on us they like maidens here same as we do i know i know the other legionary replied for some silver though i bet i can get her to go down on her knees for me or else take it up the rear if she says no dont pester her caelius jerked his chin toward the fields were outnumbered remember sure sure sextus said in a way that meant he was paying as little attention as he could caldus caelius and the rest of the legionaries looked at one another caelius wondered if theyd have to knock sextus over the head and drag him back to mindenum if he stirred up trouble that might be the smartest thing the other romans could do theyd come for a good time not to fire the barbarians up against them sextus drew a denarius from his belt pouch holding it out in the palm of his hand he went up to the german girl she was within a thumbs breadth of being as tall as he was and almost as wide through the shoulders she did have good teeth and a swelling bosom sextus knew even less of the germans language than caldus caelius did he used such rags as he had as well as some gestures that left next to nothing to the imagination the girl said something to her older friend caelius couldnt follow it but they both got the giggles well sweetheart sextus asked in latin instead of slapping him or turning away and walking off in a huff she led him to one of the farmhouses when they came out a few minutes later he wore a sated smirk while she proudly showed the denarius to the other woman your lucky day caelius said sextus smirk got wider hey if shell do him maybe shell do me too another legionary said he too produced a coin this time the negotiations were swifter the young woman knew what he wanted from her she gave it to him too he was grinning like a fool when he came out of the wattleanddaub hut shes good he declared by priapus shes mighty good caelius went next himself as long as it was business as long as the barbarians werent getting upset why not if he had the chance hed grab it a denarius was more than he would have paid back at vetera but so what he couldnt think of anything else hed sooner spend his money on even beer lots of silver the girl said happily when she took his coin by the time the day ended she might become the richest person in the little village the inside of the farmhouse was gloomy caelius stood there while she dropped down in front of him he set a hand on the back of her head urging her on she didnt need much urging neither did he he spent himself in nothing flat she spat on the hard dirt floor he helped her up they went outside together she ended up satisfying all the romans they emptied the barrel of beer too as caelius none too steadily made his way back toward the encampment he couldnt remember a day hed enjoyed more arminius stared at the handful of silver the village girl showed him did you people butcher a roman to get this he asked her if you did i hope you hid his body so the legionaries never found out how he died if one of them gets killed they avenge themselves on many thev he broke off because she was laughing at him we didnt kill anybody she said then she told him exactly how shed earned the denarii they pay so much for so little look at all this silver i never thought i would have so much in my whole life and it didnt even take an hour he knew what prostitutes were hed used a couple himself to slake his lusts while he served among the roman auxiliaries up till now germany had known little of such notions probably because so few coins circulated here but if the country came under roman rule if money spread here till it was as widely used as anywhere else in the empire how many girls like this one would there be her father wasnt helpful she didnt do anything that made her no maiden the man said as long as she bleeds on her wedding night nothing else matters and she will my wife made sure of that he held up his middle finger to show how but arminius wanted to hit him she sold herself got a good price too the other german agreed these romans must have silver falling out of their assholes the way they throw it around plenty of chieftains with less than weve got now he eyed arminius do you have that much yes arminius said flatly if the other man challenged him it would give him the excuse he wanted to murder the fellow but the man just stood there outside of his steading a foolish grin on his face arminius tried again dont you see before the romans set up their cursed camp near here your daughter never would have done anything like this i should say not the girls father answered for a moment arminius thought hed reached him then the wretch continued before the romans came nobody couldve paid anywhere near so well we have to get rid of them arminius insisted theyll ruin us if we dont the older man stared at him in what arminius hoped was honest incomprehension why do you want to get rid of them when theyre making us rich i can spend some of this silver at their camp for things they have and we dont my little girl wants some fancy combs for her hair hard to tell her no when she was the one who made the money eh i can even buy wine if i want to like i said i might as well be a chieftain myself you might as well be a swine arminius said i dont know who you are but youve got no cause to talk to me that way the villager didnt reach for a spear or a sword he was brave enough running his mouth but not when he had to back up his words so it seemed to arminius anyhow he didnt think about what it might be like to confront a large fierce wellarmed stranger only a little more than half his age people half arminius age were children he didnt need to fear them he didnt need to fear the shameless girls father either he turned his back and strode away if his scorn made the other man respond he would do what he had to do what he wanted to do but regretfully he didnt think it would and he turned out to be right he wondered if he could make it out of the village without being sick he managed but it wasnt easy the romans purposely changed the way the folk they conquered did things hed heard about that in gaul and seen it with his own eyes in pannonia they were like potters working with soft clay shaping it into whatever they wanted they also changed people and peoples without meaning to if they hadnt set up their encampment so close to this village that man would have stayed an ordinary fellow oh chances were he never would have been a hero or any kind of leader but arminius wouldnt have wanted to wipe him off the sole of his shoe like a dog turd either the man never would have been proud of how much his daughter could make going down on her knees and he wouldnt have worried about fancy combs or wine the romans might not have known that they used such things as weapons but they did too many germans craved what they lacked and the romans had wine and luxury goods had bought too many chieftains arminius fists clenched as he thought of thusneldas father silver no matter how you got it could buy lesser men too and if the romans bought enough men and women if they persuaded them the way of life inside the empire was better than their own what then why the folk of germany would turn into romans they would be taxpayers slaves the way the romans themselves were slaves arminius shook his head by tuisto and mannus it will not happen he vowed tuisto was a god born of the earth mannus tuistos son was reckoned father of the german folk mannus three sons were said to be the ancestors of the three divisions of german stock some people gave mannus many more sons men whose names matched those of the various german tribes maybe they were right how could anyone now know for sure but arminius preferred the simpler arrangement he wanted things simple in his germany too he wanted his folk to stay free the way it had always been and he wanted to drive the romans back over the rhine he would have liked to drive them farther still but he didnt suppose the spineless gauls would help men like the gleeful pimp back in that village made him wonder if even his own folk would help ix when quinctilius varus rode forth from mindenum he rode forth with the idea that he was somebody and needed to be seen as somebody he much preferred civilian clothes to a generals muscled corselet and scarlet cloak but conscientiously donned them anyhow you look magnificent sir aristocles murmured tightening the fastenings that held the corselets breast and back pieces together did that little pause conceal the word ridiculous varus suspected it did but he couldnt prove it and the slave would only deny everything what else did slaves do better not to pick a fight you had no hope of winning instead varus said i aim to overawe the barbarians let them see roman might personified in me let them see yes and let them despair of resisting of course sir aristocles said it might have been agreement or it might have been you must be joking sir again varus couldnt prove a thing again he had sense enough not to try instead cloak swirling around him he strode out of the tent a cavalry officer standing outside gave him a clenchedfist salute the officer also gave him a legup he settled himself in the saddle he would have preferred a litter but he could ride tolerably well the germans for their part had made it very plain that they despised litters they didnt think a man had any business being carried by other men to varus mind that was only one more proof they were barbarians he hated having to cater to local prejudices but since he did want to impress he found himself with little choice vala numonius rode with him so did a troop of stolid cavalrymen the germans could still overwhelm them if they wanted to badly enough but he had enough romans with him to put up a stout fight and the germans had to know his murder would lead to vengeance on a scale they could barely imagine varus felt safe enough besides the village where he was going was supposed to be friendly the locals had begun holding assemblies to talk about what they should do very much as villagers in italy might have done so reports said anyhow one thing varus had learned in his administrative career if you trusted reports if you didnt go out and see for yourself sooner or later something would bite you in the backside probably sooner well make roman subjects out of them yet he said to vala numonius gods grant it be so the cavalry commander answered but we could build a new rome in place of our encampment here and i still wouldnt be sorry to see the last of this miserable country no olive oil no wine too cursed many germans i know what you mean varus said still augustus didnt send me here to fail we collected taxes from them last fall well take more this time around see if we dont and most of it in silver half the battle is getting them used to the idea of paying once they are once they dont grab for their spears every time the taxcollector comes around well be on the road to triumph he hastily chose a different word to victory i understand sir numonius assured him since augustus became the supreme leader in the roman world generals couldnt aspire to a proper triumph a procession through the streets of roman acclaiming them for what theyd done their victories were assumed to come in augustus name and at his behest if you said you wanted a triumph of your own it was almost the same as saying you wanted augustus position varus wouldnt have minded having it he didnt think hed get it after augustus died though of augustus surviving kin all the signs pointed to tiberius not only had he been disastrously married to augustus daughter he was also augustus wifes son and a firstrate soldier to boot overthrowing him would take a civil war and rome had seen too many but tiberius was within a year or two of varus age and childless if he died fairly soon in that case people might look to me varus thought a branch hanging down from an oak into the narrow path swatted him in the face and snuffed out his daydreams of imperial glory never mind building a new rome here numonius he said what we need to build in this benighted place are some decent roads youve thrown a triple six with that sir vala numonius exclaimed it wont be easy or cheap though so much of this country is swamp or bog or mud or something else disgusting we can do it varus said back a lifetime ago the germans never dreamt we could bridge the rhine and punish them for sticking their noses into gaul caesar showed them how ignorant they were and proper highways would be worth their weight in gold here except along rivers we have a demon of a time getting troops where they need to go dont i know it numonius rolled his eyes horsemen have an even worse time pushing down these narrow twisting tracks or slogging through the mud than foot soldiers do yes i can see how that would be so varus decisive nod was patterned after the one augustus habitually used roads then as soon as we decide its safe enough for the engineers to start working on them or maybe even a little before that a little before that would be very good vala numonius said if you wait till youre sure youre safe in germany youll wait forever ha varus laugh faded to a rueful chuckle thats one of those jokes that would be funny if only it were funny if you know what i mean one of the romans riding ahead of the governor and the cavalry commander said heres their village sir under his breath he added godsforsaken little pisspot of a place isnt it quinctilius varus didnt think he was meant to catch that last so he pretended he didnt as the path came out of the forest into the cleared land around the village and he got a good look at it he found he had a hard time disagreeing with the cavalryman the cattle and sheep were small and scrubby the horses mere ponies the swine seemed only half a step up from wild boars while the snarling dogs might have come straight from the wolfpacks that roamed the woods the houses were huts with walls of mud and sticks and with thatched roofs that hung out on all sides far enough to keep the rain from melting the mud and the people were germans varus had got to the point where he didnt mind watching the women they were tall strongly made and most of them fair nothing wrong with any of that the men though were as close to wild as the pigs and the dogs hed learned that calling another man a swinehound was a favorite german insult now he thought he understood why they used it it suited them ten or twelve big men all swathed in cloaks and carrying spears stood around in what passed for the village square arguing with one another they shouted they clenched fists and shook them under their neighbors noses no one ran anybody through but varus wondered if it was only a matter of time this is the assembly they wanted you to see sir vala numonius said if theyre proud enough of this to want to show it off gods only know what they do when were not watching too true varus said with a sigh still he could write to augustus and truthfully well almost truthfully tell him hed seen the germans begin to imitate roman institutions augustus would be glad to hear something of that sort and if it wasnt as true as it might have been just yet varus would make it so before too long he was confident of that then one of the barbarians startled him by waving and calling out in pretty fair latin hail your excellency good to see you how are you today would you like me to translate for you arminius varus was pleased he remembered the fellows name hed had it shouted in his ear all winter long of course to say nothing of the scandal the summer before but arminius was only a german after all a lot of romans wouldnt have bothered recalling his barbarous appellation no matter what so quinctilius varus was pleased the germans in the village debated what they ought to do about men from a village a few leagues away who ran off their cattle on moonless nights theyd already decided what they would do they planned to set an ambush and slaughter the thieves but they couldnt say that in front of the romans who aimed to reserve killing for themselves one more usurpation among so many arminius turned what they did say into latin for quinctilius varus he couldnt shade the translation much varus would have someone else along who spoke the german tongue arminius didnt want anyone giving him the lie in front of the important roman he just hoped the men in this supposedly romanstyle assembly wouldnt come out with something everyone would regret to his relief they didnt one of them even asked varus to send soldiers to the other village to order its men to stop thieving why not the order wouldnt make them stop but it would humiliate them they deserved that so these villagers thought anyhow arminius didnt care one way or the other they werent men of his clan or even of his tribe their very dialect sounded odd in his ears but they were germans they shouldnt have had to pretend to follow roman customs to make this bigbellied quinctilius varus happy and arminius himself shouldnt have had to smile and clasp this bigbellied romans hand and pretend to be his friend hed made varus like him the summer before if he hadnt segestes would have used the official to get his vengeance for losing thusnelda from what varus said arminius reminded him of his own son who was growing to manhood down inside the roman empire that was probably lucky for the german if varus had no children or only daughters or if his son were different better perhaps not to dwell on such chances to arminius way of thinking if the younger varus were any kind of a man he would be here in germany with his father what better thing could a son do than help his father accomplish something important for their folk maybe it wasnt good to remind the roman of a son like that but varus himself seemed to find nothing amiss in the youngsters absence the romans didnt have the family cohesion arminius folk took for granted husbands and wives in the empire divorced for any reason or none at all and no one there thought the worse of them because of it roman women were so fickle so faithless that their men had got used to it and even made jokes about it to a straitlaced german that was truly shocking at last the farce in the village played itself out beaming quinctilius varus told arminius please convey to these distinguished gentlemen how much i admire their thoughtful and mature deliberations the course they plan seems wise and just one day their grandsons may wear the toga and ornament the debates of the senate in rome as best he could arminius did put that into his own language again he dared not shade the translation lest some roman who knew his tongue give him away he hoped the men whod gathered in the square would remember they werent supposed to show varus what they really thought of him to arminius relief they did remember the roman had brought along enough cavalrymen to massacre the socalled assembly here and the rest of the village besides that no doubt helped the germans concentrate on what they needed to do arminius particularly admired them for not showing offense when varus said their descendants might one day become roman senators varus meant it as a compliment the germans received it as if it were one rather than the last thing they wanted that went very well even better than i would have hoped quinctilius varus said as most of the men returned to their steadings staying there in the square with all these romans arminius felt very much alone he did his best not to show it wasnt he in varus eyes a roman citizen wouldnt a roman citizen be at ease with his fellow citizens of course he would seem to be they grow used to the idea that their future will be part of the empires future arminius replied he didnt say the men of his folk liked that idea but neither varus nor any of the other romans noticed the omission like any men they heard what they wanted to hear regardless of whether it was really there this is not your home is it arminius you live north and west of mindenum dont you varus said yes thats right your excellency arminius said you honor me by remembering it one day perhaps you will honor me more by visiting me among my clansmen why perhaps i shall if varus sounded surprised that arminius should suggest such a thing he covered that surprise with layer upon layer of practiced roman politesse it would be a rare privilege in fact may the day come soon arminius said indeed quinctilius varus nodded and smiled and since you find yourself away from home now would you care to come back to mindenum and sup with me this evening i would like nothing more said arminius who would have liked anything more but he couldnt refuse the roman not unless he wanted varus to believe he mistrusted him arminius did mistrust varus but didnt want him believing that and so i stick my head into the bears mouth again the german thought splendid splendid varus jowly smile got wider he turned to some of the other romans whod come with him to watch the farce in the village there my friends do you see some of the small swarthy men nodded even the ones who did though eyed arminius like hounds eyeing a wolf so what exactly had the roman governor meant by that something like no matter what youve heard about this barbarian hes not such a bad fellow after all arminius didnt see how he could mean anything else and what would the romans have heard about him unfortunately he had no trouble figuring that out either word of what hed gone through germany saying during the winter would have got back to them well arminius already knew it had segestes and his henchmen had made sure of that if only my friends could have killed masua arminius thought angrily but varus still believed he was friendly to the empire and these other romans would have to be wondering wouldnt they a man who hated their folk wouldnt stick his head into the bears mouth on purpose would he the romans would have talked about sticking your head into a lions mouth arminius had seen a lion at a beast show in pannonia any god that could create a wildcat the size of a bear was a god to be wary of varus cavalry commander was a dour fellow named vala numonius he eyed arminius the way a snake eyed a toad im sure you will enjoy the wine at supper eh he said the only reason you said yes to varus was to guzzle our fine vintages that wasnt what he said but it was what he meant arminius looked back just as coldly the romans often scorned someone who let his temper run away with him i like beer about as well he said in a wintry voice adding im no waterdrinker you ask for a flux of the bowels if you do that when you dont have to hes got you there quinctilius varus said with a chuckle you cant very well tell him hes wrong either no sir numonius answered tonelessly that quiet reply didnt mean he agreed oh no it meant he despised arminius all the more but he didnt feel like showing it a german would have but the roman was a serpent all right he tried to make himself invisible in the grass but hed poison you if you stepped on him varus either took no notice of numonius unhappiness or affected not to see it well lets go back he said you have a horse arminius yes sir the german said he vaulted into the saddle without bothering to ask for a legup it was less of a feat than it might have been he was a big man getting up onto a small horse standing next to the romans he was taller than any of them riding with them he was the shortest man in the group they noticed as soon as he did their chuckles said they liked it arminius shrugged yes he craved a charger like the one vala numonius rode but he was still himself the romans still themselves had he been sitting on a short stool while they used high ones he still would have been taller than they were and so he was now whether they liked it or not they didnt have much to say to one another or to him as they all rode back to the roman encampment in the german heartland their glances his way told him they would have liked to talk about him but their silence proclaimed that they remembered he spoke good latin the roman sentries frankly stared at him when he rode in with varus and vala numonius and the rest of the romans arminius didnt think he could behave haughtily toward the roman officers in whose company he found himself sentries they were a different story he affected not to notice them as he went by miserable scut one of the common soldiers growled who does he think he is another said maybe they didnt know he could follow their language more likely they just didnt care unlike their superiors they werent hypocrites when they didnt like somebody they didnt try to hide it quinctilius varus greek slave looked surprised to see arminius in the company of his master the weedy little man aristocles was his name arminius remembered somehow contrived to look down on romans as well as germans varus and the legionaries here knew it too but for reasons beyond arminius ken they failed to get angry come to that hed seen the same thing with the few greeks hed met in pannonia he didnt understand it but he was sure it was real ill let the cooks know we have a distinguished guest aristocles said by all means thank you quinctilius varus didnt notice the slaves discreet pause or if he did he pretended not to yes romans were master dissemblers he noticed aristocles hesitation he knew what it meant too aristocles thought he would have got angry if he heard something like we have a hairy barbarian eating with us tonight well the greekling wasnt wrong oh aristocles varus called when his slave had already taken a couple of steps away the man perforce stopped yes sir bring us some wine when you come back its been a long day we can all use some refreshment of course sir this time aristocles succeeded in disappearing of course sir what else could a slave say the germans kept slaves too what folk didnt theirs though were less like to be body servants more likely to be farmers who owed their masters a share of what they raised a german master was less likely to beat or whip a slave than a roman was but a german was more likely to lose his temper and kill a man he owned and why not it wasnt as if he had to pay any penalty for doing it if the romans got their way theyd turn all the germans from the rhine to the elbe into slaves maybe even farther if they thought their legions could bring it off theyd already enslaved more lands more peoples than most germans had ever imagined arminius remained determined he wouldnt let them do that to his folk aristocles returned with a large tray cups a jar of wine and a jar of water he set the tray down on a light folding table a clever and useful piece of furniture he mixed wine and water for the legionary officers but paused before serving arminius how would you like your wine sir he inquired the same way the other roman citizens are having theirs arminius replied face carefully blank the greek handed him a cup of watered wine laughing varus said he got you there aristocles the slave affected not to hear arminius would have boxed the mans ears for such insolence but varus put up with it some romans as arminius had seen in pannonia let slaves get away with more than free subordinates no german would do that i thought you would sooner drink your wine neat vala numonius said to arminius i would if you gentlemen were doing the same the german answered but if i get drunk while your heads stay clear youll laugh at me i dont fancy that the roman cavalry commander looked surprised for a moment then he raised his cup in salute ive heard you were clever it seems to be so for which i thank you arminius also raised his cup your health they grudgingly drank to each other when the cook came out to announce that supper was ready arminius was glad to see the man had a double chin and a potbelly who would have wanted a meal from a man who didnt like his own cooking he had a skinnier slave of his own or maybe the man who carried out the heavy tray of food was a more junior cook the greens course was covered with a mixture of wine vinegar olive oil and ground spices no german would have seasoned them that way but arminius had met such dressings in pannonia this one didnt drive him wild but he could deal with it boiled turnips in a cheese sauce seemed less exotic a german cook might have made the same dish though the roman cheese was sharper than arminius was used to the main course was roasted slices of boar the meat was fine the sauce on the other hand i know you romans like garlic arminius said but whats that other spice you put on it the one that bites the tongue thats pepper varus told him it comes into the empire all the way from india why arminius asked we like it varus answered the other roman officers nodded so promptly arminius didnt think they were agreeing only because their superior had spoken varus went on dont you care for the flavor it adds maybe im just not used to it arminius said i suppose it would be good to mask the taste of meat thats going off but what you have here is nice and fresh it doesnt need to be hidden by all that garlic and uh pepper we think bland food is boring vala numonius said the officers nodded once more what you eat is your business arminius said but if you try to feed it to me i may not like it so well romans and germans are not the same a considerable silence followed arminius decided he might have said too much even if his wine was watered varus said do i need to remind you that you are a roman citizen no sir i am proud to be a roman citizen it is a great honor arminius knew the romans reckoned it one and he was proud it showed hed successfully deceived his foes he went on my head and my heart are glad to be roman my tongue and my belly remember i was born german i dont know what to do about that varus and several officers smiled not all of them did though a man arminius didnt know asked was it your german tongue that made you say your people ought to chase all the romans out of germany the pork suddenly sat heavy in arminius stomach he was in his enemies power here if they wanted to stretch out a hand and crush him they could the trick then was making sure they didnt want to or at least making sure the most powerful one didnt i never said anything like that arminius answered steadily i never would say anything like that whoever told you i did whoever told you i would is a liar there are germans who do not love me segestes insulted me and you know how i answered his insult so now segestes spreads lies wherever he can and uses his friends to spread them too i cant do anything about that except to remind you they are lies he waited they didnt have to believe him some of them plainly didnt but varus said yes weve been over this ground before dont worry arminius whatever segestes and his friends say we know we need to take it cum grano salis with a grain of salt arminius echoed i know what the words mean but not the phrase it means we have to doubt whatever they say varus explained and that is so we do he looked down from the head of the table waiting for anyone to challenge him no one did at a german feast someone would have and when someone challenged him it would have gone from words to spears in the blink of an eye the romans accepted varus guidance because he held the highest rank among them was that better or worse than the german way it was simpler anyhow if the man of highest rank knew what he was doing everyone would do well by obeying his commands if he didnt arminius slept at mindenum that night he left the encampment the next morning the romans could have rid themselves of a great danger they didnt arminius waited till he was more than a bowshot away from the encampments earthwork and ditch then making sure he kept his back to mindenum so the sentries wouldnt notice him doing it he laughed and laughed and laughed some more roman soldiers liked to complain vala numonius knew as much but what lucius eggius was doing went far beyond complaint you really should watch your tongue the cavalry commander said if you dont someone will say youre trying to incite a mutiny by the gods maybe we need one eggius burst out vala numonius looked at him i am going to do you the biggest favor anyone ever did i am going to pretend i didnt hear that you can thank me when you come to your senses to numonius vast relief the other officer realized hed gone too far ill thank you now and thank you kindly he said but how we could have let that cursed german walk out of here it makes no sense you cant tell me it does nobody can not if he wants me to believe it you think arminius is more dangerous than quinctilius varus does numonius said hes a barbarian why take chances with him if hes done a tenth part of what his womans father says he has hes a menace eggius said getting hold of germany is hard enough if we do get rid of the troublemakers why let em run around loose arminius isnt just a barbarian vala numonius pointed out what should have been obvious hes a roman citizen hes a member of the equestrian order one step below the senate he can appeal any sentence to augustus eggius snorted scornfully lets see him appeal being dead wed all sleep better of nights after he was would we numonius was anything but convinced or would that start the big german uprising when arminius alive didnt he startled lucius eggius he could see as much thatd be a pretty kettle of fish wouldnt it eggius said it would numonius pressed his advantage and what do you think augustus would do to the people who sparked a rebellion here especially when tiberius still hasnt cleaned up the mess in pannonia eggius winced like a man contemplating a bad hangover that wouldnt be pretty would it i dont think so the cavalry commander thought that made a pretty respectable understatement so why dont you be a little more careful before you start talking about killing germans you dont happen to like and it wont happen anyway because his excellency likes arminius vala numonius didnt but he unlike lucius eggius understood subordination i know he does if the knowledge gave eggius any pleasure he hid it very well you think i worry about the barbarian too much ill tell you something numonius he doesnt worry about him enough and you can mark my words he thinks arminius is a tame dog he cant see a wild wolf when ones standing right in front of him vala numonius didnt try to argue what was the point instead he answered indirectly all these germans are wolves now a lifetime ago all the gauls were wolves too theyve settled down fifty years from now the governor is sure these germans will have too and well be wondering what we ought to do about the barbarians on the far side of the elbe thats what the roman empire does we move forward hrmp lucius eggius grunt was not one of agreement the reason the gauls settled down is caesar walloped the piss out of them they knew they were licked they knew we were better men we cursed well showed them we were the germans dont believe it and why should they weve won some against them but theyve won some against us too we havent convinced em we can squash em whenever we put our minds to it its this miserable country numonius said bogs and swamps and woods and gods only know what all else no place where an army can form a proper battle line and show the savages how real soldiers do it youre right eggius said this time he surprised vala numonius yeah youre right he repeated but so what what do you mean so what the cavalry commander demanded its the truth if it werent for the country we would have beaten the germans a long time ago and if it werent for the ocean you could walk from sicily to carthage too eggius said vala numonius gasped at the unfairness of the comeback but eggius couldnt see it he pressed ahead dont you get it why we havent beaten the stinking barbarians doesnt matter that we havent beaten them does it matters a lot they still think they can mess with us and they may even be right a plague take them its not that theyre such wonderful warriors numonius said they skulk and they hide and they sneak out and bite us like spiders or scorpions the lay of the land lets them do it the lay of the lands got blond hair down to here and tits out to there lucius eggius gestured lewdly vala numonius winced eggius got more serious a little anyhow but youre not wrong this country is a big pile of turds he said the fun and games we go through getting back to the rhine every winter prove that i wish we had a route where we werent up to our knees in muck most of the time ill bet the germans know a route like that numonius said sure but will they tell us dont hold your breath friend eggius said which had the unfortunate ring of truth we need proper roads here we need em worse than anything else numonius nodded the governor knows that i expect well have them before very long but we need em now lucius eggius hawked and spat by venus cunt weve needed em for years well you may be right that was the most polite brushoff numonius knew some people kept pounding with hammers even when there wasnt a nail in sight and lucius eggius all too plainly was one of them x from perhaps half a mile away sigimerus eyed the roman encampment of mindenum you want us to go in there he asked his voice rising in disbelief but arminius nodded i do father ive been in and out several times varus thinks i cant possibly be dangerous and why because i dont hide from him thats why he doesnt believe someone who is an enemy of rome would dare let the legionaries get their hands on him whenever they please i can see why he doesnt sigimerus muttered a train of oxdrawn wagons guarded by roman soldiers brought supplies from the lupia river to the fortress by now after a couple of years the wagons had worn deep ruts in the german soil the romans thought they were wearing their way into germany in the same fashion arminius stubbornly refused to believe it that the invaders felt they needed so many men to protect their goods showed how far from victory they were it did to him anyhow come on he will treat you with honor arminius said why shouldnt he arent you the father of a roman citizen the father of a veteran of the roman auxiliaries sigimerus was the father of two veterans of the roman auxiliaries but arminius refused to think about flavus who was still fighting in pannonia gods grant i am not the father of a fool sigimerus said despite the gibe he followed arminius toward the fort he studied it with keen interest as they got closer arminius understood that the romans were masters of fieldcraft no german army had ever dreamt of protecting itself in hostile country the way the romans did the germans thought the romans worked too hard till they had to attack one of those encampments then the legionaries labor proved its worth again and again and again a roman soldier outside the rampart spied the approaching germans and trotted over to see who they were and what they might be up to oh its you he said recognizing arminius he sounded polite but businesslike not a tone a german would have been likely to take whos this ah gentleman with you whos this barbarian with you that was what hed been on the point of asking arminius was sure of it but the roman had swallowed the insult so arminius had to pretend he didnt know it was there this is my father his name is sigimerus he has come to meet the great quinctilius varus whose praises he has often heard from me no german would have swallowed flattery laid on even half so thick but the legionary did the romans were in the habit of extravagantly flattering one another they might have been so many dogs licking one anothers privates and assholes but they were dangerous dogs this one wasnt dangerous now the flattery put him at ease well he can do that you can do that come along with me and ill bring you to the gate by the way he spoke he intended to be obeyed arminius had to use an effort of will to keep his hand from dropping to the hilt of his sword how dared this trooper order him around but arminius had seen that romans always thought they could order anyone who wasnt a roman around just because they were romans yet another reason to make sure they lost their hold on germany arminius glanced over to his father sigimerus was less used to roman arrogance than he was himself the older man looked ready to murder the legionary who was leading them to the encampment ever so slightly arminius shook his head his fathers raised eyebrows asked how can you put up with people like this even for a moment and arminius tiny shrug answered well what choice have i got he couldnt see any not yet the men at the gate greeted him politely enough hail one of them called come to call on the governor again thats right arminius answered is that your father with you the roman asked the two of you have a family look yes it is arminius replied in latin in his own language he added do you understand them father well enough sigimerus said also in the germans tongue he switched to latin slower and less fluent than arminius to give the sentries his name hail sigimerus said the one whod greeted arminius welcome to mindenum i thank you sigimerus said arminius didnt think hed ever heard anything less sincere in his life his father kept looking around the encampment once they got inside these romans are an orderly folk arent they he said in his own speech they enjoy living like animals in cages eh all in row after row boring i think so too but it works for them arminius added be careful with your words father some of the romans have learned bits of our tongue i thought you told me they stuck to latin whenever they could sigimerus said they do especially the officers they think learning our speech or any other speech except greek is beneath their dignity arminius answered but the common soldiers arent so fussy if theyre in the field and they get hungry or they want to sport with our women they learn the words they need to have so you never can tell when one will know more than he lets on sneaky devils how do you trust people like that sigimerus answered his own question simple you dont he eyed the tent in front of which arminius had stopped so this is where the roman governor lives yes father arminius smiled sigimerus could watch his tongue if he worked at it the older man delivered his judgment well if you want to live under canvas all the time you could do worse than this but i would not care to live under canvas all the time who in his right mind would sigimerus didnt say that out loud but his eyebrows were eloquent if they have to the romans can move out of this encampment tomorrow arminius said when i was in pannonia i saw them do things like that at a moments notice and they build a fortified camp every evening of a march you will have seen that yes sigimerus nodded too much work i think maybe but it makes them hard to assail arminius held the tent flap open so sigimerus could go in ahead of him hed seen how curtains did duty for walls in these fancy tents where they stood was the equivalent of an entrance hall a swarthy slave nodded to arminius you wait the fellow said in bad latin he hurried away he will bring varus to us sigimerus asked maybe more likely though he will bring varus chief slave to us arminius answered you have to go through slave after slave before you finally get to talk to an important roman again his father didnt say what he was thinking again sigimerus expression spoke louder than words sure enough it wasnt quinctilius varus but aristocles his pedisequus who emerged to greet the germans hail arminius aristocles said is this distinguished gentleman your father by any chance with him as with the fellow whod met them outside the encampment that pause showed he was really thinking something like graying savage but arminius responded only to the words aristocles actually used yes he is father i present to you aristocles who is the roman governors chief slave aristocles here is my father sigimerus by name aristocles bow lacked for nothing in manners i am honored to meet you sir with his citizenship and the courage he showed fighting romes enemies your son is an ornament among these forests good to meet you thank you for nice words sigimerus answered in his deliberate latin i come here with arminius to meet roman governor anyone who knew sigimerus would have understood that to mean why am i wasting my time talking to a worthless slave instead arminius did and had to hide a grin if aristocles also did he concealed it well romans were good at that their slaves of necessity even better the pedisequus said of course the governor will be delighted to make your acquaintance excellent sigimerus let me inform him of your most auspicious arrival and of course you will wish refreshments to put down the dust of your journey here before sigimerus could say yes or no aristocles vanished behind a curtain when the curtain stirred again out from behind it came yet another slave this one carrying a silver tray with wine and bread and fruit candied in honey like all of varus slaves arminius had seen this fellow was not a german arminius knew the romans did enslave his folk varus was shrewd enough not to rub german visitors noses in that unpleasant fact though when i was young sigimerus said wine was a sometime thing a onceinawhile thing many more roman traders nowadays and much more wine in germany than there used to be wine is a goodness arminius agreed anyone listening to them on the far side of a curtain would find no fault in what they said but their eyes met in perfect mutual understanding wine may be a goodness rome is anything but quinctilius varus voice came from farther back in the tent so did those of a couple of other romans arminius supposed the governor was conferring with his officers if arminius knew romans varus would take care of that before he deigned to meet any barbarians all the highranking officials in pannonia had acted the same way sigimerus didnt recognize varus voice he probably couldnt follow what the romans were saying either arminius could get bits and pieces of it though slaves chatter in the foreground made him keep missing some from what arminius could hear varus was finding out what several different columns hed sent forth were doing he had to be confident germany lay open to him like an unchaste woman if he divided his forces like that down in pannonia tiberius had been much more cautious but pannonia was a real war no one could doubt that even for a moment germany seemed peaceful varus must have thought he could take chances here that he wouldnt have risked if the countryside were in arms against him well let him believe us peaceful let him think germans are nothing but the romans curs let him send legionaries here there and everywhere the less we worry him now the better when is the fancy roman coming sigimerus asked doesnt he reckon were important enough to see i dont think it will be too much longer father arminius answered he is talking with his retainers now hrmm it was not a happy noise sigimerus partly muffled it by taking another swig of wine the jug soon emptied the slave fetched another did varus want the germans drunk before he met with them arminius wouldnt have been surprised wine was stronger than beer taken neat it got people drunk faster especially when they werent used to it you may want to go easy father arminius whispered yes yes sigimerus said impatiently in a way that couldnt have meant anything but no no he wasnt drunk when varus finally came forth he wasnt too drunk anyhow arminius made the introductions so sigimerus you are the father of this young man varus said he spoke slowly and clearly and kept his grammar simple he must have realized sigimerus was not fluent in latin i am sigimerus answered varus reached out to touch the golden fibula that fastened sigimerus cloak that would have been uncouthly familiar except for what he said next even more than this he is an ornament to you sigimerus smiled he is he agreed running through another part of the conjugation of the verb to be i miss my own son he is far away studying learning in greece varus said he set a hand on arminius shoulder when i met your son it was almost as if i had mine with me once more not quite you will understand that but almost he wore a toga chalky white wool with a purple border sigimerus cloak was of bearskin trimmed with fine sealskin pained in trade from the chauci a tribe that lived by the north sea varus hair was cut short sigimerus let his grow long varus shaved his face sigimerus wore a beard the roman was short and heavyset the german tall and lean varus had none of the germans language sigimerus only a little latin and yet they were both proud fathers for a moment arminius found them more alike than different but only for a moment sigimerus cared nothing for varus son varus whether he fully realized it or not wanted to enslave sigimerus what difference could be greater than that please excuse me for keeping you waiting varus said i was discussing ah certain matters with my aides we aim to bring peace to germany you understand i understand yes sigimerus said arminius feared he would add if you want to bring peace then leave but to his relief sigimerus left it there hearing him say he understood made varus believe he approved good good the roman said i am glad that like your son you see the advantages of working with rome how would sigimerus answer that without spilling the chamber pot into the stew arminius father looked at quinctilius varus with wide blue innocent eyes pardon me he said i was talking about the advantages of cooperating with rome varus said sigimerus still looked artfully blank varus turned to arminius perhaps you would be kind enough to translate for your father of course sir arminius replied and he did though he was sure sigimerus already understood the romans words he rendered them into the germans tongue he did a proper job of it too in case another roman one who knew the language stood listening behind a curtain sigimerus enlightenment was a small masterpiece of its kind the romans put on stage plays to entertain themselves arminius had seen a couple in pannonia once he got the idea of playacting he enjoyed them sigimerus had never seen or even imagined one but he could have gone up on a stage himself oh he said work with now i follow you sir varus smiled he didnt notice that sigimerus didnt say he agreed with him or approved of him arminius didnt notice either not right away when he did he realized there was more to his father than first met the eye not always the most comfortable realization a young man can have will you both dine with me varus immediately answered his own question before the germans could of course you will you are my guests i am pleased that you are my guests your being here shows the world that germans and romans can get along we are pleased to show that sir where his father had evaded arminius lied without hesitation or compunction under other circumstances sigimerus would have had every right to beat him for being so shameless well so am i varus answered and your being my guests will go a long way toward laying to rest some of the ah unfortunate rumors that have attached themselves to your name arminius that would be very good arminius said to himself alone adding especially since those rumors are true his being here might lay them to rest among the romans who suspected him but it also might make his fellow germans wonder whether he was turning traitor that could cause him problems after the romans went back over the rhine to winter in gaul but even if it did he could repair such things later for now he was inside the roman encampment as long as he stayed here he would do well to act as much like a roman as he could sigimerus coughed a couple of times what that would have amounted to had he put it into words arminius could imagine luckily quinctilius varus couldnt aristocles the roman called yes sir the pedisequus might have appeared out of thin air one heartbeat he was nowhere to be seen the next he stood at varus elbow tell the cooks arminius and his distinguished father will be dining with me tonight varus said certainly sir aristocles vanished almost as smoothly as hed manifested himself he might have made a good conjurer amusing people by pretending to pull coins or jewelry out of their ears and noses or arminius thought uneasily he might be a real wizard one who could snap his fingers and appear or disappear arminius thought that unlikely wizards were more often talked about than seen but you never could tell or could you why would a true wizard let an ordinary man enslave him that struck the german as something only a fool would do aristocles was no fool which had to mean he was no wizard either only a man uncommonly light on his feet the cooks served mutton without garlic that had to be a compliment to arminius and sigimerus because the romans doted on the stuff varus noticed too he remarked its ah interesting flavored with mint isnt it different from what im used to good sigimerus said the amount of meat hed put away said he approved of what the cooks had done we might seethe the mutton instead of roasting it arminius said but i think my father is right it is very good we thank you for it he sucked marrow out of a bone my pleasure believe me the roman said and i assure you that it is also my pleasure to see germans who trust me and my people enough to be our guests and accept our hospitality who would not want to accept it when it is so generous arminius said he wasnt sure his father had followed all of what varus said if sigimerus had he was better at keeping his face straight than arminius had guessed if he was good in mindenum he needed to be will you two spend the night with us varus asked we can run up a tent for you you arminius will be familiar with our arrangements from your time of service with the auxiliaries you can acquaint your distinguished father with them as well arminius went back and forth with his father in the germans tongue to let him know what varus had offered after a moments thought sigimerus nodded it would be our privilege sir arminius told varus in latin splendid varus exclaimed arminius reflected that he was turning into a better liar than hed ever wanted to be lucius eggius looked back at the long column of legionaries he led they slogged through the german forests and marshes slapping at the mosquitoes and biting flies that plagued them and swearing at the officers whod sent them forth since eggius felt like swearing at those officers too he didnt even try to restrain the men let them cuss he thought itll make them feel better and it wont hurt the buggers theyre cussing out too stinking bad come on boys he called looks like better ground up ahead if it was any worse ground itd swallow us up and wed never be seen again one of the soldiers said oh cheer up gnaeus eggius said at least the barbarians arent giving us any grief the legionary was not cheered yes and thats all wrong too he answered why arent they its suspicious like quinctilius varus says its because theyre finally coming to see we really are their masters eggius loyal to the idea of rome if not necessarily to the blueblooded chuckleheads who represented that idea in germany gave forth with the party line gnaeus wasnt the only soldier who jeered at him and at varus unlike the governor the men had been going through these woods for years they knew the germans werent subdued so did lucius eggius but hed given up on trying to get his superiors to see it sometimes you could yell till you went blue in the face and it didnt do you any good he hadnt been lying to the legionaries unlike some of his superiors he didnt think that was a good idea the ground ahead did improve it was higher less muddy less swampy it didnt try to suck the caligae off the soldiers feet at every step they took eggius glanced toward the sun at least he could see it with the beastly german weather there was no guarantee of that it neared the western horizon as soon as we find a spring or a stream well camp for the night eggius said he didnt think that would take long and he proved right hed never seen any place for water like germany it bubbled out of the ground here there seemingly everywhere when the legionaries found a spring they began digging in around it fortified camps took a lot of work but nobody grumbled they bumped up your chances of lasting long enough to get gray hair and wrinkles and the men knew it ditch earthen rampart made from the spoil thrown out of the ditch sharpened stakes atop the earthwork gates facing the cardinal directions main streets running north and south east and west between the gates tents always placed just so inside the square perimeter every soldier had a particular job to do and everybody through long familiarity did it without much waste motion torches flared along the rampart ensuring that the germans couldnt sneak up on the camp sentries paced the circuit exchanging passwords and countersigns eggius chose latin words with rs in them for those the romans trilled their rs while the germans gargled theirs not even a barbarian whod served as an auxiliary and knew roman military customs would be able to fool a sentry eggius hoped not anyhow thinking of germans whod served as roman auxiliaries naturally made lucius eggius think of arminius when his column left mindenum the young german and his father had been installed there happy as a couple of sheep in clover quinctilius varus thought arminius a house snake not a viper lucius eggius sighed he hoped the governor was right he had trouble believing it but he had even more trouble believing he could change varus mind men like that didnt listen to men like him to varus he was nothing but a craftsman whod chosen a necessary but nasty way to make a living no augustus grandnieces husband wouldnt pay attention to a veteran legionary and since he wouldnt what point to brooding about it no point at all eggius shoved it out of his mind he had plenty of more immediately urgent things to worry about when the romans got moving again the next morning scouts came trotting back from the woods ahead that they came back was a good sign in and of itself no germans in there one of them called good eggius answered he turned to the men he led well go on through double time the sooner were out the other side the better before plunging down the path he made sure his sword was loose in its scabbard the scouts had done their job but you could never be sure theyd done enough germans were like any other beasts of prey they were masters at leaping out from hiding the trees blotted out the sun eggius eyes needed a few heartbeats to adapt to the gloom his nostrils twitched taking in the spicy scents of pine and fir and the greener more ordinary odors of oak and ash and elm were he a beast himself he might have sniffed out any lurking barbarians or he might not have maybe the strong odors coming off his own men would have masked them along with the dim light came dankness the narrow path he followed turned muddy almost at once his hobnailed marching sandals squelched at every step he was at the head of the column too the going would be worse for the men farther back after their friends had chewed up the track bushes and ferns pushed into the path from either side it was as if the forest resented having any way through it and was doing its best to reclaim that way for itself something large and heavy crashed through the undergrowth off to the left before eggius consciously realized it his gladius was halfway out of the bronze scabbard no volley of spears no screaming german warriors with a shaky chuckle another roman said only an animal right lucius eggius kept his own voice under tight control as he let the shortsword slide down again only an animal a bear an aurochs an elk hed never know now that silence had returned he could tell himself it didnt matter he could tell himself yes but he couldnt believe it the woods didnt just seem to squeeze in on either side eggius felt or imagined he felt the canopy of leaves and branches pressing down on him maybe everything would close in like a great green hand making a fist and when the fist opened again he wouldnt be here anymore maybe the whole roman column wouldnt be he laughed at himself he told himself that was nothing but nonsense moonshine this time he did manage to convince himself he was right some romans had far more trouble going through these forests than he did they really believed the trees were closing in on them they didnt just have brief vapors about it cold sweat dripped off them they went pale their hearts pounded and raced only coming out into the open again could cure them eggius wondered how a german would feel out in the syrian or african desert would he think the landscape was too wide would he feel tiny and naked under the vast blue dome of the sky would he shudder and shake wishing he could draw forest around him like a cloak the roman wouldnt have been surprised double time it wasnt just to give the natives less of a chance to set a trap among the trees it was also to get out of this horrible place as fast as the romans could roads roman roads crisscrossing germany roman roads arrogantly cutting through forests and swamps wonderful roman roads with the trees cut back far enough on either side to make bushwhacking impossible they couldnt come soon enough not as far as lucius eggius was concerned bring on the engineers he muttered so what if he was an officer he would gladly have carried a hod anything to make sure the men who came after him didnt have to endure this what did you say sir a legionary asked nothing getting overheard embarrassed him i sure am sick of these trees the soldier said what i wish more than anything is that we had some decent roads through the woods well now that you mention it so do i eggius shook his head he might have known his men would be able to see the same thing he did they werent fools well except for the tact that theyd got stuck in germany they werent after what seemed like forever eggius saw sunlight ahead even though hed been doubletiming it through the forest he broke into a run before long he stood at the edge of a meadow and some fields he breathed hard as if he were coming up from underwater some scrawny german cattle grazed in the meadow some scrawny german herdsmen kept an eye on them as soon as lucius eggius came out of the woods the barbarians let out several raucous halloos to warn the village a couple of furlongs away then they trotted purposefully toward him hefting their spears as they came more romans moving almost as fast as he was emerged from the forest behind him what do those buggers think theyre up to one of them asked he pointed toward the approaching germans i could be wrong but i dont expect theyre bringing us wine and dancing girls eggius voice was dry by then the germans were no longer approaching seeing themselves outnumbered they lost their appetite for murdering strangers they stopped short one of them jabbed the butt of his spear into the ground to help himself stop even shorter quite suddenly they all went pelting back the way theyd come they did some more hallooing as they ran now they sounded alarmed not wolflike more germans came from the fields and out of the village a surprising number of them bastards must breed like flies eggius thought had he come with an ordinary taxcollecting party the savages might have overwhelmed them but he had a real fighting column behind him a column designed to show the natives that roman might could penetrate even the deepest darkest corners of germany deploy into line of battle he called to the legionaries as they came out of the woods let them see what theyre up against maybe thatll make em think twice before they try anything stupid and if it doesnt well clean this miserable place out eggius didnt see who said that whoever he was he sounded as if he looked forward to it over by the village the germans had started to form a battle line of their own looking at the swarm of romans deploying as they debouched from the woods the locals started arguing among themselves shaking fists and brandishing spears not all of them wanted to commit suicide anyhow other germans started running for the trees on the far side of the village both sexes here wrapped themselves in cloaks most of the time so eggius had trouble being sure but he guessed those were the women trying to get away yes some of the fleeing shapes were smaller so they had their brats with them eggius told off a couple of dozen legionaries two of whom could speak the germans language after a fashion come forward with me he ordered well parley he raised his voice to address the rest of the romans if the barbarians jump us kill em all hunt down the cunts too by the noises they made he thought they would enjoy obeying those orders he advanced his little bodyguard spread out behind him and on both flanks he kept both hands away from his weapons and displayed them palm out to show they were empty a german stabbed the butt of his spear into the ground and came forward the middleaged man also showed off his empty hands he stopped just out of javelin range and asked what are you doing here in halting but clear latin wont need the interpreters eggius thought good we are passing through our province he answered will you give us food and beer asking for wine around here was hopeless your province the german said bleakly and then more bleakly still what befalls us if we feed you not well you can always find out eggius said with his sweetest smile the german muttered something his mustache muffled one of the romans who followed the local language stirred eggius pretended not to see him he didnt care whether the locals loved him only whether they obeyed we will give you the german said and then some more things eggius affected not to notice the roman smiled again why not hed won xi arminius was used to sleeping in a tent surrounded by other tents full of soldiers loyal to rome his father wasnt sigimerus wasnt used to eating roman rations either they seemed to agree with him his breeches were tighter than they had been when he came to mindenum he seemed unhappy even so he did have the sense not to talk about it inside the encampment by the nature of things mindenum had no privacy but arminius could see something was wrong he and sigimerus went for a walk outside the fortified perimeter tell me what it is father before you burst like a sealed stewpot forgotten in the hot coals arminius said sigimerus turned a look of pure hatred on mindenum fortunately they were too far away for any sentries to make out his expression we are that godscursed romans hounds he said his hounds i tell you we eat from his hand we sleep in his kennel we lick his face and roll over to show him our bellies faugh he spat in the grass he thinks were his hounds arminius answered thats what he needs to think if he thinks were anything else hell close his hand on us instead of patting us with it i want honest war sigimerus said better a hundred times better than this game of pretending and lying better if we win worse if we lose arminius said right now i think we would lose not enough of us are ready to fight the romans too many would stand aside and wait to see what happened and too many traitors to our folk follow segestes path flavus path too but arminius didnt name his own brother theyre the true hounds the ones who want to see varus as governor here and augustus as king kings among the german tribes reigned by virtue of their blood their real power though depended on their prowess and their wisdom if they couldnt get people to follow them they heard boos and catcalls in the tribal assembly if they did win approval the tribes menfolk clashed their spears together the sweetest sound a german leader could hear to arminius augustus was a german king writ large he had to be fierce and clever for men did his bidding even when far out of his sight that showed he enjoyed both fear and respect arminius wished he knew augustus tricks he would have liked to use them himself if all the germans followed him the way the romans followed augustus well who could say what wonders he might work right now he had trouble getting even his father to follow him sigimerus said i think we should just kill varus then get away if we can and if not we will have given our folk a mark to aim at among the germans if a man died all his designs died with him arminius had needed a while to realize the romans were different that was one more part of what made them such a menace if we kill varus vala numonius steps into his place till augustus sends some new governor up from italy arminius said and everything they do they will do as if varus still lived except they will also strike at our folk to avenge his death that will do sigimerus said if they come out of their encampment we have the chance to beat them but can we in the fights that have gone on as long as ive been alive they win at least as often as we do arminius replied and when they lose what do they do they fall back and get ready to fight some more we dont need to beat them father we need to crush them he bent down picked up a clod of dirt and closed his fist on it only dust fell when he opened his hand again yes that is what we need his father agreed how do we get it you said it yourself the romans dont leave themselves open to such disasters we have to trick them that must be how to beat them its the only way i can see arminius said if they dont know something dreadful is about to befall them until it does theyre ours if sigimerus said heavily arent we tricking varus now you complain we are his hounds but we both know that isnt so arminius said but does varus know if he knew he would have killed us two weeks ago since he thinks he has hounds he feeds us and houses us tricking one man is easy tricking an armys worth of men must be harder or we would have done it long since his father said arminius grunted his father had a point even so if the man we trick commands an army and varus does if this augustus is such a mighty king he should have found a better war leader than that fellow sigimerus said arminius nodded for the same thought had occurred to him thank the gods the roman called tiberius commands the army in pannonia he said that is a man to beware of if he were here we could not play these games with him let him stay far away then sigimerus hesitated or maybe not some of the things varus does would rouse our folk against him even if the two of us were never born not just taxes but taxes in coin this year he says how many of us can pay in silver not many i know that even if varus doesnt arminius answered i should hope so and what is this talk about taking our spears away his father spat again how can a man be a man without a weapon many romans who are not soldiers in the legions dont carry anything more than an eating knife arminius said sigimerus snorted his disbelief arminius set a hand over his heart its true father i swear it well what do they do when they quarrel sigimerus demanded with no spears or swords what can they do they have lawyers instead arminius said his father snorted again this time in fine contempt arminius went on i scoffed when i first heard it too but a roman told me a spear can only kill you once where a lawyer can make you wish you were dead for months at a time then you kill the lawyer sigimerus was relentlessly practical or thought he was anyhow arminius shook his head if you do that augustus and his servants go to law against you the romans have fewer blood feuds than we do but the kings justice reaches further with them faugh sigimerus repeated contemptuously theyre a pretty poor sort of man if they have to have the king do what they should do themselves it could be so arminius respected his father too much to quarrel openly with him yes it could indeed but i still wish they were a poorer sort of man yet for then they wouldnt trouble us at all quinctilius varus read the report lucius eggius had submitted after his foray through the german backwoods he paused to rub at his eyes eggius would never make a stylist his spelling and grammar left something to be desired and his script was cramped and tight the letters were too small to be easy to read when varus held the papyrus far enough from his eyes to make them clear all things considered then the governor was glad enough to set the papyrus down when aristocles came up to him and said may i speak to you sir what is it varus would rather have talked with his pedisequus than with most of the soldiers in the encampment at mindenum aristocles was far more clever than they were and being a slave he always gave varus his full measure of respect though the roman governor didnt put it that way to himself how long do you think those germans will stay here sir aristocles asked he must have swallowed something like barbarians or perhaps godsdetested stinking barbarians varus knew aristocles didnt like arminius and his father finding out how much he didnt like them might be interesting and entertaining the greeks sallow cheeks went quite pink when varus asked him about it no sir i dont fancy them they look at me the way stray dogs look at tripes in a butchers stall they did too varus had noticed it he thought of it as wolves eyeing a crippled fawn but the pedisequus comparison was just as apt they cant help it aristocles the roman governor said they dont understand that a peaceable man should be left to live in peace i should say they dont aristocles exclaimed thats why i wish theyd leave well i find myself with two things to say about that varus replied the first is that however they look at you theyve offered you no harm and the second is that weve come to germany not least to make it into a place where a peaceable man can be left to live in peace he chuckled wryly weve come with three legions to make it into that kind of place in fact yes sir but aristocles only sounded dutiful not amused that disappointed varus who was pleased with the line hed got off they are our guests dont forget varus said that matters here if i send them away id affront them but what if theyve come here to murder you aristocles blurted that made quinctilius varus laugh he wasnt especially brave one more reason he felt uneasy around soldiers many of whom took their own courage for granted but he could tell when his slave was jumping at shadows if they wanted to murder me they could have done it a dozen times by now and they could have sneaked away before anyone knew i was dead since they havent seized any of those chances i have to think they dont aim to do me in what would murdering me get them they would have killed the man charged with bringing germany into the roman empire to aristocles it must have seemed obvious varus went on laughing yes and so and so that the pedisequus replied isnt it enough not if they aim to stop rome from conquering germany varus said wed take such revenge that the savages would shriek and wail and hide under their beds for the next hundred years vala numonius would see to that he and whoever augustus sent out to replace me besides youre missing something else whats that like anyone else slave or free aristocles didnt care to believe he could be missing anything arminius is a roman citizen hes a member of the equestrian order he risked his life to put down the rebels in pannonia and bring that province back under roman rule varus answered so why would he and his father want to work against rome at all his greek slave only sniffed why do all those people say he was doing nothing else but all winter long er sir seems to me hes the biggest fraud in the world the biggest fraud who isnt a greek you mean varus thought but he didnt care to wound aristocles feelings unless he had to i think we heard lies put together by segestes claque ive thought so all along segestes is a roman citizen too aristocles said hes been one longer than arminius has as if that proves anything hes older than arminius and hes still trying to fix arminius for running off with his daughter with thusnelda the names these germans have quinctilius varus was pleased with himself for remembering hers doesnt that say something about the kind of wolf uh man arminius is aristocles replied he swoops down like a thief in the night and and varus couldnt stop laughing ill tell you what kind of man arminius is hes a young man thats what kind he goes around with a stiff prong all the time didnt you when you were that age without waiting for aristocles to answer the roman governor went on besides its pikestaff plain he didnt steal thusnelda away against her will she went with him because she felt like it he fooled her he tricked her the pedisequus was nothing if not obstinate and hes fooling you tricking you too and youre letting him the day a german barbarian can fool a roman hes earned the right to do it varus said but i dont think that day will come any time soon aristocles sighed yes sir i understand once upon a time we greeks said the day a roman barbarian can fool a greek hes earned the right to do it we didnt think that day would come either but look where we are now look where i am now sir we didnt take greece by trickery we took greece because we were stronger quinctilius varus said aristocles didnt answer one of the masters privileges was the last word but somehow even though varus had it he didnt feel as if he did a torrent of guttural gibberish burst from the lips of the german chief or village headman or whatever he was caldus caelius looked to the interpreter a german about his own age whats he saying he hasnt got any silver the young german answered in good latin all that meant he hasnt got any silver caldus caelius raised an eyebrow come on friend give me the rest of it id rather not the interpreter said hes upset if you knew what he called you you might think you had to do something about it he didnt insult you on purpose i swear to that he is angry that your governor tries to make him give what he does not have oh he is is he how do you know he hasnt got it what happens if we do some digging and find hes sitting on half a talents worth of denarii let me ask him the interpreter spoke in his own language the village chieftain looked appalled hed never heard of acting he blurted out something the interpreter translated he says you wouldnt do that caldus caelius laughed in the barbarians face tell him we dig in every night when we make our camp tell him we dont mind digging up this louse trap he calls a village tell him he cant run far enough or fast enough if we find silver after he tells us he hasnt got any the interpreter did the chieftain went from fair to pale to fishbelly really his glassgreen eyes kept sliding towards a spot behind the biggest house then jerking away if caelius had to tell his men to dig he knew where hed have them start more gutturals from the headman the interpreter listened then asked him something the other german shook his head he laid a hand over his heart the way his folk did when they took an oath he says he just now remembered he might have a little silver the interpreter reported he says he wasnt trying to fool you before or anything he says it just slipped his mind germans dont use coins as often as romans do that last bit from everything caldus caelius had seen was true the rest he started laughing again so did several other legionaries who stood close enough to hear what the interpreter said a roman officer heard every kind of excuse under the sun from soldiers whod done what they shouldnt have and hadnt done what they should this chieftain couldnt have been a worse liar if he tried but that wasnt the point collecting taxes was tell him hed better come up with those denarii right away tell him hed better have enough to pay what quinctilius varus says he owes and tell him that hell end up dead if he tries screwing around with a roman whos got a nastier temper than i do and his wife and daughters will be slaves if theyre lucky that sounded pretty good in latin by the time the interpreter got done with it it sounded even better in the germans language the headman went red then white again he bellowed something not at caldus caelius but at his own people somebody came out of the biggest house the man was skinny unhappylooking and barefoot he wore a ratty threadbare cloak if that didnt make him a slave caelius had never seen one the way the chieftain yelled at him was another good marker the skinny man went into a building next to the house a barn caelius guessed and came out with a spade it had a wooden blade except for an iron strip at the bottom where it bit into the ground the fellow who was holding it called a question to the headman he wants to know where to dig the interpreter supplied right caldus caelius nodded if he were the village chieftain he wouldnt have wanted a slave to learn where the coinhoard was buried either the man could dig it up some moonless night and be long gone and able to buy not only freedom but friends before anybody caught up with him muttering under his breath the swagbellied headman lumbered over and stamped his foot like a petulant girl dig here he didnt say it but he might as well have rich dark german dirt flew they had fine soil here caelius didnt like the weather or the local menfolk but the soil tempted him to settle in germany once it turned into a proper province marry one of these big blond german girls raise crops and kids and pass the farm down to them you could do worse plenty of people did thud caelius clearly heard the noise even from where he stood the spade had hit something that wasnt dirt the slave dug a little more then picked up a small stout wooden box he carried it over to the headman by the way he handled it it wasnt light caldus caelius looked at looked through the heavyset german it just slipped your mind that you had this he waited for the interpreter to translate the chieftain didnt act well enough to hide the hate on his face either he said something what difference does it make the interpreter said the chieftain tacked on something else so did the interpreter you have it now thats right i do caelius nodded so open it up lets see what all you forgot about well both be surprised when the interpreter sent him a questioning glance he nodded the young german translated the chieftain glowered some more caldus caelius had enough men at his back not to care inside the box was an oiledleather sack caldus caelius chuckled softly the german looked daggers at him luckily for the barbarian caelius affected not to notice this wasnt the first german whod coughed up his cash after protesting that he didnt have any without a doubt he wouldnt be the last the locals still hadnt figured out that the romans had heard all their lies and excuses before he supposed they would before long that would make the tax collectors who followed on the armys heels have to work harder to pry money out of these people caelius wasted no more sympathy on the tax collectors than on the germans come on he said lets see the silver if you forgot it was there you wont miss whatever we take right his men snickered the interpreter grinned once the latin was rendered into the germans language the headman didnt seem to appreciate caelius wit the roman wondered why the chieftain had more than enough denarii to pay the villages tax assessment caldus caelius took only what hed been told to he handed the rest back to the barbarian these are yours he said you see i am not cheating you no you are not but the german wasnt agreeing for he went on you are robbing me things should have their proper names one of the legionaries hefted his javelin shall we give him what he deserves for his lip sir do i translate that the interpreter asked by the way the chieftain eyed that javelin caelius guessed he had a fair notion of what the soldier said yes go ahead he said and the young german did caelius continued now translate this too no we dont hurt him because he paid what he owed and he didnt try to fight us roman subjects pay taxes thats all there is to it and hed better get used to the idea well be back to collect next year too one growled sentence at a time the interpreter passed the word along to the headman the older german looked at him he spat out one word then scornfully turned his back whats that about caelius asked he called me a traitor the interpreter shrugged nothing i havent heard before these people dont understand that the roman empire has better ways of doing things than they ever dreamt of too right they dont caelius said well thats what were here for to fix things so they do understand and well teach em the lesson if we have to kill every stinking one of them to do it he thought but he kept that to himself some of these germans might follow more latin than they let on and even the interpreter might not fancy it he finished now that weve done the job here we go on to the next village and do it again yes sir the interpreter smiled he was a pretty good fellow caelius trusted him as far as he would have trusted any barbarian not quite so far as he would have trusted a roman in other words beyond the fields these germans cultivated beyond the meadows where their animals grazed stretched more forests and swamps caldus caelius eyed them without enthusiasm germany had far too many of both or so it seemed to him he wondered that the place had any room for germans but it did for altogether too many of them how long would it take to drag them into the empire one thatchroofed village and steading at a time as long as it took that was all he raised his voice to a shout that would reach all the legionaries come on boys time to go find the next place if they were eager they hid it very well but they followed him and their rear guard stayed alert if the germans here thought about getting their own back they thought again right afterwards caldus caelius nodded to himself one place at a time all right he marched on silver clinked in front of the camp prefect as he counted the cash roman soldiers had squeezed from german villages when arminius took service with the romans hed been impressed to see that they had officers in charge of paying their soldiers that had never crossed his mind till then german warriors lived on loot and on gifts from the war leaders they followed a niggardly leader had a hard time getting men to fight for him standard wages took care of that that the romans should also have an officer in charge of money coming in only made the german nod these people were nothing if not disciplined and thorough they left as little to chance as they could quinctilius varus came up behind arminius and his father you see the roman said my own men wondered whether we would be able to tax germany but we manage germans use far more silver than they did when i was a boy that is so arminius agreed germans use coins far more often than they did when i was a boy he didnt think he was half of varus age even sigimerus nodded when i was young he said in his slow latin you hardly ever saw a denarius now we use them often the world changes the world does change varus sounded enthusiastic about it where sigimerus arminius knew hated the idea the roman governor went on you germans grow ever more civilized though you may not notice it you grow ever more ready to become part of the empire it could be so arminius said before his father could tell varus exactly what his opinion was oh i think it is varus thought becoming a roman province would be good for germany he needed to think arminius and sigimerus agreed with him or their role in the resistance would end suddenly and unhappily he continued i dont suppose julius caesar would recognize germany if he saw it today arminius knew a couple of old men whod fought against the first roman to invade germany most of a lifetime earlier by things his father had said sigimerus had known many more though most of them were dead no one spoke of caesar without respect he hit hard he hit fast and he could talk you out of the brooch on your cloak and make you glad you gave it to him was how one of the graybeards summed things up romans said augustus was as great a man as caesar had been maybe it was true augustus had stayed king longer than arminius had lived which argued that he was formidable none of the men hed sent to try to bring germany into the empire came close to matching his quality though tiberius might but tiberius was busy in pannonia varus didnt he was no warrior and uneasily aware of it but he seemed happy about what the legionaries under his command had been able to squeeze from the germans before long well be able to spend the whole year in germany instead of wintering back in gaul he said proudly that will be one more step toward bringing this province into line with the rest of the empire so it will arminius said which let him acknowledge varus words without showing what he thought of them but not yet your excellency no not yet now varus sounded regretful well have to slog back through the mud through the swamps he heaved a sigh you could come farther north through the land where my tribe lives arminius said eagerly i know a route that stays on higher ground on dry ground all the way back to the rhine its longer but you wont have to worry about mud for even one step whether varus and the legionaries would have to worry about germans was a different question but not the one the roman governor was worrying about at the moment if varus decided to go that way arminius knew the kind of place where he wanted to lead the romans he thought he could gather enough of his own folk around that kind of place to give them a proper welcome too to his disappointment quinctilius varus shook his head i thank you for the suggestion my friend but ill pass this year weve already made plans to use the same route we did before sometimes even the gods cant change plans once theyre made arminius didnt dare push too hard he couldnt show how disappointed he was either not unless he wanted to rouse varus suspicions however you please sir he said if you enjoy the muck youre welcome to it and if you ever decide you dont speak to me of that my route wont disappear it wont flood either neither will the one we usually use i hope varus betrayed himself with those last two words knowing as much he went on one of these days germany will have proper roman roads may they come soon yes may they as arminius had so often he lied without hesitation roman roads would tie germany to the empire all right he understood why varus wanted them nothing could possibly be better for moving swarms of men on foot traders and travelers and farmers might use roman roads but they were for the legions varus dream of soldiers marching through germany along them was arminius nightmare one more step in bringing roman ways here varus said arminius made himself smile and nod he glanced toward his father sigimerus was nodding too but no smile lightened his features varus fortunately didnt notice lightning flashed thunder boomed rain poured down out of a dark gray sky the romans squashing through the mire between mindenum and the headwaters of the lupia cursed the gods who oversaw the weather in germany unlike most of the legionaries quinctilius varus was mounted that kept him from getting muddy past the knees the way they did but he couldnt have got any wetter in the pools inside a bathhouse the chilly drumming relentless rain stayed in his eyes his nose his mouth his ears a fish could do as well in this as i could he had to shout to make himself heard through the downpour thats a fact sir vala numonius shouted too and a fish would be more comfortable in its scales than i am in my cloak the wool garment clung to him the way a caul was said to cling to some newborn babes varus did the same thing soaked in rainwater it was not only clinging but heavy the roman governors eyes slid to aristocles the slave rode a donkey so he too was out of the worst of it but he looked like a drowned mouse some of the legionaries had their hair in their eyes varus and aristocles didnt the first advantage to balding the governor had discovered water dripped off the end of aristocles pointed nose the pedisequus didnt say anything but every line of his body and of his cloak screamed out a reproach one thing sir lucius eggius said we dont have to worry about the germans jumping us in a storm like this oh why not varus had been worrying about just that dont be silly sir eggius said before varus could decided whether to be affronted eggius went on the savages would have as much trouble moving as we do ah that hadnt occurred to varus yes one mans miseries are every mans miseries arent they in spite of the deluge he smiled pleased with himself ive heard aphorisms i liked less vala numonius also smiled eggius shrug loosed a small freshet from his shoulders varus wondered if he knew what an aphorism was career soldiers were more cultured than germans but sometimes not much more that reminded the roman governor of something we might have been able to steer clear of all this his horse chose that moment to step into a deep puddle the poor beast couldnt see where to put its feet after all varus had to grab its mane like a tyro and hang on for dear life to keep from getting pitched headlong into the slop neither vala numonius nor lucius eggius laughed at him it could have happened to them too and they both knew it after varus was securely seated once more numonius asked what do you mean sir arminius told me of a route back to the rhine that never floods varus replied if its raining when we leave mindenum next fall to the crows with me if i dont think ill let him show it to us i dont care if it is longer if it means we dont have to put up with this again i didnt think there were any places in germany that never flooded eggius said are you sure that blond bastard isnt hiding something under his cloak sir he tacked on the title of respect too late to do himself any good better in fact if hed left it off altogether the sliteyed look quinctilius varus sent him had nothing to do with the rain why would you think showing us a better route smacks of treachery varus inquired i didnt say that sir this time eggius used the title without hesitation but it was too late to mollify quinctilius varus id sure want to make sure the route was good before i used it though do you imagine a roman citizen and a member of the equestrian order would intentionally mislead his fellows varus asked in tones colder than the rain he may be a roman citizen sir but hes still a german too lucius eggius was stubborn so was varus he may still be a german but he is a roman citizen like you hes risked his life for augustus and for rome he waited eggius didnt say anything what could the officer say if varus had decided to trust arminius nothing he heard was likely to persuade him to do anything else and he had and every yard his horse fought to gain made him wish he d done it sooner xii he almost bit father by the gods he almost did arminius couldnt hide his own excitement as they made their way north and west back toward their own country he was like a fat trout he nibbled at the worm and he never saw the hook like a trout or like a water dragon sigimerus asked what would you have done if hed decided to take your route what could you have done except let him take it and eat half a dozen tribes out of house and home along the way no one in germany would have loved you after that and you couldnt have gathered an army together fast enough to fight him arminius scowled not because his father was wrong but because he was right rain dripped through the pines arminius and sigimerus both had their cloaks up over their heads they were both wet even so the rain also turned the track to mud they slogged on without complaint things in germany had always been like this next year arminius said next year we can be ready im sure of it all varus has to do is take the bait and then what sigimerus insisted on looking at all the things that could go wrong varus and the romans see we have an army so what they have an army too they dont fight like us but that doesnt mean theyre bad at it if they were we would have driven them off years before you were born rain dripping off the end of his nose arminius scowled again for the same reason as before he knew how good the romans were he hadnt just seen them fight or stood against them hed used their system he not only understood that it worked he understood how it worked in his minds eye he heard roman trumpets blaring he saw the swarthy little men moving from marching order to line of battle without wasted motion he imagined the blizzard of javelins theyd send up the wall of their big shields and the way their sharp swords would bite like vipers we have to ruin them before they can deploy hed said that before his inner picture of the legions getting ready to face a german host only made the words seem more urgent now urgency failed to impress his father all very well to talk about it how do you aim to do it the question was as pointed as a roman gladius we have to take them in a place where they cant swing from column into line arminius said and where will you find a place like that his father asked you can wish for one but its not the same thing ill do more than wish ill be traveling this winter anyhow everywhere i go ill look for what we need sooner or later im bound to find it germany isnt all flatlands and fields if i keep my eyes open ill find something arminius made himself sound confident i hope youre right sigimerus said me ill be glad to get home to your mother for a while and i expect you wont be sorry to see thusnelda again either in spite of the rain arminius blood heated thats so he said hed bought relief a few times while staying at mindenum seeing german women selling themselves for silver distressed him but not enough to keep him from taking advantage of them he thought his father had done the same thing though neither asked the other about it if you were a long way from your woman you took what you could find if she did the same while you were away you had the right to slit her throat and fling her faithless body into a bog men didnt need to be chaste but women did you should get a child on her sigimerus said that will bind her to you even after passion fades good advice arminius smiled wolfishly youd best believe i aim to try both men laughed arminius tried to pick up the pace but the sloppy path wouldnt let him gods curse this mud he said and laughed again this time on a different note now i understand why the romans want to build their roads in our land so they can get to our women in a hurry sigimerus said one more gibe with too much truth behind it a jay screeched high up in a pine most of the birds were gone now heading off to the south toward the roman empire some stubborn ones stayed through the winter though vultures and ravens and carrion crows squabbled over carcasses regardless of the season arminius wanted to glut them on roman meat he had a plan he needed a place my third winter in vetera quinctilius varus thought with a kind of benumbed wonder when he first came up to the rhine he could have imagined no fate more dismal than spending three winters here now though this roman military town seemed an outpost of civilization compared to what lay beyond the river he wasnt the only one who felt that way by the gods sir its good to have real walls around me and a proper roof over my head aristocles said meaning no disrespect to you and the job youre doing but i get tired of living under canvas i dont think youll fall over dead with surprise if i tell you i feel the same way varus said one day mindenum will make a fine city i suppose plenty of places that started out as legionary encampments are even veteras on the way though i wouldnt have believed it when i got here but mindenum does have some way to go yet the pedisequus dipped his head in greek agreement oh doesnt it just he said fervently why on this side of the rhine i can go out beyond the wall by myself without worrying that some savage will murder me and spike my head to a tree thats not too likely around mindenum varus hid a smile though part of what he hid was wistful being a slave aristocles didnt have to pretend to courage he didnt own as roman governor of germany varus did he knew hed been better suited to peaceful syria unfortunately augustus didnt and augustus will was the only one that counted not only for aristocles sake but for his own varus went on the germans around there have learned more of our ways than any others i do believe more maybe but not enough plainly nothing would turn aristocles into a germanophile well he wasnt the only one who felt that way we need time thats all again varus worked to convince himself too when i was born these gauls on this side of the river were nothing but trousered barbarians still smarting after caesars conquest you cant tell me they dont make good roman subjects now tolerable i suppose truth to tell aristocles didnt approve of anything north of the alps at least they mostly use olive oil not butter he wrinkled his nose more than you can say about the germans the olive wont grow there varus said for that matter it wont grow here either though it will farther south in gaul but our merchants take the oil all over the province they can do the same in germany they will once we get the place a little more settled that day cant come soon enough aristocles long nose twitched again butter on bread is bad enough even when its fresh but the unending stink of the stuff in the lamps it sticks to your hair it sticks to your skin and you cant get away from it and every german reeks of it not every german varus shook his head his pedisequus would have tossed his varus was long used to that difference between romans and greeks he continued arminius and his father smell the same way we do they do when theyre scrounging our food and aping our ways aristocles sniffed if you called on them in their village now theyd be as rancid as all the other german savages enough varus snapped so he wouldnt have to think about that arminius is a fine young man we already have roman senators from spain before too long well probably have some from gaul and if arminius lives long enough he may be the first man of german blood to don the toga edged with purple if he is i dont expect any of the other conscript fathers to complain about how he smells theyre polite arminius it was chilly in varus residence despite fires and braziers but that had nothing to do with aristocles shiver he looks at me like a fox eyeing a pullet and his father is even worse sigimerus is a formidable man varus said arminius father reminded him of a tough old wolf too but if we tame the younger man he will tame the elder for us yes sir if a slave wasnt supposed to take the last word when he argued with his master aristocles walked away anyhow leaving varus with his mouth hanging open the roman said something that would have made aristophanes blush but he said it quietly to himself and then he started to laugh hed dealt with slaves his whole life every once in a while you had to remember they were people not just property with legs the governor of germany summoned his leading officers to plan the next campaigning seasons moves inside the province the romans didnt quite rule i want to see more of germany than mindenum and the miserable route we use to reach it he declared its not so miserable sir lucius eggius said we can use boats most of the way theyre faster than marching and theyre safer too foot soldiers can use boats vala numonius said not so easy for cavalry by the gods there are never enough boats for the horses or for the mules and donkeys and oxen a quartermaster broke in thats right numonius nodded we slogged back through the mud every cubit of the way if the savages came screaming out of the woods we wouldnt have had a smooth time of it either i see i understand eggius nodded too quinctilius varus thought everything would go smoothly after that but eggius aimed a sarcastic dart at the cavalry commander you enjoy marching through mud so much you want to take the long way back from mindenum and go through even more of it vala numonius turned red no curse it i want a route that doesnt go through mud good luck friend its germany eggius said youve got swamps and youve got woods sometimes just to keep you on your toes youve got swamps in woods thats what the country is that certainly fit what varus had seen even so he said arminius tells me that if we swing north of the low hills north of the lupia the land is drier he says we can march up around there and keep our feet dryalmost the whole way if a portrait painter had wanted to sketch insubordination he could have used lucius eggius as a model meaning no disrespect sir but id sooner not trust a german if i dont have to eggius said whenever a man said meaning no disrespect he meant disrespect varus had learned that rule when he hardly needed to scrape down from his cheeks it had served him well ever since and he recalled no exceptions to it i think arminius is reliable he said now never mind his past service to rome would he have spent so much time at mindenum last summer if he meant us ill he prefers us to his own savage kind will you say his father likes us better too sir lucius eggius asked the old bastard spent as much time at mindenum as arminius did varus opened his mouth then closed it again he might want to say that but no one whod ever set eyes on sigimerus would claim he was romanized even if his son was he came along with arminius to see what roman ways are like he didnt seem to mind sleeping soft or drinking wine having said so much varus knew hed gone as far as he could eggius chuckle had a wry edge your excellency i like sleeping soft and drinking wine too that doesnt tell me much about what this barbariand do to me if he ever got the chance the germans seem to pay more attention to arminius than they do to sigimerus and arminius is in our company any way you care to use the phrase varus insisted another officer a junior man one whose name varus was always forgetting said what about those things segestes keeps telling us if even a quarter of thats true arminius isnt such a big friend of romes as he makes himself out to be several other soldiers nodded varus fought to hide his exasperation a losing battle oh by the gods mm caelius he said there hed remembered you might as well be jews and egyptians and cappadocians back at rome caring more for gossip than you do for truth vala numonius nodded most of the other legionaries eyed varus in stony silence they didnt like him calling them a bunch of jews he groaned silently now hed have to waste mars only knew how much time jollying them along till they werent angry at him anymore they were even more foolish than jews they reminded him of spoiled children he was tempted to tell them so but that would only make things worse it began to pour outside vetera might have been built of wood rather than canvas but the place wasnt well built of wood every other roof leaked including this one water started plinking into two pots set out under the leaks the sound would have annoyed varus most of the time it would have reminded him how far away he was from places where they did things properly now though it came as a welcome distraction pointing towards one of the pots he said well gentlemen its still winter we dont have to make up our minds right now that seemed to satisfy the soldiers at least the ones with sense enough not to show too much some of them the more naive ones would believe him when he said nothing was decided yet the rest would see that antagonizing augustus kinsman by marriage wasnt the smartest thing they could do for now lets discuss something else quinctilius varus went on the officers looked relieved we took far more taxes in silver last fall than we did the year before and correspondingly less in kind he said i want that trend to continue next fall before many more years go by i expect germany to use as much money and to take money as much for granted as any other roman province yes eggius only one thing wrong with that sir the military prefect said there isnt as much money in germany as there is in an ordinary province the natives mostly dont buy and sell amongst themselves they swap back and forth like so sometimes we can squeeze silver out of em sure but sometimes they just dont have any varus smile showed genuine pleasure now he was arguing on his ground not the legionaries as the province grows more settled and more used to roman rule we can expect to see more traders entering from gaul and from rhaetia south of the danube theyll bring silver with them they want to do business in cash whenever they can the more denarii there are in germany the more we can take out in taxes doesnt that seem sensible to you he didnt even have to make his tone suggest that had better seem sensible to you or youll be sorry the mildly spoken words were plenty by themselves and lucius eggius got the message he might be a stubborn nitpicker unlike some of his colleagues he wasnt a stupid stubborn nitpicker well yes sir as long as everything in germany stays smooth that has a fighting chance of working out anyway why wouldnt everything stay smooth now varus let himself sound ominous but if he hoped to impress the officers he failed at least half a dozen of them chorused because its fornicating germany several others nodded all varus could do was fume somewhere ahead lay the ocean arminius had never seen it but he could smell the salt tang on the wind blowing down from the north serving in pannonia hed heard romans talking about the sea to them it was blue and warm and generally friendly but hed also heard men from the frisii the chauci the anglii and other seaside german tribes they called the ocean green or gray they said it was cold freezing in the wintertime and they thought it was at least as dangerous as a wolf or a bear either somebody was lying or the ocean was more fickle than any woman ever born arminius still hadnt made up his mind which he was up near the marches between his own cherusci and the chauci he wanted to talk to the men who lived north of his tribe he knew they were fierce the wars theyd fought against his own folk proved as much the cherusci would long since have conquered any tribe that couldnt match their ferocity arminius might not love the chauci but he respected them for many of the same reasons he respected the romans and the chauci would respect him unless they decided to take his head instead if they did they would face another round of war with the cherusci they had to know it that north wind brought more than seascent with it rain started dripping down out of a leadgray sky arminius pulled his cloak up over his head his father was doing the same thing at the same time neither of them got upset it was winter if it didnt rain it would likely snow living close by the sea the chauci have wetter winters than we do sigimerus said arminius shuddered one more reason to be glad we dont belong to their tribe he said some of the romans told me it never rains in summer in their country and hardly ever snows in winter no rain in the summer how do they raise their crops his father asked they plant in the fall and harvest in the spring arminius said they do get rain in winter it waters the grain i think those romans were lying the way they would if they said their trees grew with branches underground and roots in the air sigimerus said they just wanted to see what youd fall for i dont know father arminius said pannonia plants in spring and reaps in the fall the same as we do the romans kept talking about how funny that was well i wasnt there sigimerus said a polite way of skirting an argument his foot came down in mud he pulled it out and scraped the muck off on some dying grass i wish i werent here too if you know a better track that goes north you should have told me about it arminius said this one snaked north and west along the edge of a bog the reasonably hard ground was wide enough for three or four men abreast no more sigimerus pointed it does get a little better up ahead just a couple of bowshots up ahead as a matter of fact the ground up there gets higher and are you listening to me arminius he raised his right hand as if he were on the point of cuffing his son for not paying attention but that was only old habit arminius was too big to cuff even if he wasnt listening and he wasnt he was looking at the higher ground sigimerus had pointed out by the way he was looking at it he might have seen the germans fierce gods feasting there sigimerus stared try as he would he couldnt see or even imagine the gods there because he couldnt he went on grumbling when i was a young man we respected our elders we didnt forget they were there im sorry father arminius didnt sound very sorry its just that what sigimerus snapped now i know what to tell the chauci arminius said sigimerus spent the next two days trying to get him to explain what he meant to the older mans disgust arminius wouldnt his smile though was even broader and more selfsatisfied than it had been when he brought thusnelda home from segestes house quinctilius varus had just sent away a german girl when aristocles tapped on his door varus grumbled to himself the pedisequus was pushing things by bothering him so soon couldnt a man have some leisure to enjoy the afterglow had varus been as young as the girl he would have enjoyed another round in his fifties hed have to wait a day or two or three no matter how many leeks and eggs and snails he ate not even oysters would help much and theyd likely spoil by the time they got here from the coast and so grouchily he said what is it please excuse me sir aristocles said as he came in but theres someone here i think youd better see oh really who varus asked the first person he thought of who might fit that bill was a messenger from augustus if the rebels in pannonia had surrendered or been crushed if tiberius was on his way to finish the job in germany varus wouldnt be affronted by the sweet gods he thought i could go home but a glance at his slaves face told him the news wasnt that good voice faintly apologetic aristocles answered the distinguished german gentleman named segestes varus knew that as far as aristocles was concerned there was no such thing as a distinguished german gentleman he also knew segestes was about the last person he wanted to see i dont suppose you could tell him ive gone down to italy to get the hair in my nose and ears trimmed he said aristocles tossed his head i dont think hed be happy to hear something like that sir he did come all this way he talks as if he thinks he has important news the only trouble with that is he always thinks he has important news and hes been wrong every time so far quinctilius varus heaved a sigh oh very well you cant really tell him to turn around and go on back to germany take him to the small dining room and give him wine and whatever else he fancies ill be along soon ill do that then sir the pedisequus bobbed his head and hurried out of the bedchamber with another sigh varus draped himself in his toga roman fashions werent made for winters like this he understood why the germans wore breeches under their cloaks he wished he could himself but what people would say if a roman governor started aping the barbarians did not bear thinking on he did put on thick wool socks that rose almost to his knees he could wear those without loss of dignity and his wifes female slaves had knitted him several pairs trousers would have covered more of him but the socks were better than nothing they did help keep his feet warm anyhow when he walked into the small dining room segestes was drinking neat wine and eating figs candied in honey the german jumped to his feet and clasped varus hand your excellency he said in his gutturally accented latin good day segestes always a pleasure to see you one thing long experience in roman politics had done for varus he could lie with a straight face and a sincere voice what brings you to vetera today a roman might have used polite evasions for a while segestes words were as blunt as his features about what you would expect i bring you news of arminius it is not good news not for anyone who cares about rome and the roman province of germany quinctilius varus poured wine for himself the house slaves had thoughtfully left two cups on the table well tell me what it is he went on doing his best to sound friendly but he felt he was going through the same thing more often than he wanted as if he kept burping up fish that hadnt been quite right to begin with he has gone up to the north to talk with the chauci segestes wintry eyes widened to show what a wicked deed that was and why has he gone there varus asked patiently he wasnt altogether sure arminius had he disliked taking segestes word for anything he kept quiet about that if the german thought varus reckoned him a liar things might take an unpleasant turn they dwell far from mindenum sir the power of the legions is not much felt in their land and they have been a strong fierce tribe for many years why else would arminius go to them but to seek their help in his fight against rome by the way segestes laid things out he might have been a greek geometer drawing in the dust with a stick to prove a theorem suddenly and powerfully varus missed the warm sun of athens missed the bright sky missed standing in the shade of an olive tree with graygreen leaves as a greek geometer drew his figures and then erased them with his sandal he missed everything the sun and the tree and the geometer stood for too he missed civilization hed never dreamt his work would involve extending civilization to germany dealing with this wolfish savage told how hard the job was and would be and as far as varus could see segestes hadnt proved his theorem now any more than he had any other time he trotted it out did you hear arminius speaking to these chauci do you know for a fact what he said to them the roman governor asked did i hear him no segestes shook his big head like so many germans he towered over varus varus didnt like it his unwelcome guest went on but i know what he must have said how varus demanded perhaps more bluntly than hed intended the wine hed poured himself was as neat as segestes unmixed wine kept you warm in the wintertime it also mounted straight to your head i will tell you how sir segestes might have drunk more than one cup himself bright red spots burned on his cheekbones his teeth seemed uncommonly long and sharp as he continued i know because if i stood before the chauci blazing with hatred for rome it is what i would say ah there we have it varus pounced why do you claim arminius blazes with hatred for rome you will have heard i suppose that he and his father guested with me at mindenum this summer they showed no hatred then have you ever caught a duck with your hands segestes asked what on earth does that have to do with anything varus asked irritably you havent then i did not think so the german nodded to himself you sit by the riverbank you sit very still so you dont scare the duck off right away after a while it grows easier at having you around you toss crumbs of stale bread or whatever other food you have into the water the duck swims closer and closer it loves you now you go on sitting still but for when you feed it and then when it comes close enough you grab it he lunged at varus who involuntarily stumbled back and you wring its neck he could have wrung varus neck had he wanted to both men knew it it made them oddly complicit there in the chilly little dining hall with what dignity varus could muster he said i am no duck nor is arminius hunting me so you say segestes replied if you kill arminius and i am wrong though you do rome no harm but if you do not kill him if you let the worthless swinehound live and i am right you do not just hurt yourself you also hurt rome you may hurt rome badly for you do not grasp how ambitious arminius is ambitio was a word to conjure with in latin quinctilius varus wondered whether segestes knew a man ambitious for himself rather than rome was the greatest danger to the state ambitious men had brought down the republic now augustus having gained all his ambitions did his best to keep others from having any ask any man in any clan in any tribe in all of germany segestes went on if he knows my name he will tell you i am romes friend and ally ever since my beard began to grow i have been on the roman side i have fought for rome inside germany arminius never has he never will he thinks you are a duck sir he throws stale bread on the water to make you swim closer will you let him grab you he didnt go for varus throat again from what varus had seen of germans that showed unusual restraint from segestes well you may be right the roman governor said after silence stretched in the roman empire anyone with ears to hear would have understood that as quiet down and go away youre boring my toes off segestes might be a roman citizen but he was no roman sophisticate you wait you look close you will see i am right he had to pause to remember how to form the future varus just wanted him to leave theyd played this scene too many times now did actors get sick of roles after performing them over and over if they didnt why not segestes poured himself more wine and drank it down the red patches on his cheeks burned bigger and brighter he reached for a candied fig then pulled his hand back when he looked at varus again his eyes were bright with unshed tears ask you something your excellency he said his speech slightly slurred of course varus said more cordially than he felt you had arminius as your guest for all that time at mindenum the german chieftain said which didnt sound like a question to varus he nodded anyway yes thats right he was there he and his father both and if you dont like it too bad segestes muttered to himself then slowly painfully he brought out what was on his mind while arminius was with you did he speak of thusnelda did he say she was well did he say she was happy he loves her he cares about her varus realized in surprise hed assumed segestes resented arminius for showing him up not for stealing away someone who mattered to him but the middleaged chieftain wasnt just posturing he missed his daughter and he worried about her varus had to think back arminius hadnt talked much about thusnelda one way or the other but what did that prove varus hadnt talked much about claudia pulchra either he remembered speaking of his own son of whom arminius reminded him a little but not of his wife he picked his words with care in all the time he was there i never heard anything to make me doubt it he is not a man who enjoys hurting someone and then laughing about it varus had hoped that would make segestes feel better but it didnt seem to the german heaved a sigh no i suppose he is not that kind of beast he allowed that does not mean he is no beast he takes what he wants and then once he has it he puts it on a shelf and forgets about it not so bad if you talk about a fancy pot or a silver statuette but if a girl sits on a shelf and gathers dust it is cruel not so plenty of girls gave their all to men who got bored with them afterwards varus didnt think segestes wanted to hear that i hope it will turn out for the best in the end the roman said one more sentiment that sounded good and cost him nothing i always hope for this segestes slow deliberate latin seemed strangely impressive but what i hope for and what i expect are two different things he sighed once more i cannot persuade you i cannot uh convince you all i can do is to say again try not to be a duck your excellency he sketched a salute and strode out of the small dining room with no more ceremony than that aristocles appeared a moment later varus nodded unsurprised were you listening he asked of course not sir the pedisequus sounded shocked so shocked varus didnt believe him for a heartbeat he does go on doesnt he the roman governor said and on and on aristocles agreed not caring that hed just given himself the lie what was that nonsense about ducks i couldnt follow all of that dont worry its not worth following but he really is fond of his daughter varus shook his head in wonder you never can tell with germans you never can tell about anything aristocles remarked true varus said and then wished he hadnt xiii caldus caelius caligae clunked on the timbers of the bridge across the rhine one more time he said to nobody in particular maybe well finish the job this year then we can go do something else or settle down in germany for garrison duty said the man marching on his left wouldnt that be fun sometimes i think so caelius answered sometimes im not so sure silence in the ranks a military tribune bawled caelius marched on without a word sooner or later probably sooner the senior officer would find something else to worry about in the meantime caelius didnt feel like getting screamed at his hobnailed marching sandals stopped clunking and started thumping dirt underfoot not planks germany the legionary beside him said again both mens eyes darted now left now right neither was foolish enough to turn his head and risk drawing the tribunes notice caldus caelius took an extra long stride to avoid a horse turd in his path the governor and the cavalry had gone on ahead of the legionaries and left souvenirs for the unwary a couple of ranks behind caelius somebody swore sulfurously the tribune barked at him whats that all about whispered the man to caelius left he mustve stepped in the shit caelius whispered back i saw it coming so i missed it he must not have is that why you hopped i thought something went and bit you the other legionary said not yet give it another month caelius answered the other man grunted quinctilius varus had started them for mindenum early the trees that shed their leaves were just beginning to get them back germany seemed to have fewer mosquitoes than italy did but it had more midges and gnats and biting flies when spring was a little further along they would rise from the swamps and marshes in buzzing myriads spring brought forth all kinds of life including the unwelcome thinking about the unwelcome naturally made caldus caelius think about germans wonder if the governors tame barbarianll come round again he murmured huh the other legionary said a books worth of commentary packed into what wasnt even a word all the same the soldier went and amplified it did you ever see a german who was really tame theres the one who keeps coming to tell the governor what a rotter the other savage is caelius said if hes tame the other fellow isnt and if he isnt the other bugger is or maybe neither one of em is the other roman replied i say theyre both stinking barbarians and i say to the crows with em that you running your mouth caelius the tribune rasped like a saw blade hacking through marble no sir caldus caelius lied without compunction or hesitation well somebody cursed well is the military tribune was half mollified but only half whoever it is hed better shut up if he knows whats good for him caelius didnt respond to that if he had the centurion would have suspected he had a guilty conscience he did but he also had the sense not to put it on display the legionaries plunged into the woods if you wanted to go anywhere in germany you had to go through the forest or through mud or more likely through both because so many of the trees were pines and spruces and yews the air took on a faint spicy scent that odor was almost the only thing about the woods caelius liked he had a javelin in his right hand he also unobtrusively made sure his gladius was loose in its sheath he didnt think the germans would try to ambush the legionaries so close to vetera but you never knew they might try an ambush here just because they guessed the romans wouldnt expect it several soldiers in front of him were checking their weapons too after youd gone into germany a few times you realized every tree had eyes and every bush had ears legionaries who took stupid chances usually regretted it but not for long a raven high up in a spruce croaked gutturally hear that the man next to caelius said its going feed me feed me we arent supposed to do so much fighting now caelius said this is supposed to be a working province now tell me one ill believe the other roman said so this is a province like gaul say then i can walk around wherever i please in a tunic and maybe a cloak if its chilly outside i dont need any armor he shrugged to make his chainmail jingle i dont need any weapons like caelius he carried javelins and thrusting shortsword as well as a leatherfaced wooden shield with an iron boss in the center and bronze edging caldus caelius had to laugh i said it was supposed to be that kind of province i didnt say it was yet good thing too only place in germany where i can walk around in my tunic and not worry about getting scragged is inside the rampart at mindenum oh yeah and i guess in aliso and the other riverside forts too silence in the ranks the tribune bellowed again caelius this time i know it was you didnt making centurion give you any extra sense the ordinary soldier marching next to caelius snickered he hadnt got caught caelius contrived to step on his toe which not only made him bleed but also made him swear the military tribune pounced like a wildcat jumping a field mouse caelius didnt laugh not on the outside anyhow a graybearded warrior his face drawn and grim approached the funeral pyre torch in hand the pale corpse on the pyre looked like a thin wasted version of him and was in fact his younger brother the dead mans spear and dagger and a shortsword hed captured from some legionary lay on his breast when the graybeard touched the torch to the pyre the wood began to blaze at once standing in the crowd of mourners with his head bowed arminius caught the odor of burning butter the romans used olive oil sometimes perfumed to make sure their pyres burned strongly butter worked just as well as it also did in cookery alcus was a worthy fighter no man of the chauci could ask for greater praise his brother said stepping back from the flames a low murmur of agreement ran through the crowd arminius hadnt known alcus alive but added his respects now that the man was dead he didnt want an affronted ghost dogging his tracks a man could fight the romans how could anyone hope to fight a ghost he would have gone to war once more against the invaders of our fatherland alcus brother continued now his spirit will watch to make sure we fight as fiercely as he would have more murmurs of approval rose again arminius joined them leaping flames engulfed alcus body the stink of charred meat mingled with the odors of butter and wood smoke in the air coughing arminius sidled away so he was upwind of the pyre beside him his father was doing the same thing so were the chauci so the two cherusci didnt stand out all the mourners swung to the left how long had the chauci been burning bodies in this meadow a long time judging by the number of turf mounds that rose here arminius had seen that the romans raised stone memorials above their dead like any german he thought those oppressively heavy a ghost might not be able to get out from under one of them cut turves were better and then suddenly he forgot about alcus forgot about the sorrow he was supposed to share with his hosts he nudged his father and loudly whispered turves turves sigimerus echoed what are you talking about his tone suggested he would clout arminius if he didnt like the answer he got hed done that often enough when arminius was smaller but arminius repeated turves when the romans wanted to remember something they could write it down and preserve it as if they were smoking pork most roman officers had their letters only a handful of men in germany did to write latin rather than their own tongue arminius wasnt one of them when he needed to hold something in his memory he spoke to make his ideas stick and to pass them on to someone else so they wouldnt stay in his head alone he went on if we pile them up to make a rampart at that spot we found coming here ah i see what youre saying sigimerus sounded as excited as he did several of the chauci sent them scandalized glances arminius was embarrassed he wasnt behaving as a mourner should where are your manners guest among us a big man rumbled his tone suggested there might be bloodshed if he didnt like the answer he got my apologies arminius said i just had a notion that will help us in our fight against the romans in my excitement maybe i spoke louder than i should have you did the big man nodded but that is a good reason for bad manners i say no blame sticks to you he eyed his fellow tribesmen as if daring them to disagree no one did another man was not so easily pacified you say you want to do this and that and something else to the romans he told arminius i do arminius replied and i say it for the best reason it is true you say it the man from the chauci repeated but is it true or are you a spy for them you spent last summer in their stinking camp are you a proper german or are you the romans lapdog i am a german never doubt it arminius said if you fish for trout dont you put a fat worm or a cricket or a bit of meat on your hook of course you do the bait will help you catch your fish i am the bait that will help germany catch the romans so you say the other man returned yes so i say arminius agreed and if you say i lie you had better say it with something more than words the other man had a spear in his hand and a knife on his belt germans from all tribes carried their weapons everywhere even to a funeral the fellow dipped his head to arminius i am ready shall we begin sigimerus set an urgent hand on arminius arm what if he kills you he whispered you cant do this you risk too much the gods will not let him kill me arminius said calmly and even if they do you can lead our folk to victory against the romans you know everything ive done and everything i aim to do you have the name of a brave warrior no less than i do men will follow where you lead if you fall the first thing ill do is kill this ass with ears sigimerus growled im not going to fall arminius assured him then he bowed to alcus brother he didnt want to anger the chauci he wanted them fighting the legions alongside his own cherusci and as many other germans as he could gather i mean no disrespect to the fine fighter now lying on his pyre but you surely are a man of honor yourself would you let anyone say you did not tell the truth how could you show your face among men afterwards if you did you will do what you will do and the gods will show us all who has the right of it the older man replied just so arminius said the chauci who had been mourning alcus now buzzed excitedly some of them pointed towards arminius others in the direction of their fellow tribesman they argued in low voices arminius knew what they were doing getting their bets down if he werent in the fight he would have done the same thing like most germans he loved to gamble men whod lost everything else would bet their own freedom and if they lost that too theyd go into slavery without a word of complaint and with their heads high the chauci formed a circle around arminius and the man whod called him a liar you know who i am tell me your name please i would not kill a stranger i am vannius son of catualda i had heard that the cherusci were a rude lot i see that is not so the other man replied we hear those things about the chauci too it must come from living beside each other for so long arminius raised his spear in salute shall we begin lets vannius advanced on him by the way the fellow held his own spear arminius knew him for an experienced warrior well he was a few years older than arminius few germans reached that age without a battle or two under their cloaks the two men were about the same size vannius might have been a little thicker through the shoulders arminius hefted his spear as vannius stalked closer if he threw it and hit he could end the fight before it began if he threw it and missed hed be left with a roman gladius against a spear with four times the reach hed die in short order in other words vannius had to be making the same calculations arminius foe showed no sign of wanting to cast his spear of course nobody with a grain of sense would till the instant before he let fly why let your enemy get ready to dodge or duck but vannius seemed to want to fight it out at close quarters i told father the gods wouldnt let him kill me arminius thought was i right or was i fooling myself before he could wonder for more than a fraction of a heartbeat his right arm went back then forward again he watched the spear fly as if it had nothing to do with him he didnt even reach for his sword one way or the other he didnt think it would matter vannius waited till the last moment to start to spring aside maybe he was gauging the spears flight or maybe he wanted to show how brave he was whatever the reason he waited too long as he tried to fling himself to the right the spear caught him square in the chest he stood swaying for a couple of heartbeats looking astonished when he opened his mouth to say something blood came out instead of words blood also bubbled from his nose he slowly crumpled to the ground his feet drummed and scuffed at the grass cautiously arminius approached him do you want me to give you peace he asked ready to jump back in a hurry if vannius went for his knife but the other man only nodded he was biting his lip to hold in a shriek now wounds often didnt hurt for a little while then as arminius knew too well they did he drew his gladius and drove it into vannius throat the other man twisted and jerked his life rivered out of him as arminius pulled out the shortsword and plunged it into the ground again and again to clean off the blood after a few moments vannius lay still his gaze set and staring arminius felt for his pulse and found none setting his foot on the corpses chest he jerked out the spear he bowed to the wideeyed chauci he was as brave as any of you he said i dont think i ever saw a man die so well may the gods give his spirit peace may it be so alcus brother spoke for his fellow tribesmen you downed him in a fair fight where he had a like chance to slay you he eyed the other chauci let no one here claim otherwise a few of the mans tribesmen stirred but no one challenged him no one challenged arminius either that relieved him he didnt want a blood feud with the chauci the germans could fight among themselves later they needed to join together now to drive the romans beyond the rhine and then what arminius wondered gaul was supposed to be a rich country richer than germany the romans hadnt ruled there for even a lifetime yet old men remembered when the gauls were still their own masters several german tribes had tried to take new lands west of the rhine the gauls werent strong enough to stop them unfortunately the romans always had been if the romans were cast out of germany though wouldnt they also be thrown into disarray in gaul then the germans could burst forth in a vast wandering of peoples they could lay hold of all the living space they craved and deserved and with the romans all topsyturvy who could stop the german tribes no one arminius thought exultantly no one at all shoveling chopping hammering sawing endless profanity and obscenity by now quinctilius varus was far more familiar with the sounds that went into making a legionary encampment than hed ever dreamt he would be like the phoenix mindenum was rising from its own ashes once more varus remembered thinking it would make a fine provincial town one day the only trouble was he didnt want even the finest provincial town he wanted rome as a lover longed for his beloved he wasnt perfectly faithful to rome alexandria would have done so would antioch from which hed ruled syria and if athens was good enough for his son it was good enough for him as well mindenum wouldnt make an athens an antioch or an alexandria for the next two thousand years and mindenum wouldnt make a rome for well forever but it would make a place from which to administer germany for another summer one of these years varus supposed it would make a place from which to administer germany the year around he devoutly hoped somebody else would govern germany by then if a man wasnt allowed to return to even the dubious civilization of vetera he would be a mighty unhappy man after a while he would if he was anything like varus anyhow some stolid soldier might enjoy the kind of town mindenum would be by then plenty of officers seemed to like vetera well enough no accounting for taste or lack of taste would you care for a cup of wine sir by the slight slur in aristocles voice hed already had a cup of wine or several cups himself he went on to explain why if you drink a bit you dont notice the racket so much or at least i dont thats not a bad idea varus said why dont you make it a cup of neat wine as a matter of fact ill do that sir the pedisequus winked turning into a german are you by the gods i hope not varus exclaimed ive been called a lot of things in my time aristocles but what did i do to deserve that well sir the next german i see who likes his wine watered will be the first be right back for you aristocles hurried away rome alexandria varus thought longingly antioch athens his nearest approach to athens was a greek slave here in mindenum that wasnt close enough and the slave was bringing him neat wine at his own request not only ungreek but unroman as well the trouble was in mindenum neat wine was medicinal anything that helped you forget you were in mindenum for a little while was medicinal he would have used poppy juice if the physicians could have spared it it was expensive but he had no better uses for his silver still the reason it was expensive was that it was the only remedy for real physical pain he could understand why the doctors didnt care to use it for anything less aristocles came back with the wine your health sir he said handing varus the cup wine will help my health the roman governor poured a small libation on the rammedearth floor he drank and smiled at the warmth sliding smooth down his throat going back to italy would help it even more going back to italy would help my health too can we do that aristocles practically quivered with eagerness quinctilius varus shook his head not until my wifes greatuncle gives us leave what would augustus do if he threw up this governorship and went back to rome on his own maybe nothing maybe he would understand varus simply wasnt the right man for the job or maybe he would make an example of his grandnieces husband closer relatives were spending the rest of their lives on small hot barren mediterranean islands while the weather at a place like that was bound to be an improvement over mindenums the rest of the arrangements wouldnt be and the humiliation if he went home anyone who remembered him after he was dead would remember him for a sentence in some as yet unwritten history that read something like in the thirtysixth year of augustus reign publius quinctilius varus was exiled to belbina for neglecting his duties and anyone who cared if anyone at all cared would have to consult some geographers work to find out where the demon belbina was to keep from thinking about belbina varus knew too well where the arid rock was and knew it wasnt much more than a good piss long and maybe half that wide he poured down the wine the legionaries had fortified mindenum the wine fortified quinctilius varus he thrust the cup at aristocles fill this up again when you were talking to a slave you didnt even have to say please aristocles gauged him the way a sailor gauged clouds boiling up to windward like a prudent sailor the pedisequus shortened sail yes sir he said and not another word he came back with the refilled cup faster than hed brought it before varus poured a very small libation this time the rest of the wine went straight into him after two of those goodsized cups of potent vintage he felt like finding a nice quiet spot somewhere wrapping his cloak around him and going to sleep like a dormouse in germany nobody could tell him he couldnt do something like that if he wanted to the only person in the whole roman empire who could tell him any such thing was augustus and augustus was a long way from germany but not even augustus designated governor could keep some kind of commotion from starting in front of his tent whats going on now varus asked irately ill go see sir aristocles went off to find out he came back sooner than varus had expected his expression was altogether unreadable voice as carefully blank as his face aristocles said the german named arminius has returned your excellency his father is with him as he was last year oh good varus said aristocles face took on an expression then had varus tried to name it he probably would have called it unwatered horror arminius had wondered whether he would get back to the site of mindenum before the romans finished rebuilding it but no the camp or town or whatever you called it was a going concern by the time he and sigimerus came southeast from the country of the chauci to central germany the roman sentries bristled like angry dogs when they spotted arminius varus might enjoy having him around but they didnt only the governors rank kept them from showing how little they enjoyed his company even that wouldnt have sufficed if they were germans in the name of your eagle greetings he called to them he didnt want the romans angry at him now that might ruin everything maybe reminding them that he knew and respected their customs would make them happier he didnt want somebody knifing him in the back while he was walking through the encampment if somebody did he would bet gold against copper that varus never caught the murderer he didnt soften up the romans as much as hed hoped our eagle has its eye on you one sentry snarled the others nodded a couple of them let their hands fall to the hilts of their gladii careful now sigimerus said out of the side of his mouth his lips barely moving i know arminius answered the same way when he addressed the romans again he raised his voice would you please be kind enough to let his excellency the governor know im here if varus knew the legionaries couldnt kill him right here and then claim they hadnt realized who he was and the looks on their faces said they wanted to most reluctantly one of the sentries went back into the encampment may we enter sigimerus asked in his slow halting latin i am not a young man any more i get tired standing out here in the sun he and arminius had practiced at swords not long after sunup if hed been tired then arminius hadnt noticed sigimerus might not be quite so fast or quite so strong as he had been when he was arminius age but he was still fast and strong enough to be dangerous and he knew every trick all his years of fighting had taught him shouts rang out inside mindenum arminius hid a smile his father was probably doing the same thing as he murmured see how much they love you nothing we didnt already know arminius said he raised his voice again may we come in i dont want to harm my fathers health the romans were like germans in respecting their elders and once he and sigimerus got into mindenum the legionaries would have a harder time throwing them out than they would excluding them in the first place but one of the sentries answered lets see what the governors got to say if it were up to me he didnt say what would happen then arminius drew his own conclusions another sentry looked over his shoulder here comes his excellency now the legionaries stiffened to attention they expected their auxiliaries to do the same thing arminius had never seen anything so ridiculous in his life but hed learned the silly pose going along was easier than arguing especially for one lone man facing a ponderous military machine the romans thought all of germany would take the easy road go along and submit to their yoke but the germans were not one lone man they outnumbered the invaders they were more determined than the romans too im more determined than the romans are arminius thought and i can kindle germany i can and i will a stocky figure mounted to the top of the earthen rampart the sun gleamed from the romans bald scalp arminius smiled and waved hail your excellency he called if the smile never reached his eyes quinctilius varus couldnt hope to notice from that distance sigimerus waved too if he didnt smile so broadly he was an older man and carried himself with more dignity arminius hoped varus would think so anyhow and evidently varus did he was at least as old as sigimerus but he wore a smile wider than arminius hail welcome he said i didnt know if wed be lucky enough to see the two of you back here this year here we are sir arminius said may we come into mindenum your men didnt seem to want us to you know how soldiers are varus said and arminius did he was one himself if the roman governor wasnt or didnt think of himself as one why did he hold this position smiling still he went on you certainly have my permission to come in im sure i will want your advice again and again on how best to civilize this province sigimerus growled down deep in his throat arminius gaze flicked over to his father but the older mans expression didnt change and the romans wouldnt have heard him arminius wore his smile like a mask hiding his fury what varus meant by civilizing germany was taking away its character and its freedom always a pleasure to help arminius lied spoken like a roman citizen like the member of the equestrian order you are varus boomed after a moment arminius realized the roman governor wasnt really speaking to him or wasnt speaking to him alone varus was reminding the legionaries that the man outside was a tame german a good german he didnt say anything to or about sigimerus but if the soldiers accepted arminius they wouldnt mind his father arminius drew himself up straight and delivered a clenchedfist roman salute yes let the legionaries see i can ape their customs let them see that im a tame german a good german and when the time comes ill show them just how tame and good i am none of that showed on his face he probably had more practice dissembling than any other german since the gods first created his folk among themselves germans were always altogether honest unless of course they saw some pressing reason not to be as segestes had when he broke his pledge to arminius and tried to give thusnelda to tudrus what they thought of as their innate honesty put most of them at a disadvantage when they tried to deal with deceitful foreigners arminius had been shocked to discover that the romans reckoned his folk a pack of lying thieving savages how could they be so blind he finally decided that since the romans were liars and thieves themselves they thought other peoples shared their vices pass in arminius pass in sigimerus quinctilius varus said loudly if the sentries tried to go against that now they would be mutinying against the provincial governor indirectly against augustus himself the romans had some fearsome penalties for anyone who dared such a thing any folk that had such penalties was bound to need them one more argument against rome and all its ways legionaries mostly held their faces straight as arminius and sigimerus walked into mindenum they probably wouldnt have done that if they werent under varus eye then again they probably wouldnt have let the two cherusci into mindenum if not for varus orders that one soldier is smiling at us arminius father whispered whats wrong with him arminius got a corneroftheeye glimpse of the roman his father had to mean sure enough the fellow had a broad welcoming smile plastered across his face arminius didnt think the man was putting it on for varus benefit either some of the legionaries must see that the governor is right and that we arent dangerous to rome arminius also spoke quietly but you never could tell whether somebody with a big nose and sharp eyes was eavesdropping he could say what he meant even if he used words that said the exact opposite if you took them the wrong way ah of course sigimerus understood him just fine if a snoopy roman thought he meant something different well that was the chance you took when you listened in on conversations not meant for you several legionaries paced the germans as they walked through the encampment our hounds arminius thought or maybe our keepers he called out to one of them will we stay in the same place we did last summer the roman seemed embarrassed at being noticed arminius wondered why the only way he could have made himself more obvious was to paint himself blue after a moment the man recovered enough to answer yes i think so all right thanks arminius hadnt really expected anything else as hed seen in pannonia and here roman camps varied little from one place to another or from one time to another if the legionaries had put them there last year chances were theyd do the same thing again it was boring it gave ordinary men no room to deviate from the pattern but it worked the romans wouldnt have conquered so much of the world if it hadnt they always camped the same way they always fought the same way too if you offered them battle on ground where they could do what they usually did chances were theyd make you regret it no one could doubt that the germans were the fiercest fighters the gods ever made but the roman legions had given them all they wanted and then some for a generation now we need to fight them on our own terms then if we can arminius thought that same notion had spun round and round inside his head ever since he came back from pannonia like so many things it was easier to imagine than to bring off as his father hadnt tired of reminding him but quinctilius varus really did think he was a tame german that was bound to help would it help enough xiv quinctilius varus paused halfway through his latest report to augustus he knew he sounded as hopeful as things in germany could possibly allow and then a little more besides when you were writing to the ruler of the roman world you didnt want to have to tell him things werent going well even a man married to augustus grandniece could spill his career in the chamber pot if he forgot that and if after varus returned to civilization anyone asked him whyhed seemed so optimistic he could point to the reports hed got from subordinates all over germany hed kept every single one of them dating back to the day hed first crossed the rhine and hed based his optimism squarely on theirs he started to write again then paused with the reed pen only a digit above the papyrus damnation he muttered of course he made everything in germany seem good to augustus whether it really was good or not quite so good wouldnt his own underlings do the same thing with him they would if they thought they could get away with it he was sure of that they wouldnt want him breathing down their necks any more than he wanted augustus breathing down his but he had to accept their reports how else was he supposed to know what was going on you could travel all over the province and see for yourself he thought but he was shaking his head as soon as the idea formed in his mind if he spent all his time on horseback and in the sorry camps legionary detachments built for themselves while patrolling the german wilderness how was he supposed to administer the land between the rhine and the elbe he saw no way but he didnt like having to depend on reports he couldnt check aristocles he called yes sir as usual the pedisequus appeared with commendable haste id like to speak with ceionius for a bit fetch him if youd be so kind some romans would have said varus wasted politeness on a slave but a little honey made the gruel more appetizing it wasnt as if politeness cost anything ill bring him directly aristocles hurried away while varus waited he wrote a little more of the report some inspiration seemed to have oozed out of him but he persisted even so augustus expected to be informed on how germany was doing and what augustus expected augustus got more than a generation of his rule had proved that if aristocles couldnt find ceionius if he brought lucius eggius back instead varus wouldnt be very happy about that the two camp prefects were as different as chalk and cheese you could reason with ceionius while eggius curse him was as stubborn as crossgrained as any man ever born he didnt have nearly enough respect for his betters to the governors relief his slave returned with ceionius hail your excellency the prefect said saluting what do you need today i expect youll know ah reliable centurions in most of the detachments weve got wandering through germany varus said lucius eggius might not have caught his drift ceionius did leaning forward and lowering his voice he asked reliable in what way sir if some of their superiors are trying to gild lead in their reports thats something i should hear about dont you think varus said by the camp prefects vulpine expression he did think so its something i ought to hear about too ceionius murmured he nodded thoughtfully yes sir im sure i can find centurions like that quietly letting them know what you need will take a bit of doing but i can manage it i thought you might be able to varus said the more ways we have to learn whats really going on the better and as you say best to do it under the rose ill get right on it sir off the top of my head i can think of three or four men whod be perfect sketching another salute ceionius hurried away aristocles had listened as discreetly as if he were part of the tent canvas not bad sir not bad at all he said who knows whether these field commanders truly are doing all the wonderful things they claim varus said if some of them are lying and i can show they are that will make all of them tighten up just so aristocles dipped his head in agreement do you need anything else from me right now sir no you may go varus said the pedisequus vanished as smoothly and quickly as hed manifested himself varus attacked his report for augustus with renewed vigor he might not tell claudia pulchras greatuncle things werent perfect here but at least he could come closer to the truth himself varus paused once more muttering to himself he was setting spies on his subordinates now to make sure they did what they told him they were doing he was a good enough administrator realistically though the empire had plenty of others just as capable even if they didnt enjoy his connections augustus now had long since proved he was one of a kind no one else could run things the way he did that being so wouldnt he have had men quietly keeping an eye on varus and germany all along what were they saying how well did they think rome was doing here if they thought varus was botching things would he suddenly get a letter recalling him to italy would i be sorry if i did varus wondered he would be sorry augustus judged hed failed he would be especially sorry if augustus shipped him to an island in the middle of the sea but would he be sorry to get out of germany no he said firmly with a sigh he reinked the pen and started writing again lucius eggius watched the old german come out of his village and approach the legionary detachment eggius kept his hand on his swordhilt even if this fellow was graying and balding you never could tell with germans but the native held up his right hand with the palm out to show it was empty hail romans he called in fair latin come ahead if you like we have no quarrel with you thanks eggius answered can you feed us some the german said we are not rich this is not a large village either but we will give you what we can they would try to hold out on the legionaries lucius eggius had heard that song often enough to know all the verses well his men had got plenty of practice at squeezing out more than the barbarians felt like giving and if the germans didnt like it too bad we will take what you can give eggius said aloud several of his men grinned a few of them chuckled theyd take anything else they thought they needed too again what could the locals do about it come be welcome the old man said he wasnt going out of his way to make trouble anyhow eggius wished the locals were this reasonable more often as soon as he got into the village he figured out why nobody here felt like getting uppity the place held plenty of women and girls of all ages but only a handful of men between fifteen and fifty youths with downy cheeks yes fogeys like this fellow who spoke latin yes in between no where are your warriors eggius asked bluntly if they thought they could ambush his detachment theyd be sorry but not for long and he had plenty of hostages if it came to that but the old german pointed northwest there is trouble with the chauci may the gods cover their backsides with boils eggius had to hide a grin sure as sure the native had learned his latin from legionaries and so they go off to fight good luck to them eggius said hed fought the chauci himself and hadnt enjoyed the experience even for germans they were rough tough and nasty i hope they help cut those buggers down to size he meant every word of that if the germans fought among themselves they did the legions work for them every german some other german killed was a german the romans didnt have to worry about it will be as the gods decide but after a moment the barbarian added any gods who would favor the chauci over our tribe dont deserve the sacrifices we give them there you go eggius said as the german ambled off quinctilius varus wont be sorry to hear the savages are squabbling one of his aides said in a low voice i was thinking the same thing the camp prefect answered for once i wont have to make up pretty stories when i write to him you dont do much of that the junior officer said loyally no more than i can help eggius agreed if i told him what things were really like in this godsforsaken province hed sack me not that id mind getting back to the real world who would by venus pretty pink nipples but i hate to walk away from a job before its finished women mostly women too old to be interesting and youths brought out barley mush and beer eggius politely suggested that they kill some pigs too he would have got less polite had they said no but they didnt the savory smell of roasting pork made spit flood into his mouth some soldiers said meat made them slow hed never felt that way himself he eyed the graybeard whod come out to greet the romans you fed us pretty well i will say he allowed we dont want trouble right now the german said right now eggius wondered but probing what was likely just a slip of the tongue would only stir up trouble he didnt think it would tell him anything he didnt already know he teased the barbarian instead so youre finally getting used to the notion of living inside the empire eh the german looked back at him with eyes suddenly as cold and pale and flat as a sheet of ice of course he said you lying bastard lucius eggius thought but the natives here didnt have to like anything about submitting to rome they just had to do it if they kept doing it long enough their grandchildren would like it fine and eggius full belly told him they were getting used to doing it rain drummed down on mindenum the romans squelching along the encampments muddy puddled streets swore at the miserable weather arminius had to work hard not to laugh at them they were used to winter rains hed seen that in pannonia which had weather like germanys spring and summer could be wet there as they so often were here the romans arrogant as usual thought the pattern they were used to was the only natural one thinking that way only made them hate northern weather even more than they would have otherwise one of the legionaries twisted his fingers into the horned gesture they used against the evil eye if hed aimed it at arminius the german would have had to start a fight to salve his own honor but the soldier shot his hand up at the sky he might have been telling the gods they had no business letting it rain at this time of year they wouldnt listen to him no matter what he thought rain in spring and summer was no prodigy not in germany it happened all the time the gods wouldnt stop it on one romans account he reminded arminius of a yappy little dog barking at his betters no the gods wouldnt heed him but they might they just might remember hed been rude a wagon train came into the encampment supplies fetched from the headwaters of the lupia if men had trouble getting through the mud heavy wheeled wagons had far more the wheels only tore up the ground worse the oxen hauling the wains struggled forward one slow stride at a time the soldiers guarding the wagon train had to shoulder wagons forward whenever they bogged down by the mud soaking the men theyd already done a lot of shouldering most excellent arminius that precise fussy voice belonged to aristocles sure enough here came varus chief slave he was fussy about his person too and looked even more unhappy at going out in the rain than most of the romans did what can i do for you today arminius asked he treated the skinny greek as politely as if aristocles were free you had to do that with prominent romans prominent slaves your life wouldnt be worth living if you didnt some of them ran their masters rather than the other way around that would never have happened among germans slaves here knew their place if they forgot it a clout in the teeth reminded them what was what the governor wishes to confer with you aristocles said he could be polite too arminius had no trouble imagining what varus had told aristocles go fetch the german he would have said or perhaps more likely go fetch the barbarian he wouldnt have cared whether his slave honeycoated the message or not but aristocles did i am always pleased to confer with the governor arminius replied he can give me orders as long as im stuck in this terrible encampment so many things the german and the greek werent saving arminius wondered if aristocles heard them nonetheless he watched the pedisequus flinch delicately as rain poured down on him that almost made him laugh a german who minded getting wet would soon go mad besides arminius could always pull his cloak up over his head he didnt bother here impressing aristocles counted for more this weather leaves much to be desired the greek said arminius only shrugged its often like this here he said which was nothing but the truth but you say its better north of the hills aristocles asked is that what the governor wants to talk about trying to hide his sudden excitement arminius parried question with question he doesnt tell me such things the slave sniffed aristocles go find arminius and bring him to me thats what he said arminius smiled that was close to what hed imagined all right striking a pose even in the rain aristocles continued i found you so now ill bring you so you will arminius agreed he followed the greek back to varus tent if he was going to be seen as a proper roman friend and ally he had to act like one no matter how it made his stomach churn once under thick canvas he shook himself like a dog water sprayed every which way aristocles squawked some of it got him in the eye what did you go and do that for he said to dry off before i see the governor arminius answered as hed guessed mentioning varus calmed aristocles down all the same arminius added sorry if you were going to act like a friend and ally you did have to act like one curse it aristocles hurried off no doubt to tell varus hed done his duty arminius could hear his voice but couldnt make out what he was saying the folds of cloth muffled words then the slave came back this way he said as quinctilius varus so often was he was writing something when aristocles ushered arminius into his presence your excellency arminius said and waited for the governors pleasure varus set down the pen with every sign of relief he got up from behind the folding table he was using for a desk high roman officers in pannonia had almost identical tables the empire expected its commanders to read and write which had always struck arminius as strange but he didnt need to dwell on it now varus advanced on him with every sign of pleasure and clasped his hand in a grip firm enough to remind him the romans were no weaklings even if they did care too much about their precious letters welcome welcome three times welcome varus said and then to aristocles why dont you bring us some wine we havent got any sir not till they unload this convoy just coming in aristocles answered arminius learned a couple of latin phrases he hadnt heard before then varus heaved a sigh with the air of a man sacrificing on the altar of friendship he said well bring us some beer then yes sir aristocles said and sensibly not another word arminius minded beer not at all why should he when hed drunk it since he was weaned before he could say as much varus spoke first this ghastly weather were lucky the wagons got here at all yes sir arminius said it too he suddenly wished he hadnt shaken off some of the rain he wanted he needed to remind varus how wet it was here he swallowed his sigh too late to fret about it now and varus went on you must love it too youre soaked rain happens at this season in these parts arminius said evidently he still looked soggy we go on as best we can it is better on the far side of the hills not perfect maybe but better he didnt want the roman to expect too much especially since there was no real difference in the weather up there it couldnt be much worse varus muttered arminius didnt think that was true near the sea it was definitely cloudier and rainier with fogs that sometimes lasted all day even in summer but varus didnt need to hear such things aristocles returned he served the beer with as much ceremony as if it were finest falernian arminius raised his mug in salute to varus health your excellency your health varus echoed they drank it was arminius thought plenty good beer the roman governor sipped gamely he didnt screw up his face the way his folk often did after tasting beer ive certainly had worse he said nothing wrong with beer arminius said not so sweet as wine maybe but nothing wrong with it barbarian quinctilius varus didnt silently mouth the word aristocles did arminius was more amused than affronted aristocles looked down his nose at romans too to him anyone who wasnt a greek was a barbarian the romans had conquered his folk and ruled them for lifetimes he himself was a romans slave as much his chattel as the writing table details only details they dented his conceit not at all quinctilius varus drank again and again managed not to wince you must tell me more about the route we would take if we went north of your hills a bad rain just as we were on our way to the river on the old route could ruin us wed bog down in the mire and the wild germans might swoop down and cause us no end of trouble they do not understand that they and their children and their childrens children will be better off under roman rule arminius said he didnt understand any such thing either but varus didnt need to know that yet the roman governor beamed at him thats just it they dont well theyll come to see as time passes gaul needed a while to get used to things but the people there are happy enough now i believe it sir arminius wasnt lying germans had a low opinion of gauls his folk had thumped them time after time till the romans reached the rhine and worse crossed it if he could do what he wanted to do to varus legions he didnt intend to stop there how many troops would the romans have left along the rhine after a disaster in the heart of germany enough to stop a triumphant army blazing with righteous rage and hungry for all the good things romans and gauls enjoyed arminius didnt think so speak to my military secretaries varus told him describe the route you have in mind in as much detail as you can tell them of the distances involved and of ways to keep the legions supplied on the march if what youve been talking about seems at all feasible to the secretaries to the crows with me if we wont try it on the way home this year your excellency i will obey you as if i were your own son arminius said varus eyes went soft and misty arminius realized hed come out with just the right thing the roman had talked about his son before and how arminius reminded him of the young man under most circumstances arminius would have taken that for an insult not praise as a matter of fact he still did but it was an insult he could use anything anything at all to make varus trust him there stood mindenum an island of roman order and discipline in the middle of germany segestes eyed the encampments ramparts from perhaps a mile away by the gods i dont know why im bothering to do this he said mournfully that fat bald fool wont listen to me masua gave him a sidelong glance i know why youre bothering his retainer said youre a roman citizen youre a friend and ally of the romans if you walk away from a promise you made what kind of friend and ally are you not the kind youd want to be segestes grunted well youre right but it seems to me that this stupid roman is walking away from me why hed want to listen to godscursed arminius maybe he wants to stick it up his ass masua said everybody knows the romans enjoy those games but segestes shook his head varus likes women he likes german women in fact all the gossip from mindenum and vetera says so i suppose the ones he got used to in rome seem little and skinny next to ours no he doesnt want to bugger arminius but he doesnt see that hes being played for a fool either i dont know why not but he doesnt hed better wake up pretty soon or hell land in more trouble than he knows what to do with masua said thats why im here why were here to wake him up weve got to try segestes sighed again come on we cant very well turn around after weve come this far high summer hung over the land warm and muggy the birds that had sung so sweetly in springtime were silent now theyd found their mates and were raising families so they didnt need to sing any more thinking of mates and families made segestes think of thusnelda his right hand tightened on the spear he carried everywhere his left folded into a fist he would have warned varus against arminius even if arminius hadnt stolen his daughter of course i would he told himself and varus might have been probably would have been more ready to listen to him if arminius hadnt sneaked off with thusnelda latin had a word for that irony segestes hadnt understood the notion till this happened to him he would gladly have gone without the language lesson they see us masua said well theyd better segestes replied with a snort if they fall asleep on the ramparts they wont need arminius to make them sorry they were ever born a legionary cupped his hands and shouted who comes i am segestes a citizen of rome segestes shouted back with me comes my friend masua also a roman citizen the soldiers put their heads together segestes realized he was as welcome as a hornet hed known he wasnt in good odor among the romans but hadnt realized things were this bad after a bit a legionary seemed to remember he was there wait the fellow called and then went back to the colloquy segestes perforce waited time stretched time in fact dragged what were they doing sending to varus to find out if hed deign to let in a couple of germans standing there in the warm sunshine segestes decided they were doing just that at last another legionary waved to him well come on then the roman said grudgingly thank you for your gracious kindness segestes had learned enough from the romans to appreciate irony his own stab at it slid off the soldier like rain off the oily feathers of a goose if they try and search us by the gods im going to break some heads masua said like segestes he carried a sword and a dagger along with his spear they wont segestes sounded more confident than he felt an insult like that would turn even me against them and they have to know it the legionaries had to know yes but did they have to care by all the signs quinctilius varus cared very little for segestes feelings these days the sentries huddled again segestes would have bet they were wondering whether to frisk him and masua but when the huddle broke one of them said pass on through thank you segestes repeated this time more sincerely he didnt want a row at the gate but he too had his pride he had more than masua did truth to tell his comrade was a man of his sworn band but he was a chief if he let the romans rob him of his pride what did he have left nothing and he knew it all too well fortunately the issue didnt arise how many roman encampments had he visited in his time a great plenty of them he knew that even vetera across the rhine still plainly showed it had grown from a camp and mindenum was one more they varied in size depending on how many men they had to hold but they were all made to the same pattern once youd learned your way around one you could find what you wanted in any of them here segestes found something he didnt want coming up the straight street toward him and masua was sigimerus arminius father and segestes were about of an age a little old to fight at the front of a battle line but both seasoned warriors they stiffened segestes lowered his spear a little but only a little inside the camp sigimerus wasnt carrying a spear his sword came halfway out of its sheath but no more than halfway sigimerus greeted him you swinehound you son of a swinehound better a swinehounds son than a swinehounds father segestes retorted if i thought you were worth killing id kill you now men better than you have tried sigimerus said ravens and badgers tore them once they were dead while i still live i have killed too segestes said after so many one more especially a nithing like you is easy you cant do so you talk arminius father jeered you know more about idle talk than i ever will segestes retorted romans gathered to watch the confrontation they grinned and nudged one another segestes knew what they were doing betting on who would come out alive or on whether anyone would germans would have done the same thing also seeing that masua said you make a spectacle for them i know segestes answered he raised his voice to sigimerus let us go by i didnt come here to kill you no matter how much you deserve it no only to spit poison into the roman governors ear but sigimerus let his sword slide back down till the blade was out of sight well come ahead why not no matter how many lies you tell varus wont listen to you segestes feared that was true it had been true every other time he tried to open varus eyes but what kind of friend to rome was he if he didnt make the effort either you know nothing of lies or you know too much he said any man with his wits about him can guess which too he started forward masua a pace behind him and a pace to the left ready to guard his flank slowly and deliberately as if to show himself no coward sigimerus stepped out of their path watch yourself masua said loudly he may stab you in the back i dont waste treachery on weasels like you two sigimerus said no you must save it for the romans then segestes said sigimerus haughtily turned his back anywhere but here segestes would have attacked him for that offensive arrogance he made himself walk by instead varus wouldnt hearken to him if he killed arminius father he knew that too well the governor occupied what would have been the generals tent in any other encampment segestes had expected nothing different that was where the highestranking officer posted himself for better and for worse the romans were a predictable folk hail segestes hail masua said varus greek slave segestes took it as a good sign that the man remembered his comrades name he took it as another when aristocles continued the governor will see you without delay we thank you segestes had wondered whether varus would try ignoring him without seeming to keep putting him off with excuses each plausible by itself but all together adding up to i want nothing to do with you no german would play that kind of game a german who didnt care to see him would come straight out and say so but segestes had enough experience of romans to know they could be sneakily rude not today though as promised aristocles led segestes and masua straight to quinctilius varus the slave managed to disappear the moment segestes took his eye off him segestes wished he hadnt for one look at varus face told the german hed done no good coming to mindenum what can you possibly tell me now that you have not told me time and time again the roman governor demanded his voice as cold and cutting as sleet i could tell you you would have done better to listen to me before segestes said your excellency varus flushed he understood that what should have been a title of respect became one of reproach i do not believe that to be the case he snapped if no the more fool you masua said in his halting latin varus did pretend he wasnt there speaking only to segestes the roman said i am afraid you have wasted your time and are wasting mine will you say the same sir after i tell you warriors are gathering on the route arminius wants you to use segestes returned i have had no report of this not from friendly germans and not from romans either varus said i am not surprised segestes said it would be worth most germans lives to inform on your precious arminius now i know for a fact it has already been worth some honest germans lives and as for your legions your excellency this is not their fatherland they see what people want them to see they hear what people want them to hear past that he shook his head we are not so blind nor so deaf as you seem to think varus sounded as haughty as sigimerus you are not so wise as you seem to think cither segestes said i shall have to be the judge of that varus said i do not believe you wish me ill segestes i would not leave you at liberty if i did but i do believe you have become altogether unreasonable about anything that has to do with arminius i believe you will blacken his name on any pretext or none and so as much as i regret to say it i do not believe you segestes stood half a heartbeat later so did masua you may think you regret to say it now segestes told varus the day will come and i fear it will come soon when you regret it in good earnest soothsaying the roman governor asked sardonically if you please segestes answered but a man does not need to read entrails to know a hanging stone will smash whatever lies below it when it falls at last good day your excellency may your days be long they will be longer if you see you cannot trust arminius but i cannot make you do that only you can lift the veil from your eyes i do not believe there is any such veil varus said yes i know segestes nodded sadly a fool never believes he is a fool a cuckold never believes his wife opens her legs for another man but whether you believe or not others do by the gods farewell segestes quinctilius varus said his tone even more frigid than before farewell sir segestes replied if we meet again in a years time you may laugh in my face i will bow my head and suffer it as best i may i look forward to it varus said believe it or not your excellency so do i segestes left with the last word he could have done without it xv heat came to germany but seldom when it did as on this stifling latesummer day it came with a thick blanket of humidity such as mediterranean lands never knew sweating itching scratching swearing legionaries tore mindenum to pieces gods i hope we never have to do this shitty job again one of them said sure and then you wake up another roman said with a scornful laugh we build em we take em down then we build em one more time quinctilius varus nodded as he watched the legionaries work that was what they were for all right they were beasts of burden more clever and versatile than mules or oxen but beasts of burden all the same well i hope the stupid fucking governor makes up his stupid fucking mind one of these years the first soldier said sure and then you wake up the other man repeated this time they both laughed the way men will when theres really nothing to laugh about but the only other choice is to go on swearing somebody behind varus laughed too the governor whirled angrily aristocles face was as innocent as if hed never heard anything funny in his life arminius and sigimerus also might have been carved from mirthless marble varus fumed his ears burning sometimes even a man of exalted rank could look ridiculous in front of his inferiors he pulled himself together well be ready to march soon he told arminius yes sir so i see the german said your men always do everything very smoothly roman efficiency varus said not without pride i expect well show you more of it on the march oh so do i arminius replied and i thank you for finally taking me up on the route i offered you tall wetlooking anvilheaded clouds drifted across the sky the sun played hideandseek behind them but the day got no cooler no less muggy when it disappeared for a few minutes two days earlier some of those clouds had let loose in a thunderstorm the likes of which varus had seldom seen for all he knew they might do it again any time when the legions were on the move for instance if the weather is better drier farther north thats the way we want to go he said arminius nodded oh yes it almost always is he nudged his father and spoke to him in their guttural tongue thus prompted sigimerus also nodded weather better ja he said in his dreadful latin the last word wasnt really but it was one of the handful varus had learned from the germans language you will see the country i spring from arminius was far more fluent far more civilized when you got right down to it oh joy one more bloody fleabitten pesthole in a land packed full of them aristocles said for a moment varus wondered why arminius didnt draw his sword and try to cut the insolent slave in half then he realized the pedisequus had spoken with a straight face and mild tones and much more to the point had spoken in greek to varus with his fancy education and years of service in the east it was as natural as latin to a rude german though it would only be noises now now varus said also in greek its his such as it is only natural for him to be proud of it a swallow must be proud of a nest of sticks and mud aristocles retorted that doesnt mean i want to go out of my way to visit arminius looked from one of them to the other when neither offered to translate the german shrugged his broad shoulders maybe he wondered if they were talking about him behind his back so to speak if he did he didnt look angry about it the way varus thought a barbarian would be bound to do clang a legionary threw an iron tripod into a wagon the romans would bury more iron but not where arminius or any other german could watch them do it they didnt want the savages digging up the metal and hammering it into spearheads and sword blades things did go smoothly and why not the soldiers tore mindenum down every year at this time theyd had plenty of practice by now would they still wreck it at the end of summer twenty years from now or would they stay here around the year by then to garrison a peaceful province if they dont varus thought i havent done my job that led to another thought if i dont do my job what will augustus do to me varus had already brooded about some of those possibilities disgrace exile a desert island miles and miles from anything but another desert island even if he escaped all those failure would bring augustus disapproval down on him and augustus disapproval was colder than any blizzard on the rhine id better not fail then he told himself did you ever hear it rains less up on the other side of the hills than it does down here lucius eggius asked ceionius the other camp prefect shook his head no but i never heard it rains more there than it does here either so that should be a wash these germans are like so many syrian figsellers theyll tell any kind of lie to get you to go their way but i think itll work out all right hope so eggius said this stinking trail sure isnt everything it ought to be we had what was almost a proper path not a real road on account of it wasnt paved but a path anyhow going straight west from mindenum this scrawny little thing isnt anything like it its all right as long as were in the meadows i just dont like it when it twists through the woods ceionius returned to his previous theme dont worry about it lucius like i say germans lie all the time do you know what that old fox of a segestes said to blacken arminius name while you were out on patrol tell me eggius urged he said warriors were heading off to jump us somewhere ceionius laughed id like to see em try i wouldnt eggius wasnt laughing i passed through a bunch of halfempty villages and steadings this summer the old men whod stayed behind claimed their fighters were off getting ready to go to war against the chauci if they were getting ready to go to war against us instead you always were more jittery than you need to be ceionius said ive got more experience with the germans than you do lucius eggius replied no such thing as being too jittery around them they always try to come up with sneaky new ways to screw us over id better talk to varus he wont listen ceionius predicted that struck eggius as much too likely even so he said id better dont say i didnt warn you ceionius warned him as he booted his horse forward a stubborn man eggius nodded and pressed on he had a demon of a time catching up to varus the trail did dive into a forest tree trunks pressed close on either side marching legionaries could hardly squeeze in close to make way for him no matter how he shouted and swore regardless of his rank they swore back at him there was the governors greek slave up on his donkey and there was quinctilius varus himself laughing and joking with arminius eggius was no courtier but even he could see this wasnt the time to beard varus as well tell a man his dog killed ducks while the beast was licking its masters hand eggius sat his horse between two massive oaks till ceionius finally came up ceionius eyed him you didnt say anything thats right eggius admitted how could i he had arminius right there with him you think he would have paid any attention to me no ceionius couldnt help adding told you so ahhh but eggius didnt say anything about the other officers mother you could do that with a close friend but ceionius wasnt one he might think eggius meant it and things could end in blood if he did maybe ill try again later eggius said sure ceionius didnt believe a word of it since eggius didnt either he couldnt even call him on it arminius wanted to caper like a colt he wanted to dance for joy the romans were doing exactly what he wanted them to do if not for the training in duplicity theyd given him he might have betrayed himself he couldnt believe things were going this well the only person he could talk to was his father and then only in tiny whispers at night in their tent just dont get too excited thats all sigimerus said it may not work as well as you hope i know arminius answered believe me i know but it may too and if it does by the gods worry about it then in his own way sigimerus was as practical as a roman in the meantime get some sleep most of the time arminius would have had no trouble sleeping what else could you do after the sun set especially without a warm friendly woman to keep you awake for a while he could hear legionaries snoring in the encampment he could hear mosquitoes buzzing crickets chirping and sentries exchanging password and countersign as they patrolled the rampart theyd built a few hours earlier yes romans were hard to surprise curse them a couple of days later chariomerus rode up as the legionaries were readying the nights camp arminius clansmate clasped hands with him and with sigimerus what are you doing here arminius asked the other german he was ever so conscious of the listening legionaries and hoped chariomerus was too the wrong words even in their own language could mean disaster when you left for mindenum you left thusnelda with child chariomerus said sigimerus allowed himself a rare smile i shall be a grandfather he exclaimed if the gods grant it chariomerus said the confinement has been rough the midwife is worried about thusnelda she fears her hips may be too narrow for an easy delivery and thusnelda wants nothing more than to see you again arminius i would be there soon enough anyhow arminius said frowning the governor counts on me to show him the way north and west go to your woman son sigimerus said i am here i can bring the romans along as well as you can ive known the way longer than youve been alive he used his own tongue as he almost always did the legionaries would have wondered why he suddenly started spouting latin with his son and the other german some of them would follow what he was saying now regardless of the language he used i promised his excellency that id do it arminius said go talk with him take chariomerus with you let him tell the governor what he just told you varus will give you leave to go home he is a fine man an understanding man sigimerus spoke with a perfectly straight face arminius admired his father he hadnt thought the older man could act so well he had to hide his own admiration the romans shouldnt see it dipping his head he said i will do as you say come on chariomerus arminius wasnt surprised when aristocles greeted him with this must be your fellow tribesman outside of varus tent news flashed through a legionary encampment quick as lightning as it did through a german village just so arminius introduced chariomerus to him then went on he brings news from my home we need to speak of it with his excellency let me find out if he can see the two of you the greek slave said chariomerus looked worried arminius reassured him with his eyes aristocles always said things like that they made him seem important but arminius was confident varus would meet with him and chariomerus sure enough when the pedisequus came back he beckoned them on without another word maybe someone could have made something of chariomerus relieved grin but arminius didnt think so anybody would take it to mean that chariomerus was glad he wouldnt have to waste his time standing around outside if arminius hadnt known the circumstances he would have taken it that way himself so your womans got a bulging belly eh quinctilius varus said after arminius presented chariomerus to him and told him the news yes sir arminius replied the roman had a bulging belly too but only because he made a glutton of himself arminius went on my clansmate tells me she worries about her health so does the midwife and so thusnelda wants to see me id like to see her too there is the matter of guiding us along your muchpraised route to the rhine varus said my father will stay behind with you and the legions sir arminius said he told me himself that he knows the way better than i do he smiled you know what fathers are like that proved a mistake mouth twisting varus shook his head not of my own experience my father passed away when i was quite young more to himself than to arminius he added he always clung to his ideals even in the midst of civil war and he paid for it i am sorry your excellency i did not know arminius said chariomerus murmured sympathetically thank you both you are kind varus said you may go arminius if your uh thusnelda has a boychild i hope father and son will know each other for many years you leave me in your debt sir arminius knew how he intended to repay varus too he eagerly looked forward to it and yet in an odd way he meant what he said he didnt hate varus for anything the roman had done but because varus was a roman for a german who wanted to see his land free that was reason enough and more varus wrote something on a scrap of papyrus here give this to the sentries they will pass you out with no fuss thanks again whatever shame arminius might have felt he made a point of stifling it he and chariomerus bowed their way out of the governors presence chariomerus started to say something in their own language arminius sharply shook his head to his relief his comrade took the point and kept quiet to have some sneaky roman understand inopportune words now when things were coming together arminius shook his head again if the plans hed spent so long laying fell apart because of something like that it would be too much to bear well it wouldnt happen the pass did help him and chariomerus leave the camp easily as varus had promised the sentries didnt fuss at all the two germans rode away out in the free land again chariomerus exulted arminius didnt reprove him not when they were out of earshot and bowshot of the legionary encampment soon the whole land will be free again arminius said very soon the middle of germany three legions no one dared approach the romans or challenge them anyone foolish enough to dare would have died either quickly and unpleasantly or slowly and unpleasantly depending on the soldiers mood but having all the legionaries gathered together in one long sinewy column reminded lucius eggius that everything around them was enemy country whenever they passed by a steading or through a village it seemed almost empty of warriors of course most german steadings and villages seemed almost empty of everybody the barbarians didnt want to meet the legionaries and make friends with them had an army of germans come tramping through italy italian peasants wouldnt have hung around to greet them either peasants and soldiers were oil and water eggius and quinctilius varus were oil and water too the camp prefect knew it all the same he caught up to varus the morning after arminius rode out of camp and said talk with you for a little while your excellency you seem to be doing it varus answered coolly er right eggius had guessed this wouldnt go well now he saw how right he was even so he plunged on i sure hope that segestes fellow didnt know what he was talking about when he said the germans were getting ready to jump us oh of course he didnt quinctilius varus went from cool to irritable in less time than it took to tell eggius sighed yes sir you couldnt come out and tell a governor he had his head up his but oh by the gods how you wished you could since eggius couldnt he continued we still shouldnt take any chances we dont have to better to worry too much and not need to than to need to and not worry i have nothing against the customary precautions do we neglect our encampments do we forget to post sentries varus said no sir but i was just thinking maybe we shouldnt have come this way at all there eggius got it out and it did no good the governor stared at him do you want to turn around and go back for what amounts to no reason at all might be safer if we did eggius said varus stared at him as if he were something sticky and stinky on a sandal sole yes i suppose it might if you believe arminius to be a traitor and segestes an honest man do you believe that eggius to the crows with you if you do eggius the camp prefect could hear what varus wasnt saying as well as what he was picking his own words with care lucius eggius replied sir i dont like taking chances any which way if we dont have to i dont think we ought to well i dont think we are varus said and that settles it how right he was when the governor of a roman province decided something the only man who could overrule him was augustus and augustus was in no position to overrule varus about this even on the unlikely assumption that he would legions xvii xviii and xix were stuck with varus decision eggius just had to hope the governor was right vala numonius was waiting to see the governor when lucius eggius left varus presence everything seems to be going well enough the cavalry commander remarked eggius eyed him with something close to loathing easy for you to say he growled if things get buggered up you and your boys can gallop off the rest of us were just in for it do you think wed do that do you vala numonius sounded deeply affronted were all in this together and theres no reason to worry about any fighting the germans are as peaceful as theyve ever been too peaceful eggius said his excellency isnt worrying enough if you ask me i didnt im sure the governor didnt either numonius said pointedly have you been dropping your own worries in his lap if you havent i will that was what he had to mean eggius glared at him then shrugged say whatever you cursed well please he answered he wont hear anything from you that he hasnt heard from me maybe hell even listen to you i can sure hope so numonius edged past him as if afraid he had something catching lucius eggius knew too well he didnt if the truth were contagious it would have spread more the cavalry commander was more likely to spread good oldfashioned slander i hope everything is all right sir aristocles said as eggius stormed out of varus tent so do i eggius answered i wouldnt bet more than a copper on it though clouds piled up in the northwest tall and thick and dark the wind blew them toward the marching romans quinctilius varus nostrils flared if that wasnt the wetdust odor of rain on the way hed never smelled it curse it arminius had told him rain wasnt so likely in these parts varus looked around before remembering the german was off seeing to thusnelda then varus looked for sigimerus he didnt see arminius father either he did see aristocles who as usual rode his donkey instead of a horse and the greek slave saw him too ah your excellency he said as insolently as a man could use an honorific what is it varus snapped he could hear the testiness in his own voice as hed known aristocles would the pedisequus pointed out the obvious i hate to say it your excellency but it looks like rain if you hate to say it then keep your miserable mouth shut varus growled im sorry sir aristocles didnt seem to know whether to sound scared or hurt quinctilius varus sighed owning a man holding his life in your hands could make you feel pretty big it could also make you feel pretty small if you struck at him for something that wasnt remotely his fault sighing again varus said nothing you can do about the weather nothing anybody can do about it worse luck thats true sir aristocles was nothing if not relieved if varus felt like striking out at him what could he do about it nothing as he had to know too well after looking around again the roman governor felt his frown deepen have you seen sigimerus lately the slaves neck twisted as he too looked this way and that no sir i havent hes got to be somewhere though everybodys got to be somewhere this time varus looked up to the heavens the clouds were darker and closer the smell of rain more distinct unhappily he clicked his tongue between his teeth but where the demon is sigimerus right now aristocles made as if to peer inside his belt pouch which drew a snort from varus i havent got him the greek said well neither have i varus looked around one more time no still no sign of sigimerus he called to one of the roman cavalrymen riding nearby find me arminius father i need to talk to him yes sir the rider sketched a salute he told off two or three other horsemen of lower rank they worked their way forward and back through the long column calling sigimerus name thatll flush him out aristocles might have been talking about a partridge hiding in the brush or given how carnivorous sigimerus seemed a sharpclawed wildcat rather than a helpless harmless hapless bird varus heard legionaries shouting sigimerus louder and louder and more and more insistently what he didnt hear was arminius father answering where could he have got to varus said he doesnt seem to be anywhere close by aristocles replied which wasnt what the roman governor wanted to hear a little later the horseman varus had first asked to find sigimerus came back and said the same thing in different words sorry to have to tell you sir but curse me if it doesnt look like the miserable buggers gone and given us the slip but how could he quinctilius varus wave took in the thousands of marching legionaries so many of us only the one of him the cavalryman shrugged stolidly wouldnt have been that hard begging your pardon sir but it wouldnt suppose he goes off into the woods a couple of hours ago if anybody asks him he says hes easing himself or something like that but chances are nobody even cares he doesnt mean anything to ordinary soldiers except for being one more nuisance theyve got to keep an eye on well why didnt they keep enough of an eye on him to notice that he didnt come out of the woods varus demanded the cavalrymans guess struck him as alarmingly probable he got another shrug from the fellow he could figure out what that meant even if the horseman didnt feel like putting it into words he himself might care about sigimerus if for no other reason than that the german was arminius father ordinary romans though wouldnt be sorry if the barbarian disappeared it wouldnt look so bad if hed told you he was going off to keep arminius company aristocles observed one more thing quinctilius varus didnt care to hear shall we beat the bushes for him sir the cavalryman inquired the boysd like that you bet they would more fun than hunting a wild boar or an aurochs even if we couldnt butcher him or roast him over hot coals once we caught him he smiled thinly or maybe we could though we wouldnt eat him after he cooked reluctantly reluctantly enough to surprise himself varus shook his head no better not he said he may still have left for some innocent reason huh the horseman said a syllable redolent of skepticism he may varus insisted and arminius is a true friend he wouldnt stay one if we hunted his father with hounds this time the cavalrymans shrug suggested that he couldnt care less varus was surprised again surprised and dismayed when aristocles shrugged exactly the same way before the roman governor could say anything a drop of water splashed down onto the back of his left hand he stared at it in amazement where could it have come from well you idiot where else but varus looked up at the dark and gloomy heavens another raindrop hit him in the right eye so much for arminius as weather prophet aristocles said brushing at his cheek he did warn me that he couldnt promise varus voice sounded hollow even to himself before long it started to rain in earnest come on arminius called you can do it we can do it and we have to do it fast too german warriors built slabs of turf theyd cut into a concealing protective rampart on a hillside arminius also cut and carried and stacked when he said we he meant it he wasnt asking the men hed called together to do anything he wouldnt do himself he made a point of being very visible as he labored the warriors werent from his small sworn band or his fathers larger one most of them werent even cherusci they would have been battling amongst themselves if he hadnt persuaded them to try to deal with the romans first they might yet and he knew it he had to keep them loyal to him till the legions arrived after that after that he would either be the biggest hero germany had ever known or hed be dead whichever way things turned out he wouldnt have to worry about fractious followers after the fight arminius somebody called he threw his chunk of turf into place and waved a grimy hand here i am theyre coming the german said theyre not far and arminius didnt let him go on he yelled theyre coming himself his voice reached all the working warriors some chieftains had that knack most roman officers did the romans could teach a man how to make his voice bigger arminius had learned the trick from them how the germans cheered suddenly this seemed real to them they could do it they would do it they were less steady than roman legionaries less steady even than roman auxiliaries but they had more fire with the goal plainly there in front of them they would work like men possessed for how long arminius wondered for once the question answered itself for long enough the messenger came up to him theres something more the man said in tones not meant for the rest of the men what is it arminius asked also quietly your father is free of them the other german said he looked back over his shoulder it had started to rain he couldnt see very far but he smiled as he turned towards arminius in fact here he is now father arminius shouted he ran toward sigimerus the two big men embraced sigimerus peered through the raindrops at the growing rampart he pounded arminius on the back i did not think you could bring this off by the gods son i did not and by the gods i own i was wrong we arent finished yet arminius warned you know what they say about pricing the colt before hes born sigimerus went on as if he hadnt spoken theyll come right past here they have to theyve got no other choice none the track leads straight here and if they go off it they go into the swamp into the mud they dont know the secret ways through it and those ways wont let them move that many men either wont let them deploy arminius used the precise latin word this is what weve been looking for all along you found it sigimerus told him you said you had when we went up to talk to the chauci and you were right and this mound rampart again arminius used a latin word in place of a less accurate one from his own language rampart sigimerus agreed indulgently youll stick on leaves and branches and such so they dont know what it is till too late oh yes arminius grinned youre thinking along with me all right you can talk about deploying and ramparts and all that fancy stuff as much as you want his father said just the same youd better remember i was ambushing romans before you were born some people do need a head start arminius sounded as innocent as a child why you miserable puppy but sigimerus started to laugh instead of walloping him im among my own kind again gods it feels good and pretty soon no more romans among us arminius finished for him if everything goes the way it should i mean no he didnt want to price the unborn foal where are your warriors cutting those turves sigimerus asked your warriors arminius didnt answer for a moment savoring that it was as if his father had passed him the jeweled pin that closed a highborn mans cloak pride made his heart swell and almost choked him he had to try twice before he could say over behind the hillock there he pointed we dont want the romans to notice anything wrong you thought of everything sigimerus eyes glowed well ill go back there and cut some myself i want to be part of all of this even if it means fetching and carrying like an ox or an ass ive cut them and carried them too arminius said i feel the same way you do and seeing me work hard makes the rest of the men work harder thats one of the tricks all right his father agreed i hate to sayit but i was some older than you are before i figured it out one more thing i picked up from the romans arminius said anybody knows fighters will follow a strong fighter but in the legions and auxiliaries any officer who works himself no matter at what can get his men to do the same the romans have taught us plenty of lessons sigimerus said now we teach them one they dont belong in our country weve been trying to get it across since i was a little boy this time maybe just one more thing weve got to do arminius said whats that weve got to win xvi from behind caldus caelius came the usual racket of a roman army on the march somewhat muffled by the rains dank plashing legionaries squelched through puddles on the track they were following the ground to either side was worse much worse chainmail clinked faintly like most of the other soldiers caelius had rubbed his mailshirt and helmet with greasy wool that would help hold rust at bay but only so much hed have a lot of scrubbing and polishing to do once the legions got back to vetera ahead through the rain he could see a couple of horses rumps and also the glumlooking cavalrymen atop the animals the way the riders shoulders slumped said they wished they were anywhere but here as a matter of fact caldus caelius felt the same way that german whod served with the auxiliaries over in pannonia had told the governor this part of germany had better weather than mindenum did so scuttlebutt insisted as far as caelius could see the barbarian had sold quinctilius varus a bill of goods it was coming down like a mad bastard caelius stepped into a puddle and went in deeper than hed expected he swore wearily his voice was only one note in a massive grumbling chorus the legionaries would complain marching on a paved road in perfect weather since this was neither they groused and groused water dripped from the visor of his helmet most of the time it didnt drip onto his face every so often though the wind would swing and blow the drips and the rest of the rain into his eyes and into his mouth and onto his nose so he had new drips from the end of it with his feet soaked too chances were hed come down with catarrh just my luck he thought he shook his head as much to look to right and left as to try to get rid of some of the water not much to see in either direction only swamp that was starting to fill up with nasty little puddles he didnt spot any germans he hadnt for some time now part of him was unsurprised they wouldnt have wanted to live in this godsforsaken country either but germany was full much too full of savages hed seen worse terrain packed with big blonds trying to scratch out a living why werent more of them doing the same thing here maybe varus could ask his pet german as soon as that thought crossed caelius mind he shook his head again this time annoyed at himself the accursed german was off dealing with his woman his father had buggered off too nobody quite knew why but it was unsettling the neckguard on caelius helm kept water from dripping down his back he had that chilly unsettling feeling all the same something a little more substantial than usual in this marshy landscape loomed up ahead and to the left a low grassy hillock not just grassy caelius saw as the path brought him closer to it branches and bushes sprouted from it caelius wished he could get a better look but the rain wouldnt let him his mailshirt clattered about him as he shrugged you could find anything in germany why get all hot and bothered about one poorly manicured little hill it looks funny a voice inside him said he told the voice to shut up and go away it wouldnt that hill doesnt look right caldus caelius shrugged again this time in exasperation if anything were wrong the horsemen up ahead would be catching it right now as they rode past and they werent they were riding along wishing they were somewhere else the same way he was marching at least their feet werent soaked somethings wrong the small voice shrilled ignoring it caelius pulled his left foot out of the mud and stuck his right foot into it arminius peered out between two lovingly transplanted bushes roman cavalrymen rode by on their big horses almost near enough for him to reach out and touch them one looked his way he froze the roman looked straight ahead again he hadnt noticed a thing the gods are with us arminius thought jubilantly to make sure they stayed on the germans side he hissed ill kill the man who casts now dyou hear me ill gut him like a swine remember youve got to wait behind the rampart theyd built the german warriors seethed like boiling soup they jumped up and down nerving themselves for the fight ahead they brandished their spears they brandished them yes but nobody threw one they all understood what the plan was and if that wasnt a godsgiven miracle arminius didnt know what would be his own right hand clutched a spearshaft tight enough to whiten his knuckles he was ready himself ready and then some but he too needed to wait this was the one chance hed have he had to remember that if he moved too soon if the romans got a chance to recoil and to fight on ground that gave them any kind of chance in that case who could say when his folk would be able to try again with the odds on their side who could say if they ever would more horsemen rode past and more still the romans were going through the motions of protecting their van but their leaders didnt really believe trouble was anywhere close that attitude rubbed off on the men they were laughing and joking and grumbling about the weather and bragging of what theyd do to the whores once they got back to vetera they werent paying so much attention to what lay around them as they might have the rain did make it harder for them on arminius side of the barricade rose a growing hum and murmur of excitement hed charged every leader here and in the woods off to the right which held even more warriors with keeping his men quiet the chieftains were doing what they could but it wasnt enough arminius fidgeted like a man with the shits killing wasnt near enough for the loudmouthed fool who betrayed his comrades because he couldnt shut up but the romans never twigged the drumming rainfall muffled the noise from the german host truly the gods favor us arminius thought when we conquer we have to give them rich offerings indeed he peered out again the last roman cavalrymen were going by there would be a little gap and then oh and then when someone beside him asked for a wonder the other german didnt look out to see for himself it wasnt roman discipline it wasnt anything close to roman discipline but it was more than arminius could reliably expect from a man of his own blood soon he answered very soon here came the foot sloggers arminius waved the chieftains were supposed to be waiting for that signal they were supposed to ready the fighters whod accompanied them and to pass it on to the men in the woods had arminius been leading legionaries or auxiliaries he would have been confident that what was supposed to happen really would with his own folk he could only hope very soon indeed he could see the roman foot soldiers faces through the rain they looked less lighthearted than the riders and well they might they were doing the work themselves not letting their mounts carry them along as soon as the first rank passed that bush arminius had promised himself that as soon as he came back from his long stretch lulling the roman lulling quinctilius varus in particular idly he wondered how things would have gone had varus not had a son about his age he shrugged i would have found some other way to do what wanted doing he told himself was it true he thought it was which was all that really mattered on came the legionaries closer closer the nearest man in the lead rank had a long chin and a broken nose arminius right arm went back on its own as if freed at last from some unjust imprisonment cast he roared his arm shot forward like an eagle like a gods thunderbolt his spear flew free caldus caelius kept staring at the little rise off to the left of the track it just didnt look the way it should have hed tried getting some of the romans near him to pay more attention to him he hadnt had much luck they didnt want to think about funnylooking landscape all they wanted to do was get through this godsdespised muddy stretch of ground and make tracks for the rhine since that was all he really wanted too how could he blame them when you got right down to it he couldnt somebody shouted something it didnt sound like latin caelius head snapped to the left toward that hillock but the cry sounded closer than the reverse slope should have been he wasnt the only one who heard it what the demon another roman said his hand dropping to the hilt of his gladius something sliced through the air no several somethings no again a swarm of somethings for an instant caelius thought the cry had flushed a flock of birds or perhaps even came from the throat of one of them only for an instant then suddenly horribly he knew exactly what those somethings were and he knew he and all the romans with him had been betrayed the spears reached the top of their arcs some of them clattered together in the air a few knocked spinning fell short but most of them crashed down on the head of the roman column like his comrades caldus caelius marched with his scutum slung over his back the big heavy shield would have been impossibly awkward on his arm it was for battle not travel and so the shields did no good as the spears struck home one of the spears came down not half a cubit in front of caldus caelius foot and stood thrilling in the mud another pierced the thigh of the legionary marching to his left the man stared at the shaft and the spurting blood for a couple of heartbeats more astonished than in pain then reality caught up with amazement he shrieked clutched at the spear and at his leg and crumpled a soldier two men to caldus caelius right took a spear through the throat he made horrible gobbling noises gore pouring from his mouth in place of words then his eyes rolled up in his head and he too slumped to the muck of the track the romans were following in a sense he was lucky he didnt suffer long before oblivion seized him there were plenty of worse ways to go caelius wished he hadnt had that thought how many worse ways would he see before this day died and what sort of end will i find for myself he wondered fearfully he turned to find out how the rest of the soldiers were faring the answer was simple worse than he could have imagined in his most dreadful nightmare that enormous volley of spears had wrecked the head of the column dozens no more likely hundreds maybe even thousands of legionaries were down some mercifully dead more wounded and thrashing and screaming their torment and terror up to the wet uncaring sky the agonized din made him want to stuff his fingers in his ears more cries came from the romans left those werent wails of pain but fierce triumphant bellows the germans realized what theyd done with their shattering volley well they could hardly not realize it could they they might be barbarians but they werent stupid barbarians theyd just proved that by the gods they proved it again a moment later theyd built ways to get up and over the curving rampart that concealed them they dropped down on the near side and loped toward the legionaries and they rushed out of the dark woods next to the rampart joves thunderbolt could not have struck the romans a harder blow than those deadly spears fight caldus caelius yelled shrugging out of his pack and drawing his sword weve got to fight them or theyll slaughter us like sheep deploy form line of battle he wasnt the only legionary shouting orders like that through the wounded soldiers howls and screams here and there romans did their best to obey but the presence of their injured comrades not only demoralized them but also hampered their efforts to form up and as caldus caelius rapidly discovered even if that hadnt been so there was almost nowhere for the romans to deploy when they stepped off the track to the right they sank to their knees in muck the ground to the left was a little better but sloped swiftly upward toward the hillock from which the spears had flown and down which the baying german horde now swarmed along with a few unwounded comrades caelius set himself the legions were ruined even a blind man could sec that the barbarians were going to slaughter every roman they could catch a few legionaries floundered out into the swamp desperate to get away caelius might have done the same thing if it didnt seem so obviously hopeless since it did come on he shouted well make the whoresons pay for our hides anyhow and if he made them kill him in battle it would all be over pretty fast then they wouldnt have the chance to amuse themselves with him at their leisure afterwards something hard caught him in the side of the head a stone a spearshaft the flat of a sword he never knew inside a heartbeat his vision went from a red flare to blackness he crumpled into the mud his hands scrabbling feebly quinctilius varus and aristocles were arguing in greek about platos symposium it made time go by and helped varus forget about the wet gloomy german landscape all around what id like to see is the symposium on the stage varus said its not a play its a dialogue aristocles sounded shocked he was fussy and precise to him everything had one proper place and one proper place only it could be a play the roman insisted aristophanes and alcibiades are both wonderful roles to say nothing of socrates himself you might he broke off and fell back into latin by the gods whats that the color drained from aristocles face nothing good he answered numbly varus nodded the two of them rode just in front of the baggage train near the center of the long straggling roman column that sudden eruption of shrieks and screams and wails from up ahead it sounded like the noises from a slaughterhouse but monstrously magnified no varus made himself shake his head thinking such thoughts is a had omen i wont believe it i wont let myself believe it he kept on not letting himself believe it for five more minutes maybe even ten then a bloodied legionary came running back toward him crying were buggered what do you mean varus demanded he feared he knew but clung to ignorance as long as he could sometimes as with a spouses infidelities not knowing indeed deliberately looking the other way was better but the wounded roman cried the germans theres a million germans up there your excellency and theyre slaughtering us no quinctilius varus whispered it cant be it could he knew that only too well and if the barbarians had attacked the legionaries if that had happened then arminius infidelities were likely to prove far more lethal than any mere spouses what do we do sir his pedisequus asked for a moment varus had no answer everyone from segestes to aristocles to lucius eggius had tried to tell him arminius was not to be trusted he hadnt believed any of them hed been sure he knew better than all of them put together and they were right and he was wrong and because he was wrong because hed trusted where he shouldnt three roman legions were in deadly peril no treachery since helen of troys had caused this kind of slaughter being remembered with menelaus was a distinction varus could have done without he hadnt even got to lay arminius or wanted to no matter what some people thought what do we do sir this time aristocles and the wounded roman soldier asked it together they sounded more urgent that way more frantic really a tragic chorus varus thought and wished he hadnt he paused to listen to the racket from up ahead it sounded worse than ever sure enough the wounded man had told the truth varus couldnt imagine why the fellow wouldnt have he could feel himself grasping for straws no time for that now we have to fight varus said he pointed to the man whod brought the news tell the troops ahead to form line of battle and give the barbarians worse than they get and tell them to remember theyre romans well win this yet the wounded man set his hands on his hips exactly as claudia pulchra might have done after varus said something truly stupid sir they cant form line of battle the fellow said as if speaking to an idiot theres nothing but swamp on one side of the track and nothing but howling savages on the other thats got to be why the germans picked this place to begin with hearing that varus knew at once that it must be true he also knew the depth of his own folly how long had arminius been cozening him stringing him along while at the same time drawing germans from all over the province to this this ambuscade from the very beginning probably from before the beginning even why would he have taken service with the auxiliaries if not to learn how the romans fought and how to turn what he learned against them your excellency if that wasnt desperation in aristocles voice now quinctilius varus had never heard it the wounded roman shifted from foot to foot too as if about to piss himself varus wondered why he wasnt more afraid maybe because understanding that the worst had happened he saw he couldnt do much about it now if your only real choice was making the best end you could that was what you had to do he drew his own sword well my dears we shall have to fight he said if we cant deploy well take them on one by one thats all something else occurred to him oh aristocles yes sir dont get too far from me please if worse comes to worst even now varus wouldnt say when worse comes to worst i dont aim to let the savages take me alive id appreciate a friendly hand on the other end of the sword if youd be so kind the greek gulped he couldnt very well misunderstand that even if his expression said he wanted to licking his lips he said if i have to sir ill tend to it i hope somebody will do the same for me thats all i think you may be able to find someone varus said dryly that might prove his last understatement but it surely wasnt his smallest vala numonius head whipped around only a dead man could have ignored that sudden dreadful racket by the gods a mounted officer near him exclaimed what the demon is that although the cavalry commander feared he knew he didnt want to say the words out loud sometimes naming something could make it real where it hadnt been before maybe that was only superstition on the other hand maybe it wasnt why take chances and numonius didnt have to a man galloped up from behind him crying the germans the germans what about them numonius knew the question was idiotic as soon as it passed his lips which was just too late the man coming forward fortunately didnt take it amiss but that was the only good news the cavalry commander had for the fellow went on theyre killing the foot soldiers sir slaughtering them with spears we have to save them cried the officer whod exclaimed about the awful noise if we can vala numonius said the officer looked at him as if he couldnt believe his ears face hot with shame numonius realized the cavalrymen would have to make the effort if he didnt order it theyd mutiny and go back without him easier to lead them in the direction they wanted to go if that didnt get them all killed vala numonius licked his lips before he shouted back well do all we can for our comrades cheering the horsemen turned and rode south and east in the direction from which theyd come numonius drew his sword maybe the charge would frighten the germans away he hoped so if it didnt the roman cavalrymen would have their hands full vala numonius knew he would with the sword in one hand he would have only the other to use to hang on to his saddle grip if his left hand slipped he might go right off his horses back mounted spearmen were in the same predicament they couldnt charge home with the full weight of their horses behind them a rider would go over his mounts tail if he tried anything so harebrained if only a mans foot could grip the saddle as well as his hands could numonius laughed at himself talk about harebrained if there were a way to do something like that someone would surely have thought of it by now then the laughter died vala numonius had imagined the germans attacking the romans yes but hed never imagined such horrible swarms of them all thrusting and ululating and having a grand old time and hed never imagined that the roman cavalry wouldnt be able to stand off and ply the savages with arrows in this rain that was hopeless a wet bowstring was as useless as no bowstring at all they would have to close with the germans then if they were going to rescue their friends if they could rescue them how many thousands of barbarians were battening on the legionaries numonius led a few hundred horsemen roman armies were always stronger in infantry man in cavalry riders were fine for scouting and pursuits for real fighting you needed men on foot so the romans had always believed and centuries of experience had taught them they were right crassus disaster against the parthian cavalry a lifetime earlier was the exception that tested the rule but what the parthians had done meant little to vala numonius theyd had an army of horsemen then he had a detachment he somehow had to beat an army with it hoarse yells said the germans saw the oncoming romans so did a shower of spears flying toward the roman riders a wounded horse screamed terribly a wounded cavalryman added his shrieks to the din the horse with a spear in its barrel staggered and fell pitching off its rider the animal just behind tripped over the wounded beast the man atop it also flew off with a wail of dismay numonius swung his sword at a german laughing the barbarian sprang back out of range in his excitement the cavalry commander almost cut off his horses right ear the german picked up a fistsized rock and flung it at him the fellow was too eager had he let numonius ride past and then struck him from behind he might well have brought him down as things were numonius saw the stone hurtling toward him he flattened himself against his horses neck the stone brushed his left shoulder as it flew by he yelped but it was an involuntary noise a heartbeat later he realized he wasnt hurt he also realized his cavalrymen wouldnt be able to drive the savages away from the roman infantry as the fight came to closer quarters he saw how many legionaries in the front ranks were already down what had the germans done whatever it was it meant that a whole great slavering pack of them had interposed themselves between his detachment and the surviving foot soldiers farther back the riders hadnt the slightest chance of hacking through so many from behind he slashed a barbarian who was about to spear another roman horseman the german leaped in the air in surprise blood pouring from his right shoulder he howled like a wolf a roman who saved a comrades life in battle earned a decoration vala numonius feared he wouldnt survive to claim it sure as demons the decoration was the least of his worries a savage with a sense of tactics was shouting and gesticulating trying to move his men to surround the roman riders was that arminius whod learned too many lessons from rome numonius couldnt be sure not through the rain it seemed all too likely though so varus was wrong straight down the line he didnt do things by halves when he went wrong did he another german threw a spear that pierced numonius greave and bit into his calf the wound wasnt nearly so bad as it would have been were he unarmored he pulled out the spear and awkwardly threw it back then the pain hit the warm trickle of blood running down his leg joined the cold trickle of rainwater numonius couldnt even look down to sec just how nasty the wound was not unless he wanted to unstrap the punctured greave he wanted nothing less suppose he got hit again that thought fanned the rising flames of panic inside him and they already blazed high enough high enough no too high the torment of his wound and the sight of savages loping along to cut off his men made him shout orders that left the riders staring at him away he screamed save yourselves the legionaries are lost get away if you can he wheeled his own horse and roweled it with his spurs the animal squealed it bounded off so powerfully it almost threw him but he clung to the handgrips like a burr after a bit the horse slowed some and steadied its pace many cavalrymen fled with him some shot past him as if launched from a ballista maybe theyd get away maybe ill get away numonius thought the selfishness of fear made him forget everything else other cavalrymen went on doing what they could for their comrades on foot they had to know they were throwing away their own lives vala numonius looked back over his shoulder he saw the germans pull a rider off his horse and slowly and deliberately shove spears into the man he imagined he heard their hoarse baying laughter but it was only his imagination hed got too far away by then maybe i will get away he thought again as his horse bucketed north and west maybe i will maybe please gods just let me get away under his cloak arminius had an erection the most beautiful most sensual woman in all of germany couldnt have roused him like this not if she danced naked in front of him to plan for years to see all your plans not only come to fruition but turn out better than you ever dreamt they could if that wasnt enough to put some fire in your balls you probably didnt have any the romans did things like that one of the latin words arminius had learned in pannonia was eunuch the idea was enough to sicken him to treat a man as if he were a stallion or a bull or a ram the idea almost made his yard shrink and one of the roman officers down there had had such a creature for a slave seeing a eunuch hearing a eunuch that had put arminius off his stride for days but hed cut the ballocks off the romans in germany curse me if i havent he thought hed had a bad moment when the cavalry came back to try to rescue the legionaries too late for that though the roman horsemen had figured that out themselves now they were running some of them might even make it back to the rhine but his folk would hunt most of them down before they could and if a few did escape well so what arminius nodded to himself that could even turn out for the best if the refugee roman cavalrymen spread panic ahead of them the rhine garrisons might flee instead of fighting the germans in that case arminius would have an easier time taking gaul away from the empire he intended to do just that he had a victorious army behind him what else could you do with an army but use it as long as he led it from one triumph to another it would stay his and as long as it stayed his he could use it for whatever he wanted germany needed a king germany might not know that yet but he did the romans had done very well with one man telling them what to do as long as the germans followed scores of tribal chieftains and war leaders and petty kings theyd waste most of their strength fighting one another led by somebody like arminius they could turn all that strength against foreign foes led by somebody just like me arminius thought nodding he could do it he was sure he could after a victory like this who would dare stand against him but for himself the strongest german king was maroboduus of the marcomanni far off to the southeast everyone knew maroboduus had stirred up the pannonian rebellion to keep the romans from invading his lands that was canny no doubt but maroboduus hadnt had the nerve to attack the romans before they came after him i did arminius exulted i did he shouted thrusting his sword up into the air a dying legionary groaned several germans stared at arminius you did what one of them asked he wore a shabby cloak held closed by a bronze fibula tarnished green he was a nobody in other words and had probably never got close enough to arminius before to have any notion of what he looked like i brought the romans here arminius answered i lured them to destruction who do you think you are one of the big shots the other german eyed his cloak of fine wool trimmed with fur eyed the garnetstudded gold pin that closed it and eyed the sword only rich men carried swords the spear was the common german weapon grudgingly the fellow went on well maybe you are i am arminius arminius wanted everyone to know who he was and how wonderful he was like the romans his folk reckoned a proud reputation one of the most important things a prominent man could have what made you prominent if not fame among your neighbors he impressed the unknown german less than hed hoped well maybe you are the man repeated but two other fellows already told me the same thing point them out to me so i can kill them arminius snarled no one would rob him of his glory no one would cling to his good name and suck the blood from it like a leech in a swamp either dont seem em now the other german answered maybe he didnt or maybe he didnt care to watch a fight among his own folk that might be wise arminius realized as much even before the poor man continued we ought to be killing these godshated romans instead well youre right so we should arminius agreed lets go do it a legionary down with a leg wound stretched out an imploring hand and called mercy comrade in latin most of arminius comrades wouldnt have understood the words though they probably would have figured out the gesture also in latin arminius said heres all the mercy you deserve he drove his sword into the romans neck the man gasped and choked as life gushed from him then slumped over to lie still arminius knew he had been merciful already germans were leading or dragging chained roman prisoners away from the field after the uneven fight finally sputtered out they would offer the captives to the gods how many interesting and unusual ways to kill legionaries would they find all of them arminius was sure would make harder deaths than a cut throat here and there individual romans and a few stubborn knots of them still showed fight maybe they knew what would happen to captives and aimed to make the germans kill them maybe like brave soldiers anywhere they were simply too stubborn to give up arminius admired their courage but it would do them no good theyd had no chance to form up the head of their column was destroyed and their foes had got in amongst them if they wanted to die fighting die they would other romans wanted to live they stumbled out into the swampy mire that lined the track to the right quite a few of them got stuck in it the germans had a high old time throwing spears and stones at them men made bets with one another who could hit the most romans or the ones farthest away or who could hit a particular soldier with a particular cast a few legionaries managed more progress than the rest some were liable to get out of the swamp and have to be hunted on better ground a few might even escape others staggered up onto higher drier patches of ground within the swamp a couple of those groups perhaps led by hardbitten underofficers tried to ready themselves for defense they would die in due course too but finishing them off might prove costly first things first the romans at the rear of their column hadnt even been attacked yet arminius shouted and sent more of his men after them their baggage train will be back in that direction too he added that got the germans moving all right they did everything but slaver at the prospect of three legions worth of booty you dont fight fair a wounded roman moaned as arminius trotted past the german chieftain almost stopped and bowed he couldnt imagine finer praise even if the legionary hadnt meant it that way something else struck arminius take varus alive if you can he bawled well give him to the gods they deserve to feed well for what theyve done for us today what would make them happier what would make them fatter than a fat roman with the gall to call himself governor of germany how the warriors all around shouted and cheered that acclaim tasted even sweeter than a woman gasping and quivering under arminius most men could pleasure a woman how many though ever won fame like this as long as the german folk endured men would remember arminius what greater immortality could a man claim come on arminius said we wont just beat them well slaughter them theyll never dare set their toes on this side of the rhine from now till the end of the world in fact well go take away their land on the far side the germans cheered him again xvii lucius eggius lurched through the mud he had a nasty wound on the outside of his right thigh blood soaked the strip of cloth hed tied around it and ran down his leg it hurt like a bastard so did several lesser gashes it wasnt often given to a man to know the date of his own death though not dead yet eggius knew when he would die today soon in fact the only reason he wasnt already dead was that no german had decided to come after him instead of some other roman and finish him off at first that had been nothing but luck eggius was no longer convinced it had been good luck later after so many men fell in the first dreadful barrage of spears eggius not only stayed alive but fought back hed used his javelins his gladius had blood on it though the rain was washing that off hed made the barbarians pay for his tanned and scarred hide and much good it had done him or anybody else shrieks from the southeast said the germans were still working their way through the roman column under normal circumstances a roman army had a considerable advantage over a german army of the same size legionaries fought together deployed together and enjoyed all the benefits of superior discipline under normal circumstances lucius eggius muttered bitterly amazing how three words changed everything the romans couldnt deploy here there was nowhere to deploy except for the road everything was muck and trees the legionaries couldnt form a shield wall to ward themselves against enemy spears while they hurled their own javelins a horrific number of them had died or been put out of action before they ever got their shields off their backs off to eggius left deeper in the swamp whooping germans slaughtered a small knot of romans whod managed to put up a bit of a fight before they died that was about as much as the legionaries could manage it wasnt just the terrain this battle was lost and catastrophically lost the instant the barbarians first spears flew three legions were getting massacred not least because they couldnt believe what was happening to them too many men were too dumbfounded even to try to fight back and their fall only made their fellows predicament worse which dumbfounded them which led to it led to lucius eggius calfdeep in clinging ooze it was liable to lead to three legions wiped out almost to the last man it was liable to lead to three legionary eagles being lost eggius jaw dropped even after everything that had happened and was happening that thought only now crossed his mind for the first time legionaries guarded the eagles with their lives they would rather die than let an enemy seize the sacred symbols of their trade they were dying all right whether they wanted to or not and once they finished dying arminius would have the prizes he must have craved all along even thinking of arminius made lucius eggius spit in the mud in disgust thinking of arminius also made him think of publius quinctilius varus he spat again harder this time as soon as the vulture gets done with prometheus liver it can start gnawing on varus eggius growled hed tried to warn the governor of germany now there was a title that had just turned into a monstrous joke about arminius so had gods only knew how manv other roman officers varus didnt want to listen his rank meant he didnt have to so he didnt and now he was paying for not listening and so was everybody else eggius limped toward some trees if he could hide among them till the fighting stopped and the germans went away maybe hed be able to sneak back toward the rhine later and he laughed in spite of everything the idea was funny he didnt think he could make it to the trees if he did he didnt think hed be able to hide for long and even if he concealed himself he didnt think hed ever see the rhine again a guttural shout a tall blond man pointing at him four more barbarians coming along the edge of the track toward him two of them carried spears one a captured roman gladius and one a gladius and a spear one of them had a cut on his left arm the other three seemed unwounded they would eggius thought as he turned and tried to find the best footing he could sure as hades house he wasnt going to reach those trees but at least he could he hoped he could make the germans kill him you didnt want them to take you alive their gods were thirsty for blood and captives fed them surrender one of the barbarians yelled in latin eggius shook his head you dont surrender you die the german warned shaking his spear now tell me something i didnt know eggius answered the barbarian only scratched his head that must have been more latin or harder latin than he could deal with but he didnt have to deal with it he had the brute simplicity of sharp iron on his side he flung the spear at eggius the roman ducked the spear grazed his left shoulder as it flew past the german jumped up and down shouting something hot and guttural plenty of spears lay on the ground though he picked up another one and jumped into the muck heading purposefully after eggius two more savages followed him they grinned and laughed in anticipation grimly eggius set himself and waited he couldnt outrun them not with his leg wound he had to make the best fight he could in other words he was about to die he didnt want to but soldiering had long since shown him you had to do all kinds of things you didnt want to one certainty once he did this he wouldnt have to worry about anything else that lead german thrust at him eggius twisted to one side and stepped forward he still had one quick stride in him anyhow his gladius pierced the barbarians belly the man looked absurdly surprised as he crumpled eggius twisted his wrist to make sure the stroke cut guts and killed even before he could clear the sword the other two germans speared him hed known they would nothing to be done about it he screamed no dignity when you died none at all he fell on top of the barbarian hed taken with him after a while not nearly soon enough the pain faded and the torch of his life went out the baggage train for many of arminius germans the chance to loot three legions worth of booty was the only reason theyd joined his force so many things here all in one place traders from inside the empire would have charged more for them than any ordinary man could hope to pay but now anyone with a spear could take away as much as he could carry ordinary men could get their hands on things chieftains would envy by the time arminius got to the baggage train a lot of ordinary men were drunk one of the things the romans carried with them was their wine supply in a closerun fight that might have meant disaster as things were it only served to make them fiercer and at the same time more foolish laughing like a loon a shaggyhaired warrior capered in a transparent silk tunic some highranking roman must have bought in mindenum and been bringing back to vetera for his ladylove the change must have been easy for him because hed worn nothing underneath his stout wool cloak hed had nothing else to wear he shook his hips at arminius arent i gorgeous he bawled dont tear that cloth arminius told him the big man seemed about to burst from the tunic in several different places have you got any idea how much its worth why should it be worth anything its hardly here at all the warrior put a hand under the fabric to show what he meant you can see right through it patiently as if to an idiot child arminius said thats why imagine it on a woman imagine it on your woman ohhh the other german said in a low voice because the silk was so transparent arminius could see exactly what he thought of that he liked the idea arminius had thought he might no doubt much more carefully than the fellow had put on the tunic he took it off again several dozen romans from the rear of their column the part that hadnt been so irretrievably shattered counterattacked then they had it all their own way for a moment because the plundering germans werent expecting anything like that the legionaries fought with the desperation of men who had nothing to lose they had to know they wouldnt get away they were just trying to sell their lives as dearly as they could and doing a good job of it in their caligae arminius would have done the same thing as it was he pushed his own men into the fight and went into it himself he didnt want to be seen he couldnt afford to be seen hanging back he thrust with his spear and then after some romans sword stroke shattered the shaft he slashed with his sword red drops flew from the blade every time he swung it one of the legionaries recognized him you traitor dog the man shouted if i can drag you down to plutos house in the underworld i will his gladius flicked out quick and deadly as a striking viper but arminius wasnt there to take the stroke quick and deadly himself he danced away then returned to the fight his sword thudded off the legionarys shield the man was good if he hadnt been good he would have died a while ago on this field or on some earlier one no matter how good you were though nothing saved you from one german when another one tackled you from behind the legionary let out a despairing wail as he went down the wail cut off abruptly when arminius sword descended on the back of the romans neck the stroke hewed halfway through the legionarys whole body convulsed arminius hacked again then picked up the mans head and waved it about that was well struck the other german said nodding to him want to share the buggers stuff you can take it arminius answered i have plenty obliged the other man said i think his mailshirt will just about fit me sandals too the romans make good stuff why cant we do more things like that i dont know arminius said but they didnt know how to win this battle we did that counts for more because now all the good stuff they made is ours sure is the other warrior agreed get right down to it and thats what counts most thats what counts for everything arminius said he looked around things seemed to be under control the counterattacking romans had done as much as flesh and blood could do and now almost all of them had met the universal fate of flesh and blood the last few still on their feet kept fighting hard they wanted to make the germans kill them outright and it looked as if they would get their wish which reminded arminius where is varus he asked but the question answered itself anybody whod seen one roman marching column had seen them all the commander always placed himself in the same position not far ahead of the baggage train arminius grin was gleefully feral how he wanted to take the roman general alive how the gods would love to drink varus blood to savor his screams as he died a digits width at a time how arminius himself wanted to gloat in varus face the roman fool that he was had trusted him how you could trust anyone who wasnt your closest kin well varus had done it and hed paid and rome had paid with him rome would go right on paying for generations to come varus wouldnt last that long the last legionary from that counterattacking band went down a spear through his throat hed got himself a quick end on this field that made him one of the lucky ones arminius didnt want varus to share his luck come on he called to the germans around him he pointed forward lets go grab the roman general that drew less eagerness than hed hoped why bother one of them said hell get killed pretty soon any which way and the plunders bound to be better here the plunder here is better than anything several other warrior solemnly nodded we have to make sure arminius insisted besides i want him alive the gods in the sacred grove deserve their fair share of his suffering a few of the men nodded but only a few the fellow who preferred looting said if the gods want him taken alive theyll fix it so he is they dont need us to do it right now ive got another reason for you to come with me arminius told him oh whats that the other german asked ill cut your lazy cowardly heart out if you dont arminius said he braced himself wondering if hed have a fight on his hands in the next instant the other german said ive killed enough romans so no man can call me a coward lazy why not only a fool or a slave works harder than he must since arminius felt the same way he had trouble arguing with that the romans wouldnt have agreed theyd done great things with hard work but what had it got them in germany here at the end only death three legions worth of death come with me then arminius said kill some more romans that still needs doing and if you do it well ill reward you from my own share of the booty now youre talking like a man the warrior exclaimed lets go others came with them too even so arminius noticed fighters sidling off so they wouldnt have to quit stealing he swore at them but sometimes there was no help for a situation and the men he did have would probably be enough they had to shove their way through more plundering germans a couple of times they almost had to fight their way through their countrymen yes the baggage train drew his folk the way nectar drew bees and here and there small groups of legionaries kept on fighting a few of them as mad for things as the germans seemed to be defending their personal property much good it would do them when they were dead and dead they were in short order but the sun was sinking in the west days were shorter than they had been in high summer some romans might escape in the coming darkness if varus turned out to be one of them arminius promised himself he would kill the warrior whod delayed him by talking back that bonehead might not know what was important but arminius did another determined group of romans determined enough to die on their terms rather than those of the germans anyhow if that was what they wanted arminius and his comrades would oblige them he struck and slashed like a man possessed he split a scutum clean in half with a sword stroke which was supposed to be impossible the roman holding what was left of the shield reeled away terror and awe on his face arminius sprang after the fellow and cut him down a god has hold of him one of the other germans said to another the second warrior nodded that was what possession meant wasnt it arminius didnt think he was in a gods clutches he just wanted varus anything that stood between him and the roman had better watch out and since the legionaries standing in the way couldnt watch out they fell one after another how much time had they bought their commander too much it had better not be too much onward arminius roared hoping he wasnt too late night was falling literally and figuratively when the end came the best you could do was face it with style publius quinctilius varus looked around the end was coming all right the end in fact was just about here an officer with wild eyes and with gore from a missing right ear splashed all over that side of his mailshirt staggered out of the ruination ahead varus was shocked to recognize ceionius the military tribune had always been so neat so spickandspan no more no more lets surrender your excellency ceionius cried if we give up now maybe the germans will let us live even at the end of all things some people could still cling to illusions varus had clung to his much too long but he was free of them at last as gently as he could he shook his head its no use any more he said we might as well fight as long as we can but ceionius said no quinctilius varus cut him off do as you please for yourself and good luck to you but the legions will not surrender you cursed stupid old fool ceionius shouted varus bowed his head accepting that with a howl of despair ceionius dashed off toward the swamp maybe hed get away maybe hed find a german who would take his surrender and let him live as a slave maybe but varus didnt believe it for a moment an embattled centurion not far away shouted for men to go forward and hold off the barbarians a little longer quinctilius varus took him by the arm the man jumped his sword twitched then stopped varus realized hed almost died a little sooner than hed intended well what difference would it have made not much not now he said what he needed to say to the centurion im sorry i made a mistake and were all paying for it my fault no one elses i am sorry too late for that dont you think the other roman growled too late for everything varus agreed ah bugger it the centurion said too late for everything is right what do you aim to do now die varus said simply want me to do the honors my slave will attend to it varus replied but if youd be kind enough to take him off quickly after im gone id be grateful and so would he ill tend to it the centurion promised and then ill look for somebody to do the same for me thanks varus said and then raising his voice till he sounded almost gay aristocles ive found someone to kill you oh thank you your excellency relief filled the little greeks voice better one of our own than this his wave took in the madness all around them the germans would have assailed them sooner but a whole great swarm of the barbarians were plundering the baggage train which wasnt far behind some of the germans guzzled wine others stuffed themselves with barley bread still others led off pack horses and murdered the slaves whod tended them all the barbarians seemed to be having a rare good time here and there small groups of romans fought on but there was no room for the legionaries to make war as they usually did and the germans who were used to fighting as individuals had all the better of it ill be glad when im dead the centurion said then i wont see the savages steal our eagles im sorry varus said again he knew what the eagles meant to the men who served under them three legions were going down here was it any wonder their eagles would be lost a spear flew through the air it pierced the soft ground and stood quivering only a few cubits from varus feet aristocles said not meaning to rush sir but i dont think we should wait much longer no no neither do i if anyone here ever sees augustus tell him im sorry too varus said he drew his sword hed never used it in war here the first blood it would drink in germany would be his own he handed it to his pedisequus here you go aristocles i daresay youve dreamt of doing this for years strike hard if varus had little experience with the sword aristocles had none a slave a slave who wasnt a gladiator anyhow caught with a blade commonly died a cruel death rome had seen too many slave uprisings and plots for anything else to seem safe and so the skinny greek held the blade as if it were a kitchen knife and as if he didnt know what to do with kitchen knives sighing varus pulled up his tunic and ran his forefinger between two ribs on the left side of his chest put it here and stick it in he said as if he were a girl helping an eager boy lose his cherry but you only did this once aristocles set the sword in place he gulped he closed his eyes with a horrible grimace he shoved it forward it hurt it hurt like nothing varus had ever known before he knew a certain pride that he didnt pull away from the blade he couldnt help shrieking though when the sword came out he fell to the ground and waited for the end it took longer than hed hoped it would from what hed seen dying always took longer than you hoped it would and hurt worse blood filled his nose and mouth he felt as if he were suffocating but he was really drowning drowning from the inside out aristocles screeched the centurion had struck him down from behind by surprise that wasnt so bad but as varus vision faded he saw that the soldier needed a second stroke to finish the job that wasnt so good but aristocles was in no position to complain and after a bit neither was varus arminius hadnt slept for a day and a half maybe longer excitement kept him going he wondered if hed ever sleep again it was all over now well close enough the germans still hunted roman stragglers through swamps and woods and fields sooner or later theyd track down most of them and kill them a few might get away arminius had stopped worrying about it they would spread fear ahead of them spread it all the way into gaul and behind the fear would come arminius three legionary eagles lay at his feet he knew what the eagles meant to roman soldiers knew as well as any german could anyhow they defended those eagles to the death they had defended these eagles so and now they were dead varus head lay at his feet too varus was also dead by the time the germans found him and took it his scrawny slave had lain dead beside him that disappointed arminius hed wanted to offer them to his gods after they watched him offering plenty of other romans he shrugged you couldnt get everything you wanted he had more than enough a german carrying a wine jar from the roman baggage train staggered past he gave arminius a sozzled grin good he said his broad extravagant wave taking in well everything good arminius agreed and so it was more germans led lines of captured legionaries their hands chained off toward the oak groves where they would be sacrificed even now the dying cries of men being offered to the gods rose in the distance his folk often worried about whether the gods got enough to eat they wouldnt have to worry for a long time not after the bounty the gods were enjoying now here and there two or sometimes four romans carried an unconscious comrade toward the sacrificial groves nobody wanted to waste any of this enormous feast for the gods if a man still breathed his spirit was nourishment sigimerus came up to arminius and bowed before him you did it he said you truly did germany is free arminius said the romans will never dare stick their noses across the rhine again well visit them on their side before too long i do believe we will his father sounded almost dazed at the size of their triumph and after that he shook his head plainly he couldnt imagine what might happen after that well neither could arminius but he was sure he would think of something when the time came when caldus caelius came back to himself he thought he was dead and being punished in tartarus his head ached as if it had been smashed to pieces and so it nearly had he needed a little while to realize he might have been better off if he were already dead he tried to raise a hand to his throbbing brow both hands came up theyd been chained together the links between the manacles clanked as they moved why would anyone have slowly realization returned oh he muttered the battle we must have lost if you lost a battle to the germans what happened next no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than he got an answer of sorts a shriek rang out that made him wonder if he hadnt been right when he first regained consciousness maybe he really had landed in a realm of eternal punishment no matter how much his battered head hurt he made himself turn it so he could see where that shriek came from a moment later he wished he hadnt several germans were holding down a legionary the luckless roman was also chained just like caelius while another barbarian slowly and clumsily decapitated him the screams subsided into a gurgling wheeze blood poured out onto the damp ground and spattered all over the germans at last the sword it was a roman gladius found its way between two neck vertebrae with a grunt of satisfaction the german held up the dripping head to caldus caelius horror the head wasnt just dripping even after it was severed from its thrashing body it blinked several times before its eves finally sagged shut its mouth might have tried to shape a word caelius hoped that was his imagination but feared it wasnt the other germans congratulated the one whod done the beheading he grinned and shuffled his feet as if hed never deserved such praise before then he carried the roman soldiers head over to one of the nearby oaks he used a leather thong to tie it to a lowhanging branch other legionaries sightlessly staring heads already hung there still others were spiked to the trunk nor was that the only tree sprouting such fruit the whole grove was full of butchered romans the iron stink of blood clogged caelius nostrils and things only got worse along with heads and other pieces of legionaries hung the eagles of legions xvii xviii and xix as well as the lesser emblems from the cohorts that made up the beaten legions seeing them there offerings to the grim german gods wounded caldus caelius almost as much as the rest of the atrocities put together he wished he could die of shame he wished he could die any way at all so long as it happened fast a big german came over and looked down at him the man wore a legionarys helmet at a jaunty angle and carried a legionarys shortsword in his right hand and he proved to speak latin too for he said you are the one called caldus caelius eh thats right caelius answered automatically who the demon are you my name is ingaevonus the barbarian answered do you remember me caelius started to shake his head then he stopped not only because it hurt but because he did remember that village he croaked ingaevonus nodded yes that village my village taxes he spat the word out through his mustache we do meet again eh he thoughtfully hefted the gladius yes caldus caelius forced the word out through dry lips he didnt want to show fear though the barbarian had to know he felt it i kill you ingaevonus said i kill you slow roman i kill you nice and slow caldus caelius i go think how to do it then i come back eh he ambled off testing the swords edge with his thumb over his shoulder he added wont be long not nearly far enough away another legionary started screaming for his mother the germans were gutting him the way they might gut a slaughtered boar but they hadnt slaughtered him first they drew out his bowels a few digits at a time laughing as they worked the legionary kept on screaming one of the barbarians had a new idea he cut again lower the roman wailed again higher the german stuffed what hed cut off into the mans mouth to muffle the noise caldus caelius shuddered his chains clanked again if ingaevonus needed ideas not me caelius muttered hoarsely he wouldnt do that to me but how could he possibly stop the barbarian if the germans wanted to they could have done it to him already they seemed to be picking most of the men they tormented at random a savage would point at a roman a couple of others would seize him and then they would set to work to see how much horror they could pack into the end of his life no one had pointed to caelius yet but ingaevonus would and soon maybe theyd waited for him to come to they did prefer their victims aware and suffering till the end not me caelius whispered again if hed had a sword he would have fallen on it if hed had a dagger he would have hoped it could reach his heart or else slashed it across his throat if but what he had was a head already half shattered and a stout set of manacles and chains and then amidst the stench of blood and the worse stench of terror sudden mad hope flowered in him if he could use the manacles to finish the job of crushing his skull but what if he couldnt his laugh sounded more than a little mad too if he couldnt how was he worse off he pulled himself to a sitting position that drew the germans notice as hed feared it would one of them shouted for ingaevonus three more strode toward him anticipatory grins on their faces now or never flashed through his mind he smashed at himself with all his fearfueled strength the last thought he ever remembered having was i hope i spoil their fun vala numonius horse stumbled south and west the poor beast was on its last legs the roman cavalry commander the roman fugitive in a land all traps and snares for romans urged it on even so if it foundered when it foundered hed have to use his own legs and its were swifter he was he hoped still ahead of the news of quinctilius varus army hed seen a few germans working in their farm plots they hadnt paid him much special attention they still thought of him as a roman soldier not as a fugitive from black disaster as long as they thought of him so as a man who was dangerous to approach as a man who would be avenged if he fell he was fairly safe but he knew better or worse even if they didnt he knew he was nothing but a runaway he also knew that scores hundreds maybe even thousands of roman fugitives cluttered the german landscape the barbarians might not have to hear the news just seeing so many romans wandering at random over the countryside could be plenty to tell them the legions had met catastrophe and that wasnt vala numonius only worry oh no far from it sooner or later the cavalry commander knew hed have to sleep a german could come up to cut his throat or knock him over the head and hed never know it till too late the legionaries joked about waking up dead if they got stuck in the middle of enemy country numonius didnt think those jokes were funny not any more he didnt maybe worse yet was that news and rumor would go right on spreading while he slept they were liable to get ahead of him even if he still had a lead on them for the moment if they did if they did the germans would know he didnt have the empires might behind him now they would know hed suddenly become fair game and they would hunt him he rode past a farm women and boys and one graybeard with a crooked back worked in the fields no warriors the romans had wondered about that on their way north vala numonius mouth quirked in a bitter grin by the gods he didnt wonder anymore sometimes though knowledge came at too high a cost people talked about that all the time now numonius understood it in his belly in his balls the barbarians all stared at him as he went by they would know where their menfolk had gone and why but they wouldnt he prayed they wouldnt know what had happened maybe numonius was only a scout with a victorious roman army not far behind him maybe i am but im not the nonsense formed of itself inside his mind it was one more measure of how worn he was he wondered whether his horses head was full of moonshine too more nonsense he was starting to have trouble even recognizing it he still had half a loaf of barley bread left when it was gone hed need to buy food from the germans or steal it from them the commander of the roman cavalry reduced to chicken thievery well better that than being reduced to what had happened to the poor sorry foot soldiers numonius was glad when the track went into the woods and he couldnt feel the germans pale eyes on him anymore the barbarians watched him like wolves watching a sick staggering doe if it fell over they would feed if it didnt they could catch something else before long he hated the german woods everything seemed to close in on you you couldnt see any farther than you could spit anything might lurk in there and lunge out at you anything wolves a bear a widehorned aurochs as fearsome as any meateating brute germans the most fearsome brutes of all youd never know danger drew near till too late but when every breath was danger the woods didnt seem to matter so much and if the hunted couldnt see far neither could the hunters vala numonius slid off his horse and led it away from the track then he tied it to a sapling and went back and covered its tracks and his as best he could he didnt know it his best would prove good enough but you had to try half a bowshot away from the path he gnawed on the barley bread it was dense and chewy bread made from wheat flour would have risen better it would have tasted better too but it wouldnt have packed so much nourishment into such a small space for soldiers who had to carry their own rations that mattered more he gave the horse a couple of bites of bread too that was all he had for the animal a few ferns and weeds grew in the gloom under the forest canopy the horse nibbled at those it raised its head and gave numonius a reproachful look as if to say you work me to death and then all i get is this sorry he told it his own voice a weary whisper carry me back across the rhine and ill fill you full of oats and barley by epona i will maybe the gallic horsegoddess would hearken to his prayer here in the german woods plainly the gods of his own folk held no power here he lay down beside the horse no matter what the risks he simply had to sleep hed soon be a babbling idiot if he didnt liable to tell the germans he was on the run even if they hadnt already figured it out that most of them knew no latin while he had only a handful of words in their tongue bothered him not at all once he lay down nothing bothered him bare ground might have been jupiters divinely soft bed up on mount olympus he didnt wake up with his throat cut maybe epona was listening maybe it was just luck whatever it was he had to make the most of it he found a few mushrooms growing not far from where hed lain he didnt know german mushrooms well but stuffed them into his mouth anyhow if they poisoned him well so what his horse wanted nothing to do with mushrooms all it wanted was rest he couldnt have cared less a convenient stump made mounting easier than it would have been otherwise but he knew he would have managed one way or another a cavalryman had to be able to vault into the saddle from flat ground so did a cavalry commander who expected his men to follow him vala numonius met the requirements how many of his men had followed him away from the trapped foot soldiers how many of them still lived how many roman infantrymen still did not many he feared three legions thrown onto the sacrificial altar and butchered what would augustus say when he learned maybe i can be the one who brings the news to rome numonius thought that dignified his flight with purpose of course it had had purpose all along if survival wasnt a purpose he couldnt imagine what would be but the germans had a purpose too slaughtering romans theirs seemed more likely to be fulfilled than his curse them he managed to find the track again without it he might have wandered in circles till he starved or till the barbarians found him but he still had a chance to get away the track came out into open country as abruptly as the trees had swallowed it vala numonius could ride faster could flee faster now but who were those horsemen out there ahead of him more romans he feared if theyd got ahead of him in the night word of the germans victory would have too and so it proved now the barbarians who spotted him didnt stare and wonder what he was up to they knew he was on the run they pointed and shouted and came after him he booted the horse up into a shambling drunken trot so the spears some of them flung fell short dogs ran howling after the horse vala numonius supposed they were dogs anyhow they obeyed better than wolves would have no matter what they looked like they terrified a brief gallop out of the horse then no matter how numonius screamed at it and beat it it decided it could run no more and stood still that was the last thing he wanted barbarians loped toward him behind the dogs few of them were in the prime of life which didnt mean their spears couldnt kill him knowing he was in trouble deeper than the sea he slid down from the horses back and started to run some of the dogs gave chase he slashed one in the snout with his cavalry sword which was longer than the gladii foot soldiers carried the horrible beast yelped in surprise and pain and fell back bleeding he hoped the others would turn on it but no such luck another gray sharpeared beast darted forward to snap at his leg he killed it but while he fought the dogs he couldnt flee their masters here came the germans youths and even one rugged blond woman who must have fancied herself a warrior a sword was a perfectly good weapon against a pack of dogs against spears with three or four times the reach that was a different story no vala numonius whispered please no the germans eyes were paler than their dogs that was the only difference between them for both sets held death the barbarians moved to surround the cavalry officer he turned this way and that about as helpless and hopeless as his horse the germans surged forward before too long it was over but not nearly soon enough to suit numonius before arminius could lead his swarms of germans into gaul he had to finish driving the romans out of his own country destroying three legions wasnt quite enough almost but not quite several roman fortresses persisted east of the rhine the men those forts sheltered might prove dangerous if he just forgot about them and so he set out to reduce the forts one by one having served in the roman auxiliaries he knew a little something about siegecraft what he failed to take into account was that the average german knew nothing or perhaps a bit less and the legionaries shut up inside the wooden palisades knew they would die horribly if his men broke in not many romans had escaped the massacre of legions xvii xviii and xix but some few had and spread word of what had happened there to the garrison troops to his surprise it made the men in the forts determined not afraid aliso caused the most trouble it stood on the south bank of the lupia not far east of where the smaller river joined the rhine near vetera the roman garrison inside aliso was large and very stubborn speaking soldiers latin arminius shouted to the legionaries if you surrender and come out i swear i will let you keep your arms and march back to gaul with no more attacks i will give hostages to prove it a centurion came up to the edge of the palisade to answer him arminius recognized the roman officer for what he was as much by his ingrained arrogance as by the transverse crest on his helmet no the man shouted you wouldnt be howling out there if you hadnt cozened quinctilius varus and murdered his men the promises you make arent worth piss every word of that was true which only infuriated arminius the more he shook his fist at the roman youll pay he said when we break in well give you all to our gods a fingernail at a time come ahead and try the centurion spat in his general direction i dont think you can do it you baldbottomed son of a whore i bet your assholes as wide as a tunnel from all the times you had varus cock up you to make sure arminius and his followers understood him the roman said that again pretty fluently in the germans language you turd with legs ill see how far your lying guts can stretch when i lay hold of you arminius bellowed in blind fury come ahead and try the centurion repeated calmly and stepped away arminius bellowed orders the germans shot flight after flight of arrows at aliso then roaring like angry bears to fire their spirits they rushed toward the fort with scores of scaling ladders if rage and ferocity could overcome skill and a strong position arminius followers would do it but they couldnt the romans dropped stones on the germans who threw bundles of brush into the ditch around the palisade they shot at them through holes drilled into the floor of their walkway with hardly any risk to themselves they used forked branches to reach out and overturn scaling ladders that did get placed against the walls they poured boiling water and sizzling oil on the germans swarming up the ladders in spite of everything a few germans did make it to the top of the palisade but only a few they didnt last long up there in a fight like that the armored disciplined and desperate romans had every advantage cradling a horribly burned arm a german whod fallen off a ladder groaned they fight dirty and so they did arminius acutely felt his folks ignorance of siegecraft when he served with the legions in pannonia hed seen the variety of engines and stratagems the romans could roll out against a strongpoint that presumed to resist them but having seen such things didnt mean he could duplicate them he didnt know how to make the catapults that flung darts or thirtypound stones farther than a man could shoot an arrow nor were germans miners he couldnt order them to tunnel under aliso and make the palisade fall over even if he could have given that order he wouldnt have he knew too well he couldnt hold his army together long enough to let mining work they would run out of food from the surrounding countryside pretty soon one more trick of roman siegecraft he realized now when it was too late was the stream of wagons that kept besiegers fed roman armies didnt come down sick as often as those of the germans either he couldnt make his own men keep their camp clean and orderly and he couldnt stop them from dumping waste upstream from where they drew drinking water they would have laughed at him had he tried knowing he wouldnt be able to stay outside of aliso long he kept trying to break in hurling his warriors at the palisade again and again maybe luck would be with them as it had been before maybe the romans would despair if they didnt fight back with all their might the german tide would surely lap over them and wash them away no matter how arminius hoped either or both of those things would happen neither did the legionaries inside aliso might have been some of the last romans left alive on this side of the rhine but they fought as if they still thought they would turn germany into a peaceful province any day now after a week of fruitless assaults sigimerus took arminius aside and said this isnt working son if were going to take gaul away from the empire we cant waste any more time hanging around here we cant leave these legionaries in our rear either arminius answered one more try they cant hold us out forever maybe the romans couldnt but they could hold the germans out during that last assault and as arminius had feared a flux of the bowels and a coughing sickness broke out among his men they started getting hungry too and word came that the romans were rushing soldiers to the rhine from all over gaul men began streaming away from aliso and heading for their homes arminius cursed and wept and pleaded all to no avail the germans had one great deed in them but not two watching his army break up he gloomily wondered if the same held true for him xviii late summer in rome was the hottest most unpleasant time of the year romans with even the faintest pretensions of importance got out of town some of them had seaside villas others went up into the mountains on higher ground the weather wasnt nearly so oppressive the truly rich enjoyed estates on one or another of the little islands that dotted the tyrrhenian sea augustus had seaside villas he had mountain hideaways he had island estates he had no pretensions of importance he had no need for pretensions and they would have seemed wantonly ostentatious on him he was important and he knew it and so did everyone else in the roman empire without pretensions he stayed in rome for the summer if he went to one of his retreats couriers would have to find out which one hed chosen and then go there themselves things might get delayed for days the roman empire ran slowly enough as it was making it run slower than it had to might turn indignation to rebellion or might cost the chance to nip and invasion or a famine in the bud going out to a summer place might slow down good news just a few days before word came in that tiberius had finally quelled the pannonian uprising the palatine hill is not so bad the ruler of the roman world said to whoever would listen and when you were ruler of the roman world everyone listened to you were up almost as high as we would be in the apennines his countless servants and slaves listened yes and behind his back they rolled their eyes and spiraled their forefingers next to their ears they knew bloody well it was hotter and nastier in rome than it would have been at any of the many summer refuges augustus could have chosen if he wanted to put up with sweat and with city stinks wafted on the breeze that was his business if he wanted them to put up with those things too that was also his business and all they could do about it was grouse and fume when he wasnt watching or listening he liked to nap in the afternoon no wonder not when he was as old as he was it gave his servants and his bodyguards some romans others wandering germans chosen for their size and ferocity more of a chance to complain and as luck would have it he was asleep when the courier from the north rode up on a horse hed come as close to killing as made no difference seeing the sorry state of the animal one of augustus grooms clucked reproachfully another said you could have come slower friend for hes sound asleep right now hell be up and about in a couple of hours wake him the courier said in a flat hard voice whaat both grooms chorused as if not believing their ears one of them added hed skin us if we did hell skin you if you dont the courier said the news i bring is that important what is it then asked the groom whod talked of skinning the courier looked through him it is for augustus thats what it is hell skin you if anyone hears it before him too well go on in that same groom said not for us to say who sees augustus and who doesnt its not my job the underlings escape hatch since the beginning of time in went the courier he had several brief but heated exchanges with augustus slaves he finally unbent enough to tell the senior servitors he brought news from germany when they asked him what the news was he looked through them too they muttered among themselves in greek and aramaic and perhaps other languages that werent latin by the way they eyed the courier they loved him not at all he was making them decide things in the absence of their master if augustus didnt think they should have let him be disturbed but in the end the couriers stubbornness carried the day stay here one of the senior servitors told the fellow sending him a baleful stare that he ignored we will rouse augustus and tell him you are here with your important news what he does after that is up to him of course of course the courier said and visibly composed himself to wait he didnt need to wait long augustus a little stooped hurried into the anteroom a few minutes later his gray hair was tousled his tunic wrinkled and rumpled he rubbed at his eyes to get sleep out of them you have news from germany he said without preamble give it to me at once yes sir the courier bowed he respected the master of the roman world if not the lesser men surrounding him i am sorry sir but the news is as bad as it can be quinctilius varus three legions are destroyed in the teutoburg forest only a handful of men escaping their eagles are lost captured by the germans varus trusted the chieftain named arminius and the barbarian betrayed him to his doom when varus saw the fight was hopeless he had a slave slay him he died as well as a man could but thousands more died with him and because of him as the courier spoke color drained from augustus face leaving him pale as bleached linen you are sure of this he asked in a hoarse whisper no possible doubt none sir im sorry the man who gave me the written message the courier took it off his belt and handed it to augustus had it from one of the horsemen who somehow escaped the massacre inside germany the rider filled his ears with worse things than ever got written down and i had some of them from him to say it was a bad business beggars the power of words it cant be augustus muttered it cant moving like a man in the grip of nightmare he broke the seal on the written message unrolled it and held it out at arms length to read it the scribe who first composed the message must have remembered it was bound for an old man for hed written it large to make sure the intended recipient could make it out by the look of anguish on augustus face the power of written words to describe what had happened in germany wasnt beggared after all are you all right sir one of his underlings asked in greekflavored latin real anxiety filling his voice the ruler of the roman world was the very image of a man overwhelmed a man unmanned by disaster unlookedfor oedipus could have seemed no more appalled no more horrified on discovering hed lain with his mother were any pins or brooches handy augustus might well have sought to blind himself as oedipus had done as things were he reeled away from the courier and the slaves and servitors who helped make him the most powerful man in the world he might as well have been blind as he fetched up against the frame of the doorway through which hed entered the antechamber he pounded his head on the sturdy timbers of the frame while his servants exclaimed in alarm he cried out as if he were indeed the protagonist of a tragedy on the stage quinctilius varus give me back my legions in a tragedy everyone knew though the actors skill might almost disguise the fact that the events portrayed came from the realms of myth and legend and history and were not happening to those portraying them here it was real no one would muster the men of legions xvii xviii and xix again they were dead all too often horribly dead give me back my legions quinctilius varus augustus wailed again his forehead bruised and swelling give them back i tell you neither the courier nor any of the servitors seemed to know what to say none dared say anything for fear it would be wrong when augustus cried out once more and yet again battered his head against the doorframe one of the men who served him the men who helped him rule the roman empire gestured to the courier by then the man whod brought the bad news was glad to get away lest he be blamed for it augustus servitor took him off to the kitchen and told the lesser slaves there to bring him bread and wine and olives obliged sir the courier said and then im sorry i knew it would be bad i didnt think it would be this bad he never imagined failure the servitor said why should he when hes known so much success beats me the courier gulped wine he would never be able to drink enough to forget the look on augustus face when the roman ruler realized all his plans for germany had just collapsed in ruin what will he do now i dont know from one of augustus aides that was no small admission i fear we shall have to change our policy which is not something we usually do gods curse those barbarians for being difficult as the courier nodded augustus voice echoed down the halls from the chamber where he still stood quinctilius varus give me back my legions scowling arminius stared across the rhine he wouldnt be able to invade gaul now and he knew it as soon as hed stopped encircling aliso the romans trapped inside the fortress broke out and fought their way west to the rhine most of them had made it across so had the garrisons from forts on the lupia closer to the greater river and two full legions had rushed up from the south when the romans in gaul got word of what happened to their countrymen in germany over on the west bank of the rhine a detachment from one of those legions paced arminius army he hadnt been able to shake loose of the romans even with night marches he wouldnt be able to fight on ground of his choosing if he did force a crossing on ground of their choosing the legions had the edge he wouldnt have had to work so hard to draw varus into his ambush otherwise someone called his name im here he answered waving glad for any excuse not to think about the west bank of the rhine a man from his own clan came up to him good news the fellow said your woman has given you a son she and the baby are both doing well gods be praised that is good news arminius took off a golden ring spoil from the vanquished legions and gave it to the other german this for bringing it to me i thank you the other man found a finger on which the ring fit well what will you call the baby sigifredus arminius said without the least hesitation in memory of the victory i won against the romans that victory however great it was was also turning out to be less than hed hoped it would with an old mans sour wisdom his father insisted things were often thus arminius had hoped sigimerus was only carping when he looked across the rhine and saw the roman soldiers there he knew his father had a point i also visited the grove of the sacrifice his clansman said never have the gods feasted like that before not in all the days since the world was made so many heads spiked to the holy oaks and hung from them the mans eyes glowed and three eagles three have the romans lost three since their realm began that i dont know arminius admitted hed served with the legions long enough to know the romans had suffered military disasters before but they were tightlipped about them well what warriors in their right minds boasted of battles lost ah the other german didnt much care about the answer he was only making conversation he went on in among all of them though i didnt see varus head and i wanted to you wouldnt have i brought it with me as we moved toward the rhine i wanted to use it as a talisman to frighten the romans but that didnt work out so well as i hoped it would arminius sighed cant have everything i suppose for a little while hed thought he could hed thought he had almost but not quite the price he paid for aiming so high what will you do with the head now pitch it in the river the other german asked well it was partly burned before i got my hands on it i salted it down but its getting high anyway arminius wrinkled his nose still i dont aim to throw it away ill send it southeast to maroboduus and the marcomanni it will show him what we germans can do when we set our minds to it wont it just his clansmate exclaimed eyes glowing oh wont it just till arminius meteoric rise king maroboduus had unquestionably been the most powerful german of all hed drawn augustus watchful attention too had the revolt in pannonia not broken out he likely would have drawn augustus legions as well maroboduus loudly denied hed had anything to do with stirring up that revolt arminius believed not a word of it he was sure augustus didnt either but the roman ruler hadnt found the chance to attack maroboduus and odds were he never would now thanks to me arminius thought proudly maroboduus might have stirred up others to fight against rome arminius had done his own fighting against foes who invaded his land if the folk of germany couldnt see which of those was the greater accomplishment arminius couldnt imagine that his countrymen would be so blind a roman who dreamt of ruling us his clansmate said and what is he now nothing but a stinking souvenir a stinking souvenir arminius echoed a slow smile spread over his face he nodded half to the other german and half to himself yes he liked that and it was true of more than quinctilius varus alone roman hopes for germany had also fallen into decay and they were no more likely to rise from the dead segestes lived quietly on his steading a good many of his sworn retainers stayed there with him a few of them younger men mostly had gone off to fight the romans with arminius despite what segestes thought of the man whod stolen his daughter enough remained to fight a war if arminius decided to try punishing segestes for staying loyal to the empire so far thered been no signs such trouble was coming nor even threats segestes gave arminius reluctant credit for that or maybe arminius was so enmeshed in great affairs that his womans father had fallen beneath his notice segestes sighed out in front of the thatchroofed farmhouse hed always thought of himself as a man of consequence but he could hardly deny that events had outrun him these past few months they wouldnt have if hed listened to me segestes murmured whats that one of his warriors asked varus segestes said if only hed listened to me are there any words sadder than i told you so the only time anyone ever gets to say them is when its already too late for them to do any good i never thought of it like that by the puzzled expression on the retainers face he didnt waste a lot of time thinking he was a good man with a spear in his hands though everyone had his strengths and his failings segestes sighed again his failing was that hed been born into a german body not a roman one he knew what the romans thought of his folk he knew that in varus eyes hed been as much a barbarian as arminius he sighed once more time would have solved that had the romans brought germany into the empire his grandchildrens grandchildren would have been unquestioned romans as babies born in gaul now were that wasnt going to happen not now whether arminius had done something good or bad men could argue one way or the other that hed done something great nobody could doubt germany would not be roman three legions gone taken all in all the roman empire had no more than thirty or so one soldier in ten from all the empire had perished in the swamps and woods not too far north of where he stood augustus was a canny man he wouldnt risk such a disaster twice he wouldnt have wanted to risk it once but varus thought he could trust arminius and three or four roman fugitives had made it here after the battle segestes hid them for a little while fed them gave them barley cakes and sausage to carry when they left and sent them away by night he wished he could do more but more would have cost him his life if word got out and word of such things always got out you did everything you could do not everything you wanted to do unless you were arminius segestes scarred hands folded into fists arminius had done everything anyone could have wanted to do or had he men said hed intended to cross the rhine and plunder gaul maybe even try to take it away from the romans his army got to the river but it didnt cross over what would he do with all those warriors now how long could he keep feeding them how long before the galloping shits or chest fever broke out among them segestes laughed harshly arminius had served with the romans learning their ways so he could fight them better segestes had served with them too years earlier arminius would have seen how the legions kept themselves supplied he would have seen how they kept their camps clean and how much good would it have done him he was dealing with germans here not romans supply wagons rafts carrying grain along rivers segestes laughed again he knew his own folk hadnt a prayer of organizing anything like that german encampments were always filthy too the romans said dirt led straight to disease from everything segestes had seen they knew what they were talking about as they commonly did whats funny lord his retainer asked funny everything in the world or maybe nothing at all segestes said the warrior scratched his head a moment later he squashed something between his thumbnails that made segestes want to scratch too i dont think i understand the younger man said well dont worry your head about it segestes said i dont think i understand either his retainer scratched some more he didnt come up with any new vermin or if he did segestes didnt see him do it which was good enough a few days later a solitary warrior approached the steading the chieftains followers led the fellow to segestes himself three of them stood between the man and segestes if the fellow had come with murder on his mind hed have to go through them to get at his target this is poor guesting he observed it is and i am sorry segestes said but times are hard and i have a strong foe can you blame my retainers for staying wary when you put it so i suppose not the other man replied my news comes from his steading in fact you will have heard your daughter gave birth to a boy yes i know that segestes nodded one of these days that grandson might lead him to reconcile with arminius one of these days but not yet what of it stranger my name is alcus the newcomer said i am sorry to have to tell you the baby is dead a flux of the bowels i hear it was quick and seemed painless woe the retainers cried they covered their faces with their cloaks woe segestes said with them he too covered his face tears ran down his cheeks so he could uncover himself without shame no one would think him coldhearted or mean of spirit in truth though he didnt know what he felt you are sure of this he asked i am there is no doubt alcus said my fields lie next to arminius i have the word straight from his retainers yes it is so then segestes said woe woe indeed always hard when a babe dies untimely harder when the babe is your grandson i beg you segestes dont hate me for being the one who brought you the news alcus said i know you and arminius are at odds if i had not come you might not have heard for some time true i might not have segestes wondered if that wouldnt have been for the best reluctantly he shook his head the news would have come sooner or later and sooner or later grief would have speared him sooner wasnt better but it also wasnt really worse i do not hate you alcus you did what you thought best and who is to say you did not have the right of it thank you lord that is well said and i will show you good guesting segestes realized he had to do that if he were not to be reckoned liar and niggard eat as you will of my bread and meat drink as you will of my beer and of my wine from beyond the rhine sleep soft tonight before you fare forth to your farm alcus bowed you are gracious you are kind yes i am segestes said bleakly and much good any of that has done me rain pattered down on rome it was winter the proper season for rain as any man who lived round the mediterranean would have agreed augustus was one of those men and faced a problem common to a lot of them his roof leaked a drip near the entrance to his great house plinked into a bowl he gave the bowl a jaundiced stare new leaks started every winter the men who laid roof tiles always promised that everything would be perfect this time they always lied too augustus shook his head in the scale of human calamities there were plenty worse his mouth tightened he knew too much about that he opened the door and looked out the guards standing outside stiffened to attention as you were boys augustus said and they relaxed what can we do for you sir one of them asked not a thing im only looking at the weather all right sir however you please the guardsman grinned at augustus he had a strongnosed face with cheekbones that made sharp planes below his eyes he spoke latin like the native of italy he was all his comrades came from italy too in the frightening frightened days after news of varus disaster came to rome augustus had eased all the germans and for good measure all the gauls out of his personal guard most of them maybe all of them remained loyal to him but he dared not take the chance that they would do something to help arminius he didnt cashier them he did send them out of rome quite a few of them were garrisoning mediterranean islands these days against whom were they garrisoning those islands pirates drunken fishermen skrawking sea gulls augustus had no idea but doing things that way had preserved the honor of the germans and gauls if he ever needed them again he could use them hed begun repairing the mutilated roman army too the legions hed raised in the aftermath of the disaster were no match for the ones arminius had destroyed he knew that they held far too many older men far too many squinting craftsmen and chubby shopkeepers hed had to draft men to fill out their ranks at all which caused no end of grumbling but hed done it and he wasnt about to look back and tell himself he shouldnt have yes those raw new legions would get hacked to bloody bits if they ever faced rampaging germans in the field augustus knew that so did the officers under whom the reluctant soldiers served all the same the new men could fill up forts they could protect backwaters that needed only a show of force to stay quiet and in doing things like that they could free up better troops to deal with real trouble augustus sighed cheer up sir one of the guards said the rainll make the grain grow he was a stubby little fellow and seemed all the more so when augustus remembered the hulking blonds whod protected him before if you couldnt trust your bodyguards though what were they worth to you not even a lead slug i know sextus i know augustus answered if sextus wanted to think the weather was what was wrong he could augustus only wished he could think the same thing himself quinctilius varus give me back my legions how many times had he howled that in his torment more than he cared to remember he had no guarantee he wouldnt start howling it again either if the black mood seized him again hed gone on so long and done so well maybe hed started believing he couldnt make mistakes any more if so hed got a reminder of his own humanity his own fallibility far blunter and more brutal than the stinking turds in his chamber pot forty years that was how long hed ruled the roman world the mediterranean world in all that time he hadnt had to pull back his horns very often oh death had forced him to change his mind more than once about his successor irony there hed been sickly in his younger years he was often sickly even now but hed outlived almost everyone to whom hed thought to entrust the empire after he was gone still no mortal could outwit or outreach death since hed never had a son of his own body he supposed tiberius his wifes son from an earlier marriage would have to do tiberius made a fine soldier hed proved that in pannonia if he hadnt been busy settling that revolt he might have proved it in germany instead quinctilius varus give me back my legions again die howl of torment rose unbidden in augustus mind though he managed not to cry out loud those legions were gone gone forever tiberius made a good soldier yes but did he have what it took to continue the delicate charade augustus had carried on with the roman senate all these years augustus held all the power in the empire worth holding but hed artfully pretended to be no more than a magistrate of the republic that was likely one reason and not the smallest one hed escaped assassination for so long people had feared his greatuncle would make himself into a king and so julius caesar died under the knives of men whod been his friends augustus cared little for the show of power the reality sufficed he wasnt so sure about tiberius tiberius didnt suffer fools gladly if the conscript fathers got pushy tiberius would do whatever he had to do to remind them where power really lay they wouldnt like that tiberius wouldnt care different parts of the roman government shouldnt squabble with one another augustus had to hope they wouldnt he saw no one but tiberius to whom he could hand over the reins death had cut down his other choices when he was gone all this would be his stepsons worry and so would germany bringing it into the empire as julius caesar had brought in gaul would have been augustus greatest legacy to his successor it would have been but it wouldnt be now augustus knew he would never could never mount another campaign to annex germany the rhine and the danube would remain the empires frontiers maybe after enough time had passed tiberius would be able to avenge this defeat even as the thought formed augustus shook his head some wounds were just too large too deep quinctilius varus give me back my legions again augustus kept the shriek inside him the first few weeks after the catastrophe he couldnt even manage that all his servants flinched whenever he cried out varus would have flinched too were he not beyond any reproaches but the gods arminius curse him had managed what only death had done before hed made augustus withdraw from a policy hed set his mind to if germany was not to be roman it would stay german it would stay squalid it would stay barbarous it would stay independent it would stay troublesome augustus could see that he had to hope it wouldnt become too troublesome too soon three days later a courier down from the danube reached the great house on the palatine hill he spoke to the grooms one of the guards spoke to one of augustus senior servants the freedman approached augustus himself sir i think you would do well to see this man to hear him to see the burden he bears send him to the anteroom then ill see him there only after the words were out of his mouth did augustus remember that was where hed seen the messenger who brought word of the battle in the teutoburg forest quinctilius varus augustus spat into the bosom of his toga to turn aside the evil omen the courier looked nervous when augustus strode into the small antechamber augustus knew that meant nothing couriers coming before him mostly looked nervous at the mans feet lay a large leather sack augustus nostrils twitched a faint foul odor rose from it well augustus pointed toward the sack whats that in aid of sir let me give you this first it will explain better than i can the man handed him a letter festooned with the usual wax seals and ribbons very well augustus broke the seals and unrolled the letter the script was small and none too neat after struggling with it for a moment augustus passed it to his servitor read this to me of course sir the freedman said i begin i am gaius libo a wine merchant and a roman citizen i am at the court of king maroboduus of the marcomanni north of the danube king maroboduus has no letters himself he asks me to write to you to explain the gift this letter comes with augustus pointed to the sack again whatevers in there thats right sir the courier said all right augustus turned back to his servitor go on yes sir not long ago maroboduus received from arminius another german princeling the head of the roman general publius quinctilius varus maroboduus says he has no quarrel with you and no quarrel with varus to show this he sends you the head for burial ah augustus said to give himself a moment to gather his thoughts then he asked the courier do you know if this is truly varus head or is it the head of some nobody maroboduus is using to curry favor with me sir i dont know i never met the gentleman alive and i would not recognize him the courier said i also have to tell you the head is not in the best of shape but i have heard that arminius did send varus head to maroboduus yes i have heard the same thing augustus said unhappily even more unhappily he went on take the head out of the sack if anyone is likely to recognize poor varus i am the man he could have summoned julia pulchra or her son no the younger quinctilius varus was studying in athens but he would not have done that to his grandniece and he couldnt do it to the peaceable youth hed seen battlefields and their aftermath even if not for many years he braced himself the courier didnt reach into the sack he didnt want to touch what it held and who could blame him for that instead he turned it inside out spilling the head onto the mosaic floor the stench the sack had contained filled the audience chamber gagging augustus freedman beat a hasty retreat he knew no more of battlefields than claudia pulchra or the younger varus did his ignorance the ignorance of so many in the empire was augustus doing and something for augustus to be proud of but battlefields hadnt disappeared altogether even if augustus wished they and one in particular would have he stalked around the severed head examining it from every angle weighing the wreckage here against what he remembered of his grandnieces husband his gorge didnt rise yes he remembered what death and its aftermath could do to flesh well sir asked the courier whod stood his ground and won credit with augustus for doing it is it him yes augustus said in a voice like iron that is publius quinctilius varus or what remains of him the bald crown curly hair at the temples and nape the nose the chin there can be no doubt that is varus he died well sir from what people say the courier offered such solace as he could so he did but too many died with him too many died because he let arminius trick him quinctilius varus give me back my legions quinctilius varus never would the disaster in germany was no nightmare to wake up from it was real and would stay real forever with a sigh augustus nodded toward varus remains would you be kind enough to put that back in the sack he said to the courier i will give it decent burial but not right now yes sir the other man answered resignedly getting the head back into the sack wasnt so neat as taking it out had been when the nasty job was done the courier said may i wash my hands of course augustus called for some slaves for a basin of warm water for scented oil the sweetest and strongest we have by the gods and for a bronze strigil so the courier could scrape his fingers clean thank you kindly sir the man said as the slaves brought what augustus required no i have to thank you for your help there and for the word you brought me augustus said now we know what became of this much of quinctilius varus anyhow and now we can lay this much to rest after the courier had scraped off as much of the corpsereek as he could augustus dismissed him with a gift of five goldpieces for all he had done the ruler of the roman world wished he could have dismissed the whole german problem as easily but the foul odor from varus head lingered in the audience chamber even after a slave gingerly carried away the sack the larger problem that foul smell symbolized lingered too and he couldnt do anything about it hed tried and hed failed as hed failed against death the death reek here brought back memories of those earlier failures wild german tribes would go on prowling the roman empires northern borders because they were separate tribes a canny ruler might be able to play them off against one another maroboduus and arminius had no love for each other now chieftains in years to come would also surely be rivals augustus knew he could exploit a situation like that but he also knew his day was passing if he lived five years more he would be surprised if he lived ten more he would be astonished how many of those who came after him would share his peculiar combination of talents he grimaced he couldnt do anything about that hed done everything he could about germany and it hadnt been enough if only hed had two tiberiuses if only pannonia hadnt rebelled when he was about to lay hold of germany once and for all if only quinctilius varus give me back my legions he cried once more the empty useless words echoed back at him from the antechambers walls historical note what happened in the middle of germany two thousand years ago has had a profound effect on the history of europe ever since the battle of the teutoburg forest teutoburger wald in german in adce made sure that germany would not become part of the roman empire and that the germans would not become romanized as the gauls had before diem to this day the division between romanized and nonromanized peoples in europe is easily visible in the languages and cultures of the nations that grew up on the wreckage of the roman empire in the west a collapse accomplished in military terms primarily by germanic tribes whose histories would have been altogether different had germany been annexed to rome if indeed they would have had separate histories for long after that point our written sources for the battle are less good than we might wish they were closest in time is the account of velleius paterculus a retired military officer who wrote his epitome of roman history around adce his work does not get much respect from modern historians he was no great stylist and he was an admirer of augustus successor tiberius whose character had a good many features less than admirable imagine a modern us colonel who served in vietnam and some years later wrote a memoir full of extravagant praise for richard nixon that will give you some notion of why historians raise an eyebrow at velleius patcrculus on the other hand the man actually served in germany he knew at least some of the people involved in these campaigns and he has information about them that we simply cant get from anyone else so his account is certainly worth reading other historians in the roman empire who touched on the fight in the teutoburg forest wrote at least a lifetime after the events occurred they include florus suetonius and cassius dio also known at least as often as dio cassius the last of whom wrote in greek rather than latin in addition tacitus mentions the battle in passing as he treats in more detail the retaliatory campaigns the romans waged in germany in the early years of tiberius reign augustus anguished cry of quinctilius varus give me back my legions comes from suetonius for manv years the actual site of the battle of the teutoburg forest was unknown there is a large heroic statue of arminius holding an upraised sword near detmold germany which was believed to be close by the battlefield in fact it is farther north and east near the village of kalkriese this was proved beyond a reasonable doubt through the excavations conducted by tony clunn one of the gifted amateurs who have contributed so much to archaeology in the s clunn was a british army officer serving in germany the coins and other artifacts he uncovered including the remains of the rampart arminius men built up demonstrate where the fight took place clunn has written a fascinating book detailing his discoveries the quest for the lost roman legions discovering the varus battlefield savas beattie new york and spellmount limited staplehurst uk also extremely valuable in addition to the primary sources was peter s wells the battle that stopped rome w w norton company new york and london i have not always agreed with their conclusions but console myself by remembering that i am writing a novel not history clunn also includes his own fictional version of the battle of teutoburg forest its installments separated by italics from the rest of the book i carefully did not read those installments not wanting his take on things to influence my own arminius augustus caldus caelius ceionius lucius eggius publius quinctilius sometimes spelled quintilius varus segestes sigimerus thusnelda and vala numonius are real historical figures so are claudia pulchra flavus julia maroboduus tiberius and varus son to whom i have given the praenomen gaius his actual praenomen is unknown who are mentioned but stay offstage as it were accounts of caesars deeds in gaul and germany a couple of generations earlier than the time in which give me back my legions is set are as accurate as i could make them so are those of crassus less fortunate deeds farther east varus father did commit suicide as described two key questions underlie the events leading up to the battle of the teutoburg forest first why was segestes so strongly opposed to arminius second why did quinctilius varus prefer to believe arminius rather than segestes arminius did elope with thusnelda segestes daughter after segestes betrothed her to another man when this happened is uncertain it may well have been later than ive put it perhaps even after the battle ive chosen to move it forward in time to give segestes a strong motive for disliking arminius and to give varus a reason for discounting segestes claims about arminius as he reckons them fueled by personal animosity ive also made varus especially susceptible to arminius deceit by having the german remind the roman of his own son i cant prove either of those speculations then again i dont have to im writing fiction i can and do hope my readers will find them plausible in the novel ive mixed modern and ancient place names where modern names are likely to be more familiar to the englishspeaking reader ive used them eg rome athens rhine danube less widely known places go by the names the romans gave them eg vetera rather than xanten the lupia river rather than the lippe gaul is a special case to call it france after the franks the germanic tribe that later affixed a new name to it would be anachronistic the romans large encampment in central germany was built where the modern town of minden lies no one knows what the romans called it so ive given it a classicalsounding name based on the modern one thusneldas giving birth to sigifredus is fictitious as is of course that babys death a few years later she did bear arminius a son to this day no one has discovered just where the roman fortress of aliso lay roman forts east of the rhine were abandoned in great haste after the battle of teutoburg forest arminius and the proroman flavus faced each other in war when flavus served with the punitive expedition in the time of tiberius arminius was killed by men of his own tribe the cherusci in ad ce maroboduus the king of the marcomanni ended his days in exile inside the roman empire while the germanic tribes did eventually help overthrow the empires western half this did not happen till centuries after the battle of the teutoburg forest the battle marked a crucial turningpoint in history but no one should make the mistake of thinking it marked an immediate one
