alexander kent command a kings ship bolitho to the contessa with love danger and death dance to the wild music of the gale and when it is night they dance with a fiercer abandon as if to allay the fears that beset the sailor men who feel their touch but see them not george h grant the admirals choice an admiralty messenger opened the door of a small anteroom and said politely if you would be so good as to wait sir he stood aside to allow captain richard bolitho to pass and added sir john knows you are here bolitho waited until the door had closed and then walked to a bright fire which was crackling below a tall mantel he was thankful that the messenger had brought him to this small room and not to one of the larger ones as he had hurried into the admiralty from the bitter march wind which was sweeping down whitehall he had been dreading a confrontation in one of those crowded waitingrooms crammed with unemployed officers who watched the comings and goings of more fortunate visitors with something like hatred bolitho had known the feeling too even though he had told himself often enough that he was better off than most for he had come back to england a year ago to find the country at peace and the gowns and villages already filling with unwanted soldiers and seamen with his home in falmouth an established estate and all the hardearned prize money he had brought with him he knew he should have been grateful he moved away from the fire and stared down at the broad roadway below the window it had been raining for most of the morning but now the sky had completely cleared so that the many puddles and ruts glittered in the harsh light like patches of pale blue silk only the steaming nostrils of countless horses which passed this way and that the hurrying figures bowed into the wind made a lie of the momentary colour he sighed it was march only just over a year since his return home from the west indies yet it seemed like a century whenever possible he had quit falmouth to make the long journey to london to this seat of admiralty to try and discover why his letters had gone unanswered why his pleas for a ship any ship had been ignored and always the waiting rooms had seemed to get more and more crowded the familiar voices and tales of ships and campaigns had become forced less confident as day by day they were turned away ships were laid up by the score and every seaport had its full quota of a wars flotsam cripples and men made deaf and blind by cannon fire others half mad from what they had seen and endured with the signing of peace the previous year such sights had become too common to mention too despairing even for hope he stiffened as two figures turned a corner below the window even without the facings on their tattered red coats he knew they had been soldiers a carriage was standing by the roadside the horses nodding their heads together as they explored the contents of their feeding bags the coachman was chatting to a smartly dressed servant from a nearby house and neither took a scrap of notice of the two tattered veterans one of them pushed his companion against a stone balustrade and then walked towards the coach bolitho realised that the man left clinging to the stonework was blind his head turned towards the roadway as if trying to hear where his friend had gone it needed no words the soldier faced the coachman and his companion and held out his hand it was neither arrogant nor servile and strangely moving the coachman hesitated and then fumbled inside his heavy coat at that moment another figure ran lightly down some steps and wrenched open the coach door he was well attired against the cold and the buckles on his shoes held the watery sunlight like diamonds he stared at the soldier and then snapped angrily at his coachman the servant ran to the horses heads and within seconds the coach was clattering away into the busy press of carriages and carts the soldier stood staring after it and then gave a weary shrug he returned to his companion and with linked arms they moved slowly around the next corner bolitho struggled with the window catch but it was stuck fast his mind reeling with anger and shame at what he had just seen a voice asked may i help sir it was the messenger again bolitho replied i was going to throw some coins to two crippled soldiers he broke off seeing the mild astonishment in the messengers eyes the man said bless you sir youd get used to such sights in london not me i was going to tell you sir that sir john will see you now bolitho followed him into the passageway again conscious of the sudden dryness in his throat he remembered so clearly his last visit here a month ago almost to the day and that time he had been summoned by letter and not left fretting and fuming in a waitingroom it had seemed like a dream an incredible stroke of good fortune it still did despite all the difficulties which had been crammed into so short a time he was to assume command immediately of his britannic majestys ship undine of thirtytwo guns then lying in the dockyard at portsmouth completing a refit as he had hurried from the admiralty on that occasion he had felt the excitement on his face like guilt aware of the other watching eyes the envy and resentment the task of taking command of gathering the dockyards resources to his aid to prepare undine for sea had cost him dearly with the navy being cut down to a quarter of its wartime strength he had been surprised to discover that it was harder to obtain spare cordage and spars rather than the reverse a weary shipwright had confided in him that dockyard officials were more intent on making a profit with private dealers than they were on aiding one small frigate he had bribed threatened and driven almost every man in the yard until he had obtained more or less what he needed it seemed they saw his departure as the only way of returning to their own affairs he had walked around his new command in her dock with mixed feelings above all the excitement and the challenge she represented gone were the pangs he had felt in falmouth whenever he had seen a manofwar weathering the headland below the castle but also he had discovered something more his last command had been phalarope a frigate very similar to undine if slightly longer by a few feet to bolitho she had been everything perhaps because they had come through so much together in the west indies at the battle of the saintes he had felt his precious phalarope battered almost to a hulk beneath him there would never could never be another like her but as he had walked up and down the stone wall of the dock he had sensed a new elation halfway through the hurried overhaul he had received an unheralded visit from rear admiral sir john winslade the man who had greeted him at the admiralty he had given little away but after a cursory inspection of the ship and bolithos preparations he had said i can tell you now im sending you to india thats all i can reveal for the moment he had run his eye over the few riggers working on yards and shrouds and had added dryly i only hope for your sake youll be ready on time there was a lot in what winslade had hinted officers on halfpay were easy to obtain to crew a kings ship without the urgency of a war or the pressgang was something else entirely had undine been sailing in betterknown waters things might have been different and had bolitho been a man other than himself he might have been tempted to keep her destination a secret until he had signed on sufficient hands and it was too late for them to escape he had had the usual floweryworded handbills distributed around the port and nearby villages he had sent recruiting parties as far inland as guildford on the portsmouth road but with small success and now as he followed the messenger towards some high gilded doors he knew undine was still fifty short of her complement in one thing bolitho had been more fortunate undines previous captain had kept a shrewd eye on his ships professional men bolitho had taken charge to discover that undine still carried the hard core of senior men the warrant officers a first class sailmaker and one of the most economical carpenters he had ever watched at work his predecessor had quit the navy for good to seek a career in parliament or as he had put it ive had a bellyful of fighting with iron from now on my young friend ill do it with slander rear admiral sir john winslade was standing with his back to a fire his coattails parted to allow the maximum warmth to reach him few people knew much about him he had distinguished himself vaguely in some singleship action off brest and had then been neatly placed inside the admiralty there was nothing about his pale austere features to distinguish him in any way in fact he was so ordinary that his goldlaced coat seemed to be wearing him rather than the other way round bolitho was twentyseven and a half years old but had already held two commands and knew enough about senior officers not to take them at face value winslade let his coattails drop and waited for bolitho to reach him he held out his hand and said you are punctual it is just as well we have much to discuss he moved to a small lacquered table some claret i think he smiled for the first time it was like the sunlight in whitehall frail and easily removed he pulled up a chair for bolitho your health captain he added i suppose you know why i asked for you to be given this command bolitho cleared his throat i assumed sir that as captain stewart was entering politics that you required another for winslade gave a wry smile please bolitho modesty at the expense of sincerity is just so much tophamper i trust you will bear that in mind he sipped at his claret and continued in the same dry voice for this particular commission i have to be sure of undines captain you will be on the other side of the globe i have to know what you are thinking so that i can act on such despatches as i might receive in due course bolitho tried to relax thank you he smiled awkwardly i mean for your trust sir quite so winslade reached for the decanter i know your background your record especially in the recent war with france and her allies your behaviour when you were on the american station reads favourably a full scale war and a bloody rebellion inamerica must have been a good schoolroom for so young a commander but that war is done with it is up to us he smiled slightly some of us to ensure that we are never forced into such a helpless stalemate again bolitho exclaimed we did not lose the war sir we did not win it either that is more to the point bolitho thought suddenly of the last battle the screams and yells on every side the crash of gunfire and falling spars so many had died that day so many familiar faces just swept away others had been left like the two ragged soldiers to fend as best they could he said quietly we did our best sir the admiral was watching him thoughtfully i agree you may not have won a war but you did win a respite of sorts a time to draw breath and face facts you think the peace will not last sir an enemy is always an enemy bolitho only the vanquished know peace of mind oh yes we will fight again be sure of it he put down his glass and added sharply now about your ship are you prepared bolitho met his gaze i am still short of hands but the ship is as ready as she will ever be sir i had her warped out of the dockyard two days ago and she is now anchored at spithead awaiting final provisioning how short two words but they left no room for manoeuvre fifty sir but my lieutenants are still trying to gather more the admiral did not blink i see well its up to you in the meantime i will obtain a warrant for you to take some volunteers from the prison hulks in portsmouth harbour bolitho said its a sad thing that we must rely on convicts they are men that is all you require at the moment as it is you will probably be doing some of the wretches a favour most of em were to be transported to the penal colonies in america now with america gone we will have to look elsewhere for new settlements there is some talk of botany bay in new holland but it may be rumour of course he stood up and walked to a window i knew your father i was saddened to hear of his death while you were in the west indies i believe he did not wait for a reply this mission would have been well cut for him something to get his teeth into selfdependence decisions to be made on the spot which could make or break the man in command everything a young frigate captain dreams of right yes sir he pictured his father as he had last seen him the very day he had sailed for the indies in phalarope a tired broken man made bitter by his other sons betrayal hugh bolitho had been the apple of his eye four years older than richard he had been a born gambler and had ended in killing a brother officer in a duel worse he had fled to america to join the revolutionary forces and later to command a privateer against the british it had been that knowledge which had really killed bolithos father no matter what the doctor had said he tightened his grip on his glass much of his prize money had gone into buying back land which his father had sold to pay hughs debts but nothing could buy back his honour it was fortunate that hugh had died if they had ever met again bolitho imagined he might kill him for what he had done more claret winslade seemed absorbed with his own thoughts im sending you to madras there you will report to well it will be in your final orders no sense in idle gossip he added just in case you cannot get your ship manned eh ill get them sir if i have to go to cornwall i hope that will not be necessary winslade changed tack again during the american campaign you probably noticed that there was little cooperation between military and civilian government the forces on the ground fought the battles and confided in neither that must not happen again the task i am giving you would be better handled by a squadron with an admirals flag for good measure but it would invite attention and that parliament will not tolerate in this uneasy peace he asked suddenly where are you staying in london the george at southwark i will give you an address a friends residence in st jamess square he smiled at bolithos grave features come dont look so gloomy it is time you made your way in affairs and put the line of battle behind you your mission may bring you to eyes other than those of jaded flag officers get to know people it can do nothing but good i will send a courier with instructions for your first lieutenant he darted him a quick glance herrick i gather from your last ship yes sir it sounded like of course there had never been any doubt whom he would ask for if he got another ship well then mr herrick it is he can take charge of local matters ill need you in london for four days he hardened his tone as bolitho looked about to protest at least the admiral regarded bolitho for several seconds craving to get back to his ship uncertain of himself in these overwhelming surroundings it was all there and more besides as bolitho had entered the room it had been like seeing his father all those long years ago tall slim with that black hair tied at the nape of his neck the loose lock which hung above his right eye told another story once as he had raised his glass it had fallen aside to display a livid scar which ran high into the hairline winslade was glad about his choice there was intelligence on bolithos grave features and compassion too which even his service in seven years of war had not displaced he could have picked from a hundred captains but he had wanted one who needed a ship and the sea and not merely the security such things represented he also required a man who could think and act accordingly not one who would rest content on the weight of his broadsides bolithos record had shown plainly enough that he was rarely content to use written orders as a substitute for initiative several admirals had growled as much when winslade had put his name forward for command but he had got his way for winslade had the weight of parliament behind him which was another rarity he sighed and picked up a small bell from the table you go and arrange to move to the address i will give you i have much to do so you may as well enjoy yourself while you can he shook the bell and a servant entered with bolithos cocked hat and sword winslade watched as the man buckled the sword deftly around his waist same old blade eh he touched it with his fingers it was very smooth and worn and a good deal lighter than more modern swords bolitho smiled aye sir my father gave it to me after i know forget about your brother bolitho he touched the hilt again your family have brought too much honour for many generations to be brought down by one man he thrust out his hand take care i daresay there are quite a few tongues wagging about your visit here today bolitho followed the servant into the corridor his mind moving restlessly from one aspect of his visit to another madras another continent and that sounded like a mere beginning to whatever it was he was supposed to do every mile sailed would have its separate challenge he smiled quietly and reward he paused in the doorway and stared at the bustling people and carriages open sea instead of noise and dirt a ship a living vital being instead of dull pretentious buildings a hand touched his arm and he turned to see a young man in a shabby blue coat studying him anxiously what is it the man said quickly im chatterton captain i was once second lieutenant in the warrior seventyfour he hesitated watching bolithos grave face i heard you were commissioning sir i was wondering im sorry mr chatterton i have a full wardroom yes sir i had guessed as much he swallowed i could sign as masters mate perhaps bolitho shook his head it is only seamen i lack im afraid he saw the disappointment clouding the mans face the old warrior had been in the thick of it she was rarely absent from any battle and men had spoken her name with pride now her second lieutenant was waiting like a beggar he said quietly if i can help he thrust his hand into his pocket tide you over awhile thank you no sir he forced a grin not yet anyway he pulled up his coat collar as he walked away he called good luck captain bolitho watched him until he was out of sight it might have been herrick he thought any of us his majestys frigate undine tugged resentfully at her cable as a stiffening southeasterly wind ripped the solent into a mass of vicious whitecaps lieutenant thomas herrick turned up the collar of his heavy watchcoat and took another stroll across the quarterdeck his eyess slitted against a mixture of rain and spray which made the taut rigging shine in the poor light like black glass despite the weather there was still plenty of activity on deck and alongside in the pitching store boats and water lighters here and there on the gangways and right forward in the eyes of the ship the red coats of watchful marines made a pleasant change from the mixtures of dull grey elsewhere the marines were supposed to ensure that the traffic in provisions and lastmoment equipment was one way and none was escaping through an open port as barter for cheap drink or other favours with friends ashore herrick grinned and stamped his feet on the wet planking they had done a lot of work in the month since he had joined the ship others might curse the weather the uncertainties offered by a long voyage the prospect of hardship from sea and wind but not he the past year had been far more of a burden for him and he was glad no thankful to be back aboard a kings ship he had entered the navy when he was still a few weeks short of twelve years old and these last long months following the signing of peace with france and the recognition of american independence had been his first experience of being away from the one life he understood and trusted unlike many of his contemporaries herrick had nothing but his own resources to sustain him he came of a poor family his father being a clerk in their home town of rochester in kent when lie had gone there after paying off the phalarope and saying his farewell to bolitho he had discovered things to be even worse than he had expected his fathers health had deteriorated and he seemed to be coughing his life away day in day out herricks only sister was a cripple and incapable of doing much but help her mother about the house so his homecoming was seen in rather different ways from his own sense of rejection a friend of his fathers employer had gained him an appointment as mate in a small brig which earned a living carrying general cargo up and down the east coast and occasionally across the channel to holland the owner was a miserly man who kept the brig so shorthanded that there were barely enough men to work ship let along handle cargo load lighters and keep the vessel in good repair when he had received bolithos letter accompanied by his commission from the admiralty charging him to report on board undine he had been almost too stunned to realise his good fortune he had not seen bolitho since that one last visit to his home in falmouth and perhaps deep inside he had believed that their friendship which had strengthened in storm and under bloody broadsides would be no match for peace their worlds were after all too far apart bolithos great stone house had seemed like a palace to herrick his background his ancestry of seafaring officers put him in a different sphere entirely herrick was the first in his family to go to sea and that was the least of their differences but bolitho had not changed when they had met on this same quarterdeck a month ago he had known it with that first glance it was still there the quiet sadness which could give way to something like boyish excitement in the twinkling of an eye above all bolitho too was pleased to be back keen to test himself and his new ship whenever a chance offered itself a midshipman scuttled over the deck and touched his hat cutters returning sir he was small pinched with cold he had been aboard just three weeks thank you mr penn thatll be some new hands i hope he eyed the boy unsympathetically now smarten yourself the captain may be returning today he continued his pacing bolitho had been in london for five days it would be good to hear his news to get the order to sail from this bitter solent he watched the cutter lifting and plunging across the whitecaps the oars moving sluggishly despite the efforts of the boats coxswain he saw the cocked hat of john soames the third lieutenant in the sternsheets and wondered if he had had any luck with recruits in the phalarope herrick had begun his commission as third lieutenant rising to bolithos secondincommand as those above him died in combat he wondered briefly if soames was already thinking of his own prospects in the months ahead he was a giant of a man and in his thirtieth year three years older than herrick he had got his commission as lieutenant very late in life and by a roundabout route mostly as far as herrick could gather in the merchant service and later as masters mate in a kings ship tough selftaught he was hard to know a suspicious man quite different from villiers davy the second lieutenant as his name suggested he was of good family with the money and proud looks to back up his quicksilver wit herrick was not sure of him either but told himself that any dislike he might harbour was because davy reminded him of an arrogant midshipman they had carried in phalarope feet thumped on deck and he turned to see triphook the purser crouching through the drizzle a bulky ledger under his coat the purser grimaced evil day mr herrick he gestured to the boats alongside god damn those thieves theyd rob a blind man so they would herrick chuckled not like you pursers eh triphook eyed him severely he was stooped and very thin with large yellow teeth like a mournful horse i hope that was not seriously meant sir herrick craned over the dripping nettings to watch the cutter hooking on to the chains god their oarsmanship was bad bolitho would expect far better and before too long he snapped easy mr triphook but i was merely reminding you i recall we had a purser in my last ship a man called evans he lined his pockets at the peoples expense gave them foul food when they had much to trouble them in other directions triphook watched him doubtfully what happened captain bolitho made him pay for fresh meat from his own purse cask for cask with each that was rotten he grinned so be warned my friend hell have no cause to fault me mr herrick he walked away his voice lacking conviction as he added you can be certain of that lieutenant soames came aft touching his hat and scowling at the deck as he reported five hands sir ive been on the road all day im fair hoarse from calling the tune of those handbills herrick nodded he could sympathise he had done it often enough himself five hands they still needed thirty even then it would not allow for death and injury to be expected on any long voyage soames asked thickly any more news none just that we are to sail for madras but i think it will be soon now soames said good riddance to the land i say streets full of drunken men prime hands we could well do with he hesitated with your permission i might take a boat away tonight and catch a few as they reel from their damn ale houses eh they turned as a shriek of laughter echoed up from the gun deck and a woman her breasts bare to the rain ran from beneath the larboard gangway she was pursued by two seamen both obviously the worse for drink who left little to the imagination as to their intentions herrick barked tell that slut to get below or ill have her thrown over the side he saw the astonished midshipman watching the spectacle with wideeyed wonder and added harshly mr penn jump to it i say soames showed a rare grin offend your feelings mr herrick herrick shrugged i know it is supposed to be the proper thing to allow our people women and drink in harbour he thought of his sister anchored in that damned chair what he would give to see her running free like that portsmouth trollop but it never fails to sicken me soames sighed half the bastards would desert otherwise signed on or not the romance of madras soon wears off when the rum goes short herrick said what you asked earlier i cannot agree it would be a bad beginning men taken in such a way would harbour plenty of grievances one rotten apple can sour a full barrel soames eyes him calmly it seems to me that this ship is almost full of bad apples the volunteers are probably on the run from debt or the hangman himself some are aboard just to see what they can lay their fingers on when we are many miles from proper authority herrick replied captain bolitho will have sufficient authority mr soames i forgot you were in the same ship there was a mutiny it sounded like an accusation not of his making he turned on him angrily be so good as to have the new men fed and issued with slop clothing he waited watching the resentment in the big mans eyes he added another of our captains requirements i suggest you acquaint yourself with his demands life will be easier for you soames strode away and herrick relaxed he must not let him get into his skin so easily but any criticism or even hint of it always affected him to herrick bolitho represented all the things he would like to be the fact he also knew some of his secret faults as well made him doubly sure of his loyalty he shook his head it was stronger even than that he peered over the nettings towards the shore seeing the walls of the harbour battery glinting like lead in the rain beyond portsmouth point the land was almost hidden in murk it would be good to get away his pay would mount up and go towards helping out at home with his share of prize money which he gained under bolitho in the west indies he had been able to buy several small luxuries to make their lot easier until his next return and when might that be two years it was better never to contemplate such matters he saw a ships boy duck into the rain to turn the hourglass beside the deserted wheel and waited for him to chime the hour on the bell time to send the working part of the watch below he grimaced the wardroom might be little better soames under a cloud of inner thought davy probing his guard with some new smart jest or other giles bellairs the captain of marines well on the way to intoxication by this time knowing his hefty sergeant could deal with the affairs of his small detachment triphook probably brooding over the issue of clothing to the new men typical of the purser he could face the prospect of a great sea voyage with each league measured in salt pork and beef ironhard biscuit juice to prevent scurvy beer and spirits to supplement fresh water which would soon be alive in its casks and all the thousand other items under his control with equanimity but one small issue of clothing while they still wore what they had come aboard in was too much for his sense of values he would learn he grinned into the cold wind they all would once bolitho brought the ship alive more shouts from alongside and penn the midshipman called anxiously beg pardon sir but i fear the surgeon is in difficulties herrick frowned the surgeons name was charles whitmarsh a man of culture but one with something troubling him most ships surgeons in herricks experience had been butchers nobody else would go to sea and face the horrors of mangled men screaming and dying after a savage battle with the enemy in peacetime he had expected it might be different whitmarsh was a drunkard as herrick peered down at the jolly boat as it bobbed and curtsied at the chains he saw a boatswains mate and two seamen struggling to fit the surgeon into a bowline to assist his passage up the side he was a big man almost as large as soames and in the grey light his features shone with all the brightness of a marines coat herrick snapped have a cargo net lowered mr penn it is not dignified but neither is this by god whitmarsh landed eventually on the gun deck his hair awry his face set in a great beaming smile one of his assistants and two marines lifted him bodily and took him aft below the quarterdeck he would sleep in his small sickbay for a few hours and then begin again penn asked nervously is he unwell sir herrick looked at the youth gravely a thought tipsy lad but well enough to remove a limb or two i daresay he relented and touched his shoulder go below your relief will be up soon he watched him hurry away and grinned it was hard to recall that he had been like penn unsure frightened with each hour presenting some new sight and sound to break his boys illusions a marine yelled guardboat shovin off from the sallyport sir herrick nodded very well that would mean orders for the undine he let his gaze move forward between the tall spiralling masts with their taut maze of shrouds and rigging the neatly furled canvas and to the bowsprit below which undines beautiful fullbreasted figurehead of a waternymph stared impassively to every horizon it also meant that bolitho would be returning today and for thomas herrick that was more than enough free of the land captain richard bolitho stood in the shelter of the stone wall beside the sallyport and peered through the chilling drizzle it was afternoon but with the sky so overcast by low cloud it could have been much later he was tired and stiff from the long coach ride and the journey had been made especially irritating by his two jovial companions businessmen from the city of london they had become more loudvoiced after each stop for change of horses and refreshment at the many inns down the portsmouth road they were off to france in a packet ship to contact new agencies there and so with luck expand their trade to bolitho it was still hard to accept just a year back the channel had been the only barrier between this country and their common enemy the moat the last ditch as some newssheet had described it now it seemed as if it was all forgotten by such men as his travelling companions it had become merely an irritating delay which made their journey just so much longer he shrugged his shoulders deeper inside his boatcloak suddenly impatient for the last moments to pass so that he could get back to the ship the cloak was new from a good london tailor rear admiral winslades friend had taken him there and managed to do so without making bolitho feel the complete ignoramus he smiled to himself despite his other uncertainties he would never get used to london too large too busy where nobody had time to draw breath and noisy no wonder the rich houses around st jamess square had sent servants out every few hours to spread fresh straw on the roadway the grinding roar of carriage wheels was enough to wake the dead it had been a beautiful house his hosts charming if slightly amused by his questions even now he was still unsure of their strange ways it was not just enough to live in that fine fashionable residence with its splendid spiral staircase and huge chandeliers to be right you had to live on the best side of the square the east side winslades friends lived there bolitho smiled again they would bolitho had met several very influential people and his hosts had given two dinner parties with that in mind he knew well enough from past experience that without their help it would have been impossible aboard ship a captain was next only to god in london society he hardly registered at ail but that was behind him now he was back his orders would be waiting and only the actual time of weighing anchor was left to conjecture he peered round the wall once more feeling the wind on his face like a whip the signal tower had informed undine of his arrival and very soon now a boat would arrive at the wooden pier below the wall he wondered how his coxswain allday was managing his first ship as captains coxswain but bolitho understood him well enough to know there was little to fear on his behalf it would be good to see him too something familiar a face to hold on to he glanced up the narrow street to where some servants from the george inn where the coach had finally come to rest were guarding his pile of luggage he thought of the personal purchases he had made maybe london had got some hold on him after all when bolitho had got his first command of the sloop sparrow during the american revolution he had had little time to acquaint himself with luxuries but in london with the remains of his prize money he had made up for it new shirts and some comfortable shoes this great boatcloak which the tailor had assured him would keep out even the heaviest downpour it had been partly winslades doing he was certain of that his host had casually mentioned that bolithos mission in undine required not merely a competent captain but one who would look the part no matter what sort of government official he might meet there was he had added gently a matter of wine together they had gone to a lowbeamed shop in st jamess street it was not a bit what bolitho might have imagined it had the sign of a coffee mill outside its door and the owners names pickering and clarke painted in gold leaf above it was a friendly place even intimate it could almost have been falmouth it was to be hoped the wine had already arrived aboard undine otherwise it was likely he would have to sail without it and leave a large hole in his purse as well it would be a strange and exciting sensation to sit in his cabin hundreds of miles from england and sample some of that beautiful madeira it would bring back all those pictures of london again the buildings the clever talk the way women looked at you once or twice he had felt uneasy about that it had reminded him bitterly of new york during the war the boldness in their faces the confident arrogance which had seemed like second nature to them an idler called yer boats acomin capn he touched his hat ill give ee a and he hurried away to call the inn servants his mind dwelling on what he might expect from a frigates captain bolitho stepped out into the wind his hat jammed well down over his forehead it was the undines launch her largest boat the oars rising and falling like gulls wings as she headed straight for the pier it must be a hard pull he thought otherwise allday would have brought the gig he found he was trembling and it was all he could do to prevent a grin from splitting his face in two the dark green launch the oarsmen in their checked shirts and white trousers it was all there like a homecoming the oars rose in the air and stood like twin lines of swaying white bones while the bowman made fast to the jetty and aided a smart midshipman to step ashore the latter removed his hat with a flourish and said at your service sir it was midshipman valentine keen a very elegant young man who was being appointed to the undine more to get him away from england than to further his naval advancement bolitho suspected he was the senior midshipman and if he survived the round voyage would probably return as a lieutenant at any rate as a man my boxes are yonder mr keen he saw allday standing motionless in the sternsheets his blue coat and white trousers flapping in the wind his tanned features barely able to remain impassive theirs was a strange relationship allday had come aboard bolithos last ship as a pressed man yet when the ship had paid off at the end of the war allday had stayed with him at falmouth servant guardian trusted friend now as his coxswain he would be ever nearby sometimes an only contact with that other remote world beyond the cabin bulkhead allday had been a seaman all his life but for a period when he had been a shepherd in cornwall where bolithos pressgang had found him an odd beginning bolitho thought of his previous coxswain mark stockdale a battered exprizefighter who could hardly speak because of his maimed vocal cords he had died protecting bolithos back at the saintes poor stockdale bolitho had not even seen him fall allday clambered ashore everythings ready captain a good meal in the cabin he snarled at one of the seamen grab that chest you oaf or ill have your liver the seaman nodded and grinned bolitho was satisfied alldays strange charm seemed to be working already he could curse and fight like a madman if required but bolitho had seen him caring for wounded men and knew his other side it was no wonder that the girls in farms and villages around falmouth would miss him better though for allday bolitho decided there had been rumours enough lately about his conquests then at last it was all done the boat loaded the idler and servants paid the oars sending the long launch purposefully through the tossing water bolitho sat in silence huddled in his cloak his eyes on the distant frigate she was beautiful in some ways more so than phalarope if that were possible only four years old she had been built in a yard at frindsbury on the river medway not far from herricks home one hundred and thirty feet long on her gun deck and built of good english oak she was the picture of a shipbuilders art no wonder the admiralty had been loath to lay her up in ordinary like so many of her consorts at the end of the war she had cost nearly fourteen thousand pounds as bolitho had been told more than once not that he needed to be reminded he was lucky to get her there was a brief break in the scudding clouds and the watery light played down along undines gun ports to her clean sheathing as she rolled uneasily in the swell best anglesey copper stout enough for anything bolitho recalled what her previous captain stewart had confided in a fierce skirmish off ushant he had been raked by heavy guns from a french seventyfour undine had taken four balls right on her waterline she had been fortunate to reach england afloat frigates were meant for speed and hitandrun fighting not for matching metal with a line of battleship bolitho knew from his own grim experience what that could do to so graceful a hull stewart had added that despite careful supervision he was still unsure as to the perfection of the repairs with the copper replaced it took more than internal inspection to discover the true value of a dockyards overhaul copper protected the hull from many sorts of weed and clinging growth which could slow a ship to a painful crawl but behind it could lurk every captains real enemy rot rot which could change a perfect hull into a ripe treacherous trap for the unwary admiral kempenfelts own flagship the royal george had heeled over and sunk right here in portsmouth just two years ago with the loss of hundreds of lives it was said that her bottom had fallen clean away with rot if it could happen to a lofty firstrate at anchor it would do worse to a frigate bolitho came out of his thoughts as he heard the shrill of boatswains calls above the wind the stamp of feet as the marines prepared to receive him he stared up at the towering masts the movement of figures around the entry port and above in the shrouds they had had a month to get used to seeing him about the ship except for the unknown quantity the newly recruited part of the company they might be wondering about him now what he was like too harsh or too easygoing to them once the anchor was catted he was everything good or bad skilful or incompetent there was no other ear to listen to their complaints no other voice to reward or punish easy all allday stood half poised the tiller bar in his fist toss your oars the boat thrust forward and the bowman hooked on to the main chains at the first attempt bolitho guessed that allday had been busy during his stay in london he stood up and waited for the right moment knowing allday was watching like a cat in case he should slip between launch and ship or worse tumble backwards in a welter of flailing arms and legs bolitho had seen it happen and recalled his own cruel amusement at the spectacle of his new captain arriving aboard in a dripping heap then with the spray barely finding time to catch his legs he was up and on board his ears ringing to the shrill of calls and to the slap of marines muskets while they presented arms he doffed his hat to the quarterdeck and nodded to herrick and the others good to be back mr herrick his tone was curt welcome aboard sir herrick was equally so but their eyes shone with something more than routine formality something which none of the others saw or shared bolitho removed his cloak and handed it to midshipman penn he turned to allow the fading light to play across the broad white lapels of his dress coat they would all know he was here he saw the few hands working aloft on last minute splicing others crowded on gangways and down on the main deck between the twin lines of black twelvepounder guns he smiled amused at his own gesture i will go below now i have placed the orders in your cabin sir herrick was bursting with questions it was obvious from his flat formal voice but his eyes those eyes which were so blue and which could look so hurt made a lie of his rigidity very well i will call you directly he made to walk aft to the cabin hatchway when he saw some figures gathered just below the quarterdeck rail in mixed garments they were in the process of being checked against a list by lieutenant davy he called new hands mr davy herrick said quietly we are still thirty under strength sir aye sir davy squinted up through the light drizzle his handsome face set in a confident smile i am about to get them to make their marks bolitho crossed to the ladder and ran down to the gun deck god how wretched they all looked halfstarved ragged beaten even the demanding life aboard ship could surely be no worse than what had made them thus he watched davys neat elegant hands as he arranged the book on top of a twelvepounders breech come along now make your marks they shuffled forward selfconscious awkward and very aware that their new captain was nearby bolithos eye stopped on the one at the end of the line a sturdy man wellmuscled and with a pigtail protruding from beneath his battered hat one prime seaman at least he realised bolitho was watching him and hurried forward to the gun davy snapped here now hold your damn eagerness bolitho asked your name he hesitated turpin sir davy was getting angry stand still and remove your hat to the captain damn your eyes if you know anything you should know respect but the man stood stockstill his face a mixture of despair and shame bolitho reached out and removed an old coat which turpin had been carrying across his right forearm he asked gently where did you lose your right hand turpin the man lowered his eyes i was in the barfear sir i lost it at the chesapeake in he looked up his eyes showing pride but only briefly gun captain i was sir davy interjected i am most sorry sir i did not realise the fellow was crippled i will have him sent ashore bolitho said you intended to sign the articles with your left hand is it that important turpin nodded im a seaman sir he looked round angrily as one of the recruited men nudged his companion not like some he turned back to bolitho his voice falling away i can do anything sir bolitho hardly heard him he was thinking back to the chesapeake the smoke and din the columns of wheeling ships like armoured knights at agincourt you never got away from it this man turpin had been nearby like hundreds of others cheering and dying cursing and working their guns like souls possessed he thought of the two fat merchants on the coach so men like that could grow richer he said harshly sign him on mr davy one hand from the old barfleur will be more use to me than many others he strode aft beneath the quarterdeck angry with himself and with davy for not having the compassion to understand it was a stupid thing to do pointless allday was carrying one of the chests aft to the cabin where a marine stood like a toy soldier beneath the spiralling deckhead lantern he said cheerfully that was a good thing you just did captain dont talk like a fool allday he strode past him and winced as his head grazed an overhead beam when he glared back at allday his coxswains homely features were quite expressionless he could probably do your work allday nodded gravely aye sir it is true that i am overtaxed damn your impertinence it was useless with allday i dont know why i tolerate you allday took his sword and walked with it to the cabin bulkhead i once knew a man in bodmin captain he stood back and studied the sword critically used to hammer a block of wood with a blunt axe he did i asked him why he didnt use a sharper blade and finish the job properly allday turned and smiled calmly he said that when the wood was broken hed have nothing to work his temper on bolitho sat down at the table thank you i must remember to get a better axe allday grinned my pleasure captain he strode out to fetch another chest bolitho pulled the heavy sealed envelope towards him with some education behind him allday might have become almost anything he slit open the envelope and smiled to himself without it he was quite bad enough herrick stepped into the cabin his hat tucked under one arm you sent for me sir bolitho was standing by the great stern windows his body moving easily with the ships motion undine had swung her stern to the change of tide and through the thick glass herrick could see the distant lights of portsmouth point glimmering and changing shape through the droplets of rain and spray in the pitching deckhead lanterns the cabin looked snug and inviting the bench seat around the stern was covered with fine green leather and bolithos desk and chairs stood out against the deck covering of black and white checked canvas like ripe chestnut sit down thomas bolitho turned slowly and looked at him he had been back aboard for over an hour reading and rereading his orders to ensure he would miss nothing he added we will weigh tomorrow afternoon i have a warrant in my orders which entitles me to accept volunteers from the convict hulks in portsmouth i would be obliged if you would attend to that as soon after first light as is convenient herrick nodded watching bolithos grave features noting the restless movements of his hands the fact that his carefully prepared meal lay untouched in the adjoining dining space he was troubled uncertain about something bolitho said we are to sail for teneriffe he saw herrick stiffen and added quietly i know thomas you are like me it comes hard to tack freely into a port where months back we could have expected a somewhat different welcome herrick grinned heated shot no doubt there we will embark two maybe three passengers after replenishing whatever stores we lack we will proceed without further delay to our destination madras he seemed to be musing aloud over twelve thousand miles long enough to get to know one another and our ship the orders state that we will proceed with all haste for that reason we must ensure our people learn their work well i want no delays because of carelessness or unnecessary damage to canvas and rigging herrick rubbed his chin a long haul aye thomas a hundred days that is what i intend he smiled the gravity fading instantly with your help of course herrick nodded may i ask what we are expected to accomplish bolitho looked down at the folded sheets of his orders i still know very little but i have read quite a lot between the lines he began to pace from side to side his shadow moving unevenly with the roll of the hull when the war ended thomas it was necessary to make concessions to restore a balance we had captured trincomalee in ceylon from the dutch the finest naval harbour and the best placed in the indian ocean the french admiral suffren captured it from us and when war ended gave it back to holland we have returned many west indian islands to france as well as her indian stations and spain well she has been given back minorca he shrugged many men on both sides died for nothing it seems herrick sounded confused but what of us sir did we get nothing out of all this bolitho smiled i believe we are about to do so hence the extreme secrecy and our vague orders concerning teneriffe he paused and looked down at the stocky lieutenant without trincomalee we are in the same position as before the war we still need a good harbour for our ships a base to control a wide area a steppingstone to expand the east indies trade herrick grunted id have thought the east india company had got all it wanted bolithos mind returned to the men on the coach others he had met in london there are those in authority who see power as the essential foundation of national superiority commercial wealth as a means to such power he glanced at a twelvepounder gun at the forward end of his cabin its squat outline masked by a chintz cover and war as the means to all three herrick bit his lip and we are to be the probe so to speak i may be quite wrong thomas but you must know my thinking just in case things go against us he remembered winslades words at the admiralty the task i anm giving yon would be better handled by a squadron he wanted someone he could trust or did he merely need a scapegoat should things go wrong bolitho had always complained bitterly about being tied to too strict orders his new ones were so vague that he felt even more restricted only one thing was clear he would take on board a mr james raymond at teneriffe and place the ship at his disposal raymond was a trusted government courier and would be carrying the latest despatches to madras herrick remarked it will take some getting used to but being at sea again in a ship such as undine will make a world of difference bolitho nodded we must ensure that our people are prepared for anything peace or no peace where we are going they may be less inclined to accept our views without argument he sat down on the bench and stared through the spattered glass i will speak with the other officers at eight bells tomorrow while you are in the hulks he smiled at herricks reflection i am sending you because you will understand youll not frighten them all to death he stood up quickly now thomas we will take a glass of claret herrick leaned forward that was a goodly selection you had sent from london sir bolitho shook his head we will save that for more trying times he lifted a decanter from its rack this is more usual to our tastes they drank their claret in comfortable silence bolitho was thinking how strange it was to be sitting quietly when the voyage which lay ahead demanded so much of all of them but it was useless to prowl about the decks or poke into stores and spirit rooms undine was ready for sea as ready as she could ever be he thought of his officers the extensions of his ideas and authority he knew little of any of them soames was a competent seaman but was inclinded to harshness when things did not go right immediately his superior davy was harder to know outwardly cool and unruffled he had a ruthless streak like many of his kind the sailing master was called ezekiel mudge a broad lump of a man who looked old enough to be his grandfather in fact he vas sixty and certainly the oldest master bolitho had met old mudge would prove to be one of the most important when they reached the indian ocean he had originally served in the east india company and had endured more storms shipwrecks pirates and a dozen other hazards than any man alive if his record was to be believed he had a huge beaked nose with the eyes perched on either side of it like tiny bright stones a formidable person and one who would be watching his captains seamanship for flaws bolitho was certain of that the three midshipmen seemed fairly average penn was the youngest and had come aboard three days after his twelfth birthday keen and armitage were both seventeen but whereas the former showed the same elegant carelessness as lieutenant davy armitage appeared to be forever looking over his shoulder a mothers boy four days after he had reported aboard with his gleaming new uniform and polished dirk his mother had in fact come to portsmouth to visit him her husband was a man of some influence and she had swept into the dockyard in a beautiful carriage like some visiting duchess bolitho had greeted her briefly and allowed her to meet armitage in the seclusion of the wardroom if she had seen the actual quarters where her child was to serve his months at sea she would probably have collapsed he had had to send herrick in the end to interrupt the embraces and the mothers plaintive sobs with a feeble excuse about armitage being required for duty duty he could hardly move abous the ship without falling headlong over a block or a ringbolt giles bellairs the debonair captain of marines was more like a caricature than a real person incredibly smart shoulders always rigidly squared he looked as if he had had his uniforms moulded around his limbs like wax he spoke in short clipped sentences and barely extended much beyond matters of hunting wildfowling and of course drill his marines were his whole life although he hardly ever seemed to utter much in the way of orders his massive sergeant coaker took care of the close contact with the marines and bellairs contented himself with an occasional carry on sarnt coaker or i say sarnt that fellahs like a bundle of old rags what he was one of the few people in bolithos experience who could get completely drunk without any outward change of expression triphook the purser appeared very competent if grudging with his rations he had taken a lot of care to ensure that the victualling yard had not filled the lower hold with rotten casks to be discovered too late to take action that in itself was rare bolithos thoughts came back to the surgeon he had been aboard for two weeks had he been able to get a replacement he would have done so whitmarsh was a drunkard in the worst sense sober he had a quiet even gentle manner drunk which was often he seemed to come apart like an old sail in a sudden squall he tightened his jaw whitmarsh would mend his ways or else feet scraped across the planks overhead and herrick said theres a few below decks tonight wholl be wondering if theyve done aright by signing on he chuckled too late now bolitho stared astern at the black swirling water hearing the urgent tide banging and squeaking around the rudder aye its a long step from land to sea far more so than most people realise he returned his glass to the rack i think i shall turn in now it will be a long day tomorrow herrick stood up and nodded ill bid you goodnight sir he knew full well that bolitho would stay awake for hours yet pacing and planning searching for lastminute faults possible mistakes in the arrangement of watchbills and delegation of duties bolitho would know he was aware of this fact too the door closed and bolitho walked right aft to lean his hands on the centre sill he could feel the woodwork vibrating under his palms the hull trembling all around him in time to the squeak of stays the clatter and slap of halliards and blocks who would watch them go would anyone care one more ship slipping down channel like hundreds before her there was a nervous tap at the door and noddall the cabin servant pattered into the lantern light a small man with the pointed face of an anxious rodent he even held his hands in front of him like two nervous paws yer supper sir youve not touched it he started to gather up the plates wont do sir it wont do bolitho smiled as noddall scampered away to his pantry he was so absorbed in his own little world it seemed as if he had not even noticed there was a change of command he threw his new cloak across his shoulders and left the cabin on the pitchdark quarterdeck he groped his way aft to the taffrail and stared towards the land countless lights and hidden houses he turned and looked along his ship the wind blowing his hair across his face the chill making him hold his breath the riding light reflected on the taut shrouds like pale gold and right forward he saw a smaller lantern where the lonely anchor watch kept a wary eye on the cable it felt different he decided no sentries on each gangway to watch for a sneak attack or a mass attempt at desertion no nets to delay a sudden rush of enemy boarders he touched a quarterdeck sixpounder with one hand it felt like wet ice but for how long he wondered the masters mate of the watch prowled past and then sheered away as he saw his captain by the rail alls well zur he called thank you bolitho did not know the mans name not yet in the next hundred days he would know more than their names he thought as they would about him with a sigh he returned to his cabin his hair plastered to his head his cheeks tingling from the cold there was no sign of noddall but the cot was ready for him and there was something hot in a mug nearby a minute after his head was or the pillow he was fast asleep the next day dawned as grey as the one before but overnight the rain had stopped and the wind held firm from the southeast all forenoon the work went on without relaxation the petty officers checking and rechecking their lists of names putting them to faces making sure seasoned hands were spaced among the untried and untrained bolitho dictated a final report to his clerk a driedup man named pope and then signed it in readiness for the last boat he found time to speak with his officers and seek out mr tapril the gunner in his magazine to discuss moving some of the spare gun parts and tackle further aft and help adjust the vessels trim until she had consumed some of her own stores to compensate for it he was changing into his seagoing coat with its faded lace and dull buttons when herrick entered the cabin and reported he had brought fifteen new man from the hulks what was it like herrick sighed it was a sort of hell sir i could have got treble the number a whole company of em if id been able to bring their women and wives too bolitho paused as he tied his neckcloth women in the hulks aye sir iierrick shuddered i hope i never see the like again very well sign them on but dont give them anything to do just yet i doubt theyve the strength to lift a marlin spike after being penned up like that a midshipman appeared in the open door mr davys respect sir his eyes darted around the cabin missing nothing and the anchors hove short thank you bolitho smiled next time stay awhile mr penn and have a better look the boy vanished and bolitho looked steadily at herrick well thomas herrick nodded firmly aye sir im ready its been a long wait they climbed up to the quarterdeck together and while herrick moved to the forward rail with his speaking trumpet bolitho stood aft a little apart from the others who were gathered restlessly at their stations clink clink clink the capstan was turning more slowly now the mens backs bent almost double as the hull pulled heavilyy on the anchor bolitho looked at the masters untidy shape beside the double wheel he had four helmsmen he was taking no chances it seemed with the helm or his new captains skill get the ship under way if you please he saw herricks trumpet moving once clear of this local shipping we will lay her on the larboard tack and steer souwest by west old mudge nodded heavily one eye hidden beyond the headland of a nose aye aye sir herrick yelled stand by on the capstan he shaded his eyes to peer up at the masthead pendant loose headsls the answering flap and clatter of released canvas made several new men peer round confused and startled a petty officer thrust a line into a mans hand and bellowed old it you bugger dont stand there like a bloody woman bolitho saw a bosuns mate right forward astride the bowsprit one arm circling above his head as the cable grew stiffer and more vertical beneath the gilded waternymph hands aloft loose topsls bolitho relaxed slightly as the nimblefooted topmen swarmed up the ratlines on either beam no sense in rushing it this first time the watching eyes ashore could think what they liked hed get no thanks for letting her drive ashore man the braces herrick was hanging over the rail his trumpet moving from side to side like a coachmans blunderbuss lively there mr shellabeer get those damned idlers aft on the double i say shellabeer was the boatswain a swarthy taciturn man who looked more like a spaniard than a devonian bolitho leaned back his hands on his hips watching the swift figures dashing out on the vibrating yards like monkeys it made him feel sick to watch their indifference to such heights first one then the next great topsail billowed and banged loosely in confusion while the seamen on the yards clung on calling to each other or jeering at their opposite numbers on the other masts anchors aweigh sir like a thing released from chains the frigate swung dizzily across the steep troughs men falling and slithering at the braces as they fought to haul the great yards round to cup the wind and master it lee braces there heave away herrick was hoarse bolitho gritted his teeth and forced himself to remain quite still as she plunged further and further astride the wind here and there a bosuns mate struck out with his rope starter or pushed a man bodily to brace or halliard then with a booming roar like thunder the sails filled and hardened to the winds steady thrust the deck canting over and holding steady as the helmsmen threw themselves on their spokes he made himself take a glass from midshipman keen and trained it across the starboard quarter keeping his face impassive even though he was almost shaking with excitement and relief the sail drill was very bad the placing of trained men too sketchy for comfort but they were away free of the land he saw a few people on the point watching them heel over on the larboard tack the top of a shining carriage just below the wall perhaps it was armitages mother weeping as she watched her offspring being taken from her the master shouted gruffly souwest by west sir full an bye when bolitho turned to answer him he saw that the master was nodding with something like approval thank you mr mudge we will get the courses on her directly he walked forward to join herrick at the rail his body angled steeply to the deck some of the confusion was being cleared with men picking their way amidst loose coils of rope like survivors from a battle herrick looked at him sadly it was terrible sir i agree mr herrick he could not restrain a smile but it will improve eh by late afternoon undine had beaten clear of the isle of wight and was standing well out in the channel by evening only her reefed topsails were visible and soon even they had disappeared a mixed gathering on the morning of the fourteenth day after weighing anchor at spithead bolitho was in his cabin sipping a mug of coffee and pondering for the countless time on what he had achieved the previous evening they had sighted the dull hump of teneriffe sprawled like a cloud across the horizon and he had decided to heaveto and avoid the hazards of a night approach fourteen days it felt an eternity they had been plagued by foul weather for much of that time flicking over the pages of his personal log he could see the countless frustrating entries headwinds occasional but fierce gales and the constant need to shorten sail to reef down and ride it out as best they could the dreaded bay of biscay had been kind to them that at least was a mercy otherwise with almost half the ships company too seasick to venture aloft or too terrified to scramble out along the dizzily pitching yards without physical violence being used on them it was likely undine might have reached no further bolitho appreciated what it must be like for many of his men shrieking winds overcrowded conditions in a creaking rolling hull where their food if they could face it often ended up in a mess of bilge water and vomit it produced a kind of numbness like that given to a man left abandoned in the sea for a while he strikes out bravely swimming he knows not where until he is too exhausted too dazed to care he is without authority or any sort of guidance it is his turning point bolitho recognised all the signs well enough and knew it was the same sort of challenge for him give in to his own understanding and sympathy listen too much to excuses from his hardworked lieutenants and warrant officers and he would never regain control or be able to rally his company when the real pressure came he knew that many cursed him behind his back prayed for him to fall dead or vanish overboard in the night he saw their glances sensed their resentment as he pushed them through each day each hour of every one of those days sail drill and more drill against herricks watch while he himself made sure all engaged knew he was following their efforts he made the men on undines three masts race each other in their struggle to shorten or make more sail until finally he drove them even harder to work not in competition but as a gasping silently cursing team now as he sat with the mug in his hands he found some grudging satisfaction in what they had done what they had achieved together willingly or otherwise when undine dropped her anchor in the roads of santa cruz today the watching spaniards would see a semblance of order and discipline of efficiency which they had come to know and fear in times of war but if he had driven his company to the limit he had not spared himself either and he was feeling it despite the inviting rays of early sunshine which made reflections dance across the low deckhead barely a watch had passed without his going on deck to lend his presence lieutenant davy had little experience of handling a ship in foul weather but would learn given time soames was too prone to lose patience when faced with a disaster on deck he would knock some luckless seaman aside and leap into his place yelling youre useless id rather do it myself only herrick rode out the storm of bolithos persistent demands and bolitho felt sorry that his friend had been made to carry the brunt of the work it was too easy to punish men when in fact it was an officers fault for losing his own head or not being able to find the right words in the teeth of a raging gale herrick stood firmly between wardroom and lower deck and twixt captain and company there had even been two floggings something which he had hoped to avoid each case had been within the private world of the lower deck the first a simple one of stealing from another sailors small hoard of money the second far more serious had been a savage knifefight which had ended in a man having his face opened from ear to jaw it was still not certain if he would live a real grudge fight a momentary spark of anger caused by fatigue and constant work he did not really know in a welltrained ship of war it was likely he would never have heard about either case the justice of the lower deck was far more drastic and instant when their own world was threatened by a thief or one too fond of his knife bolitho despised captains who used authority without consideration for the misery it might entail who meted out savage punishment without getting to the root of the trouble and thereby avoiding it herrick knew how he felt when bolitho had first met him he had been the junior lieutenant in his ship a ship where the previous captain had been so severe so unthinkingly brutal with his punishments that the seeds of mutiny had been well and truly laid herrick knew better than most about such things and yet he had intervened personally to persuade bolitho to avoid the floggings it was their first real disagreement and bolitho had hated to see the sudden hurt in herricks eyes bolitho had said this is a new company it takes time to weld people together so that each can rely on his companion under all circumstances many are entirely ignorant of the navys ways and its demands they hate to see others getting away with crimes they themselves avoid at this stage we cannot allow them to split into separate groups old hands and the new recruits professional criminals and the weak ones who have no protection but to ally themselves with some other faction herrick had persisted but in peacetime sir maybe it takes all the longer we cant afford the luxury of finding out he had hardened his voice you know how i feel it is not easy the thief had taken his punishment without a whimper a dozen lashes at the gratings while undine had cruised along beneath a clearing sky some gulls throwing their shadows round and round across the tense drama below as he had read from the articles of war bolitho had looked along his command at the watching men in shrouds and rigging the sharp red lines of bellairs marines herrick and all the rest the second culprit had been a brute of a man called sullivan he had volunteered to a recruiting party outside portsmouth and had all the looks of a hardened criminal but he had served in a kings ship before and should have been an asset three dozen lashes little enough in the navys view for half killing a fellow seaman had he laid a hand on an officer he would have faced death rather than a flogging the actual punishment was terrible sullivan had broken down completely at the first blow across his naked back and as the boatswains mates took turns to lay the lash over his shoulders and spine he had wriggled and screamed like a madman his mouth frothing with foam his eyes like marbles in his distorted face mr midshipman armitage had almost fainted and some of those who had just recovered from their own sickness had vomited in unison despite the harsh shouts from their petty officers then it had ended the watching men giving a kind of sigh as they were dismissed below sullivan had been cut down and carried to whitmarshs sickbay where no doubt he had been restored by a plentiful ration of rum each day following the punishment as he had paced the quarterdeck or supervised a change of tack bolitho had felt the eyes watching him seeing him perhaps as enemy rather than commander he had told himself often enough that when you accepted the honour of command you carried all of it not just the authority and the pride of controlling a living vital ship but the knocks and kicks as well there was a tap on the door and herrick stepped into the cabin about another hour sir with your permission i will give the order to clew up all canvas except topsls and jib it will make our entrance more easy to manage have some coffee thomas he relaxed as herrick seated himself across the table i am burning to know what we are about herrick took a mug and tested the coffee with his tongue me too he smiled over the rim once or twice back there i thought we might never reach land yes i can feel for many of our people some will never have seen the sea let alone driver so far from england now they know that africa lies somewhere over the larboard bulwark that we are going to the other side of the earth some are even beginning to feel like seamen when just weeks back they had thumbs where their fingers should be herricks smile widened due to you sir i am sometimes very thankful that i hold no command or chance of one either bolitho watched him thoughtfully the rift was healed i am afraid the choice may not be yours thomas he stood up in fact i shall see that you get command whenever the opportunity offers itself if only to drive some of your wild idealism into the bilges they grinned at each other like conspirators now be off with you while i change into a better coat he grimaced to show our spanish friends some respect eh a little over an hour later gliding above her own reflection undine moved slowly towards the anchorage in the roads in the bright sunlight the island of teneriffe seemed to abound with colour and bolitho heard several of the watching seamen gasping with awe the hills were no longer hidden in shadow but danced on the glare with every shade and hue and everything was brighter and larger at least it appeared so to the new hands shimmering white buildings brilliant blue sea with beaches and surf to make a man catch his breath and stare allday stood aft by the cabin hatch and remarked ill bet some dond like to rake us as we come by bolitho ran his eye quickly along his ship trying to see her as those ashore would she looked very smart and gave little hint of the sweat and effort which had gone to make her so the best ensign fluttered from the gaff the scarlet matching that of the marines swaying lines athwart the quarterdeck on the larboard gangway tapril the gunner was having a last hurried discussion with his mates in readiness to begin a salute to the spanish flag which flew so proudly above the headland battery old mudge was beside the wheel hands hidden in the folds of his watchcoat he seemed to retain the same clothing no matter what the weather might do hot or cold rain or fine he kept a variety of instruments and personal items in his capacious pockets and bolitho guessed that sometime long past he had been made to rush on deck and stay there with half of his things still scattered around his cabin he growled to the helmsmen and they edged the wheel over a few spokes the main topsail filling and then drooping again as the ship idled beneath the lands protection herrick trained his glass on the land and then said passing the point now sir very well bolitho waved his hand to tapril begin the salute and as the english frigate continued slowly towards her anchorage the frail morning air shook and trembled to the regular crash of cannon fire gun for gun the spanish replied the smoke hanging almost motionless above the shallowing water bolitho gripped his hands together behind him feeling the sweat exploring his spine under his heavy dress coat and making one of his new shirts cling like a wet towel it was strange to stand so impassively as the slow barrage went on around him like some trick or dream at any moment he halfexpected to see the bulwark blast apart or a ball to come screaming amongst the rigid marines and cut them to a bloody gruel the last shot hammered his ears and as the drifting smoke moved away from the decks he saw another frigate anchored at the head of the roads spanish larger than undine her colours and pendants very bright against the green shore beyond her captain too had probably been remembering he thought he glanced up at the masthead pendant as it whipped halfheartedly in the breeze soon now more orders a new piece to fit into the puzzle mudge blew his great nose loudly a thing he always did before carrying out some part of his duties ready sir very well man the braces hands wear ship if you please bare feet padded across the newlyscrubbed decks in a steady rush to obey his repeated order and bolitho breathed out slowly as each man reached his station without mishap topsl sheets the flag above the battery dipped in the glare and then returned to its proper place some small boats were shoving off from the land and bolitho saw that many were loaded with fruit and other items for barter with all their bread ruined in the first storm and few fresh fruits to rival those in the boats triphook the purser would be busy indeed topsl clew lines a boatswains mate shook his fist at some anonymous figure on the fore topsail yard yew clumsy bugger you old on with one and or yewll never see yer dozy again bolitho watched the narrowing strip of water his eyes half closed against the searing glare helm alee he waited as with dignity undine turned quietly into the wind her remaining canvas shivering violently let go there was a yell from forward followed by a splash as the anchor plunged down beneath the golden figurehead herrick waited until the last of the canvas had vanished as if by magic along the yards and said they did quite well i thought sir bolitho watched him holding back the smile then relent ing he replied quite well mr herrick herrick grinned youll not need the gig today sir a boats heading out to us in fine style allday strode forward and presented bolithos sword he frowned and muttered not the gig captain he sounded aggrieved bolitho held out his arms to allow the coxswain to buckle the belt around his waist not this time allday it was terrible how both herrick and allday watched over his every move the marines were stamping and shuffling into a new formation by the entry port sergeant coakers face shining beneath his black shako like a great sweating fruit bolitho turned to watch the approaching launch a grand affair with a gilded and canopied cockpit beside it alldays poor gig would look like a falmouth harbour boat a resplendent officer stood watching the anchored frigate a scroll under one arm the usual welcoming words the first link to w hatever lay ahead he said quietly you will remain aboard mr herrick mr davy will accompany me ashore he ignored the obvious disappointment take good care of matters here and make certain our people are ready for anything herrick touched his hat aye aye sir he hurried away to tell davy of his good fortune bolitho smiled gravely with shore boats and other temptations it would need all of herricks skill to keep the ship from being swamped by traders and less respectable visitors he heard flerrick say sojou are to accompany the captain mr davy davy hesitated gauging the moment and herricks mood then he said calmly a wise choice if i may say so mr herrick bolitho turned away hiding his smile as herrick snapped well you are damn little use here are you then as the four minute drummer boys struck up with their flutes and drums hearts of oak and bellairs sweating guard presented muskets bolitho stepped forward to greet his visitor the governors residence was well situated on a gently sloping road above the main anchorage on his way from the ship by barge and carriage bolitho was relieved to discover that his official escort a major of artillery spoke very little english and contented himself wtih occasional exclamations of pleasure whenever they passed anything unusual it was obvious that everything was well planned and that from the moment undines topgallants had been sighted the previous evening things had begun to move bolitho barely remembered meeting the governor a bearded courteous man who shook his hand received bolithos formal greetings on behalf of king george and who then withdrew to allow an aide to conduct the two british officers to another room davy who was not easily impressed whispered by god sir the dons live well no wonder the treasure ships stop here en route for spain a ready market for em i would think the room into which they were ushered was spacious indeed long and cool with a tiled floor and a plentiful selection of wellcarved furniture and handsome rugs there was one huge table in the centre made entirely of marble it would take seven gun crews to move it bolitho decided there were about a dozen people standing around the table arranged he thought so that without wasting time he could distinguish those who counted from those who did not the man he guessed to be james raymond stepped forward and said quickly i am raymond captain welcome we had expected you earlier perhaps he spoke very abruptly afraid of wasting time unsure of himself it was hard to tell he was in his early thirties well dressed and had features which could pass as handsome but for his petulant frown he said and this is don luis puigserver his most catholic majestys personal emissary puigserver was a sturdy man with biscuitcoloured features and a pair of black eyebrows which dominated the rest of his face he had hard eyes but there was charm too as he stepped forward and took bolithos hand a pleasure capstan you have a fine ship he gestured to a tall figure by the window capstan alfonso triarte of the nervion had much praise for the way she behaved bolitho looked at the other man very senior he would be to command the big frigate in the roads he returned bolithos examination without much show of pleasure like two dogs who have fought once too often perhaps he forgot all about triarte as the emissary said smoothly i will be brief you will wish to return to your ship to make last arrangements for sailing to our destination bolitho watched him curiously there was something very compelling about the man his stocky figure his legs which looked so muscled despite the fine silk stockings even the rough handshake could not disguise his confident assurance no wonder the governor had been quick to pass bolitho on to him puigserver obviously commanded respect he snapped his spatulate fingers and a nervous aide hurried forward to take bolithos hat and sword another beckoned to some servants and in minutes everyone was seated around the altarlike table a beautifully cut goblet at his elbow only puigserver remained standing he watched the servants filling the goblets with sparkling wine his face completely unruffled but when bolitho glanced down he saw one of his feet tapping very insistently on the tiled floor he raised his glass gentlemen to our friendship they stood up and swallowed the wine it was excellent and bolitho had a mental picture of his own doubts and fumblings in the shop at st jamess street puigserver continued little came out of the war but a need to avoid further bloodshed i will not waste our time by making empty promises which i cannot keep but i can only hope that we may further our separate causes in peace bolitho glanced quickly at the others raymond leaning back in his chair trying to appear relaxed but as taut as a spring the spanish captain looking at his wine eyes distant most of the others had the empty expressions of those who pretend to understand when in fact they do not it seemed likely to bolitho that they only understood one word in ten davy sat stiffly on the opposite side of the table his clean features glowing with heat his face set in a mask of formality it all boiled down to the three of them don luis puigserver raymond and himself the former said thankfully spain has received back minorca and certain other islands as concessions following the unfortunate war his eyes rested on bolitho very briefly dark almost black they were like spanish olives in return his most catholic majesty has seen fit to bless this new venture between us he looked at raymond perhaps you would be good enough to expand the details yes raymond made to stand up and changed his mind as you will know captain bolitho the french admiral suffren was responsible for many attacks on our ships and possessions in the east indies and india itself holland and spainhe hesitated as ca pitaa triarte coughed gentlywere frances allies but they had not the available squadrons and men to protect their possessions in that area suffren did it for them he captured trincomalee from us and restored it to the dutch after the war there were several other instances but you will know of most of them captain now in exchange for certain other considerations which need not concern you spain has agreed in principle to hand over to britain one of her remaining possessions in er borneo he eyed bolitho flatly which is where you will eventually be going of course of course it sounded so simple another two or three thousand miles added to their present voyage the way raymond spoke it could have been plymouth bolitho said quietly i am not certain i understand the purpose of all this puigserver interjected of that i am sure capitan he glanced coldly at raymond let us be frank to avoid further trouble in this uneasy truce for that is what it is we must move with caution the french gained next to nothing in the indies despite all their efforts and they are how you say touchy about any swift expansions around their dwindling influence there your final destination will be teluk pendang a fine anchorage a commanding position for any country with the will to expand elsewhere in that area a bridge to empire as some greek once remarked bolitho nodded i see senor he did not nor had he even heard of the place mentioned raymond said sharply when peace was signed last year our government despatched the frigate fortunate to madras with the bones of this present agreement in her care on her way around the cape of good hope she met with two of suffrens frigates which were returning to france naturally enough they knew nothing of the peace and fortunates captain was given no time to explainthe point they fought and fortunate so battered one of the enemy that she took fire and sank unfortunately she too was set ablaze and was lost with most of her company bolitho could picture the scene three ships on an open sea countries at peace at last but their captains eager to fight as they had been conditioned to do however one of the french captains the surviving one was a veteran called le chaumareys one of frances best bolitho smiled i have heard of him raymond seemed flustered yes i am sure of it well it is believed in some quarters that france through le chaumareys now knows about this arrangement we are making with spain if that is so then france will be troubled at the prospect of our gaining another possession one which she fought for on spains behalf bolitho did understand now all the veiled remarks at the admiralty the secrecy no wonder one hint that england was about to push her way further into the east indies no matter for what outward reason and a war might burst out again like an exploding magazine he asked what are we to do raymond replied you will sail in company with the nervion he swallowed hard she will be the senior ship and you will act accordingly upon arrival at madras you will embark the new british governor and convey him with whatever forces he may have to his new destination teluk pendang i will accompany you with despatches for him and to advise in any way i can puigserver beamed at them his black eyebrows arched like great bows and i will be there to ensure that there is no nonsense from our people eh raymond added wearily the french have a fortyfourgun frigate in that area the argus it is said that le chaumareys is with her he knows the sunda isles and borneo as well as any european can bolitho breathed out slowly it was a good plan as far as it went a british squadron would invite an open battle sooner or later but two frigates one from each nation would be more than a match for the heavilyarmed argus both verbally and in artillery puigserver walked slowly to the broad window and stared down at the anchored ships a long voyage gentlemen but i hope a rewarding one for us all he turned towards bolitho his square face in shadow are you ready to sail again aye senor my people are preparing to take in more water and fresh fruit if that is possible it is being attended to capitan he showed his teeth i am sorry i cannot entertain you now but in any case this island is a dismal place if you come to bilbao he kissed his fingertips then i will show you how to live eh he laughed at raymonds grim features and i suspect we will all know ourselves much better after this voyage is done the spanish aides bowed politely as puigserver walked to the door and he called we will meet before we sail he turned away but tomorrow we raise our anchors come what may raymond walked round the table as the babble of conversation broke out again he whispered fiercely that damned fellow one more day with him and i would have told him a thing or two bolitho asked in which vessel will you be sailing mine is a fine ship but smaller by far than the spaniard raymond twisted round to watch the spanish captain who was discussing something with his companions in a low voice sail in the nervion if your ship were a damned collier brig id take her in preference davy whispered i think they expect us to leave sir raymond scowled i will come to your ship and arrange things there where no ears listen even to ones breathing bolitho saw his escort waiting outside the door and smiled to himself raymond seemed to have a very vital role in things tact however was beyond him they returned to the jetty with hardly a word but bolitho was very conscious of the tension within the man raymond on a knife edge tortured by something his work was overreaching him perhaps as the scarletcoated oarsmen propelled the governors barge towards undine bolitho felt a sense of relief a ship he could understand raymonds life was as alien as the moon raymond clambered up from the barge and stared vaguely at the assembled sideparty at the comings and goings of undines seamen as they worked the tackles on the opposite side casks and nets of fruit and straw hats to protect the unwary from sunburn bolitho nodded to herrick all well he touched raymonds arm mr raymond will be a passenger with us he turned sharply as he heard a shrill of laughter from the cabin hatch who let that woman on board in gods name mr herrick this is not the nore or portsmouth point then he saw the girl small and dark in a bright red dress she was talking to allday who was obviously enjoying himself raymond said heavily i had hoped to explain earlier captain that girl is a maidservant my wifes maid he looked as if he was going to be sick herrick tried to dispel bolithos sudden anger she came out with her lady just an hour back sir she had authority he looked worried i had little choice in the matter i see bolitho strode aft all those thousands of miles in a small crowded shipofwar raymond was bad enough but his wife and a maid were too much he saw some seamen nudging each other they had probably been waiting just to see his reactions very calmly he said perhaps you would er introduce me mr raymond they went aft together and davy whispered gods teeth mr herrick what a mixed gathering we are fast becoming herrick glared at him and i suppose you have been out there damn well enjoying yourself a little wine some fair company he chuckled but i thought too of you sir herrick grinned to hell with you get into your working clothes and help with this loading you need a million eyes today in the meantime bolitho had reached his cabin and stared at it in dismay there were boxes everywhere and clothing spilled across furniture and guns as if there bad been a violent robbery aboard mrs raymond was tall unsmiling and almost beside herself with anger her husband exclaimed you should have waited viola this is our captain bolitho bowed slightly richard bolitho maam i had just mentioned that a thirtytwogun frigate has barely the room for luxury however since you have chosen to sail with us i will do all that i can to he got no further chosen her voice was husky with scorn please do not delude yourself captain he does not wish me to travel in the nervion her mouth twisted in contempt he fears for ray safety when i am with spanish gentlemen bolitho noticed noddall hovering anxiously by the dinin compartment and snapped help mrs raymonds maid to stow all thishe looked round helplesslygear he save raymond slump down on the bench seat like a dying mad no wonder he looked troubled and pass the word for the first lieutenant he glanced around the cabin speaking his thoughts aloud we will have these twelvepounders removed temporarily and put quakers in their place that will allow a little more room raymond looked up dully quakers wooden muzzles they give an appearance that we are still fully armed he forced a smile quakers having an opposition to war herrick appeared by the door sir we will rig extra screens here mr herrick a larger sleeping compartment for our passengers to larboard i think mrs raymond said calmly for me and my maid if you please she looked at her husband he will bed elsewhere on this ship herrick studied her curiously but said mr raymond to starboard then and what about you sir bolitho sighed chart space he looked at the others we will dine together here if you agree nobody answered midshipman keen hovered by the door his eyes on the woman mr soamess respects sir and the captain of nervion is about to board us bolitho swung round and then gasped as his shin cracked against a heavy chest he said between his teeth i will endeavour to be hospitable mr herrick herrick kept his face blank i am certain of it sir it was early morning by the time bolitho had pulled himself wearily into his cot his mind still reeling from entertaining capitan triarte and some of his officers he had been made to go across to the nervion where the captain had again made a point of comparing the spacious comfort with undines overcrowded quarters it had not helped at all now the ship lay quiet again and he tried to picture mrs raymond who was sleeping beyond the newlyrigged screen he had seen her in the cabin when the spanish officers had come aboard aloof yet tempting with little to reveal her true feelings for her husband a dangerous woman to cross he thought how still the ship felt perhaps like himself everyone was too weary to move guns had been trundled away and lowered with difficulty into the holds more stores and heavy gear had had to be swayed aft to readjust the trim once again it was surprising how much larger the cabin looked without the guns there he groaned as his head found some new ache to offer him he would not see much of it though he turned his face to the pillow the sweat running across his chest with the effort one thing was certain he had rarely had better incentive for a fast passage he was up and about at first light eager to get his work done before the heat of the day made thinking more difficult in the afternoon to the distant strains of a military band and the cheers of a crowd along the waterfront undine weighed anchor and with nervion in the lead her great foresail displaying a resplendent cross of scarlet and gold worked clear of the roads before setting more canvas to the wind some small craft followed them across the glittering water but were soon outpaced by the graceful frigates by dusk they had the sea to themselves with only the stars for company death of a ship ezekiel mudge undines sailing master sat comfortably in one of bolithos chairs and peered at the chart which was laid across the desk without his hat he looked even older but there was assurance in his voice as he said this windll freshen in the next day or so sir you mark my words he tapped the chart with his own brass dividers which he had just fished from one of his pockets for now the noreast trades will suit us and well be up to the cape verde islands in a week with any luck he sat back and studied bolithos reactions much as i thought bolitho walked to the stern windows and leaned his hands on the sill it was hot like wood from a fire and beyond the frigates small frothing wake the sea was blinding in the glare his shirt was open to the waist and he could feel the sweat running down his shoulders a dryness in his throat like dust it was almost noon and herrick would be waiting for the midshipmen to report to him on the quarterdeck to shoot the sun for their present position a full week but for a few hours since they had sailed from santa cruz and daily the sun had pinned them down had defied the light airs which had tried to give them comfort today the wind had strengthened slightly and undine was ghosting along on the starboard tack with all sails drawing well there was little satisfaction in bolithos thoughts for undine had suffered her first casualty a young seaman who had fallen overboard just as darkness had been closing in the previous day signalling his intention to the spanish captain bolitho had gone about to begin a search for the luckless man he had been working aloft on the main topsail yard framed against the dying sunlight like a bronze statue had he been a raw recruit or some heavyhanded landsman it was likely he would still be alive but he had been too confident too careless perhaps for those last vital seconds as he had changed his position one cry as he had fallen and then his head had broken surface almost level with the mizzen his arms beating at the sea as he tried to keep pace with the ship davy had told him that the seaman was a good swimmer and that fact had given some hope they might pick him up they had lowered two boats and for most of the night had searched in vain dawn had found them on course again but to bolithos anger he had discovered that the nervion had made no attempt to shorten sail or stay in company and only in the last halfhour had the masthead reported sighting her topgallant sails once again the seamans death had been an additional thorn to prod at his determination to weld the ship together he had seen the spanish officers watching their first attempts at gun drill through their telescopes slapping their thighs with amusement whenever something went wrong which was often they themselves never drilled at anything they seemed to treat the voyage as a form of entertainment even raymond had remarked why bother with gun drill captain i do not know much about such matters but surely your men find it irksome in this damned heat he had replied it is my responsibility mr raymond i daresay it may be unnecessary for this mission but ill take no chances raymonds wife had kept aloof from all of them and during the day spent much of her time under a small awning which herricks men had rigged for her and the maid right aft by the taffrail whenever they met usually at meal times she spoke only briefly and then touched on personal matters which bolitho barely understood she appeared to enjoy hinting to her husband that he was too backward that he lacked assurance when it was most needed once he had heard her say hotly they ride right over you james how can i hold up my head in london when you suffer so many insults why margarets husband was knighted for his services and he is five years your junior and so on now as he turned to look at mudge he wondered what he and the others were thinking of their captain driving them all too hard and for no purpose making them turn to and work at those stubborn guns while aboard the spaniard the offwatch hands sprawled about sleeping or drinking wine like passengers as if reading his thoughts mudge said dont mind what some o the buggers are sayin sir youre young but youve a mind for the right thing if youll pardon the liberty he plucked at his great nose ive seen many a capn taken all aback cause he wornt ready when the time came he chuckled his small eyes vanishing into his wrinkles an as you well knows sir when things do go wrong its no blamed use slappin yer hip an blastin yer eye an blamin all else he tugged a watch the size of a turnip from an inner pocket i must away on deck if you can spare me sir mr errick likes me to be there when we compares our reckonin it seemed to amuse him as i said sir you stand firm you dont ave to like a capn but by god youve got to trust un he lumbered from the cabin his shoes making the deck creak as he passed bolitho sat down and tugged at his open shirt it was a beginning allday peered into the cabin can i send your servant in now captain he darted a glance at the table hell be wanting to get your meal laid bolitho smiled very well it was stupid to let small things prey on his mind but with mudge it was different important he had probably sailed with more captains than bolitho had met in his whole life they both looked round as midshipman keen stood in the doorway already he was well tanned and looked as healthy and fresh as a veteran sailor mr herricks respects sir masthead has just reported sighting another vessel ahead of the spaniard on a converging tack small maybe a brig i will come up bolitho smiled the voyage appears to agree with you mr keen the youth grinned aye sir though i fear my father sent me away for other reasons but my health as he hurried away allday murmured young devil that one got some poor girl into trouble ill wager bolitho kept his face impassive not like you of course allday he strode out past the sentry and climbed quickly to the quarterdeck even though he was expecting it the heat came down on him like the mouth of an open furnace he felt the deck seams sticking to his shoes the searing touch on his face and neck as he crossed to the weather side and looked along his command with her pale lightweight canvas bent on and her deck tilting to the wind undine was moving well spray leapt up and round the jib boom at irregular intervals and far above his head he saw the pendant streaming abeam like a thin whip mudge and herrick were muttering together their sextants gleaming in the sunlight like gold while two midshipmen armitage and penn compared notes their faces screwed in worried concentration soames was by the quarterdeck rail and turned as bolitho asked about this newcomer what is she do you reckon soames looked crushed with the heat his hair matted to his forehead as if he had been swimming some trader i expect sir he did not sound as if he cared maybe she intends to ask the spaniard for her position he scowled not that theyll know much bolitho took a glass from the rack and climbed into the mizzen shrouds moving it gradually he soon found the nervion far ahead on the larboard bow a picture of beauty under her great spread of canvas her hull gleaming in the sun like metal he trained the glass further to starboard and then held it steady on the other vessel almost hidden in heat haze but he could see the tancoloured sails well enough the uneven outline of her rig square on the fore foreandaft on the mainmast he felt vaguely angry a brigantine mr soames aye sir bolitho looked at him and then climbed back to the deck in future i want a full report of each sighting no matter how trivial it might appear at the time soames tightened his jaw sir herrick called it was my fault sir i should have told mr keen to pass a full description to you bolitho walked aft mr soames has the watch i believe herrick followed him well yes sir bolitho saw the two helmsmen stiffen as he moved to the compass the card was steady enough south by west and with plenty of sea room the african coast lay somewhere across the larboard beam over thirty leagues distant there was nothing on their ocean but the three ships coincidence a need to make contact perhaps soamess indifference pricked at his mind like a burr and lie snapped make certain our watchkeepers know what they are about mr herrick he saw keen leaning against the nettings send him aloft with a glass an untried eye might tell us more mudge ambled towards him and said gruffly near as makes no difference sir cape blanco should be abeam now he rubbed his chin the most westerly point o that savage continent an quite close enough if you ask me his chest went up and down to a small wheezing accompaniment it was as near as he ever got to laughing keens voice came down from the masthead deck there brigantine is still closing the nervionl herrick cupped his hands does she show any colours none sir herrick clambered into the shrouds with his own telescope after a while he called the dons dont seem worried sir mudge growled artily likely to be bothered about that little pot o paint is they bolitho said bring her up a point mr mudge it would be best if we regain company with our companion he turned as a voice asked are you troubled captain mrs raymond was standing by the trunk of the mizzen mast her face shadowed by a great straw hat which she had brought from teneriffe he shook his head merely curious maam in his crumpled shirt and breeches he felt suddenly clumsy im sorry there is not more to amuse you during the day she smiled things may yet improve deck there keens voice made them all look up the other vessel is going about sir herrick called hes right the brigantines going to cross clean over the dons bows he turned grinning broadly thatll make em hop about the grin vanished as a dull bang echoed and reechoed over the water keen yelled shes fired on the nervion a second bang reached the quarterdeck and he cried again and another he was almost screaming with excitement hes put a ball through her forecourse bolitho ran to the shrouds and joined herrick let me see he took the big glass and trained it on the two ships the brigantines shape had shortened and she was presenting her stern to him even as she idled across the frigates broader outline even at such a distance it was possible to see the confusion aboard the spanish frigate the glint of sunlight on weapons as her company ran to quarters herrick said hoarsely that brigantines master must be mad no one but a crazy man would cross swords with a frigate bolitho did not reply he was straining his eye to watch the little drama framed in his lens the brigantine had fired two shots one of which if not both had scored a mark now she was tacking jauntily away and it was evident as the nervion began to spread more sail that capitan triarte intended to give chase he said nervionll be up to her within the hour theyre both changing tack now perhaps that fool imagined nervion was a fat merchantman eh davy had arrived on deck but no it is not possible herrick followed bolitho down from the shrouds and watched him dubiously shall we join in the chase sir mudge almost pushed him aside as he barked chase be damned i say they looked at him we must stop that mad don sir he waved his big hand across the nettings off cape blanco sir theres a powerful great reef an it runs near on a undred miles to seaward nervions in risk now but if er master brings er up another point hell be across that damned reef afore e knows it bolitho stared at him get the royals on her mr herrick lively now he walked quickly to the helm we must make more speed soames called the dons come up another point by the look of her sir mudge was already squinting at the compass bowl jesus es steerin sousoueast he looked at bolitho imploringly well never catch im in time bolitho paced to the quarterdeck rail and back again weariness the scorching heat all was forgotten but that distant pyramid of white sails with the smaller willothewisp brigantine dancing ahead mad a confused pirate it made no difference now he snapped clear away a bow chaser mr herrick we will endeavour to distract the nervion herrick was peering aloft shading his eyes with his speaking trumpet as the topmen set the additional sails aye aye sir he yelled fetch mr tapril but the gunner was already forward supervising the crew of a long ninepounder bolitho said sharply nervions pulled over still further mr mudge he could not hide the anguish in his voice how could it be happening the sea so huge so empty and yet the reef was there he had heard of it before from men who had passed this way many good ships had foundered on its hard spine larboard gun ready sir fire it crashed out the brown smoke drifting downwind and dispersing long before the telltale waterspout lifted like a feather far astern of the other frigate another keep firing he looked at mudge bring her up a point mudge protested ill not be responsible sir no i will he strode forward to the rail again his shirt flapping open across his chest yet feeling no benefit from the wind when he looked up he saw the sails drawing firmly as would the spaniards with such power to drive her she would disembowel herself on the reef unless triarte acted and at once the deck shook as another ball whined and ricocheted across the blue water bolitho yelled masthead what are they doing the lookout replied his rougher voice leaving no doubt in bolithos mind th dons is gainin sir theyre runnin out their guns right this moment maybe the spaniards had heard the bow chaser even observed a fall of shot but imagined the stupid british were still exercising gunnery or perhaps they believed undine was so furious at missing the chase that bolitho was firing at this impossible range merely to take the edge off his temper he heard himself ask how long mr mudge mudge replied thickly she should ave struck sir that damned brigantine must ave crossed the reef in safety shell draw little enough im thinkin bolitho stared at him but if she got through then perhaps the master shook his head no chance sir a great yell came from the watching seamen in the bows when bolitho swung round he stared with horror as the spanish frigate lifted drove forward again and then slewed round on the hidden reef over and around her all her masts and yards the flailing sails and rigging splashed and cascaded in a chaos which was terrible to see so great was the impact that she had presented her larboard side to the reef and through the open gunports the water must now be surging in a triumphant flood while men trapped in the tangled rigging and broken spars floundered in terror or were being crushed by the cannon as they tore from their lashings the brigantine had changed tack she was not even pausing to watch the full extent of her work bolitho said harshly shorten sail mr herrick we will heaveto presently and get every boat in the water we must do all we can to save them he saw some of the men by the bow chasers pointing and chattering as nervion yawed still further on her side spilling more broken timber and shattered planking into the swell above the reef and get those hands to work mr herrick he swung away ill not have them watch others drown as if it was a days amusement he made himself cross the deck once more and when he looked towards the reef he almost expected to see nervions proud silhouette standing before the wind that this was a bad dream a nightmare but why why the question seemed to mock him to hammer at his brain how could it have happened id not venture any closer sir mudge was watching him grimly if we gets a shift of wind we could still run foul of the reef bolitho nodded heavily i agree he looked away and thank you mudge said quietly it wornt your fault you done all you could heave to mr herrick he could barely keep his voice level have the boats swayed out soarnes remarked a long pull sir near on three miles bolitho did not even hear him he was seeing the little brigantine it was no coincidence no rash act of the moment mudge said therell not be many sir he fumbled in his pockets theres sharks aplenty in these waters as undine came up into the wind her remaining sails thundering and flapping noisily in protest the boats were lowered with surprisingly little delay it was as if something had reached out across the three miles of smiling water to touch each and every one of them a plea for help a cry of warning it was difficult to define but as the first boat shoved off from the side and the seamen at the oars picked up the stroke bolitho saw that their faces were grim and suddenly determined as he had not seen them before allday said ill take the gig if i may captain yes their eyes met do what you can i will then he was gone yelling for his men warn the surgeon to be prepared mr herrick he saw the quick exchange of glances and added coldly and if he is the worse for drink i will have him flogged all the boats were away now while far beyond their busy oars he could see the remains of the other ship writhing on the invisible reef the great foresail with its red and gold crucifix still floating around the wreckage like a beautiful shroud bolitho began to pace up and down below the nettings his hands behind him his body swaying to the untidy motion as the ship rolled in each undulating trough he heard raymond say captain triarte was wrong he made a stupid error of judgement he paused and looked at him he has paid for it mr raymond raymond saw the contempt in bolithos grey eyes and walked away i was only saying but nobody looked at him herrick watched bolitho pacing back and forth and wished he could say something to ease his despair but better than most he knew that at such moments bolitho was the only one who could help himself hours later as the boats pulled wearily back towards their ship bolitho was still on deck his shirt dark with sweat his mind aching from his deliberations herrick reported no more than forty survivors sir some are in a bad way i fear he saw the question in bolithos eyes and nodded the surgeons ready sir i saw to that bolitho walked slowly to the nettings and craned over to watch the first boat the gig as it hooked on to the chains one man cradled against alldays legs and held firmly by two seamen was shrieking like a tortured woman a shark had taken a piece from his shoulder big enough to thrust a roundshot through he turned away sickened in gods name thomas send more hands to help those poor devils herrick said it is being done sir bolitho looked up at the flapping ensign at the gaff by heaven if this is how we behave in peace then i would we were at war he watched some of the oarsmen clambering aboard hands blistered backs and faces raw from the sun they said very little as they went below perhaps what they had seen at the reef had taught them more than drill and would act as a warning to all of them he began to pace again and to me bolitho strode into the cabin and paused below the skylight it was almost sunset and the open stern windows shone in the dying glare like burnished copper within the cabin the shadows bobbed this way and that to the frigates steady motion and the swinging deckhead lanterns and he watched the little group by the windows with something like disbelief don luis puigserver sat awkwardly on the bench seat one arm in a sling his chest and ribs encased in bandages when he had been dragged aboard with the other survivors a few hours earlier he had passed unrecognised until a gasping spanish lieutenant the only one of tervions officers to be rescued had managed to explain the truth then bolitho had thought it was too late the thickset spaniard had been unconscious and covered with angry scars and bruises the fact he had survived that long had been hard to accept when bolitho had recalled the nervions final destruction of the forty or so to reach undines protection ten had already died and several of the remainder were in a bad state crushed under falling spars half drowned by the inrush of water the nervions original complement of two hundred and seventy men had been totally unprepared for the horror which had awaited them on the reef while their vessel had foundered and smashed herself to pieces the surging waters had suddenly erupted in a maelstrom of dashing shapes as the sharks had hurried to the attack terrified men had seen their companions torn to bloody remnants when moments before they had been setting more sail and manning their guns to run down the impudent brigantine when undines boats had arrived it had been nearly over a few men had swum desperately back to the capsized frigate only to be dragged down as she had slid from the reef for her last plunge others had clung to floating spars and upturned boats and had watched in terror as one by one their grey attackers had plucked them screaming into the churned scarlet water and now puigserver was sitting here in the cabin his face almost composed as he sipped steadily from a goblet of wine he was naked to the waist and bolitho could see some extent of the bruising on his body evidence of his will to survive he said quietly i am grateful that you are in better spirits seror the spaniard made to grin but winced at the effort he waved the surgeon and one of his assistants aside and asked my men how many bolitho looked past him towards the horizon a thread of copper fading even as he watched thirty he shrugged many were badly mauled puigserver took another swallow it was terrible to behold his dark eyes hardened capitan triarte was so enraged by that other ships attack that he went after her like a man possessed he was too hotblooded not like you bolitho smiled gravely not likeyon but suppose he had not had a sailing master like mudge one so experienced so travelled as to feel the reefs danger like another of his stored memories it was likely undine might have shared the spaniards fate it made him chill despite the lifeless air in the cabin somewhere beyond the bulkhead a man screamed a thin longdrawn sound which stopped abruptly as if a door had been slammed on it whitmarsh wiped his hands on his apron and straightened his back his head bowed beneath the beams he said don puigserver will be comfortable for a while sir i would like to return to my other charges he was sweating very badly and a muscle at one corner of his face twitched uncontrollably bolitho nodded thank you please inform me of any help you might require the surgeon touched the spaniards bandages vaguely gods help perhaps he gave a wry smile out here we have little else as he left with his assistant puigserver murmured a man with an inner torment capitan he grimaced but a gentle one for his trade allday was folding up a towel and some unused dressings and said mr raymond was asking to see you captain he frowned i told him you had given orders that the cabin was to be kept for the surgeon until his work was done with don puig he coughed the spanish gentleman what did he want bolitho was so weary he hardly cared he had seen little of raymond since the survivors had been brought aboard and had heard he had been in the wardroom allday replied he was wishing to make a complaint captain his wife took a displeasure at you asking her to help tend the injured he frowned again i told him you had more important work to do he picked up his things and walked to the door puigserver leaned back and closed his eyes without the others present he seemed willing to reveal the pain he was really enduring he said your allday is a remarkable fellow eh with a few hundred of his kind i might think again about a campaign in the south americas bolitho sighed he worries too much puigserver opened his eyes and smiled he seems to think you are worth worrying about capitan he leaned forward his face suddenly intense but before raymond and the others come amongst us i must speak i want your opinion about the wreck i need it bolitho walked to the bulkhead and touched the sword with his fingers he said i have thought of little else senor at first i believed the brigantine to be a pirate her captain so confused or so in dread of his crew as to need a battle to keep them together but i cannot believe it in my heart someone knew of our intentions the spaniard watched him intently the french perhaps maybe if their government is so concerned at our movements it must mean that when they sank the fortunate they did indeed capture her despatches intact it would have to be something really vital to play such a dangerous game puigserver reached for the wine bottle a game which did work then you too are of the same mind senor he watched the mans outline paler now against the darkened windows he did not reply directly if and i am only saying if this someone intended such a course of action he will have known we were two ships in company he paused and then said sharply a reaction capitan quickly bolitho said it would make no difference he would realise that this is a combined mission one ship without the other makes further progress impossible and puigserver was banging his hip with the goblet wine slopping over his leg like blood he shouted excitedly and go on capitan and what bolitho looked away and replied firmly i must return either to england or to teneriffe and await further orders when he looked again at the spaniard he saw he was slumped back on the seat his square features strained his chest heaving as if from a fight puigserver said thickly when you came to santa cruz i knew you were a man of thoughts and not merely of words he shook his head let me finish this man these creatures whoever they are who would let my people die so horribly want you to turn back bolitho watched him fascinated awed by his strength without you being here senor he looked away i would have had no option exactly capitan he peered at bolitho over the rim of the goblet his eyes shining in the lantern light like tawny stones bolitho added by the time i returned to england and new plans were made and agreed upon something might have happened in the east indies or elsewhere which we could not control give me your hand capitan he groped forward his breathing sharper in a moment i will sleep it has been a wretched day but far worse for many others bolitho took his hand suddenly moved by puigservers obvious sincerity the latter asked slowly how many have you in this little ship bolitho pictured the riffraff brought aboard at spithead the ragged men from the prison hulks the smartlydressed ones fleeing from some crime or other in london the gun captain with only one hand all of them he said they have the makings senor two hundred all told including my marines he smiled if only to break the tension and i will sign on those of your men who have survived if i may puigserver did not seem to hear but his grip was like iron as he said two hundred eh he nodded grimly it will be sufficient bolitho watched him we go on senor you are ey capitan now what do you say bolitho smiled but you know already senor puigserver gave a great sigh if you will send that fool raymond in to me and your clerk i will put my seal on this new undertaking his voice hardened today i saw and heard many men die in fear and horror whatever made that foul deed necessary i intend to set the record right and when i do capitan i will make it a reckoning which our enemies will long remember there was a tap at the door and midshipman armitage stood outlined by the swinging lantern in the passageway mr herricks respects sir the winds freshening from the noreast he faltered like a child repeating a lesson to his tutor i will come up directly bolitho thought suddenly of mudge how he had prophesied a better wind he would be up there with herrick waiting for the nights orders armitages message told him all that and more whatever was decided now might settle the fate of the ship and every man aboard he looked at puigserver it is settled then senor yes capitan he was getting more drowsy you can leave me now and send raymond before i sleep like some drunken goatherd bolitho followed the midshipman from his cabin noting how stiffly the sentry at the door was holding his musket he had probably been listening and by tonight it would be all over the ship not merely a voyage to display the navys reach in foreign parts but one with a real prospect of danger he smiled grimly as he reached the quarterdeck ladder it might make gun drill less irksome for them in future he found herrick and mudge near the helm the master with a shaded lantern held over his slate upon which he made his surprisingly neat calculations bolitho walked up the weather side looking aloft at the bulging canvas hearing the sea creaming along the hull like water in a mill sluice then he returned to where they were waiting and said you may shorten sail for the night mr herrick tomorrow you can sign on any of the nervions people you find suitable he paused as another frantic cry floated up from the orlop deck though i fear it may not be many herrick asked we are not going about then sir mudge exclaimed an a good thing too if i may say so sir he rubbed his bulging rump with one hand me rheumatism will sheer off when we gets to a otter climate bolitho looked at herrick we go forward thomas to finish what was begun back there on the reef herrick seemed satisfied im for that he made to walk to the rail where a bosuns mate awaited his orders but bolitho stopped him saying from this night on thomas we must keep our wits about us no unnecessary pauses for fresh water if prying eyes are nearby we will ration every drop if necessary and stand or fall by our own resources but we must stay clear of the land where an enemy might betray our course or intentions if as i now believe someone is working against us we must use his methods against him gain ourselves time by every ruse we can invent herrick nodded that makes good sense sir then i hope it may seem so to our people he walked to the weather side you may carry on now herrick turned away call the hands we will shorten sail as the shouts echoed between decks and the seamen came dashing on to the gangways herrick said i almost forgot sir mrs raymond is worried about her accommodation it is arranged he paused and watched the hands scampering to the shrouds don puigserver will sleep in the main cabin mrs raymond can retain her own cot with the maid herrick sounded cautious i doubt she will like that sir bolitho continued his pacing then she may say so mr herrick and when she does i will explain what i think of a woman so pampered she will not lift a finger to help a dying man a masters mate strode along the gangway all mustered sir herrick was still watching the pacing figure the open white shirt clearly etched against the nettings and the sea beyond in the next few weeks undine would get much smaller he thought very well mr fowlar get the togansls off her if the weather freshens up we may have to reef topsls before the nights done old mudge rubbed his aching back the weather is a fool but nobody heeded him bolitho saw the topmen sliding down to the deck with barely a word to each other as they were checked again by their petty officers around the vibrating bowsprit the spindrift rode in the wind like pale arrows and high above the deck he saw the topsails hardening and puffing out their bellies to a combined chorus of creaking rigging and blocks dismiss the watch below herricks voice was as usual he took bolithos word as he would a rope to save himself from drowning in the darkness bolitho smiled perhaps it was better to be so in the cabin don puigserver sat at the desk and watched the clerks quill scraping across his written orders raymond was leaning against the quarter windows his face expressionless as he peered into the darkness then across his shoulder he said it is a great responsibility don puigserver i am not sure i can advise in its favour the spaniard leaned painfully against the chairback and listened to the regular footsteps across the deck overhead up and down it is not mine alone senor raymond i am in good company believe me above and around them the undine moved and murmured in time with sea and wind right forward below the bowsprit the golden nymph stared unwinkingly at the darkened horizon decision and destiny triumph and disappointment meant nothing to her she had the ocean and that was life itself the work of a demon bolitho stood loosely by the quarterdeck rail his body partly shaded from the harsh glare by the thick mainmast trunk and watched the routine work around him eight bells chimed from the forecastle and he could hear herrick and mudge comparing notes from their noon sights while soames who was officer of the watch prowled restlessly by the cabin hatch as he awaited his relief just to watch the slow lethargic movements of the men on the gangways and gun deck was enough thirtyfour days since they had seen nervions destruction on the reef and nearly two months since weighing anchor at spithead it had been hard work all the way and from the moment the spanish ship had foundered the atmosphere aboard had been compressed and strained to the limit the last few days had been the worst part he thought for a while his company had gained some excitement at crossing the equator with all its mysteries and myths he had issued an extra ration of rum and for a time he had observed some benefit from the change the new hands had seen the linecrossing as a kind of test which they had somehow managed to pass the old seamen had grown in stature as they had recounted or lied about the number of occasions they had sailed these waters in other ships a fiddler had emerged and after a selfconscious overture had brought some music and scratchy gaiety to their daily lives and then the last of the badly injured spaniards had begun to die it had been like the final pressure on them all whitmarsh had done all he could he had carried out several amputations and as the pitiful cries had floated up from his sickbay bolitho had felt the brief satisfaction of drawing his company together fading once again the dying spaniard had dragged it out for many days nearly a month he had ebbed and rallied sobbing and groaning or sleeping peacefully while whitmarsh had stayed with him hour by hour it had seemed as if the surgeon was testing his own resources searching for some new cracking point the last of his patients to die had been the ones mauled by sharks those which because of their wounds could not be saved or despatched by amputations gangrene had set into their flesh and the whole ship had been pervaded by a stench so revolting that even the most charitable had prayed for the sufferers to die he saw the afternoon watch mustering below the quarterdeck while lieutenant davy strode aft and waited for soames to sign his report in the log even davy looked weary and bedraggled his handsome face so tanned by hours on duty he could have been a spaniard they all avoided bolithos eye as if they were afraid of him or that they needed all their energies merely to get through another day davy reported the watch is aft soames glared at him a moment late mr davy davy regarded him disdainfully and then turned to his masters mate relieve the wheel soames stamped to the hatch and disappeared below bolitho clenched his hands behind him and took a few steps away from the mast the only satisfaction was the wind the previous day as they had changed tack towards the east and the masthead had reported sighting land far abeam the westerlies had made themselves felt as he shaded his eyes to peer aloft he could see the impatient thrust of power in every sail the mainyard bending and trembling like one giant bow that blur of land had been cape agulhas the southernmost tip of the african continent now stretching before the crisscross of rigging and shrouds lay the blue emptiness of the indian ocean and like many of his new seamen who had contemplated their crossing the equator he was able to consider what together they had achieved to reach this far the cape of good hope was to all intents the halfway of their voyage and to this day he had kept his word mile upon mile day after scorching day driving wildly in blustery squalls or lying becalmed with every sail hanging lifeless he had used everything he knew to keep up their spirits when that had faltered he had speeded up the daily routine gun and sail drill and competitions between messes for the offwatch hands he saw the purser and his assistant waiting beside a puncheon of pork which had just been swayed up from the forward hold midshipman keen stood nearby trying to appear knowledgeable as triphook had the new cask opened and proceeded to check through each fourpound piece of salt pork before he allowed it to be carried to the galley keen whose junior authority as midshipman of the watch made him the captains representative on such occasions probably imagined it to be a waste of time bolitho knew otherwise from past experience it was well known for dishonest victualling yards to give short measure or to make up the contents of a cask with hunks of rotten meat even pieces of old canvas knowing as they did that by the time a ships purser discovered the fault he would be well clear of the land and unable to complain pursers too were known to line their own pockets by sharp practice with their opposite numbers ashore bolitho saw the gaunt purser nod mournfully and mark his ledger apparently satisfied then he followed the little procession forward to the galley his shoes squeaking as they clung to the sunheated pitch between the deck seams the heat the relentless unbroken days were testing enough but bolitho knew it only needed a hint of corruption some suggestion that the ships company were being cheated by their officers and the whole voyage might explode he had asked himself over and over again if he was allowing his last experience to pray on his mind even the word itself mutiny had struck fear into the heart of many a captain especially one far from friendly company and higher authority he took a few paces along the side and winced as his wrist brushed against the bulwark the timbers were bonedry the paint cracking despite regular attention he paused and shaded his eyes to watch some large fish jumping far abeam valor it was usually uppermost in his mind with the new hands and the need to use much of their precious water supply to help the sick and injured even rationing might not be enough he saw two negro seamen lounging by the larboard gangway it was a mixed company indeed when they had sailed from spithead it had been varied enough now with the small list of spanish survivors they were even more colourful apart from the sole spanish officer a sadeyed lieutenant named roj art there were ten seamen two boys who were little more than children and five soldiers the latter at first grateful to have survived were now openly resentful of their new status carried aboard nervion as part of puigservers personal guard they were now neither fish nor fowl and while they tried to act as seamen they were usually found watching undines sweating marines with both envy and contempt herrick stepped into his thoughts and reported the master and i agree he held out the slate if you would care to examine this sir he sounded unusually guarded mudge ambled into the shadow of the hammock nettings and said if you are about to alter course sir he dragged out his handkerchief it is as good a time as any he blew his nose violently herrick said quickly i would like to make a suggestion sir mudge moved away and stood patiently near the helmsman it was hard to tell if herrick had just thought of his suggestion or if he had discussed it with the others some were a mite surprised when you stood clear of cape town sir his eyes were very blue in the glare we could have landed our remaining sick people and taken in fresh water i doubt that the dutch governor there would pay much heed to our movements do you mr herrick he saw a puff of dull smoke from the galley soon now the offwatch men would be having a meal in the sweltering heat of their messes the remains of yesterdays salt beef skillygolee as they named it a mixture of oatmeal gruel crushed biscuits and lumps of boiled meat and all that washed down with a full ration of beer it was likely the latter was stale and without life but anything was better than the meagre ration of water he jerked himself back to herrick suddenly irritated and who put you up to this remarkable assessment he saw herricks face cloud over but added it has an unfamiliar ring to it herrick said its just that i do not wish to see you driving yourself sir i felt as you did about nervions loss but it is done and theres an end to it you did all you could for her people bolitho said thank you for your concern but i am not driving myself or our people to no purpose i believe we may be needed even at this moment perhaps sir bolitho regarded him searchingly perhaps indeed but then that is my responsibility if i have acted wrongly then you may receive promotion more quickly than you thought he turned away when the hands have eaten we will lay her on the new course noreast by east he looked at the masthead pendant see how it blows well get the royals on her directly and run with the wind under our coattails while it lasts herrick bit his lip i still believe we should touch land sir if only to collect water as i do mr herrick he faced him coldly and that i will do whenever i can without arousing interest elsewhere i have my orders i intend to carry them out as best i can do you understand they watched each other their eyes angry troubled and concerned by the sudden flareup between them very good sir herrick stood back his eyes squinting in the sun you can rely on me i was beginning to wonder mr herrick bolitho half stepped forward one hand outstretched as herrick swung away his face taut with dismay he had not meant the words to form in that way if he had ever doubted anything in his life herricks loyalty was not one of them he felt ashamed and angry perhaps the strain of this empty monotony of carrying men who wanted to do nothing but crawl away from work and the sun of torturing his mind with plans and doubts had taken a far greater toll than he had imagined he turned on his heel and saw davy watching him curiously mr davy you have only just taken over your watch and i would not wish to disrupt your thoughts but examine the forecourse if you please and set some of your hands to put it to rights he saw the lieutenant fall back from his anger and added it looks as slack as the watch on deck as he strode to the cabin hatch he saw the lieutenant hurrying to the rail the fact that the forecourse was not drawing as it should was no excuse for taking out his temper on davy he strode past the sentry and slammed the cabin door behind him but there was no escape here noddall was laying plates on the table his face stiffly resentful as mrs raymonds maid followed him around the cabin like an amused child raymond was slumped in a chair by the stern windows apparently dozing and his wife sat on the bench seat fanning herself and watching noddalls preparations a look of complete boredom on her face bolitho made to go but she called come along captain we barely see you from day to day she patted the bench seat with the fan sit awhile your precious ship will survive i think bolitho sat down and leaned one elbow on the sill it was good to feel life in the wind again to watch the lift and swirl of foam as it surged freely from the counter or came up gurgling around the rudder then he turned slightly and looked at her she had been aboard all this time and yet he knew little of her she was watching him now her eyes partly amused partly questioning probably two or three years older than himself he thought not beautiful but with the aristocratic presence which commanded instant attention she had fine even teeth and her hair which she had allowed to flow loosely across her shoulders was the colour of autumn while he and the rest of his officers had found difficulty in keeping cool or finding a clean shirt after the suns tyranny or some fierce squall in the south atlantic she had always managed to remain perfect as she was now her gown was not merely worn it was arranged so that he and not she looked out of place against the stern windows her earrings were heavy and he guessed their value would pay most of his marines for a year or more she smiled do you enjoy what you see captain bolitho started i am sorry maam i am tired she exclaimed how gallant i am sorry it is only weariness which makes you look at me she held up the fan and added i am mocking you captain do not look so depressed bolitho smiled thank you he thought suddenly of that other time in new york three years ago another ship his first command and the world opening up just for him a woman had shown him that life was not so kind nor was it easy he admitted i have had a lot on my mind i have been used to action and sharp decisions for most of my life merely to make sail and face an empty sea day by day is something alien to me sometimes i feel more like a grocerycaptain than that of a manowar she watched him thoughtfully i can believe it i should have realised earlier she gave a slow smile her lashes hiding her eyes then maybe i would not have offended you bolitho shook his head much of it was my fault i have been so long in ships of war that i have become used to expecting others to share my dedication if there is a fire i expect all close by to quench it if a man tries to overrun authority by mutiny or in an enemys name i would call for others to strike him down or do so myself he faced her gravely that is why i expected you to aid the men injured in the wreck he shrugged again i expected it i did not ask she nodded that admission must have surprised you as much as it did me captain she showed her teeth it has cleared the air a little yes he touched his forehead unconsciously plucking at the rebellious lock of black hair which clung to the skin with sweat he saw her eyes widen as she caught sight of the livid scar beneath and said quickly forgive me maam i must go and examine my charts before we dine she watched him as he stood up and said you wear your authority well captain she glanced at her sleeping husbandunlike some bolitho did not know how to reply i am afraid that is hardly for me to discuss maam he looked up as feet thudded across the deck and shadows flitted above the open skylight she asked what is it he did not see the annoyance in her eyes i am not sure a ship perhaps i gave orders i was to be informed so that i can take avoiding action noddall paused two forks in his hand i eard no ail from th mastead sir there was a rap at the door and herrick stood in the entrance his chest heaving from exertion i am sorry to burst in he looked past bolitho towards the woman it would be better if you came with me sir bolitho stepped from the cabin and pulled the door behind him in the doorway which opened on to the ships wardroom he saw a small group waiting for him they looked confused stricken like strangers there was bellairs accompanied by his towering sergeant triphook his horse teeth bared as if to snap at an unseen attacker and cowering just behind him was the ships cooper a small hunched petty officer named joseph duff he was the second oldest man aboard and wore steelrimmed spectacles at his work although he usually managed to hide them from his messmates for much of the time herrick said quietly duff has reported that most of the fresh water is undrinkable sir he swallowed under bolithos stare he was doing his usual inspection and has just reported to the ships corporal triphook was murmuring fervently in all my days never never have i seen the like bolitho beckoned to the cooper well duff i am waiting what is this find which you have discovered duff blinked at him through the oval glasses he looked like a greyhaired mole me usual inspection sir he grew smaller as they crowded round him soames had come from his own cabin and loomed over bellairs shoulder like a cliff duff continued shakily the casks was all good uns i saw to that sir first thing i always looks for i learned me work under a fine old cooper in the gladiator when i first took on sir an for gods sake duff herrick sounded desperate tell the captain duff lowered his head most of the casks is foul sir they as to be sergeant coaker stepped forward his boots creaking as the ship tilted in a sudden trough he was holding a small bundle but keeping it away from his tunic as if it were alive open it the sergeant unfolded the parcel very carefully his face set like stone bolitho felt the deck soaring violently tasted the vomit clawing at his throat screwed up as if at the instant shock of amputation it was tl human hand soames choked in the name of christ duff said in a small voice in all of em sir cept the last two casks by the bulkead triphook said heavily hes right sir bits of flesh he trembled violently his face breaking out in sweat the work of a demon there was a sharp cry of horror and bolitho stepped in front of the cooper as mrs raymond gasped im going to be sick he saw her leaning against the marine sentry her face like chalk as she stared fixedly at the group by the wardroom bolitho snapped get rid of that object to noddalls hovering shadow he added call that damned maid and attend to the lady his mind was reeling from duffs gruesome discovery what it meant and what he now had to do fetch the surgeon bellairs dabbed his lips with a handkerchief carry on sarnt coaker pass the word for mr whitmarsh he glanced at the others though i doubt he will be able to assist what herrick asked would you care to come in here sir he stood aside to allow bolitho to enter the wardroom it was small and compact the table laid for a meal and at odds with the twelvepounders which were lashed at each open port bolitho sat down heavily on a sea chest and stared through the nearest gun port the fair wind and dancing water held no more attraction danger was within the ship his ship herrick prompted some wine sir when he turned bolitho saw the others watching him soames at the top of the table bellairs and triphook seated on the opposite side in those fleeting seconds he recalled his own life as a junior lieutenant in a frigate the wardroom was the place you shared not merely your food and your life you shared your doubts and drew on your companions for help whenever it was needed aft behind his bulkhead the captain had been a remote godly character beyond reach at no time that he could recall had he imagined a captain required anything but obedience it even felt different here pistols in a rack some shirts hanging to air which the wardroom servant had just washed the smell of something simmering in a pot he replied thank you i would relish a glass just now they relaxed slightly and soames said it will mean turning back sir he thought about it or making for the african coast mebbee feet creaked outside the door and then mudge pushed his way into the wardroom his grey hair sprouting as he threw his hat into a corner god blast me eyes but whats this bloody deed ive bin told he saw bolitho and muttered beggin yer pardon sir i was not expectin to discover you in ere herrick held out a glass some rhenish sir he did not smile but his eyes were calm almost pleading still fairly fresh i think bolitho sipped it gratefully thank you he tasted the sourness in his throat after what i have just witnessed he swung round as the surgeon lurched through the door his shirt unbuttoned his gaze bleary you have been told the news mr whitmarsh he watched the effort he was making to focus his eyes the growth of stubble on his chin whitmarsh had been quietly making up for all the time he had stayed with his patients well whitmarsh groped his way to a gun and leaned on it with both hands sucking air through the open port like a drowning man i heard sir he retched i heard bolitho watched him impassively as the water casks were fresh when stowed aboard at spithead it would seem likely that these human fragments came from your surgery he waited feeling pity for the man but knowing the need for haste would you agree i expect so whitmarsh lurched to the table and poured a large measure of wine bolitho said sharply if you drink that mr whitmarsh i will see to it that you do not get another drop while you are under my command he stood up now think man who could have done this whitmarsh stared at the glass in his hand his body swaying badly despite the easy motion i was kept busy they were in a poor way sir i had my loblolly boys and my mate to assist me he screwed up his red face in an effort to remember the sweat dripping off his chin like rain it was sullivan i gave him the job of clearing amputated limbs and the like from my sickbay he was very helpful he nodded vaguely its all coming to me now sullivan he turned and stared fixedly at bolitho the manyou had flogged sir herrick said harshly dont be so bloody impertinent to the captain bolitho found he was suddenly very calm in your opinion mr whitmarsh will the casks be any further use after this none the surgeon was still glaring at him they must be scoured at once the contents thrown overboard a mouthful of that water after gangrenous flesh has been in it and youll have a raging fever aboard ive known it happen theres no cure bolitho placed his glass on the table very slowly giving his mind time to steady it seems that you are not the only one who wishes to turn back mr herrick now take hold of sullivan and guard him before he does some other mischief he turned to whitmarsh i have not finished with you yet feet clattered on the quarterdeck ladder and herrick reappeared in the doorway sir that fool sullivan is aloft on the crojack yard hes raving mad nobody can get near him then bolitho heard men shouting more feet pounding overhead he said i will go up he found the gangways crowded with seamen and marines while don puigserver and his spanish lieutenant had joined the work of a demon davy by the quarterdeck rail to watch a bosuns mate who was clinging to the mizzen shrouds and trying to reach sullivan the seaman was perched on the yard totally indifferent to the great billowing sail at his back and the hard sunlight which lanced across his body he was completely naked but for his belt where he carried the broadbladed dirk which had brought about his flogging in the first place davy said anxiously i did not know what to do sir the man is obviously moonstruck or worse the bosuns mate bellowed now yew get down on deck or by the livin jesus ill pitch you there meseif sullivan threw back his head and laughed it was a shrill unnerving sound now now mr roskilly what would you do then lay your little ropes end on me he laughed again and then pulled out the knife come along then matey im awaitin you you goddamned lickspittle bolitho called come down roskilly youll do no good by getting killed sullivan craned under the vibrating yard well blow me down mates an who ave we ere our gallant captain no less he rocked with laughter an es all aback cause poor old tom sullivans spoiled the water for him some of the watching seamen had been grinning at the spectacle on the quarterdeck the mention of water soon altered that bolitho looked at the upturned faces feeling the spreading alarm like the edge of a fire he walked aft his shoes loud in the sudden hush around him below the yard he stopped and looked up come along sullivan he was in the sunlight and with no shade from the bellying sail above he felt the sweat pouring down his chest and thighs just as he could sense the other mans hatred you have done enough today sullivan cackled did you hear that lads done enough he twisted on the yard the glare playing across the scars on his back pale against the tanned skin youve done enough to me capn bloody bolitho herrick snapped sergeant coaker have one of your marksmen brought aft that man is a damned danger up there belay that bolitho kept his eyes on the crossjack yard he is past reason ill not have him shot down like some mad dog he sensed puigserver was watching him and not the man on the yard and that allday was close by a cutlass in his hand but they were all excluded it was between him and sullivan he called i am asking you sullivan he recalled the womans face in the cabin i did not ask you go to hell captain sullivan was screaming now his naked body twisting on the yard as if in torment an ill take you there now bolitho hardly saw his hand move just the brief flash of sunlight on the blade and then gasped as the knife cut through his sleeve before embedding itself in the deck by his right shoe so great was the force that nearly an inch of blade was driven into the planking sullivan was transfixed a long streamer of spittle trailing to the wind as he stared down at bolitho at the foot of the mast bolitho remained motionless feeling the blood running down his elbow and forearm and on to the deck he did not take his eyes off sullivan and the concentration helped to overcome the searing pain left by the blade sullivan stood up wildly and began to scramble outboard along the yard everybody began to yell at once and bolitho felt herrick gripping his arm another wrapping a cloth around it deadening the pain whitmarsh had appeared below the nettings and he too was shouting at the man framed against the clear sky sullivan turned and spoke in a level voice for the first time and you too doctor god damn you to hell then he jumped out and down his body hitting the water with a violent splash for a moment he floated past the quarter and as the spankers great shadow passed over him he clasped his hands above his head and vanished herrick said we could never pick him up if we tried to heaveto under this canvas wed tear the sticks out of her bolitho did not know to whom he was speaking perhaps to himself he walked to the hatch holding his torn and bloodied sleeve with one hand he saw the bosuns mate roskilly pulling the knife out of the deck he was a strong man but it took him two attempts to tug it clear puigserver followed him below and then stepped in front of him that was a brave thing you did capilan he sighed but he could have killed you bolitho nodded the pain was getting worse we have some hard times ahead senor we must find water and soon he tightened his jaw but i am not turning back puigserver eyed him sadly you made a gesture one which might have ended your life and all for a madman bolitho walked to the cabin maybe we were both mad herrick hurried after him and as they entered the cabin bolitho saw there was a chair directly under the skylight raymond must have been standing on it to watch the drama overhead mrs raymond was aft by the windows she looked very pale but came towards him saying your arm captain she shouted to her maid bandages bolitho realised that herrick was in the cabin well herrick watched him worriedly what you did it could have killed me i know bolitho forced a smile i have already been told herrick breathed out slowly and i believed i knew you sir and now he looked at him steadily thomas herrick grinned i only know that you never cease to surprise me and others he gestured to the deckhead a seaman who has been cursing and complaining for near on a month was just heard to damn sullivans soul for threatening the life of his captain his grin faded but id rather you rallied our people in some other way sir bolitho held out his arm as the maid carried a basin to the desk if you know of any way to keep up their spirits thomas id be obliged to hear it in the meantime call the hands and get the royals on her i want every stitch she can carry he checked him as he made for the door and pass the word one pint of water per day he glanced around the cabin officers and passengers included herrick hesitated and the surgeon sir bolitho looked down at the maid as she cleaned the deep cut on his arm she returned his glance boldly he said i am in good hands it seems i will think about mr whitmarsh when i have more time he added grimly and at this moment time is of the greatest value in the world bolitho waited by the open stern windows and watched the moon making a fine path across the water the sea looked unusually choppy but he knew it was from a steep undertow which explored the depths many miles from the african coast at his back he heard the others moving into the cabin and finding somewhere to sit the sounds of goblets and wine as noddall went about his business despite the cool air after the days blazing sunlight his body felt drained and stiff and about him the ship creaked and groaned her timbers so driedout that it was a wonder she was not leaking like an old bucket a week since sullivan had jumped to his death seven long days while he had taken his ship inshore time and time again only to stand off at the report of some sail or an unexplained sighting of a native craft now he could delay no longer he had been visited by whitmarsh that afternoon a man so tormented by his own worries that it had been a difficult interview whitmarsh had made it quite definite that he could no longer be held responsible if bolitho persisted in staying clear of land the two remaining casks of water were almost empty and what remained was little better than scum more men were lying ill on the orlop deck and those fit enough to work ship had to be watched by the minute tempers flared and petty officers went about their duties with an eye on their backs for a knifethrust in a momentary display of madness herrick reported all ready sir like the others tense watchful bolitho turned and looked around his officers all but soames who was on duty were present even the three midshipmen he watched them gravely it might teach them something he thought i intend to close the land again tomorrow he saw don puigserver by the bulkhead with his lieutenant raymond a few feet away from him rubbing his face in sharp agitated movements davy said makes fine sense sir he swallowed some wine if we give our people more rum to drink as we cut down the water well be too tipsy to do anything he forced a smile a fine situation it would be bolitho turned to mudge he was in the largest chair still wearing his thick coat and staring up at the open skylight as a moth darted into the lanterns beam he saw bolithos expression and sighed i called at this place just the once sir when i was masters mate in the windsor indiaman we was in much the same trouble ourselves then no water becalmed for weeks on end an with alf the people goin wild with thirst bolitho asked but there is water available mudge moved his chair towards the desk in short squeaky jerks then he jabbed the open chart with his thumb wem now in th mozambique channel as we all knows he glared at midshipman armitage cept for some too hignorant to learn aright he continued in a more unruffled tone th african coast is fair wild ereabouts an not a lot be known about it ships put in of course his eyes gleamed as he looked up at bolitho tor water to trade mebbee an to find theirselves some black ivory from time to time midshipman keen was leaning over his shoulder his face the only one present which showed little sign of strain black ivory sir herrick said sharply slaves mudge leaned back comfortably it follows that we must be careful land in force get the water if i can recall exactly where it is and stand out to sea agin bellairs said my marines will give a good account thank you mudge regarded him scornfully just so capn bellairs sir in their pretty coats with their drums and fifes i can picture it a fair treat he added harshly theyd ave em for breakfast afore they could polish their bloody boots well really bellairs was shocked bolitho nodded very well then the wind is staying with us so we should be able to anchor by noon tomorrow mudge agreed aye but not close inshore sir theres a fair bit o reef just around the point itll mean every boat in th water an a ard pull for all ands yes bolitho looked at davy you can arrange the arming of each boat with the gunner swivels for launch and cutter musketoons for the rest he glanced round at their intent faces ill want an officer with each party some of our people will need watching if only for their own sakes he let his words sink in remember it well many of them are quite raw to this sort of work although because we have been together for over two months you may see them as veterans they are not so treat them accordingly lead them do not be content to leave your work to others less qualified he saw the midshipmen exchanging glances like boys about to take part in some private escapade keen his eyes sparkling with excitement little penn openly impressed by being included poor armitage his forehead raw red from being on watch for a few moments without a hat they were even less experienced than most of the men he looked at the chart but for sullivan they might have made the whole voyage to madras without a pause despite their shortages herrick had tried to help by saying it was bad luck puigserver had stated that he was behind him whatever he decided was best for the ship but it was still his decision and nobody else could change that some of those present in the cabin had stopped speaking with the surgeon altogether and perhaps for that reason alone bolitho had made no further comment about his choice of sullivan as a helper giving him the opportunity crazy or not of fouling the water supply he saw him only on matters of sick reports and each time was shocked by his appearance the man was boiling inside bitter and yet unable to share his problems he did not even want to he heard a womans voice saw the others look up at the skylight as feet passed overhead mrs raymond and her maid taking their usual stroll under the stars he hoped soames would ensure they did not stray from the quarterdeck he would not answer for their safety at the hands of some of the seamen he could understand how many of them felt to the volunteers it must seem a far cry from the recruiting posters and to the men from the prison hulks it might now appear to be a bad exchange of circumstances even those hiding from crimes committed ashore would find room for doubt and resentment the crimes would have faded with the fear of arrest and trial but the heat and thirst and the daily grind of disciplined duty were only too real he saw raymond biting his lip his eyes following the footsteps as if he was seeing through the deckhead itself if anything he and his wife were moving further apart by being confined in the ship it was a strange relationship he thought back over the past days and one particular incident he had been in his small makeshift cabin in the chart space and allday had been changing the bandage on his arm for him she had entered the cabin without knocking in fact neither of them had heard her approach she had stood by the open port quite relaxed and had watched him without saying a word bolitho had been stripped to the waist and as he reached for a fresh shirt she had said softly i see you bear yet another scar captain bolithos hand had gone to his side suddenly conscious of the ragged mark where a pistol ball had missed his ribs by a thread he had seen it exactly as he was seeing it now the privateers tilting deck the american lieutenant running towards him taking aim the crash of a shot the sharp stabbing agony oblivion allday had said rudely the captains dressing ships ways are different from those ashore it seems but she had stood firm her lips slightly parted while she watched him but how could she have understood what he was thinking that the ball had been fired by one of his own brothers officers a traitor a wanted renegade now dead and forgotten by most but not by me he shook himself out of his brooding thoughts nothing mattered now but the work in hand water all that he needed to take them to madras beyond that was another challenge it could wait he said that is all gentlemen he realised he had spoken more abruptly than intended and added we have a fine ship one of the most efficient and modern devices created by man we can give a good account of ourselves to any vessel but a ship of the line he paused as herrick smiled at him bridging the gap between them as he too remembered except for rare and not to be encouraged occasions but without water to drink we are like stumbling old men with neither the means nor the will to face another day remember what i have said be vigilant for the moment that is all i ask of you they filed out of the cabin leaving him with puigserver and raymond raymond looked hopefully at the spaniard but when he made no attempt to take his usual walk on deck he too left the cabin bolitho sat down and watched the moonlight as it played across the undines bubbling wake what is the matter with him senor it was strange how easy it was to talk to him just over a year back he had been an enemy one bolitho would have killed in battle had he not called for quarter he smiled to himself or the other way round he was a powerful man that was certain and much of his counsel he kept to himself but bolitho trusted him the ships company for the most part had also accepted him as their own like allday who had long given up trying to pronounce his name they called him mister pigsliver but they said it with something near to affection puigserver regarded him with quiet amusement my dear capitan he is like a watchdog he fears for his wife what she will do rather than what others will do to her he chuckled the sound rising from his belly she i think is beginning to enjoy the game knowing that every man aboard sees her in a different eye she stands proudly a tigress in our midst you seem to know a great deal about her senor the smile broadened you know your ships capitan unlike me i fear you still have much to learn about women eh bolitho made to protest and then changed his mind the memory was still too painful to leave room for a denial attack overland well thomas what dyou make of it at close quarters bolithos voice was hushed as with the others around him he stared towards the shore they had made a careful approach since dawn seeing the land gaining shape and substance and then as the sun had found them again they had watched the colour the endless panorama of green with two experienced leadsmenin the chains and under minimum canvas undine had felt her way towards the land it had looked like an untouched world with jungle so thick it seemed impossible for anything to move freely away from the sea herrick replied quietly the master seems satisfied sir he trained his telescope over the hammock nettings as he described it a round headland to the north and that strangelooking hill about a mile inland bolitho stepped onto a bollard and peered down over the nettings undine had finally dropped anchor some four cables offshore to give her searoom and a safe depth at all times nevertheless it looked very shallow and he could even see the great shadow of undines coppered hull on the bottom pale sand like that on the various small crescentshaped beaches they had seen on their cautious approach long trailers of strange weed writhing to the current far below the ship as if in a tired sort of dance but to larboard as the ship swung to her cable he saw other shapes browns and greens like stains in the water reefs mudge was right to be so careful not that anyone would need reminding after nervions fate alongside the first boats had already been swayed out and shellabeer the boatswain was gesticulating with his fists at some spanish seamen who were baling one of them it would do the frail hulls good to be afloat again bolitho thought he said absently i shall go with the boats and you will keep a good watch in case of trouble he could almost feel herricks unspoken protest but added if anything goes wrong ashore it might help some of our people if they see im sharing it with them he turned and clapped herricks shoulder besides which i feel like stretching my legs it is my prerogative on the gun deck davy was striding back and forth inspecting the men mustered for the boats checking weapons and the tackle for hoisting and lowering water casks when the work was begun overhead the sky was very pale as if the sun had boiled the colour from it and had spread it instead across the glittering stretch of sea between ship and shore bolitho marvelled at the stillness just an occasional necklace of white surf along the nearest beach and at the foot of the headland it was as if it was holding its breath and he could imagine a thousand eyes watching the anchored frigate from amongst the trees there were loud thumps as the swivel guns were lowered into the bows of launch and cutter and more shouted orders while the bellmouthed musketoons found their proper mountings in gig and pinnace the jolly boat was to remain with the ship it was too small for the great casks and might be needed in an emergency he rubbed his chin and stared at the land emergency it appeared safe enough all the way along the coast as they had slipped past one bay or inlet after another and all of which had seemed identical to everyone but mudge he had waited for some sign a hint of danger but not a boat drawn up on the sand not a wisp of smoke from a fire not even a bird had broken the stillness boats ready sir shellabeer tilted his swarthy face in the glare bolitho walked to the rail and looked down at the gun deck the seamen seemed altered yet again perhaps because of their cutlasses the way they glanced at each other their torment of thirst momentarily put aside most of them were very different from the men who had first joined the ship their bared backs were well browned with only an occasional scar of sunburn to mark the foolish or the unwary he called over yonder is africa lads he felt the rustle of excitement expanding like a wind over corn youll be seeing many more places before we are homeward bound again do as you are bid stay with your parties and no harm should come to you he hardened his tone but it is a dangerous country and the natives hereabouts have had little cause to like or trust the foreign sailorman so keep a good watch and work well with the casks he nodded man your boats mudge joined him at the gangway as the first men swung their way down the side i should be agoin with you sir ive told me best masters mate fowlar what to look for anes a good man that e be bolitho lifted his arms as allday buckled on his sword then what troubles you mr mudge mudge scowled time was when i could swim alf a mile an then march another with a full load on me back herrick grinned and still have the wind to bed a fine wench ill be bound mudge glared at him your timell come mr errick it aint no pleasure gettin old bolitho smiled your value is here to herrick he said rig boarding nets during our stay with only an anchor watch and the marines at your back you might be in bother if someone tries to surprise you he touched his arm i know i am overcautious i can read your face like a chart but better so than dead he glanced at the shore especially here he walked to the entry port the boats will return two by two send the rest of the men as soon as you can theyll tire easily enough in this heat he saw puigserver wave to him from the gangway and raymond watching from right aft by his wifes little canopy he touched his hat to the side party and climbed quickly down into the gig where allday waited by the tiller shove off one by one the boats idled clear of the frigates shadow and then with oars moving in unison turned towards the land bolitho remained standing to examine his little flotilla lieutenant soames with the launch undines largest boat every inch of space filled with men and casks while in the bows a gun captain crouched over the loaded swivel like some kind of figurehead then the cutter also deeply laden with davy in control his figure very slim against that of mr pryke undines portly carpenter as was proper pryke was going ashore in the hopes of finding timber suitable for small repairs about the ship midshipman keen accompanied by little penn had the pinnace and bolitho could see them bobbing about with obvious excitement as they pulled steadily across the water bolitho glanced astern at his ship seeing the figures on her deck already small and impersonal someone was in the cabin and he guessed it was mrs raymond watching the boats avoiding her husband probably neither then he looked down at the men in the gig at the weapons between their straddled legs at the way they avoided his scrutiny right forward he saw a man moving the musketoon from side to side to free the mount from caked salt and realised it was turpin the one who had tried so desperately to deceive davy at spithead he saw bolitho watching him and held up his arm in place of his hand he had a hook of bright steel he called the gunner had it fixed up for me sir he was grinning bettern the real thing bolitho smiled at him he at least seemed in good spirits he watched the slow moving hulls about eighty officers and men with more to follow when he could spare the boats he sat down and shaded his eyes with his hat as he did so he touched the scar above his eye remembering that other watering party he had been with so long ago the sudden charge screams all about him that great towering savage brandishing a cutlass he had just seized from a dying sailor he had seen it only for a second and then fallen senseless his face a mask of blood it had been a closerun thing but for his coxswain it would have been the end herrick probably resented his landing with this watering party it was work normally given to a lieutenant but that memory like the scar was a constant reminder of what could go wrong without any sort of warning cable to go captain allday eased the tiller bar slightly bolitho started he must have been dreaming undine looked far away now a graceful toy while right across the bows and reaching out on either hand like huge green arms was the land once again mudges memory proved to be sure and reliable within two hours of beaching the boats and sorting the hands into working parties the masters mate fowlar reported finding a little stream and that the water was the freshest thing he had tasted for years the work was begun immediately armed pickets were placed at carefully chosen vantage points and lookouts sent to the top of the small hill below which mudges stream gurgled away into the dense jungle after the first uncertainty of stepping on to dry land with all the usual unsteadiness to their sealegs the sailors soon settled down to the task pryke the carpenter and his mates quickly assembled some heavy sledges upon which the filled casks would be hauled down to the boats and while the cooper stood watchfully at the stream the other men were busy with axes clearing a path through the trees under fowlars personal supervision with midshipman penn trotting at his heels to act as messenger bolitho retained contact between beach and stream making several journeys to ensure the operation was working smoothly lieutenant soames was in charge of the beach and of allocating more men to the work as they were ferried ashore davy had the inland part while keen was usually to be seen with some armed men at his back trudging around the labouring sailors to make sure there were no unwelcome visitors fowlar had discovered two native fireplaces almost immediately but they were decayed and scattered and it seemed unlikely that anyone had been near them for months nevertheless as he paused to watch over the progress of each party bolitho was conscious of a feeling of menace of hostility which was hard to define on his way inland to the stream yet again he had to stand aside as a heavy sledge hauled by some two dozen blaspheming seamen careered past him shaking the undergrowth and making several great red birds flap between the trees squawking discordantly bolitho watched the birds and then stepped back on to the crude trail it was good to know something was alive here he thought beneath the trees where the sky was hidden from view the air was heavy and stank of rotting vegetation here and there something clicked and rustled or a small beady eye glittered momentarily in filtered sunlight before vanishing just as swiftly penn gasped might be makes sir he was panting hard his shirt plastered to his body from his exertions to keep up bolitho found davy beneath a wall of overhanging rock marking his list as yet another cask was sealed by duff for the bumpy ride to the beach the second lieutenant straightened his back and observed going well sir good bolitho stooped and cupped his hands into the stream it was like wine despite the rotten looking roots which sprouted from either bank we will finish before dark he looked up at a patch of blue sky as the trees gave a stealthy rustle it was unmoving air below the matted branches but above and to seaward the wind was holding well i am going up the hill mr davy he thought he heard penn sigh with despair i hope your lookouts are awake it was a long hard walk and when they moved clear of the trees for the final climb to the summit bolitho felt the sun searing down on his shoulders the heat through his shoes from the rough stones like coals off a grate but the two lookouts seemed contented enough in their stained trousers and shirts with their tanned faces almost hidden by straw hats they looked more like castaways than british seamen they had rigged a small shelter with a scrap of canvas behind which lay their weapons water flasks and a large brass telescope one knuckled his forehead and said orizons clear capn bolitho tugged his hat over his eyes as he stared down the hill the coastline was more uneven than he had imagined water glittering between the thick layers of trees to reveal some inlet or cover not marked on any chart inland and towards a distant barrier of tall hills there was nothing but an undulating sea of trees so closeknit it looked possible to walk upright across the top of them he picked up the telescope and trained it on the ship she was writhing and bending in a surface haze but he saw the boats moving back and forth very slowly like tired waterbeetles he felt grit and dust under his fingers and guessed the telescope had spent more time lying on the hillside than in use he heard penn sucking noisily at a water flask and could sense the lookouts willing him to leave them in peace theirs might be a thirsty job but it was far easier than hauling casks through the forest he moved the glass again all those men sledges and casks yet from here he could see none of them even the beach was shielded the boats as they drew near the shore appeared to vanish into the trees as if swallowed whole bolitho turned to his right the movement making the men stir with alarm in the telescopes lens the trees and slivers of trapped water grew and receded as he continued his search something had touched the corner of his eye but what the lookouts were watching him doubtfully each caught in his own attitude as if mesmerised a trick of light he blinked and rubbed his eye nothing he began another slow scrutiny thick characterless forest or was that merely what he expected to see and therefore he stiffened and held his breath when he lowered the glass the picture fell away into the distance he waited counting seconds allowing his breathing to steady the lookouts had begun to whisper again and penn was drinking as before they probably imagined he had been too long in the sun he lifted the glass very carefully there to the right where he had already noticed a faint gleam of water was something darker at odds with the forests greens and browns he stared at it until his eye watered so painfully he could not continue then he closed the glass with a snap and said there is a ship yonder he saw penn gaping at him transfixed to the southrd it must be some sort of inlet which we did not see earlier he shaded his eyes trying to estimate the distance where it lay in relation to undine and the beach where he had come ashore one of the lookouts exclaimed oi never saw nothin sir he looked frightened and worse bolitho stared past him trying to think take this glass and make sure you can see it now he knew the seaman was more frightened of his captain or what might become of him because of his negligence than anything this discovery might mean bolithos mind recorded all these reactions as he said have you found it aye sir the man bobbed unhappily tis a mast right enough thank you bolitho added dryly keep your eye on it i do not want it to vanish again penn dropped the flask and scuttled after him as he strode down the hill whwhat might it mean sir several things he felt the trees looming around him a small relief from the suns torment they may have sighted us and are lying low until we weigh perhaps they are intent on some other mischief i am not certain he quickened his pace ignoring creepers and fronds which plucked at his body but for that brief flaw in the lenss picture he would have seen nothing known nothing about the other vessel perhaps it would have been better that way maybe he was worrying to no purpose he found davy as before lounging in the shade of the hillside his features relaxed as he watched his men filling the casks where is mr fowlar davy came out of his torpor with a jerk er on the beach sir damn another hard mile before he could examine fowlars chart and mudges notes he looked up at the sky hours yet before sunset but when it did come it would be quick shutting out the light like a curtain i have discovered a ship mr davy well hidden to the southrd of us he saw the carpenter emerge from the under growth a saw glinting in one fist take charge here mr pryke he beckoned to davy we are going to the beach pryke nodded his fat face glowing like a ripe apple aye sir he looked at duff there be only five more casks by my reckonin well speed the work i want our people mustered as soon as the last one is filled davy hurried along at his side his handsome face puzzled do you think this ship may be an enemy sir i intend to find out they completed the journey in silence and bolitho knew that davy like the lookouts thought he was making too much of it fowlar listened to him calmly and then examined his chart if it is where i believe then it is not marked here so it must lie somewhere twixt this beach and the next bay he made a mark about there i would suggest sir could we reach it before dark overland fowlars eyes widened but he answered it looks close enough sir no moren three mile or so but that is four times as much in the jungle he dropped his eyes from bolithos gaze you might be able to do it sir davy asked but if we wait until tomorrow sir we could have undine anchored nearer this vessel you have found it would take too long she may have weighed and gone overnight and if they are aware of our presence and purpose a boat attack would be useless in daylight and in a confined inlet you should know that mr davy davy looked at his shoes yes sir another heavy cask lurched down the beach the men panting like animals running from the hounds soames who had trudged up the beach to listen said suddenly she might be a slaver in which case she will be well armed he rubbed his chin and nodded yours is a good plan sir his thick forefinger scratched over the chart we could cross the bottom of the hill where it reaches for the sea and strike south if we travel lightly we should be at the inlet before dark he looked at davy his eyes hard i pick some good men ones who wont falter when the passage gets rough davy said nothing he was obviously smarting because soames had offered a course of action rather than an unthinking suggestion bolitho looked towards the ship very well we will rest the hands for half an hour then we will begin forty men should be sufficient if we are careful it may be a complete waste of time he thought of the silent jungle watching but to be anchored so dangerously inland i doubt it he beckoned to penn i will write my orders for the first lieutenant and you will take them across directly undine will send her boats tomorrow morning and pick us up from seaward by then we should know he glanced at davy one way or the other he saw keen coming out of the trees a pistol hanging casually from his belt as he turned towards the sea he halted and raised one arm to point it was the jolly boat darting across the water at full speed the oars winking in the sunlight like silver eventually it ground on to the beach and without waiting for it to be made fast midshipman armitage leapt over the gunwale and then fell face down on the sand allday who had been watching critically exclaimed god damn me captain that young gentleman will stumble on an acorn armitage hurried up the beach his cheeks scarlet as he dashed past the groups of grinning seamen he stammered mr herricks respects sir he paused to wipe sand from his chin and we have sighted some small craft to the north of here he pointed haphazardly into the trees a whole party of them mr herrick thinks they may come this way although he stopped screwing up his face as he usually did when passing a message although they have vanished for the present he nodded relieved as he recalled the last part mr herrick suggests they have gone into another beach for some purpose bolitho gripped his hands behind him the very thing he had been expecting had happened it could not have come at a worse time thank you mr armitage davy said quietly that has put paid to the venture sir we cannot be divided if hostile natives are about soames said scathingly a plague on that mr davy we have enough powder and shot to scatter a thousand bloody savages that will do bolitho glared at them his mind struggling with the problem mr herrick is probably correct they may have gone ashore to hunt or to make camp either way it makes our mission all the more urgent he watched soames thoughtfully seeing the mixture of anger and triumph in his deepset eyes select your men at once davy asked stiffly what will i do sir bolitho turned away in a handtohand struggle soames would be the better man if things went against them herrick would need brains rather than brawn if he was to continue the voyage on his own resources you will return to the ship with the last of the shore parties he scribbled a note on fowlars pad and you will convey my he hesitated not seeing the desperation which clouded davys face my ideas to him as best you can davy said tightly i am senior to soames sir it is my right to take part in this bolitho looked at him calmly i will decide where your duty lies your loyalty i take for granted he watched soames marching up and down a double line of men your turn will come be sure of that a shadow fell across fowlars chart and bolitho saw the spanish lieutenant rojart watching him his face as sad as ever yes teniente he must have come ashore in one of the other boats rojart said i arrive to offer my services capitan he looked at davy and allday his face very proud don luis as instructed me to do all i can to elp you bolitho sighed rojart had already shown himself to be somewhat of a dreamer or perhaps his cruel experiences in the shipwreck had made him as he was but one more officer spanish or not would be useful he also provided an excuse he said to davy so you see mr herrick will need your services more than ever now to rojart he replied i accept your offer teniente thank you the spaniard gave a flashing smile and bowed your servant capitin allday grinned and murmured god help us all another cask was being manhandled on to the beach and duff puffed out of the trees folding his spectacles as he shouted that be the last un sir he beamed at the onlookers a full load soames tightened his swordbelt and said ready when you are sir he pointed to the assembled seamen all armed but without any unnecessary gear to drag em back he ignored davy keen and his pickets were gathering at the end of the beach and by the shallows pryke stood guard over an odd pile of timber which his mates had collected for him davy touched his hat formally i wish you luck sir bolitho smiled thank you i hope we will not need it just yet he glanced at fowlar lead the way and make notes as we go who knows we may come here again some day then he turned his back on the sea and strode up the beach towards the trees we will rest now bolitho dragged his watch from his breeches pocket and peered at it its face was harder to see than the last occasion when he looked up at a gap in the trees he thought the sky was already duller the trees touched with purple instead of gold around him the seamen dropped wearily on their knees or leaned against the trees trying to gain relief after their forced march the first part had not been too difficult with axes swinging to carve a trail they had made good time but as they drew closer to where bolitho and fowlar estimated the inlet lay they had stopped using axes and had fought their way through the brush and creeper with bare hands he looked at them thoughtfully their shirts were ripped and torn faces and arms bloody from encounters with treacherous branches and thorns at their backs the intertwined trees had grown blacker and seemed to shiver in the vapour of dead vegetation as if in a wind which could not be felt soames was wiping his face and neck with a rag ive sent scouts ahead sir he knocked a water bottle from a mans mouth easy damn you that may have to last awhile yet bolitho saw him with different eyes like the men soames had selected as scouts for instance not the toughest or the most seasoned seamen as a lieutenant of his background might be expected to choose both scouts were from undines newest recruits and had never been to sea before one had worked on a farm and the other had been a norfolk wildfowler excellent choices both he thought they had gone off into the trees with hardly a sound allday muttered what dyou think captain his sturdy figure familiar and reassuring made bolitho relax slightly he replied i think we are very near now he wondered how herrick was managing and whether he had sighted any more native craft he shivered like most of his men he felt out of place here cut off fowlar hissed stand to lads someones acomin muskets moved blindly in the gloom and a few men started to draw their cutlasses soames snapped a scout he strode towards the shadow by god hodges that was quickly done the man stepped into the small clearing and looked at bolitho i found the ship sir she be about alf a mile away he stretched out one arm if we veers a piece we should be able to reach er within the hour what else hodges shrugged he was a lean man and bolitho could well picture him as a wildfowler creeping about in the norfolk marshes he said i didnt stray too near youll understand sir but theyre anchored close in theres more on em ashore in a clearing i card someone he faltered sort of moanin he shuddered it made me flesh tingle i can tell you sir soames said harshly as i thought bloody slavers theyll have a camp ashore they collect the poor devils and sort em into groups girls in one party men in tother they weigh em then decide who will last the voyage to wherever the cargo is bound fowlar spat on the dead leaves and nodded the rest they leave behind cut their throats to save powder and shot bolitho looked at the scout trying to shut fowlars blunt comment from his thoughts everyone knew it happened nobody seemed to know how to deal with it especially when many influential persons reaped a rich profit from the trade are there guards about i saw two sir but they seem well content the ship as two guns run out soames grunted no doubt a bellyful of grape or canister if anyone tries to free those bastards the spanish lieutenant moved amongst them despite the rough passage through the trees he managed to remain very elegant in his ruffled shirt and wide cuffs peraps we should continue towards the shore capitan he shrugged eloquently there is no sense in arousing this ship if she is a mere slaver yes soames turned away saying nothing but bolitho guessed that like most sailors he was disgusted that rojart could accept slavery as a natural state of affairs we go forward teniente in any case our boats will not come for us until tomorrow he looked at soames take charge i am going to see for myself he beckoned to midshipman keen you too as he felt his way out of the clearing he added the rest of you be ready to follow no talking and hold on to each other if you fear getting separated any man who fires a musket by whatever means or accident will feel my anger hodges pushed ahead saying my mate billy norris is keepin a weather eye on em sir follow close ive marked the way bolitho took his word although he could see no marks anywhere it was amazing how near they had been it seemed no time at all before hodges was tapping his arm and gesturing for him to take cover amidst some sharptoothed scrub and here opening up like a theatre was the inlet and how much lighter it seemed the sunlight still lingering on the trees and painting the sluggishly moving water with rippling reflections he eased himself forward trying to ignore the painful jabs in his hands and chest then he froze forgetting all the discomfort and uncertainty as he saw the ship for the first time behind him he heard allday voicing his thoughts by god captain its the one which lured the dons on to that reef bolitho nodded the brigantine appeared larger in the confined inlet but there was no mistaking her he knew he would not forget her for many a year to come he heard the same pitiful moaning hodges had described and then the sharp clatter of steel on thefar side of the inlet allday whispered putting manacles on the wretches yes he wriggled forward again seeing the brigantines anchor cable a boat alongside the glow of light from her poop as before no flag but there was no doubting her watchfulness two guns already run out muzzles depressed to rake any attacker a boat glided from the shore very slowly and bolitho tensed as a woman cried out the sound dragging at his nerves as it echoed around the trees taking slaves aboard allday ground his teeth theyll be off shortly thats my guess bolitho agreed to keen he said fetch the others tell them to take care he sought out the crouching shape of the second scout you go with him to allday he said quietly if we can seize her well know for sure who was behind nervions destruction allday had his cutlass in both hands im for that captain more thuds and sounds from alongside the brigantine and another shrill cry rising to a scream until it was swiftly silenced by a blow bolitho tried to estimate how far this point was from the sea the slavers master would need to be able to slip away as quietly as he had entered he would require stealth as little noise as possible until he was clear it seemed incredible to be watching this same vessel while undine had waited to search for nervions survivors and had then taken wide detours to avoid land and other ships the slaver had pushed on with his own affairs as if nothing had happened it took ironhard nerves for that there were more sharp cries like animals at slaughter slavers had no nerves no pity he heard furtive noises behind him and soamess voice flat unemotional young keen was right then it is the same vessel he squinted at the treetops beyond the brigantine not much time left sir itll be as black as a boot in an hour maybe less what i believe too bolitho looked at the clearing where the slaves were being gathered a few wisps of smoke from fires probably for a blacksmith to work on the manacles but it was the weakest point take twenty men and move around the camp at the first sign of alarm you open fire with everything you have create panic if nothing else aye makes sense bolitho nodded his mind chilling with excitement a kind of madness which always came at such moments ill want ten men who can swim if we can board her while the slaves are being loaded we might be able to hold the poop until you rush the boats and join us he heard soames rubbing his chin a wild plan sir but its now or never it seems to me its settled then tell rojart to keep a few hands here to protect our flank for this is the way we must go if all fails soames started to crawl away hissing his orders into the forest until he appeared satisfied other figures rustled and grunted nearby and keen said our party is ready sir our party keens teeth looked very white in the fading light i am an excellent swimmer sir allday muttered anxiously i hope there are none of those damned serpents in the water bolitho looked around at their faces how well he had got to know most of them he saw it all in these last moments fear anxiety wildness to match his own even brutal eagerness he said shortly we will slide into the water below the bushes leave your shoes and everything else but your weapons he sought out allday see that the pistols are well wrapped it should keep them dry for a while he studied the sky it was darkening swiftly and only the treetops still held the gentle glow of sunlight in the inlet and around the anchored brigantine the water was dull like liquid mud nosy he caught his breath as the water came up to his waist and then his neck it was very warm he waited a few more seconds expecting to hear a shout or the sound of a musket but the muffled cries from the camp told him he had chosen the time well they were too busy to watch everywhere at once the others were in the water behind him their weapons held high as they paddled slowly away from the bank keen was overtaking him his arms moving smoothly he whispered ill make for the cable sir he was actually grinning further and further still until they had passed the halfway and bolitho knew if they were discovered now they would be lost the masts and yards stood high overhead the furled sails sharp against the sky the lantern light shining more brightly in the descending gloom feet thudded on deck and a man laughed wildly a drunkards laugh perhaps you needed extra rum for such work he thought and then as if by magic they were all together clawing the rounded hull below the starboard cathead the current dragging at their legs folding them against the rough timbers as they fought to stay concealed allday gasped the boatsll never see us here were safe for a bit at that very instant a terrible cry floated across the water and for a moment bolitho imagined someone had been killed but the seaman at his side was floundering and pointing towards the bank which they had just left even in the dying light it was easy to recognise rojarts ruffled shirt he was standing in the open his arms held out as if to seize the inlet and everything it contained he yelled again and again waving his fists stamping his feet as if he had gone raving mad rojarts sudden appearance had brought a complete hush to the brigantines deck but now as voices babbled and shouted and more feet thudded along the planking bolitho knew any hope of surprise was gone keen had been clinging to the bobstay below the bowsprit but now allowed himself to drift down towards him he gasped wretchedly nobody told rojart it was the ship which sank nervion he must have just discovered the sound of the shot was deafening and seemed to come from almost overhead the smoke gushed and eddied across the swirling water making more than one man duck his face to avoid a fit of coughing before it hid the bank bolitho saw rojart hurled away by a full charge of canister a bloody rag not a man at all he clung to the line which allday had bent on to the bobstay and tried to clear his mind the unexpected and unforeseen he winced as another shot crashed out from further aft the hull shivering under his fingers as if alive a ball this time he heard it smashing through the trees and then fading away completely and it was then from beyond the hidden camp that soamess men opened fire herricks decision the sporadic bang of musket fire was almost drowned by the mingled cries and screams from the terrified slaves bolitho heard men tumbling into a boat on the opposite side of the brigantine and confused yells which were probably to encourage their companions in the camp he gestured to allday now over the bows his limbs were like lead as he hauled himself up and across the small beakhead his heart pounding his ribs hearing the gasps and frantic whispers from the men below him as they climbed on to the forecastle he saw groups of manacled natives their naked bodies crowded together while they watched what was happening on the land two armed seamen stood beside a swivel gun but as the boat pulled away from the side they were unable to fire without hitting their comrades allday bellowed at em lads then he was flying along the deck his heavy cutlass taking a man across the neck and felling him without even a cry the second guard dropped on one knee and aimed a musket as more and more of bolithos party scrambled aboard faces lit up in the flash and bolitho felt the ball whine past the sickening sound as it smashed into flesh and bone more of the brigantines crew were dashing wildly from the poop firing as they came regardless of the screaming slaves who fell dying in their path a naked girl her body shining with sweat was trying to reach one of the fallen slaves her arms pinioned by a length of chain husband brother bolitho had no time even to guess as one of the crew hacked her down with his cutlass in order to bar the way aft bolitho felt his sword jerk in his hand as he crossed blades with the girls killer he saw the hatred on the mans bearded face the madness in his eyes as they pressed forward and apart feet sliding in someones blood bodies balanced to withstand each parry all round the deck others were fighting and slashing in the shadows with only an occasional pistol shot to throw light on friend and enemy bolitho pushed the man against the main mast forcing him backwards over the spiderband while their hilts stayed locked below his throat he could feel the other mans anger giving way to fear saw the sudden anguish as he jerked the hilt free and struck him hard across the mouth with it as he fell away gasping for breath bolitho turned and thrust the man gave one shriek lifting an arm as the blade drove under his shoulder and deeper still allday dashed to his side and gasped well done captain he rolled the man away with his foot then he snarled and another by god the seaman had jumped from the shrouds to take them by surprise from above to escape the unexpected attack bolitho did not know all he heard was alldays quick breathing the swish of his blade as he slashed the man down and then finished him with one more terrible blow two boats comin sir bolitho ran to the bulwark and then ducked as a ball slammed hard into the rail by his fingers he yelled train that swivel on them someone scuttled past him firing a pistol as he fled from alldays cutlass bolitho spun round sobbing as the pain lanced into his thigh but when he felt his leg and the jagged tear in his breeches there was no blood no agonising splinter of broken bone the man who had fired had inadvertently run too close to the yelling slaves chains swung like serpents and he vanished beneath a struggling heap of screaming shining bodies allday threw his arm around bolithos waist where are you hit captain his anxiety was clear even amidst the din of shouting and screaming bolitho pushed him aside gasping between his teeth hit my watch damn his eyes allday grinned and ducked after him i think his time has stopped too bolitho only glanced at the thing which had rolled away from the panting slaves they had literally torn him to pieces he dragged allday clear stray too close and you will follow him ungrateful dogs bolitho reached the abandoned swivel and swung it towards the nearest long boat probably think we are a different lot of slavers he jerked the lanyard feeling the hot breath from the muzzle as the canister exploded across the crowded boat screams and curses bodies splashing in the water and others still firing from the sternsheets he twisted round trying to see where soames had reached on the shore but it was impossible to be certain shots stabbed and whimpered over the inlet and once he thought he heard steel on steel then he turned and looked inboard how many he caught keens wrist as he lurched past a dirk gleaming in one hand an empty pistol held like a club in the other keen stared at him dazedly we seem to have lost five of our people sir but the slavers have either been killed or have jumped overboard bolitho strained his ears for the sounds of more oars the one thing which would tell him soames was coming to his aid there was a loud thud from aft and he guessed that another boat was grappling in readiness for boarding he peered at his little party five dead one obviously wounded it was not enough allday shouted hoarsely we can manhandle one of the guns to the hold and put a ball through her bottom if we can hold em on the poop while bolitho shook his head pointing at the slaves they are held by more than one chain they would go down with the ship he could feel the fight dying in his surviving men like fire under heavy rain most of them were staring aft each unwilling to be the first to challenge this new attack they did not have long to wait the poop doors burst open and a group of men charged along the littered deck their voices yelling wildly in what seemed like a dozen different languages bolitho balanced himself on the balls of his feet the sword angled across his body cut the cable well let her drift ashore in the shallows a ball shrieked above his head and he turned to see one of his men sprawled headlong blood gushing from his throat he had been struck by a marksman somewhere in the shrouds allday yelled stand fast you bastards but it was useless the remaining seamen were clambering forward again dropping their weapons in their frantic haste to get away only keen remained between him and the beakhead his arms at his sides his young body swaying with exhaustion allday said come on captain its no use he fired a pistol into the advancing shadows and grunted with satisfaction as a man screamed in agony the next seconds were too blurred to understand one moment bolitho was astride the bowsprit and the next he was swimming towards the black wall of trees he could not remember diving or regaining the surface although his lungs were raw from shouting from keeping alive feathers of spray spurted nearby and he heard feet stampeding along the brigantines deck as more men climbed from boats or swam out from the shore shots whimpered above his head and there was one short cry as a seaman was hit and disappeared beneath the surface keep together it was all he could do to speak and the foultasting water was slopping again and again into his mouth he saw a white figure splashing down the beach and when he groped for his sword he stumbled headlong his feet stubbing against sand and stone beneath him but it was soames his chest heaving from exertion his hair wild as he pulled bolitho to dry land bolitho gasped at the air they had failed they had lost several good men for nothing allday was hauling keen from the water and two more figures lay on the sand like corpses only their fierce breathing telling otherwise there were no others a gun banged out from the brigantine but the ball went wide splintering through the trees to a chorus of shrieks from birds and slaves alike soames said harshly i could only capture one boat sir the slaver had a large party ashore he sounded angry despairing when they fired at that damn spaniard my lads started to attack it was too soon im sorry sir not your fault bolitho walked heavily along the waters edge searching for one more swimmer how many did you lose soames replied indifferently seven or eight he gestured to several dark shapes along the beach but we took a dozen of the others he added with sudden fury we could have taken that damn ship i know we could yes bolitho gave up his search muster our people and lead me to the boat we must pick up mr fowlar and his party while its dark the slaver will be ready for us by dawn im thinking it was not much of a boat and leaked badly from a couple of stray musket balls one by one the weary seamen clambered into it hardly looking at each other or even caring where they were if they were called on to fight now they would fail completely bolitho watched them anxiously vaguely he recalled herricks words all those weeks back different in peacetime perhaps they were the wounded men were sobbing quietly and he pushed keen towards them see to them he saw the youth draw back knew that he too was close to breaking he reached out and squeezed his shoulder hold on mr keen to soames he said quietly mr fowlars party can take the oars theyll be in better shape he turned as a new sound intruded from the trees like one huge beast stamping its feet while a combined chorus of yells echoed and reechoed around the inlet allday muttered what in the name of god is that the slaves at the camp soames was standing beside bolitho as the boat edged away from the land they know something we dont bolitho swayed as the overloaded craft rocked dangerously in the current the slaves must realise that despite the brigantines presence and the power of her guns they would not now be taken as captives to the other side of the world not this time anyway he thought of the native craft herrick had sighted they might be here already he snapped easy there i can see mr fowlar the masters mate peered into the boat with obvious dismay ill never get my party in too sir soames jerked his thumb towards the trees you will if you wish to stay alive allday took the tiller and checked each man as he climbed into the boat somehow they all got in barely leaving the oarsmen room to pull and with the hull so low in the water there was hardly six inches of freeboard shove off he winced as a gun banged out the long orange flame of fire darting from the vessels side like a vicious tongue the ball hissed astern of the boat and pounded into the sand bolitho called easy now watch the stroke lads too many splashes and the gunners would have an aiming mark keen whispered one of them has just died sir he added hoarsely hodges heave him over the side watch the trim lads keep her steady poor hodges he would not walk in the marshes again never feel the north sea on his face or see the ducks in flight he shook himself angrily what was the matter with him the corpse drifted clear and another man shifted along the thwart soames observed theyve ceased firing probably licking their wounds like us most likely bolitho felt the bitterness rising again the slaver had lost several men but had still enough captives to make his visit profitable whether he retrieved the rest from the camp or not whereas he tried not to face the fact that they had failed his men had fallen back probably because they had lost whatever faith they had held in him nervions attacker was as much a mystery as before a slavers crew was usually made up from the sweepings of many ports and many tongues perhaps davy had been right after all and he should never have attempted to capture the brigantine his head was aching to match the bruise on his thigh he was barely able to think any more fowlar said mr mudge has explained it to me sir the ship will have to stand well out tomorrow because of the shoals hereabouts the slavers master doubtless knows a better passage but he left the rest unsaid very well bolitho saw an overhanging clump of trees reaching out across the water like a partly demolished bridge we will make fast here rest the men and share out the last of our water and rations nobody replied and some of them appeared to be sleeping where they sat or crouched like so many bundles he tried not to think about the brigantine but for his action she would be in ignorance of undines presence it was obvious they had not seen her nor had they understood who had attacked and tried to capture their ship after all it was not unknown for one slaver to prey upon another for extra profit but now because of his persistence her master would recognise undine as soon as he stood out to sea undine would be unable to venture too close inshore and a long chase would prove just as fruitless so if he had been involved in delaying puigservers mission he would now know that undine at least was on her way he clenched his fingers around his sword until the pain steadied him but for rojart they would have succeeded how many battles had been lost by a single stupid oversight poor rojart the ship which had destroyed his nervion was the last thing he had seen on earth then she had murdered him just as brutally the bowman called i can see a beach to larboard capnl looks safe enough allday glanced at bolithos shoulders feeling his despair as if it were his own bolitho said take her there allday he pushed his other thoughts aside with something like physical force we will work in three watches two hours at a time he tried again post sentries and keep a good lookout the bowman leapt over the stem and waded into the shallows a line across his ragged shoulder like a halter the boat nudged on to hard sand tilting drunkenly to the current and the sudden shift of men as they staggered ashore bolitho listened to soames as he picked out his sentries for the first watch had he been in charge of the boarding party would he have hesitated he doubted it soames would have done what he saw ass his duty helpless slaves or not and put a ball through the brigantines bottom or touched off her magazine in this climate she would have been gutted in minutes leaving the slavers isolated and easy to capture at leisure because he had not been able to destroy the slaves bolitho had gained nothing and he had lost nearly a third of his original party as well allday slumped down beside him and handed him a water flask ive secured the boat captain he yawned hugely i just hope we dont have to pull too far in it thats all then he said dont you fret things arent that bad when bolitho remained silent he added weve seen an done much worse in our time i know some of our people took to their heels instead of rallying when they were most needed but times are different or seem so to many of em bolitho looked at him dully but could not see his expression how so allday shrugged they dont see the sense in getting killed for a few slaves or a ship they know nothing about in the old phalarope it was different ysee a flag to follow an enemy you could recognise bolitho laid back against a tree and closed his eyes hearing the jungle coming alive for the night squeaks and roars groans and rustlings he said you mean that they do not care allday grinned if it was a proper war captain a real one like the last wed soon make em into fighters so unless they are threatened personally they will not fight for those less fortunate bolitho opened his eyes and studied the stars overhead before this voyage is done i fear that some of them may come to understand otherwise but allday had fallen asleep his cutlass across his chest like a dead knight bolitho stood up quietly and walked to the boat to see how the wounded man had settled down for the night he saw the stars reflected on the sluggish water and was surprised to discover he was feeling less despairing he looked back at the trees but alldays shape was lost in darkness by accident or design he did not know but it had often happened with allday he seemed to hit upon the very thing which was troubling him in his simple open manner not dispel it completely but stand back from it and keep it in its proper perspective when he reached the boat he found the seaman sleeping heavily his rough bandage very white against the planking keen looked up startled sorry i did not see you sir bolitho replied rest easy mr keen we are snug here for the night as he walked away fowlar who had been washing his face and hands in the water moved to the boat and said admiringly what a man eh never a one to weep an wail when things go hard keen nodded i know i hope im like him one day fowlar laughed the sound bringing more cries from the forest bless you mr keen im sure hed be flattered to know that keen turned back to watch the wounded seaman under his breath he said fervently well i do and thats an end to it in the pale glow of morning both sea and sky were joined by a filtered milky haze as the overcrowded longboat moved ponderously away from the trees and tiny beaches which lined both sides of the inlet bolitho watched for some sign of life or movement which might betray an ambush a few birds floated overhead and far beyond the last jutting spit of land he saw open water colourless in the strange light he turned his attention to the men in the boat their brief rest seemed to have had little effect they looked tired and anxious their clothes filthy with dirt and dried blood faces dark with stubble there was little to associate them with a kings ship soames was standing upright beside allday peering ahead watching the men who baled away the seeping water keeping an eye on the remaining wounded sailor his eyes were never still keen was right forward squatting on the stemhead his bare legs and feet dangling in the water while he watched the nearest bank his body sagging as if from a great weight the hull lifted and dipped as the first inshore swell rolled into the inlet some of the men croaked with alarm but most merely stared listlessly in front of them beyond caring bolitho said we will turn to larboard when we get into open water it will make our meeting with undines boats all the quicker soames glanced at him could be hours before they come itll be like a damned oven today im thinking bolitho groped for his watch and winced as his fingers touchqd the bruise when he lifted the watch from his pocket he stared at it for several seconds seeing where the ball had lanced from it smashing both shield and mechanism to fragments but saving him from injury but for it he would probably be dying now or at best a prisoner aboard the brigantine soames said quietly made short work of that sir bolitho nodded he could remember exactly when his mother had given it to him he had just been commissioned lieutenant the watch had meant a lot to him partly because it reminded him of her of her gentleness and forbearance over losing her family to the sea the boat tilted and several voices shouted in protest and he saw keen struggling back into the hull his face shocked as he yelled ahead sir larboard bow bolitho stood up one hand on alldays shoulder as he stared at the two low shapes which were emerging around the last spit of land they were moving quite fast the long paddles plunging and rising in perfect unison as they headed purposefully into the inlet fowlar said harshly war canoes i seen plenty on em in my time therell be more close by if im not mistaken he dragged out his pistol and fumbled with a powder horn soames slitted his eyes to watch the two low canoes his face like a mask gods teeth there must be thirty men in each of em one of the seamen shouted wildly it aint fair we got no reason to fear em lads we aint no slavers silence that man fowlar cocked the pistol and rested it on his forearm to them were all the bloody same so hold your noise p bolitho said speed the stroke they may let us pass allday kept his eyes on the oars if you say so captain another man called astern sir i can see the brigantines topsls bolitho turned carefully to avoid unsettling the oarsmen the man had not been mistaken far astern and moving at a snails pace above some low trees was a limp square of sail the slaver must have taken stock of his position and got under way before dawn the lifeless canvas told bolitho that the ship was being warped downstream with the aid of her boats but once in open water she would be free and away he glanced again at the advancing canoes whereas he and his men would stay here and die if they were lucky soames asked what can we do sir we cant outpace those canoes and theyll not let us get near enough to grapple he was fidgeting with his swordhilt showing anxiety for the first time bolitho called check the powder and shot there would not be much left what with the confused battle ashore and his own boarding party leaving their weapons behind he could hope for very little fowlar reported bare enough for one shot per man sir very well send the two best marksmen aft give them all the powder you have to soames he added softly we might hold them off until our own boats come for us the canoes had stopped their paddles glinting as they backed at the water holding the slim hulls motionless like a pair of pike bolitho wished he had a telescope but that too lay somewhere in the jungle he could see the natives clearly enough their skins very black their bodies angled to the paddles in readiness to move at a seconds notice in the stern of each hull was a tall man wearing a bright headdress his body hidden by an oval shield he thought of the slaves in the clearing the girl who had been killed on the brigantines deck these silent watchers would show no mercy for anyone he saw the spears glinting in the growing sunlight only blood would satisfy them nearer and nearer until less than half a cable separated them from the poised canoes bolitho looked at the two muskets in the sternsheets fowlar had one and a scarfaced seaman held the other between them the pile of powder and shot seemed even smaller now bear to starboard aliday he was surprised how unemotional he sounded they will have to move soon as the longboat swung heavily towards the centre of the opening both canoes came alive the paddles darting into the water at a great pace the air suddenly filled with the beat of a drum and the animal cry of a single warrior in the prow of the leading craft bolitho felt the boat thrusting ahead beneath his feet saw the sweat on the oarsmens faces the eyes which turned to watch the oncoming canoes widening with fear he shouted take care keep the stroke eyes in the boat something hit the water alongside and threw spray over his leg it must have been a heavy stone for immediately a whole volley of them rained down on the heads and backs of the struggling seamen knocking some of them unconscious the stroke was failing and one oar had drifted away as still more jagged stones plunged amongst them bolitho said open fire fowlar squeezed his trigger and cursed as the ball went astray the other musket banged out and one of the natives screamed and pitched from his canoe soames yelled keep baling he fired his pistol abeam and swore with satisfaction as another black figure plunged into the water both canoes were swinging round in a wide arc to follow astern one on either quarter they were cut off now from each side of the inlet and ahead the sea was opening up to greet them mocking them with its emptiness fowlar fired again and had better luck bringing down a plumed figure who was apparently beating out the time for the paddles the seamen were all so busy at the oars or peering fearfully astern that hardly any of them saw the real threat until it was almost too late bolitho yelled get forrard mr fowlar fire when you can he stared fixedly at the canoes which had suddenly swept around the green hump of land spreading out like a fan as they surged towards him a dozen at least all filled with whooping screaming savages the first shot made them falter but only for minutes then they came on again the canoes cutting through the inshore swell like swordblades some of the seamen were whimpering and pulling haphazardly at their oars others tried to stand up while a few began to gather fallen stones to defend themselves fowlar yelled that is my last ball sir he cursed as a heavy stone hurled at extreme range by a sling glanced off the gunwale and cut open the back of his hand the leading canoe was drawing very near the din of chanting and the drum almost deafening bolitho drew his sword and shouted ready lads he looked at his cowering men close quarters but it was not to be instead another volley of stones clattered over the boat striking one seaman so badly that he fell overboard the man with the musket fired and brought down two savages with one shot the canoe swung away some of the paddles being dropped so that the floundering seaman could be hauled up into their midst bolitho watched sickened as they dragged the man to his feet pinioning his arms and holding him so that he faced the slowmoving longboat he could see the blood on his neck where the stone had hit him imagine his screams which were drowned by the yelling figures who held him one with a high headdress waved a knife above his head back and forth back and forth so that the captured seamen followed it with his eyes as if watching a snake his mouth like a black hole as he continued to scream the knife came down very slowly the blood shining in the sunlight and making several of the seamen retch and groan with horror allday said tightly jesus christ theyre skinning him alive bolitho seized the marksmans shoulder feeling him jump as if he was dying with the man in the canoe do what you can he had to force the words out when he looked astern again he saw that the man was still alive writhing like a soul in hell as the knife did its work the musket bucked against the sailors shoulder and bolitho turned away fighting back the nausea soames said thickly the only way sir id not let a dog suffer like that fowlar shouted brigantines away sir the slaver had slipped into deeper water almost without anyone noticing her boats hoisted inboard and already her foresail set and drawing well as she rode clear of the protecting land the canoes were forming into two arrowheads again the drums getting wilder as they manoeuvred for the final attack bolitho held his sword towards the hazy horizon pull lads well not go under without a fight it was an empty speech but it was better than merely standing and watching them overwhelmed tortured and killed without lifting a finger allday whispered here they come he held the tiller between his legs and drew his cutlass keep close captain well show the bastards bolitho looked at him they were outnumbered ten to one and his men were already fit to drop the fight gone out of them he said simply we will allday he touched his thick forearm and thank you a great yell made him turn and as the boat swayed dangerously to the sudden shift of bodies he saw the crisp topsails and jib the figurehead shining in the milky glare like pure gold as undine tacked around the headland her starboard battery run out in a line of black teeth soames bellowed sit down youll have us in the sea otherwise allday said hoarsely now there is a sight captain fowlar called shes going about sir in gods name shes acomin through the shoals bolitho could barely breathe as he watched undines graceful outline shortening her sails in momentary disarray until the yards had been trimmed again if she struck now she would share nervions fate and worse when the survivors were taken by the war canoes but she showed no hesitation and he could see the bloodred coats of the marines along the quarterdeck nettings and even imagined he could discern herrick and mudge beside the wheel as the frigate heeled heavily to the wind her gunports almost awash keen was yelling huhza huhza lads he was cheering and weeping waving his shirt above his head the closeness of danger forgotten the brigantine had already changed tack clawing clear of a dark smudge below the surface while she set more sail to carry her to the south fowlar said with disbelief shes goin after the slaver they must be mad bolithodid not speak just watching his ship was enough it told him what herrick was thinking and doing as if he had shouted it aloud herrick knew he could not engage all the canoes in time to save bolitho and his small party he was going to stop the brigantine and so distract the war canoes in the only way he knew as the realisation came to him undine opened fire it was a slow carefullyaimed broadside the guns belching smoke and flame at regulated intervals while the frigate swept further and further amongst the hidden shoals someone gave a cracked cheer as the brigantines foretopmast shuddered and then curtsied down into the sea alongside in a tangle of rigging and canvas the effect was immediate and within seconds she was paying off to the wind her hull broadside on as another volley crashed and ricocheted all around her one twelvepound ball struck the sea near her quarter and shattered into fragments so near was the shoal to the surface shes struck everyone was yelling and screaming like a madman hugging each other and sobbing with disbelief bolitho dragged his gaze from the brigantine which had slewed round either on a shoal or a sandspit her canvas in pandemonium while she continued to drive ashore he held his breath as undine shortened sail the tiny figures on her yards like ants her copper glinting brightly as she thrust round again on the opposite tack another half a cable and she would have been aground allday shouted shes hoveto captain an theres a boat being dropped bolitho nodded unable to answer the canoes were paddling furiously towards the helpless brigantine and more canoes had appeared around the headland the latter very careful to stay clear of undines bared guns the frigates big launch was speeding across the choppy water and when one of the canoes turned towards it the crash of its swivel gun was enough to make the yelling natives join their companions elsewhere davy stood in the sternsheets very erect and proper even his oarsmen seemed totally unreal against the tattered cheering remnants of bolithos landing party the captured longboat was already sinking more planks having been stove open by stones and bolitho doubted if they could have lasted another halfhour even without the attacking canoes as the launch grappled alongside and hands dragged the gasping survivors to safety he turned to watch the listing brigantine even at this distance it was possible to hear the muskets the baying chorus from the canoes as they surrounded her for the final attack revenge or justice the slavers end would be terrible indeed davy took his wrist and helped him into the other boat good to see you again sir he looked at soames and grinned and you of course bolitho sat down and felt his limbs beginning to quiver uncontrollably he kept his eyes on the ship as she grew and towered above him very conscious of his own feelings for her and those who had risked their lives for him herrick was waiting to greet him his anxiety matched only by his relief as he took bolithos hands and said thank god youre safe bolitho fought for time looking at the loosely flapping sails the watching marines the gun crews who had paused in their swabbing to look at him and grin herrick had taken a terrible chance it had been sheer lunacy and he could tell from mudges expression beaming and nodding by the compass that his was an equal share but there was something new here which had been lacking before he tried to name it herrick was saying we heard the shooting sir and guessed you might be in trouble instead of sending boats we came in strength so to speak he let his glance move along the busy figures at the guns and waiting by the braces they did well they were glad to be here bolitho nodded understanding pride that was it to find it had cost them dear and it could have gone much worse he said get the ship under way if you please let us stand away from this damnable coast he paused searching for the words and thomas if you ever doubt your ability to command again i will remind you of today you handled her to perfection herrick looked at mudge and almost winked we have a good captain sir and are beginning to feel the benefit of his drills and exercises bolitho turned aft suddenly spent i shall not forget then he walked to the cabin hatch with allday at his heels mudge ambled to herricks side a near thing mr errick if you adnt given the order i dont know if id ave ad the will to persist through them shoals herrick looked at him remembering bolithos expression the guard no longer hiding his thoughts well mr mudge i reckon it was well worth it he stared at the misty shore line and at a growing plume of smoke the brigantine must have caught fire he thought for a while longer he held on to the picture of the battered listing boat with bolitho upright in the sternsheets that old tarnished sword in his hand if he had not disobeyed bolithos order to put the ships safety before all else he would indeed be in command now and bolitho back there dying in agony get the hands to the braces he walked to the rail with his speaking trumpet and god bless lady luck below the cabin hatch bolitho heard herrick laugh and then the clatter of blocks as the seamen went to their stations for getting under way again allday asked quietly can i fetch you some wine captain or something a mite more powerful bolitho leaned against the mizzen mast trunk and felt it vibrating urgently to the pressure of wind and canvas high overhead dyou know allday i think that after all the trouble we went through to get it i would like a glass of fresh water madras bolitho stood very still by the quarterdeck rail and watched the vast spread of land which reached away on either bow in the morning sunlight the countless white buildings seemed to rise tier upon tier the uneven skyline decorated at irregular intervals by tall minarets and plump golden domes it was breathtaking and he could tell from the quiet way the seamen were moving around the decks that they were equally impressed he turned and looked at herrick very tanned and strangely unreachable in his best uniform we did it bolitho raised his telescope and watched some highprowed dhows scudding abeam their gaunt sails like wings even they were part of the magic mudge said ease off a point then he too fell silent as the wheel squeaked over perhaps he was satisfied and so he should be bolitho thought madras the name itself was like one great milestone for what they had achieved together three months and two days after weighing anchor at spithead back there bolitho had seen disbelief on mudges heavy face when he had suggested they might make the voyage in one hundred days herrick said quietly aye sir since we quit the african coast lady luck came with us for certain he grinned broadly you and your lady luck but he smiled all the same it had seemed much as herrick had described within a few days of leaving the land the dead and dying far astern the wind had risen from the southwest the fringe of the monsoon which on this occasion had acted as a friend day after day with all sail set undine had bounded along freely recklessly her forecastle never clear of bursting spray while dolphins and other strange fish had stayed close in company it was just as if that terrible confrontation with the war canoes seeing the seaman being flayed alive and all else had been one last great challenge he glanced up at the gently flapping topsails and forward to the solitary jib the power barely enough now to carry them into the wide anchorage and between that impressive spread of shipping madras the most important british station on the southeast coast of another continent a steppingstone to advancement elsewhere to trade and further discovery even the names were like fresh challenges siam and malacca southeast to java and beyond to a million unknown islands he saw a towering merchantman spreading more sail as she tacked heavily into a pale bank of seahaze with her chequered gunports and impeccable sail drill she could have been a manofwar but she was one of the east india companys ships and three months back bolitho would have given his right arm for just a few of her seamen well trained and disciplined they were far superior to the navys companies in many respects the company could and did afford better pay and conditions for its people while the navy still had to depend on what it could get by other means and in time of war that usually meant relying on the pressgangs bolitho had often considered the unfairness of the system one day perhaps in his own life he hoped to see the change come when the navy could offer the same fair inducements the big indiamans flag dipped from her peak and bolitho heard keen calling to his signalling party to return the salute then he looked again at his own company knowing he would not willingly change them now merely because it would make life easier browned by the sun toughened by hard work and regular drills with sails and weapons they were a far cry from that motley assortment at spithead he glanced towards the indiaman and smiled perfect or not she had had to dip her flag to a kings ship his undine mudge blewhis nose and called bout five minutes now sir bolitho raised his hand and saw the masters mate with the anchor party acknowledge it was fowlar a man who had proved his worth and his loyalty who had already earned promotion whenever an opportunity came captain bellairs was inspecting his marine drummers and looking even more like a toy soldier in the blazing sunlight davy and soames were on the gun deck with their separate divisions and the ship had never looked better he heard voices behind him and turned to see don puigserver and raymond speaking together by the taffrail like him they were probably eager to discover what awaited them here in madras puigserver was surprisingly elegant his clothing consisted of a lieutenants dresscoat which had been taken apart and refashioned by mrs raymonds maid aided willingly by jonas tait undines sailmaker tait had one eye but was very skilful even if he was the most villainous looking man aboard the maid seemed to find him fascinating well captain you must be pleased with yourself today mrs raymond stepped from the cabin hatch and crossed to his side she walked easily so used had she become to undines motions and behaviour in every sort of sea she too had altered still aloof for much of the time yet lacking the old veil of disinterest in shipboard life which had first irritated bolitho her large stock of personal delicacies which had come aboard at santa cruz had long been consumed and yet she had taken to the cabins simple fare with little complaint i am maam he pointed towards the bows you will soon be able to shed the smells and sounds of a small frigate i have no doubt that an english lady reigns like a queen out here perhaps she turned her head as if to watch her husband i hope to see you when you come ashore here after all you are king she laughed lightly in many ways i am sorry to leave the ship bolitho watched her thoughtfully he remembered when he had arrived aboard after the running battle with the canoes spent almost asleep on his feet as weariness replaced the will to fight and memory pushed aside his immediate relief at his own survival she had guided him to a chair rapping out orders to her maid to a startled noddall and even to allday as she had taken charge she had told someone to fetch the surgeon but when bolitho had said harsly im not hurt the ball hit my damned watch she had thrown back her head and laughed the unexpected reaction had angered him then as she had gripped his hand quite unable to stop her laughter he had found himself joining in perhaps that more than anything else had steadied him had released all the anxiety he had been forced to conceal until that moment some of it must have shown on his face as he remembered for she said softly can i share them my thoughts he smiled awkwardly i was thinking of something my watch he saw her lip begin to tremble again and wondered why he had not noticed the fine shape of her chin and throat until now when it was too late he felt himself flushing for what she nodded it was cruel to laugh so but you lookedso angry when anyone but you would have been grateful she turned her face away as herrick called ready sirv carry on mr herrick aye sir but his eyes were on the woman then he hurried to the rail yelling man the lee braces hands wear ship undine swung easily into the wind her anchor splashing down into water so blue it looked like satin puigserver pointed at a small procession of boats which were already moving towards the ship and said a time for ceremony capitan poor rojart would have enjoyed this part he was a different man now steely eyed impatient to move again to get his plans into order behind him raymond was watching the oncoming boats with a look of apprehension rather than excitement on his face with the anchor down and all sails neatly furled undines decks were bustling with life as her company prepared to take on stores visitors or whatever they were ordered to do above all to be ready to sail again within hours should it be required bolitho knew he would be needed for a dozen things at once even now he could see the purser hovering to catch his eye and mudge waiting to suggest or ask something he said perhaps i will see you on land mrs raymond the others were listening and he could feel their glances their interest it has not been an easy passage for you and i would wish to thank you for your er he faltered seeing her lip quiver very slightly forbearance equally gravely she replied and may i thank you in turn captain for your companionship bolitho made to bow to her but she held up her hand and said until the next time captain he took her hand and touched the back of it with his lips he felt her fingers give his just the merest squeeze and when he glanced at her face he knew it was no accident then it was all over as he was caught up in the turmoil of receiving visitors from the governor and handing his despatches to the officer of the guardboat as a brightlycanopied launch pulled clear of undines black shadow he saw his passengers looking astern towards him growing smaller with each sweep of the oars herrick said cheerfully i expect youll be glad to have the cabin to yourself sir youve waited long enough yes thomas indeed i will now sir concerning extra hands herrick had seen the lie in bolithos grey eyes and decided it was prudent to change the subject immediately it was late afternoon when bolitho received a summons to report in person to the governor he had begun to think that his part of the mission had been cancelled or that in madras his status had shrunk so much he would merely stay at arms length and do as he was bid whenever it might suit the proper authority accompanied by herrick and midshipman keen he was carried ashore in undines gig despite a haughty equerrys insistence that a local boat would be more fitting and comfortable an open carriage was waiting to convey them to the governors residence and for the whole of the short journey they barely exchanged a word the bright colours the surrounding press of chattering people the whole strangeness of the town took their complete attention bolitho found the people very interesting indeed how different their skins were ranging from pale brown no darker than young keens tan to those who were as black as the warriors he had seen in africa turbans and flowing robes cattle and dejected goats all milled across the winding streets in and around the curtained shops and bazaars in an unending panorama of noise and movement the governors residence was more like a fort than a house with slits in the walls for weapons and well guarded by indian troops the latter were most impressive turbaned and bearded yet they wore the familiar red coat of british infantry set off with baggy blue pantaloons and high white gaiters herrick gestured to the flag which drooped barely moving from a high staff and murmured that at least is familiar once through the gates and into the cool shadows of the house it was another world again the noise of the streets was sealed off as if by a great door and all around was an air of watchful elegance fine rugs and heavy brass ornaments barearmed servants who moved noiselessly like ghosts and tiled passageways which led away in every direction as in a maze the equerry said smoothly the governor will see you at once captain he eyed the others without enthusiasm alone bolitho looked at herrick mr keen will remain here in case i need to pass a message to the ship you can make good use of your time as you will he turned to hide his face from the equerry dont forget to keep an eye open for extra hands herrick grinned relieved perhaps at being spared yet another set of questions and answers the visitors to the ship had kept him on his feet since the anchor had been let go the sight of an english frigate seemed to attract far more interest than the comings and goings of merchantmen a link with home some word or hint of what these people had left behind in their search for empire he said good luck sir this is a far cry from rochester the equerry watched him leave and then glanced at keen to bolitho he said ill send the young gentleman to the troops quarters if you wish bolitho smiled i am sure he will be happier here keen met the mans stare calmly and replied indeed i will sir he could not resist adding my father will be glad to learn of your hospitality when next i write bolitho turned away his father owns quite a large portion of your trading agency here the equerry said no more but led the way down the grandest of the passages he opened some double doors and an pounced with as much dignity as he still retained captain richard bolitho of his britannic majestys ship undine bolitho already knew the governors name but little else about him sir montagu strang was almost hidden behind a great desk the sides of which appeared to be made of ebony with feet fashioned of massive silver claws he was a frail greyhaired man with a pallid complexion which told its own story of some past fever hooded eyes a thin unsmiling mouth he was studying bolithos approach along a strip of blue carpet as a hunter might examine a possible victim welcome bolitho the thin mouth turned upwards a fraction as if it hurt him to make the effort it was then and only then bolitho realised that strangs attitude was not one of disdain for as he moved around the desk he saw that the governor had been standing to receive him and not in a chair as he had first thought thank you sir bolitho tried not to show surprise or worse pity down to his waist sir montagu was a normal if slight figure beyond that his legs were tiny those of a dwarf and his neat hands hung seemingly to his knees strang continued in the same crisp tone please select a chair i have a few things to say before we join the others he let his gaze move over him before adding i have read your report and those of certain onlookers you did well and have made a fast passage your action in trying to save nervions people your attack on the slaveship if only partly successful are the two better pieces of news today bolitho sat down on the edge of a thronelike chair and then realised for the first time that the great overhead fan was being worked by a tiny indian who was squatting in a far corner apparently asleep his bare foot jerking a cord to keep it in regular motion strang returned to his desk and sat down bolitho guessed he always behaved in this manner with a new visitor to get it over with and avoid embarrassment he had heard that strang had spent many years in india as a representative of government as an adviser on trade and native affairs a very important man no wonder he had chosen power out here rather than suffer the constant humiliation of gaping eyes in london he said calmly now bolitho to business i have been waiting too long for despatches wondering if my original suggestions have been accepted nervions loss was a serious blow but your apparent determination to continue with the voyage without further advice cancels it out in some ways you have don puigservers admiration it seems although whether that is good or bad remains to be seen his hooded eyes flashed angrily the spaniards lost great opportunities in teluk pendang as a race they are stealers rather than builders the sword and the crucifix are about the most they can offer bolitho gripped his hands together and tried not to let his mind drift on strangs words so the mission was still in being undine would be going to teluk pendang strang said sharply i can see that you are ahead of me bolitho allow me to fill in a few small chinks eh then he smiled but it is refreshing to find one still able to think at all beyond the cool room bolitho heard the distant call of a bugle it sounded strangely sad strang saw his expression and said we were hard put during the war hyder ali the ruler of mysore and one with a real hatred for us had plenty of support from the french but for the navy i fear the fleur de lys and not the union flag would fly above here today he continued in an almost matteroffact tone but that is not your concern the sooner we can install a british governor in pendang bay the better i will be pleased since the end of the war the spanish garrison there which comprised mainly of native soldiers has been in a state of confusion fever and some sort of mutiny made their work impossible i am hardly surprised that the king of spain is so willing to rid himself of the station his voice hardened however under our protection it will prosper the local native ruler is harmless enough he must be to allow the spanish garrison to be alive but further to the west is a vast area almost uncharted and plundered by another less charitable prince muljadi if we are to extend our gains he must be contained is that understood i think so sir bolitho frowned yours is a great responsibility quite the wind always shakes the top of the tree bolitho i am not certain what i will be required to do sir i would have thought a fresh garrison of soldiers would be a better force than mine i know otherwise his voice was scathing as he added native troops for the most part with british officers whose minds have become numbed by heat and other er local attractions i must have mobility your ship in fact the french as you are now aware are very interested they have a frigate somewhere in those waters and that too you know which is why i cannot afford open conflict if we are to succeed we must be in the right and if this muljadi opposes us or those showing friendship sir strang walked to a wall tapestry and touched it lightly you will crush him he swung round with surprising agility in the kings name he picked up a small bell and shook it impatiently i am arranging a transport for the troops and all the stores required the east india company will provide a suitable vessel in due course the rest will be up to you under the new governors hand that is rear admiral beves conway has made many of the arrangements he darted a quick glance at him you know him then why yes sir bolithos mind grappled with a dozen memories at once he commanded the gorgon seventyfour my second ship he smiled despite strangs set features i was sixteen it will be an interesting reunion no doubt strang glared at the open door where a servant stood watching him anxiously take the captain to the chamber and next time i ring this bell i want you here at once as bolitho made to leave strang added you saw a company ship leaving harbour as you entered today yes sir homeward bound a rich cargo for england he smiled gently no i am not full of regrets or pining for the homeland which in any case is scotland i merely wished you to know that the vessels crew had a long nights celebration too much to drink a way sailors have he turned his back some twenty of her hands were too drunk to return on board they are in the care of my officers they have enough to do without the trouble of drunken oafs who had they been in a naval vessel would no doubt have been flogged for desertion i do not wish to know about it further but should your lieutenants care to take over the responsibility i am certain you could make better use of some extra men bolitho smiled thank you sir i will join you shortly now go and take wine with my staff bolitho found keen in the entrance hall and passed the news to him without delay the midshipmans eyes widened and he said ill tell mr davy at once sir though i doubt if john company will thank you for taking hands from an indiaman he chuckled nor will they sir bolitho hurried along the passage where he had seen the servant waiting for him his mind returning to strangs other news beves conway then the captain of a twodecker had always been something of a hero to him cold and remote in many ways but a superb seaman and not one given to undue harshness even with his midshipmen he had left the gorgon before bolitho having held the command for several years after that he had disappeared completely which was unusual in the navy faces like ships came and went repeatedly like the sea and wind which governed their lives with conway in control of things there would be little tolerance for failure he thought he was ushered into the vaulted room described as the chamber and was surprised to find it filled with a variety of people including a number of women he saw puigserver still dressed in his makeshift clothes and raymond in close conversation with a heavyjowled major raymond left his companion immediately and with barely a nod of recognition guided bolitho around the chamber making introductions hardly able to hide his impatience if someone asked about england or what the latest fashion was at home home was somewhat vague but for the most part seemed to be london raymond paused while bolitho took a glass of wine from a bowing servant like a lot of damned farmers he smiled at a lady as she passed but added savagely but they live well enough here bolitho watched him curiously raymond had tried to show his contempt but had sounded only envious then he heard a familiar voice and when he turned observed mrs raymond talking with someone he had not so far met she saw him immediately and called come and join us her smile faded slightly as she noticed her husband we have been talking about local customs raymond said abruptly rear admiral conway the new governor of teluk pendang conway had been standing with his back to bolitho he was dressed in a dull bottlegreen coat his shoulders sloping badly so that he seemed to be leaning forward he turned to face bolitho his eyes moving rapidly noting all that they saw bolitho said it is good to see you again sir he did not know how to continue if he had met conway in plymouth or anywhere else he would have walked past him could anyone change so much in twelve years he looked thin and very intense with two deep lines running from his hooked nose to his jaw so that the mouth appeared to be suspended between them only the eyes were familiar cool calculating conway held out his hand richard bolitho eh the handshake like his tone was dry and a postcaptain no less well well bolitho tried to relax it was like seeing someone looking through a mask a rear admiral but seniority apart he was only one rank higher than himself and no title no proud knighthood to mark his climb to success he said quietly i have been very fortunate sir mrs raymond touched conways sleeve with her fan he is too modest by far i have had good opportunity to watch the captain at his duties and listen to his past exploits conways glance darted between them did he relate them well maam i heard them from others her eyes regarded him coldly to drag selfpraise from the captain is to try and open an oyster with a feather conway picked a thread from his waistcoat i am relieved to hear it raymond said it seems i am to accompany you to the new station sir he did not hide his haste to distract conways attention from his wifes sudden anger that is so conway looked at bolitho the captain will tell you i am not one to tolerate mistakes i require everyone connected with the handover of governorship within reach he glanced at the chattering people around him not here living in spoiled unreality behind his shoulder mrs raymond looked at bolitho and pouted conway said i must go and speak to the military he bobbed his head if you will excuse me maam raymond waited just a few seconds then exploded do you have to make a scene viola in gods name conway could be important to me to us she looked at bolitho he is a pompous she sought for a word bore to her husband she added and it makes me sick the way you grovel to his kind you always seem to throw yourself after the failures raymond stared at her he is the new governor what are you suggesting she flashed a smile to someone across the room you do not know anything he is a failure you have only to look at him strangely enough raymond appeared relieved is that all i thought you had heard something he stared after conway i had better go to him sir montagu strang has instructed me to give all my experience to aid him she held her fan across her lips and whispered that should take very little time she slipped one hand through bolithos arm and now captain you can escort me if you will bolitho was still thinking of that rapid exchange between them most of all of conway and what he had become she squeezed his arm i am waiting an honour he smiled at her impatience and thank you for your defence just now he shook his head although i cannot imagine what has happened to conway her fingers dug into his arm one day some stupid officer will say that about you she tossed her head anyway it was true the pompous old bore bolitho saw the heavyjowled major watching him and then turning to murmur to a fellow soldier there will be talk maam if we walk about like this good she looked at him calmly do you care well no she nodded and my name is viola please use it in future true to his word sir montagu strang lost no time in putting his longstanding plan into operation two days after undines arrival at madras the bedford a heavy transport wearing the flag of the east india company dropped anchor nearby and began to take in stores and equipment for the new station after his first visit to the governors residence bolitho had had no time for relaxation so little was known of teluk pendang except by those who had been engaged with local trade there that it was some while before he was satisfied with his calculations mudge who knew the waters well gave his cautious approval and when bolitho had paid a visit to the bedfords captain he had been quick to praise not merely his work but also his readiness to consult an officer of the company not like a kings officer he had been greatly amused most of em would rather drive aground than enquire from the likes of us bolitho wondered what his attitude might have been had he known about the twenty extra seamen he had poached from the allpowerful eic before he had left the transport he had caught his first sight of the troops who were being sent to replace the spanish garrison they looked as if they intended to make their new station a permanent home for they were accompanied by as many wives and children varied livestock and a great mass of pots and pans which made him wonder where they could all be stowed bedfords captain was unimpressed so he guessed it was the normal way of doing things out here he was in his cabin writing his readiness report when herrick arrived to announce that a launch was approaching its only passenger was rear admiral beves conway bolitho hurried on deck half wondering why conway had stayed away from him since undines arrival and partly concerned at the lack of notice to his surprise he saw that conway was still dressed in his green coat devoid of decorations or sword he was not even wearing his hat as he stepped through the entry port and bowed curtly to bellairs guard of honour and to the quarterdeck at large taut ship bolitho the eyes flitted this way and that and bolitho tried to dispel his sudden resentment at conways attitude perhaps he had always been like this even in the gorgon when bolitho had watched his regular appearances on the quarterdeck or poop with something like awe dismiss the side party this is an informal visit conway walked to a sixpounder and ran his hand across the breech then he looked aloft where some hands were blacking down the rigging making it shine like ebony he nodded she looks well enough he turned his attention to the bedford at the booms which swayed back and forth above the boats and lighters moored around her bolitho was able to watch him less cautiously and saw the thinness of his hair which was completely grey without turning conway asked what is your estimated time of arrival at our destination given fair winds sir and in accordance with all i have discovered i hope to make a landfall in eighteen days three weeks at the most i have already been told that i am to sail ahead of the transport my idea conway turned and looked at him searchingly no sense in dragging our feet with that damned hulk then you will be coming in undine sir disappointed conway shrugged of course i shall i have made arrangements for my baggage to be sent out this afternoon bolithos picture of his cabin faded he had thought of it often since arriving at madras somewhere he could examine his mistakes and assemble his advantages puigserver was one thing conway another entirely it would be like being conways junior officer again he said i will inform my first lieutenant at once sir herrick he sounded indifferent no need bolitho stared at him that was not like conway he tried again at least we shall have a rear admirals flag at the mizzen when we reach teluk pendang sir the effect was startling conway spun round his features working with sudden anger was that slur intended does it give you some twisted pleasure to sneer if so i will damn soon break you for your insolence bolitho kept his voice calm aware of herrick watching nearby with obvious concern i am sorry sir i meant no disrespect conway took a deep breath no flag bolitho i am the governorelect of pendang bay a place neither you nor most of the world has ever heard of until now the bitterness had put a new edge to his voice to all intents i am out of naval service what respect i receive at your hands will be arranged accordingly bolitho stared at him it was suddenly all too clear conway had been putting off this moment not out of haughtiness or from any sort of envy at bolithos steady promotion since their first meeting but because he was a broken man then it will be done well sir that i can promise you he looked away i have been fortunate in the navy in many cases i have been aided by sheer chance or luck as my first lieutenant would say but i have never forgotten where i first gained the value of experience and the patience of my own captain conway fumbled with his waistcoat apparently oblivious to the sun across his neck and shoulders that was kindly said he looked at his hands and then thrust them behind his back may we go below in the cabin he moved about restlessly touching the furniture peering into corners without saying anything then he looked at one of the wooden quakers and snapped this was done for that woman eh yes sir but i will see that they remain until you are settled in your new command he had meant to say residence but the word just slipped out conway watched him his thin face expressionless then he said no have the guns replaced i need no bloody pampering i want this ship ready for anything a few missing guns might make a world of difference he did not explain but asked in the same abrasive tone that woman mrs raymond how did she stand up to three months in a fifthrate eh better than i had expected hmm he studied bolitho grimly his features in shadow watch yourself with her she is three years older than you but the gap in experience is immeasurably wider bolitho said hastily might i ask when sailing orders will arrive sir tomorrow probably but i can tell you now you will weigh the day after you receive your orders no delays maximum haste we will have company on the passage sir bolitho was certain that conways thoughts were elsewhere even though his ideas came out in perfect order brig don puigserver has chartered her for his own use partly my suggestion it is too close to the war for me to take a don as a friend i see sir you dont but no matter he walked to the stern windows and stared at the shoreline at the countless tiny craft which jostled the waterfront like busy insects i would like to stay aboard bolitho until we weigh sir bolitho looked around the cabin tiny compared with the residence ashore yes he swung away from the windows dyou object just for a second it was there again the same voice which bolitho still remembered no sir he smiled i have been waiting to broach some wine i have brought from london i london conway sighed that cursed place ive not set foot there for five years a plague on it and its selfishness perhaps it has changed since people do not change bolitho he touched his breast not here inside you of all people should know that when i learned who commanded my transport i knew you would be as you are not so merryeyed and trusting perhaps but youve not altered bolitho stayed silent watching the emotions on the other mans face each one perhaps representing a memory gorgon seems an eternity back in time the best moments were with her although i did not realise it was so ybolitho said carefully your new post will probably make ou believe otherwise sir you think that conway smiled but no humour touched his eyes it is given to me because i will succeed i must there is nothing else left when you make a slip bolitho you sometimes get one final chance to redeem yourself he pounded one hand against the other and i intend to succeed there was a tap at the door and allday stepped into the cabin who is this fellow my coxswain sir bolitho had to smile at the incredulous look on alldays face i see allday said mr herricks respects and could you come on deck to receive bedfords captain bolitho excused himself to conway and followed him from the cabin allday muttered fellow captain he was a trifle hard i thought bolitho grinned i am sure that when he knows you better he will call you by your first name allday faced him guardedly and then chuckled no doubt captain he lowered his voice a message has been sent aboard he held out an engraved card tiny in his broad palm she had written across the back eight oclock please come bolitho stared from it to alldays masklike face who gave you this a servant captain his eyes did not even flicker the lady knows she can trust me bolitho turned away to hide his expression thank you allday watched him hurry up the quarterdeck ladder and grinned it will do him good he saw the marine sentry watching him and snapped who are you gaping at he grinned again my good fellow gift from a lady one hour before the morning watch was relieved bolitho came on deck to enjoy the most peaceful time of the day with his shirt open to his waist he crossed to the weather side and studied the set of each individual sail before going aft to consult the compass madras lay twelve days astern but the wind which had begun so promisingly had lulled to a gentle breeze so that even with all sails set it was unlikely they could maintain more than four knots fowlar was scribbling on the slate beside the wheel but straightened his back as bolitho approached he touched his forehead and reported east by south sir full an bye bolitho nodded and shaded his eyes to watch the sails again the wind such as it was came from the southwest and undines yards were braced well round laying her over to the starboard tack about a mile abeam the brig rosalind had no difficulty in maintaining station on her heavier consort and bolitho found himself tempted to take a telescope and examine her more closely fowlar seemed to think that he was expected to add something to his report and said might pick up before nightfall sir mr mudge seems to think the windll freshen when once we enter the malacca strait er yes bolitho tried to compose himself fromrosalinds deck undine must make a beautiful sight under full canvas but for once this gave him little consolation he wanted to drive his ship faster to become involved with his mission ghosting along like this even if idyllic for poet or artist gave too much time for other thoughts he saw davy hurrying towards him frowning as he said i beg pardon for not seeing you come on deck sir he gestured towards the main mast i was dealing with a complaint from a marine he added swiftly nothing important you are officer of the watch mr davy you should know by now i dont interfere in your affairs merely to excite attention he smiled a fine day is it not yes sir davy followed his gaze over the nettings the sea was very blue and apart from the lowhulled brig there was not a speck of land or another ship to break the emptiness its sense of vastness davy asked casually is it true this sort of mission often leads to permanent appointments in the realm of colonial government sir bolitho nodded rear admiral conways appointment is such he watched davys tanned features gravely he was worried about something it was showing now just like the time when he had selected soames and not him for the raiding party i was thinkingdavy faltered i am of course well content with life as a kings officer it is what i want i am the first in my family to follow the sea my father was a city merchant and had no use for service life he was loath to allow me to enter the navy bolitho wished he would get on with it he said encouragingly mr herrick is like you the first sailor in his family yes davy looked suddenly desperate as soames emerged from the cabin hatch yawning and consulting his pocket watch well it is not exactly what i meant sir bolitho turned and faced him mr davy i would be obliged if you would come to the point in an hour it will be anoven again i would like to take my walk before breakfast and not wait until after dinner tonight davy bit his lip i am sorry sir he nodded firmly yes i will try to explain he lowered his eyes may i speak of your brother sir bolitho tensed my late brother i did not mean to offend davy looked up and allowed the words to come out in a flood i heard somewhere that he quit the navy bolitho waited always it seemed to catch up with him now even his second lieutenant was risking a rebuke to satisfy his own curiosity but he was wrong in davys case davy said quietly it was because of his gambling i was told he looked so strained so pleading that bolitho forgot his own bitterness and asked is that what bothers you gambling yes sir like a fool i tried to win back my losses in london with my father dead i am responsible for my mothers welfare and that of the estate he looked away in time of war i might have gained early promotion and all the prizemoney which went with it you could have just as easily been killed bolitho added gently am i to be told how much you owe twenty sir bolitho stared at him in gods name you could pawn your dresscoat for more man i davy gritted his teeth twenty thousand sir bolitho ran his fingers through his hair undine and the brig yonder would cost about that sum and i thought you had more sense perhaps i should have kept my secret sir davy was shamefaced wretched no it is better shared at least you are safe from your creditors out here he watched davy grimly but twenty thousand it is a small fortune soames clumped past and beckoned to a bosuns mate have the watch piped aft kellock he was careful to keep to the lee side of the deck davy hurried on well aware that soames was waiting to relieve him you see sir i thought that on a voyage such as ours i might gain some new standing i see however this is a mission of protection not of discovery or the capture of spanish gold he nodded to soames and added softly but i will keep it in mind he began to pace the deck while the two lieutenants conversed over the compass undine had gathered all sorts within her slender hull it was not only the lower deck which sported its fortunehunters it seemed he saw midshipman keen walking along the larboard gangway with armitage and prayed he would never be left in davys predicament or in one such as his brother hughs in family background davy and keen were similar both had wealthy parents who had gained promotion in trade rather than in the kings service davys father had died leaving his son and heir totally unprepared for the temptations which he had managed to overcome keen on the other hand had been sent to sea because of his fathers riches and influence hertick had said that keen had confided in him during a night watch in the indian ocean to make a man of me it had seemed to amuse him herrick had said but keens father must be a remarkable man bolitho thought there were not many who would risk a sons life or limb for such a goal he saw noddall scurrying aft along the gun deck with a can of boiling water from the galley conway must be up and about waiting to be shaved it was surprising how little conways presence aboard had interfered with daily life he had explained it himself informal that did not mean he was disinterested quite the reverse whenever a ship had been sighted or the hands had been called to reef or make sail he had been there watching once when becalmed for half a day the seamen had streamed a seine net in the hopes of getting some fresh fish just a few flounders and some flatheaded fish which mudge had knowingly described as foxes were the entire result of their efforts but conway could not have been more pleased if they had caught a whale it was as if he was living out every hour like a prisoner awaiting sentence it was not pleasant to watch bolitho was not quite twentyeight years old but as a postcaptain with two previous commands behind him he had learned to accept if not agree with many of the navys judgements conways experience had come out at dinner one evening in the cabin it was the second day out of madras and bolitho had told noddall to fetch some of his special wine to make it an occasion it was madeira the most expensive he had ever purchased in his life conway hardly seemed to notice had he been offered cider bolitho doubted if he would have remarked on it but he had become very drunk not slowly or by accident or even out of bravado but with the firm determination of one who has been too often alone and wishes to blur the realisation without delay it had all happened two years back in these same waters when the french admiral suffren had captured trincomalee and very nearly toppled britains power in india for good conway had started to tell his story as if bolitho had not been there as if he just wanted to make sure he could still remember it he had been in command of an inshore squadron and employed on the protection of supply ships and military convoys a sloop had brought news of a french squadron off the coast of ceylon and without ado he had set off to engage or cripple the enemy ships until help arrived to complete the victory unbeknown to conway another sloop was already searching for him sent by the commanderinchief with new orders for the defence of trincomalee conway reached the area where the french had been sighted only to find them gone fishermen informed him they had sailed towards the very position he had just left and with an anxiety which bolitho could only imagine he had put his ships about once again he managed to find and bring the french rear to a brief but unsatisfactory action before losing contact in the night when dawn united his small squadron again conway found the supply ships which he had been guarding had been captured or destroyed and when the admirals sloop contacted him she too had fresh news to cancel all previous instructions trincomalee had been taken in the silence of the cabin conways voice had risen suddenly like a dying mans cry another day and ive have brought them to grips not suffren nor any other admiral could have got us out of ceylon then bolitho looked up as the first working parties swarmed aloft for the constant round of repairs splicing and stitching it was all too plain conway could have emerged a hero instead he was seized upon as a scapegoat he must still have influence somewhere he thought a governorship no matter where it was represented reward rather than a continuance of disgrace he halted in his stride his mind suddenly very alert but suppose there was a second more devious reason another scapegoat perhaps he shook his head what would be the point of that bolitho turned as allday walked along the quarterdeck towards him breakfasts ready captain he squinted his eyes towards the brig still with us then he smiled calmly at bolithos steady gaze thats good bolitho watched him and wondered it was the same look he had given when he had brought the gig for him at madras thank you he added coldly and what is amusing you now allday shrugged hard to put a name to it captain its a sort of glow i get inside sometimes he massaged his stomach comforting bolitho strode past him towards the hatch his morning had been badly interrupted as he stepped into the cool shadows between decks he imagined viola raymond just a mile abeam in the brig her husband would be watching her mister pigsliver would be watching both of them it was still hard to know what she really thought about him or if she saw his attraction as some sort of game there had been several visitors staying at the residence soldiers company officials but she had been determined to keep him to herself it had not been anything she had actually said it had been more of an excitement a sense of recklessness a dare which he found impossible to ignore she had no longer stayed at arms length and several times had allowed her hand to linger on his even when raymond had had been close by when he had made to return to the ship she had followed him on to a shaded terrace below the inner wall and had held out a small box for you she had made light of it but he had seen the hot eagerness in her eyes the thrust of her breasts beneath her gown as he had opened the box it was a gold watch while he had turned it over in his hands she had gripped his arm and had whispered i will always remember your face that daybut she had not laughed that time do not refuse my little gift please he had taken her hand and kissed it his mind grappling with what he was doing seeing all the dangers and yet dismissing them it is as well you are sailing in another ship captain she had laughed and then had pulled his hand below her breast see how my heart beats now a week a day even and who can say what might occur bolitho walked past the sentry and into the cabin his mind still hanging on to that moment conway was spreading thick treacle on a biscuit his wispy hair ruffling in the breeze from the stern windows what time is it bolitho time sir conway eyed him wryly before taking a mouthful i observed that you had your er new watch in your hand and assumed that time was of some importance bolitho stared at him the midshipman in front of his captain again then he grinned it was a memory sir that was all conway sniffed that i can well believep it makes a fine sight thomas bolitho lowered the telescope and wiped his forehead with the back of one hand the noon sun was merciless but like most of the men around him or standing high in the shrouds he was momentarily unaware of it fifteen days out of madras and in spite of the winds perversity undine had done well bolitho had made many landfalls in his time but the sight of any shore after the hazards and doubts of navigation never failed to move him and now just visible through the glare of sea and sky he could see a smudge of green across the larboard side and felt a fresh excitement and satisfaction the narrowest part of the malacca strait to starboard hidden even to the masthead lookout was the great scimitarshaped island of sumatra poised as if to squeeze the strait shut and leave them sailing in a wilderness forever herrick said it seems a mite too narrow for comfort sir bolitho smiled at him it is wider than the english channel even here thomas the master assures me it is the safest course to take perhaps herrick shaded his eyes again so that is malacca eh it is hard to believe we have reached this far and in five days or so with gods good grace well anchor in pendang bay he paused seeing the doubt in herricks blue eyes well come on thomas let us see that smile againv yes sir i know it is a good and fast passage and i am well satisfied as you are he fidgeted with his belt buckle but i am more concerned with something else i see bolitho waited knowing what was coming he had seen the worry mounting in herricks face over the past fifteen days having to spend much of his time with the admiral bolitho had had little chance of enjoying herricks company a walk together before dusk a pipe of tobacco and a glass of wine herrick said bluntly everyone knows about it sir its not my place to speak on your behaviour but but that is exactly what you are about to do bolitho smiled gravely it is all right thomas i am not going to snap your head off herrick would not relent it is no joke sir the lady is the wife of an important government official if this sort of tale ever reached england you would be in real danger and thats the truth thank you for your concern he glanced ahead where far beyond the gently spiralling bowsprit he saw rosalind leading the way through the shallows and sandspits as she had no doubt done many times before but it is something i do not wish to discuss even with you if you are to disagree with everything i say yes sir im sorry but herrick added stubbornly i cant stand by and see you in irons because of others sir not without trying at least to help bolitho gripped his arm then we will say no more of the matter thomas agreed aye sir herrick regarded him unhappily if it is the way you want it a seaman left the galley and darted down an open hatch below the forecastle he was carrying a bucket and swab herrick said wearily the surgeon is sick again that man must be going to clean out his quarters bolitho looked at him drunk i suppose it would seem so but there is little to occupy him sir and our people have been remarkably free of illness that is just as well bolitho felt unreasonably angry what in hells name am i to do with him he has a lot on his mind sir so have many others herrick kept his voice even he saw his young brother hanged for a crime of which he was later proved innocent even if he had been guilty it would still have been a terrible thing to watch bolitho swung round from the rail how did you discover this at madras he came aboard drunk i was a mite harsh with him and he started to rave about it it is destroying him thank you for telling me even if it is somewhat late herrick did not flinch you have been rather buoi sir i did not wish to trouble you bolitho sighed i take your point but in future i would like to hear everything most ships surgeons are no more than butchers whitmarsh has been something more but as a drunken sot he is a menace to everyone aboard i am sorry for his brother i for one can appreciate his feelings he looked steadily at herrick we will have to see what we can do to put things right for him whether he likes it or not herrick nodded gravely i agree sir the one afflicted is not always the best judge of his own malady he tried not to grin if you see what i mean sir bolitho slapped his shoulder by god thomas you go too far i am not surprised your father sentyou to sea then he walked up the tilting deck to the weather side and left herrick to supervise his watch so they knew all about it did they he touched the bulge in his breeches pocket what would herrick say if he saw the inscription inside the watchguard he wondered we will wear ship directly mr herrick bolitho strode to the compass and peered over mudges untidy shoulder steer nornoreast herrick touched his hat aye aye sir he was equally formal it was five days since they had discussed viola raymond and the doctors personal problem and in that time bolitho had never felt better the ship had settled down to a regular unhurried routine and even the drills had passed off without complaint at gunnery undines company still had a lot to learn but at least they moved as a team and not a stumbling confused rabble he raised his glass and studied the new shapes and patterns which parted sea from sky mudge had assured him that pendang bay lay some five miles distant but it was difficult to accept that they had all but arrived at their destination over fifteen thousand miles another world a different life hands wear ship man the braces there shoes scraped on the planking and bolitho turned to study conways reaction as he came on deck it was early morning and for a few seconds he thought he was imagining what he saw conway was wearing his rear admirals uniform complete with laced cocked hat and sword the latter he held like a pointer as if unsure of his reception bolitho said good morning sir he saw herrick staring at them his speaking trumpet in midair conway joined him by the rail and raised his head to watch as the great yards creaked round in unison while the straining seamen hauled and panted at the braces well his tone was wary what do you think i think you look right for the occasion sir he saw the quick tightening of conways mouth the lines on either side deepening still further it was moving if pathetic to see conways gratitude for that is what it was it is a bit creased of course i was merely trying it on to see if it required alteration he added sharply if i am to be governor ill land as i intend to continue damn their eyes midshipman armitage was watching the brig as she trimmed her yards to take station off undines lee he remarked nervously thunderstorm sir but bolitho was already snatching a telescope not this time mr armitage he looked at herrick shorten sail if you please and then beat to quarters he saw them all gaping at him like total strangers that thunderstorm is of a kind i have come to respect another flag ship cleared for action sir herrick watched bolithos face anxiously bolitho moved the telescope slowly from bow to bow trying to avoid the overlapping mesh of shrouds and stays as he stared fixedly at the shore because of the glare which filtered through then morning haze it was impossible to fix any proper mark or to take an accuratebearing he replied too long mr herrick i want the time cut to twelve minutes he was speaking merely to give himself another moment to gather his thoughts the distant gunfire had stopped but there had been at least a dozen shots sharp and loud despite the range probably small pieces he swung the glass further to starboard seeing the lowlying wedge of land reaching out to lie parallel with their slow approach the eastern headland of pendang bay there was no room for further doubt something dark intruded into the lens and he saw the brig tilting to the low breeze her yards alive with tiny figures as she finished reefing a huge spanish flag had been hoisted to her peak blinding white in the glare and he found time to wonder how rosalinds master was reacting to puigservers show of national pride almost without intending to speak aloud he said i wish the don was here with us i think combined thought and action may be called for he heard conway grunt unnecessary ours is the ship of war bolitho i want no damned spaniard under my feet today herrick asked quietly what dyou make of it sir bolitho shook his head an attack on the settlement maybe but i understand the place is well defended and conway interrupted harshly all this fuss over a few bloody savages herrick was standing beside mudge and whispered i expect that is what poor captain cook said bolitho turned sharply if youve all nothing better to do than make stupid remarks he swung away and added two good leadsmen in the chains immediately begin sounding to mudge he snapped let her fall off a point the edge in his tone was having the right effect men who seconds earlier had been chatting and gossiping about what might be happening ashore were now silent and alert standing to their guns or grouped at halliards and braces for the next command the wheel creaked the sound very loud in the sudden stillness and the helmsman called noreast by north sir very well bolitho glanced at conways profile the glassy intentness in his eye from forward came the leadsmans cry no bottom sir bolitho looked at mudge but the masters heavy face was expressionless he probably thought it was a waste of time to take soundings the chart and all available information told them the water was deep until the last cable or so or maybe he thought his captain was so nervous that he was afraid to leave anything to chance another single crack echoed out from the mistshrouded coast and died away very gradually bolitho tugged out his new watch and stared at it at this speed it would take near on an hour to close the land but it could not be helped no bottom sir he said pass the word for captain bellairs ill want a full landing party tell mr davy to prepare the boats for lowering once we have anchored he will take charge of them conway said briefly good beach im told the settlement and fort are on a slope to the western side of the bay herrick strode aft and touched his hat shall i order the guns to load sir he sounded guarded not yet mr herrick bolitho trained his glass across the larboard bow settlement fort they could have been imagination the blurred green outline of the land looked totally deserted he heard the marine sergeant bellowing orders the stamp of boots as his men were divided and subdivided in readiness to disembark bellairs was watching them from the starboard gangway his face completely blank but his eyes missing nothing by the mark twenty the leadsman sounded triumphant mudge nodded gloomily about right twenty fathoms hereabouts some small birds darted across the seas face and circled above the braced yards bolitho watched them recalling the swifts flying about the grey stone house in falmouth it would be fine there today sunshine bright colours the hills dotted with sheep and cattle the town itself busy with farmers and sailors each depending on the other as it had always been he saw herrick nearby and said quietly forgive my anger ust now herrick smiled no matter sir you were right we have been caught unawares already on this venture trouble will not fade away merely because we turn our backs on it rosalinds settin er foresl again sir they turned to watch as the brig dipped to the wind and gathered way conway snarled by god the don intends to lead us inshore blast himv it is his right sir bolitho trained his glass on the other vessel seeing the busy figures above and below the great slash of her ensign with its crowned shield bright in the sunlight it is still the territory of the spanish royal company until he says otherwise conway scowled that is mere formality he stared hard at him fire a warning shot captain bolitho looked at herrick pass the word forrard one ball but mind it drops well clear of the brig the leadsman called again deep eighteen bolitho shut his ears to the squeak of gun trucks as the fore most twelvepounder was run out the gun captain was peering along the muzzle and as the light touched him bolitho saw that one hand was a metal hook turpin herrick shouted ready sir as you will then the gun crashed out and seconds later a thin waterspout rose like a feather far beyond the brigs bowsprit bolitho said well atleasttheywill knowwe are coming sir conway snapped savages ill soon get to the bottom of this little matter bolitho sighed as the brig fell off slightly her foresail already being brailed up in response to his rough signal the thought of having a poorly armed brig lying between an enemy and his own artillery was a worry he could not afford and she was aboard rosalind too he turned round sharply angry with himself for allowing his thoughts to drift right now he neededto be completely clear his mind like steel mr mudge dyou know much of this place other than you have already told me the master shrugged very few people ave seen inland sir ead unters warrin tribes there are aplenty im told but the natives are often sailors pirates from the north of borneo seadyaks they calls em many a good ship as been overrun at anchor by them devils he shook his jowls then its snip snip with their long knives an poor jack is no more at that moment a seaman beside a sixpounder pointed aloft as the masthead pendant licked out with renewed energy like a long low curtain the sea mist began to move and shred itself vanishing into the land and laying bare endless stretches of beach thick jungle and finally the overlapping hills beyond herrick lowered his telescope and exclaimed and is that the settlement sir bolitho steadied his own glass not daring to look at conways face what he had first taken to be a heap of lopped and piled trees was shaping itself into long spiked palisades supported and guarded at regular intervals by squat timbered blockhouses as the mist slipped away he saw what must be the governors residence it had to be for it was the largest building in sight again it was built entirely of timber with an upper and lower rampart and one spindly watchtower in its centre above which the spanish flag lifted occasionally in the sea breeze conway said thickly in gods name the words wererung from his throat bolitho watched the distant fort for some sign of life other than the flag the place looked crude but was well sited easy to defend there must be settlements like this all over the world he thought but what about before someone had first to wade ashore from a boat or march through swamp and jungle to plant a flag to claim the land for his own country he had heard of islands in the pacific which were regularly claimed and reclaimed by half a dozen nations sometimes out of the genuine desire to colonise but often merely because their ships paused there for no other reason than to find water and firewood by the mark ten he looked at herrick we will anchor in eight fathoms he saw allday scrambling over the gig on its chocks then boats away as fast as you can he turned his attention to the cruising wavelets which had risen to enjoy the freshening breeze it was a large but wellsheltered bay it was said that the spanish royal company had claimed it years earlier almost by accident they had intended to place their settlement further north to gain access for trade with the philippines but fever losses in ships and resources had found them here instead it was easy to understand why the spaniards had lost heart easier still to realise how much more important it would be to the british within reach of both india and the vast barelytapped resources of the china seas it could be a vital link given time and skilful handling with the french and spaniards gone from the area only the power of the dutch east indiamen offered any sort of competition he glanced quickly at conways stiff features but was he the one to begin it he wondered fighting men rarely saw much further than the strategy and tactics of the moment and one made bitter and desperate by past mistakes would be less inclined to compromise people leaving the palisade sir bolitho raised the glass again twos and threes some carrying muskets others limping down the sand towards the waters edge and a long partlyconstructed pier of rough timber and piles most of them were so darkskinned they could be natives but the uniforms were spanish well enough not one of them waved they merely stood or sat dejectedly watching the frigates careful approach herrick said under his breath god they look like scarecrows what did you expect mr herrick sir unseen and unheard the surgeon had appeared on the quarterdeck his face and neck like raw meat bolitho watched him impassively you are recovered it seems mr whitmarsh the surgeon turned his gaze on him his eyes were redrimmed with strain so that they looked too hot for their sockets he muttered vaguely we have arrived i see sir he reached out for support and finding none almost fell headlong he mumbled pattern never changes first they hand over their power of protection to us with ships and men if needed to give power to that protection when all is safe the traders will come and the companys flag will be supreme bolitho asked coldly and then what whitmarsh regarded him emptily the place will become a colony a possession or if we have cleaned it out like an empty shell we will simply he retched discard it cast it away conway seemed to hear him for the first time get off this deck you drinksodden creature his face was working with despair a need to release his anger or by heaven you will be sorry the surgeon gave an awkward bow but i am sorry believe me sorry for you sir at being given this wretched task he swayed towards bolitho for the good captain who will eventually be made to stand between justice and tyranny and more sorry perhaps he pitched forward in an untidy heap and lay completely still by the mark eight the leadsmans call brought bolitho back to reality he snapped have him taken to his quarters as some seamen seized the inert surgeon and carried him to the ladder he caught the sour odour of vomit and spilled wine the stench of a mans decay conway was still staring at the deck another second and id have had him in irons he glared at bolitho well there was something in what he said sir what is on a sober mans mind is often on a drunkards tongue herrick called close enough i think sir bolitho hurried to the quarterdeck rail glad to be free of conways mood he studied the lie of the smaller headland to larboard the great eastern one on the opposite beam thrusting out to sea and already a delicate green in the early sunlight signal our intention to rosalind and then wear ship if you please he waited until the anchor party had assembled above the cathead then he added tell davy to keep our people together once we are ashore i want no plague raging through undine dyou think there is fever here sir for just a moment there was fear in herricks eyes like most seamen he could accept blood and broadside as well as the harsh discipline which guided his daily life but the unknown the terror of plague which could render a whole ship useless turn her into a floating tomb was entirely different that we will discover directly rosalinds acknowledged sir keen seemed his usual carefree self even armitage was watching the land with something like expectancy wear shipv man the lee braces bolitho saw the helm going over and moved to conwayss side to avoid the rush of seamen across the quarterdeck as the frigate turned slowly into the wind will you wait for don puigserver sir conway looked at him a nerve jumping in his throat as the anchor plunged into the clear water in a mighty cascade of spray i suppose so he peered towards the brig which was already swinging easily to her cable i wish you to accompany me an honour sir you think so conway removed the goldlaced hat and ran his palm over his grey hair he smiled bitterly we shall see noddall came on deck with bolithos sword but quailed as aliday rasped here give me that he hurried to bolithos side and carefully buckled the scabbard into place muttering the very idea then he straightened his back and stared at the boats which were being swayed up and over the nettings a long way weve come together captain he turned to watch the brigs boats being lowered into the water its not a happy place im thinking bolitho did not hear him he watched the marines clambering out and down into the swaying boats their coats very red their boots slipping and clattering as they always did captain bellairs was studying each and every one of them especially the young corporal who carried the sheathed union flag which would soon be planted on foreign soil like many sea officers bolitho had often thought about such moments but the mental picture had always been grander and vaster endless lines of men bands playing cheering people and the anchored ships looking splendid and secure at the seas edge now he understood differently it was only a beginning small but no less impressive because of that conway said well we had best begin i see the don is already on his way the brigs boats were indeed moving inshore one bearing the spanish flag the others that of the company bolitho was thankful viola raymond was remaining aboard the rosalind conway followed him into the gig and with the armed and crowded boats fanning out on either beam they started towards the nearest beach bolitho could smell the jungle long before they were within hail of the people by the frothing surf like incense heady and overpowering he gripped his swordhilt tighter and tried to compose himself it was a moment he must always try to remember he glanced quickly at conway for some sign or reaction he looked remote and sadly stern the new governor of teluk pendang had arrived lieutenant thomas herrick walked a few paces across the quarterdeck his movements restless as he watched bellairs marines and some seamen below the nearest palisade it was ast noon with the sun blazing down on the anchored ships with savage intensity most of the unemployed hands were sheltering by the guns beneath the gangways but herrick felt unable to leave the deck even though his head was swimming his shirt plastered against his body like a wet rag tugging at her cable the undine had swung her stern towards the long pale beach and with the visibility sharp and clear it was easier to see the extent of conways new command larger than he had first imagined it had obviously been planned and constructed by a military engineer even the unfinished timber pier looked neat and strong but like the rest of the place was in a state of bad neglect as he had paced the quarterdeck or peered across the taffrail herrick had seen bolitho and some of the landing party moving along the wooden ramparts or exploring the ground between the two separate palisades which guarded the approaches to the fort and its surrounding buildings the boats lay like dead fish on the beach exactly where they had ground ashore some four hours earlier he had watched some marines hauling the swivel guns towards the fort others harried by the massive sergeant coaker had manned the ramparts or could now be seen patrolling near the pier the handful of spanish soldiers had withdrawn into the fort and of the enemy or whatever the garrison had been firing at there was not a sign he turned as a heavy step fell on the tinderdry planking and saw soames shading his eyes with one hand and munching a biscuit with the other any sign yet sir soames eyed the distant settlement without enthusiasm what a place to end your years eh herrick was worried something should have happened by now there were supposed to be some three hundred spanish soldiers and followers in the settlement and god alone knew how many local natives from what he had seen there were hardly any the same old thought crossed his mind plague perhaps or something even more terrible he replied they appear to be examining the inner defences i am not surprised the dons wish to be rid of it he shuddered from here it looks as if the damned jungle is pushing the whole lot back into the sea soames shrugged and pointed his halfeaten biscuit at the gun deck shall i dismiss the gun crews there seems to be little here to excite action no there are only five of them manned change em round and send the others below for a spell he was glad when soames walked away he needed to concentrate to decide what to do if he was suddenly required to act without bolitho at his elbow it had been different the last time a sort of wild recklessness had come over him prompted as ever by the need to dash to bolithos aid in the only way he knew but here were no yelling savages no darting canoes which a few bursts of canister could scatter silence and depressing immobility midshipman penn called in his shrill voice one of the boats is being launched sir herrick felt his heart lift as the distant figure thrust undines greenpainted gig into the shallows he saw bolithos tall figure striding down the beach pausing to say something to davy before swinging his legs over the gunwale at last soon they would know what was happening only four hours but to herrick it felt an age muster the side party stand by to receive the captain bolitho looked strained and thoughtful as he climbed up through the entry port his coat covered with sandy dust his face damp with sweat he glanced at the motionless side party but did not seem to see them he said have the surgeon and his mates sent ashore to report to mr davy when the other boats arrive i want powder and shot food and fresh fruit sent over too he peered towards the anchored brig and at another boat which was pulling quickly towards her i have sent word for rosalind to assist in every way she can he looked at herricks round face and smiled for the first time easy thomas it is not the end though it was nearly so come to my cabin when you have dealt with my orders allday has a list of things required when herrick finally joined bolitho in the stern cabin he found him stripped to the waist and drinking a large tankard of lemon juice sit down thomas herrick sat aware that although bolitho sounded controlled and level there was something else something familiar which told him his mind was busy along another tack when the war ended there was a garrison of about three hundred here it was as if he was drawing a picture just as it had been painted for him the commandant the king ofspains trusted controller was colonel don jose pastor a dedicated soldier to all accounts and one well used to building such settlements he gained some trust from the natives and by barter and other inducements as well as the usual spanish use of force he was able to create a strong defence line as well as clear much of the surrounding land there is even a road of sorts although that now is overgrown a wilderness herrick ventured fever that of course but no more than you might expect in such a place he studied herrick for several seconds his eyes very grey in the reflected light the settlement has been under almost constant attack for over a year at first they thought it was only the work of marauding tribesmen dyak pirates maybe who were becoming worried by the spread of spanish influence in their midst colonel pastor had set up a catholic mission above the settlement the monks were found terribly mutilated and headless he did not see herricks expression of horror then others died when the freshwater pools were poisoned the garrison had to fall back upon its own little stream within the walls but for it the fight would have ended long ago think of it thomas if you had been an officer here trying to hold up morale fighting an unseen enemy while day by day your strength is dwindling each dawn you would be watching the horizon praying for a ship any vessel which could bring relief only one came in the whole of that time but would not land its people for fear of the plague she merely dropped despatches and left god knows i can understand that they are like living skeletons over yonder he looked round as a boat pulled clear of the hull let us hope our surgeon will find others to help and think less of himself herrick asked quietly what will admiral conway do sir bolitho closed his eyes remembering the small gathering in the room at the top of the wooden fort hearing puigservers emotional voice as he had translated the report of the settlements one remaining officer captain vega the attacks had gone on and on and when once an armed picket had been ambushed the forts defenders had nearly been driven mad by the screams and pitiful cries as their comrades had been tortured to death within sight of the walls bolitho said to the west of us is a small cluster of islands the benua group herrick nodded unable to understand yes we passed them a day back they lie astride the strait between borneo and the islands of sumatra and java his tone hardened this selfstyled prince muljadi has his stronghold there the dutch built a fortress in one of the isles many years ago but abandoned it when disease killed most of the garrison he looked through the stern windows his eyes grave not like conways new domain thomas it is built of stone herrick attempted to shift bolitho from his mood of passive despair but a few ships and men would soon destroy this damned muljadi surely once perhaps bolitho drained the glass and stared at it this morning there was a final attempt to overthrow the defences here i expect the attacker saw undine pass through the strait yesterday and knew they must make haste now they are gone into the jungle captain vega of the garrison says they will head west to the marsh district where they will be taken by sea to muljadis stronghold he gave a great sigh of all the men at the settlement there are but fifty survivors poisoned darts musket balls for they have our weapons too and fever have wrought a terrible price from them there was even a mutiny when vegas men fought with their own native soldiers most of them too crazed with drink and despair to know what they were about herrick stared at him what of colonel pastor sir is he also killed bolitho sat down and massaged the white scar above his ribs i am coming to that part weeks back a ship did finally arrive not to bring help or to offer relief to people from their own part of the world she was the argus thomas he swung round the weariness falling away like a cloak of fortyfour guns under the hand of capitaine le chaumareys he landed himself and met with colonel don pastor he brought a message from muljadi personally he gripped the desk with both hands and required him to lower the flag to relinquish all claims on the settlement in the name of spain my god indeed apparently the colonel told of help which would soon arrive but le chaumareys laughed at him said there would be no relief no ships coming to his aid then the french do have a hand in this sir a big one his face lit up cannot you see it thomas le chaumareys was instructed to force the spanish to surrender their rights here he knew better than most that nervion or undine or both would be delayed by any means available with the settlement handed over to muljadi and a written agreement from pastor who after all is his kings representative here there would be nothing we or anyone else could do i have no doubt le chaumareys had further orders to recognise muljadis rule in the name of france and to offer him whatever he needed to control his alliance he looked towards the beach at the seamen who were unloading two of the boats but we did come thomas too late for colonel pastor for he left in the argus to parley for his men with muljadi i pity him even if i admire his courage herrick nodded slowly his eyes clouded and when he had gone the last attack began no governor few defenders dead men have little to say herrick thought of their slow approach that morning the mist on the water distorting the sounds of cannon fire no wonder the remaining ragged defenders had not been able to wave or greet them undine must have seemed like a miracle bolitho said don puigserver is our one real card he can act in the name of spain and assure conway of his countrys confidence how did he react to the news bolitho thought of the spaniards face as he had listened to vega anguish shame and then fury he had seen it all only conways attitude still remained in shadow he had said little and not even argued with raymond when he had started off on what parliament would or would not support only one thing was certain the affair had to be contained no buildup of additional force no acceptance that there had been a change in rulership here or anywhere else as raymond had explained more than once the dutch were too busy recouping their losses caused by the war to want another conflict in their midst if france thrust more naval might into the area then spain too might change her views about her untried allegiance with britain it could be war all over again only when bolitho had made to leave for his ship had the rear admiral drawn him into a corner he had said very calmly politics a need for furthering trade or colonial power all are attitudes only one thing is properly clear to me as it must be to you bolitho he had held his gaze searching for a reaction before adding every puzzle must have a key this one has two undine and argus governments may try to use more power later on but by then it will be too late for us all if undine is lost so are we be sure that le chaumareys is already well aware of it when bolitho had made to question him further he had said he is a good officer make no mistake our squadrons had cause to damn his eyes in the war france has loaned muljadi their best as i hope england has aided me in the same manner much of his thoughts bolitho had spoken aloud for herrick exclaimed but it is not war sir no frenchman will cross swords for fear of starting one bolitho watched him and was glad he was here le chaumareys will have a letter of marque he is far from a fool when he runs out those fortyfour guns it will be muljadis flag at his peak not the fleur de lys of france he stood up and moved vaguely about the cabin but behind each breech will be an experienced crew the cream of his navy while wehe half turned his face suddenly drained again but that is enough battles are not won or lost on daydreams herrick nodded and what will we do now sir bolitho tugged the shirt over his head the same stained one as before we will weigh when the tide is right if iiuljadi has vessels in the area we must close with them show him we mean to continue what we have begun he pulled herrick towards the stern windows as a bugle wailed sadly across the glittering water above the fort there was conways new flag the little group of marines beneath it glowing like tiny red insects see thomas there is no drawing back not for conway not for any of us herrick watched the little tableau doubtfully better to await the bedford surely with troops and more cannon we would stand a better chance that is what le chaumareys will be thinking he smiled his face suddenly very young at least i hope that is so herrick groped for his hat glad of something to occupy his mind and to hold back the apprehension bolithos news had brought will we leave bellairs and his marines half of them there is much to be done with corpses lying unburied the place is a dunghill the defences are stout but in need of good men to patrol them rosalind will remain also under the protection of the battery such as it is i think her master is eager to get clear of this place but conway is more than a match for him herrick moved towards the door it is not what i was expecting sir nor i but like it or not we have a duty if muljadi and his threat is to be overcome then he must be seen as a common pirate he ran his hands along the desk top argots or no herrick hurried out his thoughts tugging in several directions at once he found iviudge in the wardroom staring gloomily at a plate of salt beef the master asked are we off again mr errick herrick smiled fact soon grew from rumour in a small ship yes the argus is busy here it seems as a privateer and not openly in the name of france mudge yawned unimpressed nothin new we used to do the same for the company in india a few ready muzzles always seemed to impress a doubtin rajah if a little strength was called for herrick looked at him and sighed so the frogs will back an armed uprising and we will support the protection of trade but what of the people in between mr mudge the master pushed his plate away with disgust never asked em was all he said luck of the game bolitho studied the masthead pendant and then walked aft to the compass northwest by west it was midafternoon and despite the skys unclouded relentless glare there was sufficient wind to make it easier to endure undine had been made to lie at anchor in pendang bay almost until dusk the previous day the set of the coastal currents and the winds determination to remain from the southwest making a night passage too dangerous even to attempt but in the last moments the wind had backed considerably and with her sleek hull tilting to its pressure undine had beaten out of the bay losing the settlement and its grim memories in purple shadow but if the wind had remained fresh it was still necessary to hold the ship closehauled the yards braced round to keep each sail drawing and steer undine clear of the land should the wind veer without warning and she lay too close to that undulating pattern of green coast undine could easily find herself hard upon a lee shore and in real danger herrick asked how much longer will we continue sir bolitho did not reply immediately he was watching the tiny triangular sails of undines cutter as it tacked daintily around a small clump of rocky islets then he shifted his gaze to the maintop where midshipman keen sat with one bare leg dangling over the barricade a telescope trained on the distant boat davy had the cutter and would signal the moment he sighted anything there was no sense in taking the ship too close when good visibility remained he said we are off the southwestern cape or as near as i can calculate there are marshes and swamps aplenty accord ing to mr mudge and fowlar if captain vegas information is correct the muljadis vessels may be close by he turned his face into the wind feeling the sweat drying on his forehead and neck the benua islands are about a hundred miles to the westrd of us a goodly piece of open water if we get the chance to run these pirates down herrick watched him doubtfully but was comforted by bolithos apparent optimism what do we know of muljadi sir bolitho walked up the slanting deck to thee weather rail and tugged the sticky shirt clear of his ribs little or nothing originally he came from somewhere in north africa morocco or the barbary coast jtt is said he was taken as a slave by the dons and chained in one of their galleys he escaped and was recaptured herrick whistled quietly i imagine the dons were hard with him bolitho thought suddenly of the elderly colonel pastor and his impossible mission the dons lopped off a hand and an ear and left him marooned on some desolate beach herrick shook his head yet somehow he reached the indies and can now strike fear into his old masters bolitho regarded him impassively or whoever stands between him and his final goal whatever that may be they both stared up as keen yelled deck there cutters signalled sir mr davy points to the northrd bolitho snatched a glass of course i should have realised he trained it on the cutter and then beyond to the gently sloping cape tiny islets crumbling ridges and rocks and everywhere the unbroken backcloth of green any small vessel could work her way through there as davys cutter was now doing herrick slammed his fists together got em by god bolitho said crisply we will remain on this tack for the present hoist the recall signal for mr davy and then beat to quarters he smiled if only to ease the mounting excitement in ten minutes maybe herrick waited until keen had shinned down a backstay to rejoin his signal party and then yelled beat to quarters clear for action a solitary drummerboy did the best he could his sticks blurring in doubletime as the tattoo brought the hands tumbling from hatchways and gratings that might frighten em off sir mudge was by his helmsmen his jowl working on some meat or a quid of tobacco there was little to choose between them bolitho often thought i believe otherwise bolitho watched the barebacked seamen dashing to their guns casting off the lashings and groping for the tools of their trade a reduced detachment of marines under the command of a solitary corporal was parading across the quarterdeck while a handful more clambered aloft to the foretop and its swivel gun the cutter had already turned bowson her sails lowered and thrusting through the inshore swell under oars alone they will not have met with many frigates im thinking their leader will try to reach open sea and outreach us rather than face a blockade or the risk of our landing marines at his back he touched mudges arm impetuously hell not know how unused we are to such affairs eh mudge pouted i only ope that bugger muljadi is ere too e needs to be taught a lesson an double quick in my reckonin deck there the lookout at the masthead waited until the scamper on the gun deck stopped sail on th lee bowl by heaven so there is midshipman keen gripped a seamans arm and added excitedly schooner by the cut of her the seaman pigtailed and with ten years in the navy glanced at him and grinned by god i envy you young gennlemen your learnin sir but his sarcasm was lost in the excitement of the moment herrick held up his hand as the last gun captain faced aft towards him from the break below the quarterdeck a bosuns mate shouted all cleared aft sir herrick swung round and saw bolitho examining his new watch cleared for action sir twelve minutes exactly bolitho glanced up at the masthead but for the lookouts hail i believe you may have done it in less he let the mock formality drop well done mr herrick and pass the word to all hands he walked back down the angled deck and trained his glass across the nettings two raked masts with big dark sails like wings they appeared motionless the hull still hidden beyond one more probing spit of land it was an illusion she was edging around the last dangerous point after that she would be up and away but it would take her a good while yet he swung round where is that damned cutter mowll the masteratarms and easily the most unpopular man aboard called comin up fast sir well signal mr davy to make haste ill have to leave him astern otherwise deck there tis another sail on th lee bow herrick watched in silence until he had discovered the second pair of sails in his glass another schooner probably company ships taken by these pirates no doubt bolitho turned to watch the cutter swinging round to drive beneath the main chains with a shuddering thud curses and clattering oars all were finally quenched by davys angry voice and the more patient tones of shellabeer the boatswain who was studying the whole manoeuvre from the gangway with obvious disgust allday had been standing behind bolitho and whispered should have had young mr armitage in charge captain hed have driven right through into the spirit store cutter an all bolitho smiled and allowed allday to buckle on his sword he had not seen his coxswain since breakfast just after dawn yet the moment of danger a hint of action and he was here without fuss and hardly a word to betray his presence maybe he saw midshipman armitage with soames below the foremast checking a list of gun crews which soames had reallotted on passage from india he found a moment to wonder what armitages mother would think if she saw her adored boy now leaner and well tanned his hair too long and his shirt in need of a good wash she would probably burst into tears all over again but in one way he had not changed he was still as clumsy and as lacking in confidence as his first day aboard little penn on the other hand who was strutting importantly beside the starboard battery of twelvepounders and waiting to assist lieutenant davy had no such handicap if anything he was prone to attempt tasks which were several spans of experience beyond his twelve years davy came struggling aft ducking beneath a swinging shadow as the cutter was hoisted inboard and on to its chocks above the gun deck he was soaked in spray but very pleased with himself bolitho said that was well done by making a quick sightingreport you have given us an edge on those two vessels davy beamed some prizemoney perhaps sir bolitho hid a smile we will see herrick waited for davy to join his gun crews and then said just the two schooners nothing else in sight he rubbed his hands noisily bolitho lowered the telescope and nodded very well mr herrick you may load and run out now he glanced at the masthead pendant for the hundredth time we will make more sail directly and show these pirates what they are against both schooners are keeping well inshore sir herrick lowered his telescope and turned to watch bolithos reactions with that rig they can sail really close to the wind bolitho walked to the compass the picture of the two other vessels sharp in his mind for over half an hour they had worked slowly and methodically between a small crop of islets and were now following the coastline towards a sloping spur of headland around that there was yet another bay with more jutting spits of land but the schooners would choose their moment most carefully go about and dash for the open sea separate perhaps and so lessen undines chances of conquest they were both wellhandled vessels and through his glass he had seen an assortment of small cannon and swivels and an equally varied selection of men mudge watched him gloomily winds backed apiece sir might old bolitho turned and stared along his ship weighing the risks and the gains the green headland was reaching down towards undines starboard bow or so it appeared in fact it was still some three miles distant the two schooners black against the lively wave crests seemed to overlap into one ungainly craft their great sails etched across the land he said firmly get the tgallants on her and alter course two points to starboard herrick stared at him itll be close sir if the wind veers well be hard put to beat off the shore when bolitho did not reply he sighed and lifted his speaking trumpet man the braces from further aft the helmsmen spun their spokes the senior one squinting at the flapping canvas and at the tilting compass bowl until even mudge was satisfied notwest by north sir very well bolitho studied the headland again a trap for the two schooners or a last resting place for undine as herrick seemed to think herrick was watching the topmen waiting until the topgallant sails were freed and then brought under control like bulging steel breastplates undine was moving swiftly now for with the wind sweeping tightly across her larboard quarter and with topsails and topgallants braced to best advantage there was little doubt the range was falling away mudge asked worriedly dyou think theyll try to go about sir perhaps bolitho shivered as a curtain of spray lifted and burst across the weather rail soaking him to the skin adding to his rising excitement theyll try and weather the headland as close as they dare and use the next bay to change tack or if one or both loses his head well rake em as he goes about on this side of the headland he peered at the gun deck at the figures beside each twelvepounder one good broadside would be more than enough for any schooner the second might strike without risking a similar fate he shut it from his mind the fight was not even begun yet he pictured conway back there in his remote kingdom he would know better than puigserver or raymond what was at stake with any luck undine might settle conways security long enough for him to demonstrate what he could do a faint crack echoed across the water and a white feather of spray showed itself for just a few seconds well away from the starboard bow it brought a chorus of jeers from the waiting gun crews run up the colours mr keen bolitho saw the handful of marines in the foretop adjusting their swivel gun some more were already cradling their long muskets along the hammock nettings their faces stiff with concentration one of ems making a run for it sir bolitho caught his breath as the sternmost schooner tilted at a steep angle her great mainsail sweeping above her deck like a huge wing while she altered course hard to larboard somebody yelled by jesus shes in irons look at th bugger the schooners captain had mistimed it very badly for as his command pounded round to cross the winds eye and find searoom elsewhere the sails flapped and rippled in hopeless confusion bolitho shouted well take him first stand by the larboard battery he saw soames hurrying down his line of guns the captains crouching like athletes behind each breech trigger lines taut as they peered through the open ports for a first sight of the target bolitho straddled his legs and tried to hold his telescope on the nearest vessel she was falling awkwardly downwind her narrow deck clearly visible as her crew fought to bring her back under control undine was overhauling her so rapidly that she was already lying some two cables from the larboard bow and seemed to swell in size even as he watched he saw the strange flag at her peak black with a red emblem in its centre a prancing beast of some sort he closed the glass with a snap and saw keen flinch at the sound allday grinned two minutes captain just right he nodded towards the opposite bow where the other schooner was holding steadily on course towards the headland he seems content to let his mates go under soames was peering aft his curved hanger glittering in the bright sunlight as he raised it slowly above his head the glare was making him grimace so badly that he appeared to be grinning like a madman bolitho looked at mudge let her fall off another point he forced a smile not a moment longer than necessary i promise he pulled out his sword and held it casually across his shoulder through his crumpled shirt it felt like ice the helmsman yelled hoarsely nor norwest it is sir there was no time to perfect the set of the yards no time for anything now as with barely a stagger undine turned even further towards the shore the movement dragging the labouring schooner into the view of the eager gun captains bolitho shouted as you bear mr soames soames bellowed stand by he came loping aft pausing at each gun to peer along its muzzle satisfied he jumped aside and yelled fire bolitho tensed as the uneven broadside belched and shuddered along his ships side soames had done well to an extra puff of wind which had pushed the frigate over to leeward he had judged it perfectly taking the enemy ship on the uproll raking her savagely from end to end bolitho grasped a stay his eyes blinded with smoke as the wind funnelled it back through every port men were coughing and swearing in the thick brown fog but urged on by shouts and threats they were still managing to sponge out and reload for another broadside when needed he stared with amazement at the schooner as the smoke cleared away from the quarterdeck dismasted almost buried under a chaos of fallen spars and ripped canvas she seemed a total wreck bring her back to norwest by north mr mudge he did not see the masters face his look of relief and admiration his ears were still ringing to the thunder of cannon fire the sharper probing cracks of the quarterdeck sixpounders he hoped the less experienced men had found time to tie their scarves over their ears caught at the wrong angle it only took one shot to deafen a man often permanently run out soames was peering at his crews as gun captain after captain raised a powderblackened fist to show his weapon was loaded herrick shouted now for tother one he waved to davy at the starboard battery the gesture impulsive unnoticed by himself davy waved back his movement jerky like a puppet as they swept after the second schooner midshipman penn moved slightly to place his lieutenant between him and any possible damage herrick laughed aloud by god young penn has the right idea sir he peered up at the streaming pendant the wind is still kind and this is putting new heart into our people bolitho watched him gravely later they would talk about it but when it was happening to you to those around you it was pointless to discuss anything you never really knew the man in action pride anger insanity it was there and more even on herricks homely face his own too no doubt he said we will run him as close as we can to the headland after that it will be up to him strike or fight he moved the swordblade on his shoulder the ice was gone now it was like a heated gunbarrel mudge remarked that master is a fool e should ave gone about sooner i would ave done so crossed undines bows afore we could blast im he sighed ell not get a second chance im tninkin bolitho looked at him mudge was right of course undine was playing a dangerous game to drive so bravely towards a lee shore but the schooners had taken even more of a chance herrick was saying prize crew on one and take the other in tow eh sir we should get good recompense for two schooners even if one of em is little more than a hulk bolitho watched the schooner without answering was muljadi aboard her or in the other one dying or already dead with some of his men better so he thought than fall into puigservers hands deck there the cry was almost lost above the chorus of spray and booming canvas ship on the larboard quarter bolitho swung round imagining for a moment that the lookout had been too long in the sun for an instant he could see nothing and then as his vision cleared he saw the forecourse and topsail of another ship standing around the last headland the one they had rounded so carefully in pursuit of the schooners herrick gasped what is she he stared at bolitho the argus bolitho nodded grimly i fear so mr herrick he tried to keep his tone level when his whole being was screaming at him to act to do the impossible and how easy he had made it for them he had allowed the schooners to draw him like a fox after two rabbits argus must have been following them along the coast waiting for the trap to be sprung reading bolithos mind without even being able to see him herrick exclaimed then by god well tell mr frenchman to sheer off this is none of his affair keen called shes overhauling us sir bolitho looked past him the argus was already beating well out on their larboard quarter taking the windgage doing exactly what he had attempted to do to the schooners now undine was in the trap run aground or try and claw to windward he saw the sunlight flashing down the big frigates exposed side the small moving shadows above the creaming water as she ran out her whole broadside he thought of the man behind those guns how did he feel at this moment herrick said quietly eighteenpounders im told sir he watched his face as if hoping for a denial of arguss strength yes he drew in a long breath as a flag broke from the frenchmans peak black and red like the ones which had flown above the schooners letter of marque hired by a foreign power the flag merely to keep up a pretenceof legality keen lowered his telescope and said quickly shes almost up to the dismasted schooner sir he was managing to sound calm but his hands were shaking badly there are some men in the water i think they were thrown outboard when the masts came down bolitho took the glass and watched his mind cold as he saw the frigate ride through and over the men in the water the captain had probably not even seen them all he saw was undine he raised his voice hoping the others would not despair at its strangeness we will alter course directly he ignored the unspoken protest on mudges heavy face get the tgallants off her mr herrick the frenchman will expect us to do so if we are about to fight he looked at mudge again without so much canvas we may be able to gain a little room to give an account of ourselves mudge replied harshly itll mean crossin er bows sir even if we gets round without avin the sticks torn out of us what then the argus will overreach us and put a full broadside through our stern as she passes bolitho regarded him bleakly i am relying on his desire to retain the windgage for without it he might change places with us he saw no agreement in mudges tiny eyes or would you have me haul down our colours eh mudge flushed angrily that aint fair sir bolitho nodded neither is a battle mudge looked away ill do me best sir lay er as close to th wind as shes ever bin he tapped the compass bowl if th wind olds we should be able to steer almost due west he strode to the wheel god elp me bolitho turned and saw the topmen sliding down to the deck again felt the more sluggish motion as undine plunged ahead on topsails and forecourse a glance at the other ship told him that her captain was doing likewise he had no need to worry undine would have to stand and fight there was no room left to run away he walked slowly back and forth stepping unseeingly over the sixpounder tackles his knee brushing against a crouching seaman as he passed arguss captain would be watching his every move the advantage if there was one would last only seconds a few minutes at best he looked at the headland it seemed very close now extending far out beyond the larboard bow like a great arm waiting to snatch them whole then he strode to the quarterdeck rail and called mr soames will want a broadside as we put about you have small chance of hitting him but the sudden challenge may have an effect he let his gaze move slowly along the upturned faces you will have to reload and run out quicker than ever before the argus is a powerful ship and will endeavour to use her heavier iron to full advantage we must get to close quarters he felt the grin frozen to his lips like a clamp show him that our lads are better no matter what damn flag he wears a few raised a cheer but it was not much of a rally herrick said quietly ready when you are sir it seemed very quiet bolitho looked aloft yet again the pendant flicked out as before if the wind backed further it would be some small help if it veered it would be disaster then he looked at soames as he clumped heavily aft and disappeared below the quarterdeck to supervise the sternmost twelvepounders which would bear first once they had altered course davy was by the foremast sending some of his own gun crews across to assist the larboard battery if arguss eighteenpounders got to grips they would need plenty of replacements he thought grimly he faced herrick and smiled well thomas herrick shrugged i tell you what i think when its over and done with sir bolitho nodded it was an unnerving feeling it always was of course and yet you imagined that each time was worse than the one before in an hour in minutes he could be dead thomas herrick his friend might be fighting a battle not of his choosing or screaming out his life on the orlop deck and mudge handpicked because of his vast store of knowledge but for this commission he would have been discharged now living with his children and his grandchildren too in all probability he snapped so be it then put the helm down man the braces lively there shuddering and groaning in protest undine slewed round to the thunder of wind and wildly flapping canvas bolitho saw spray bursting through the open ports as she swayed further and further to the violent change of tack from the corner of his eye he saw the arguss topsails lifting above the hammock nettings her shape shortening as undine swung round across her bows a gun banged out and the ball whimpered some where overhead someone must have fired too soon or perhaps the french captain had already guessed what they were trying to do soames was ready and waiting and the first crash of gunfire shook the deck violently the smoke swirling up and over the nettings in a writhing pall gun by gun down the side from stern to bow the sixpounders joining in as the argus crossed each black muzzle bolitho saw her foresail jerk and throb to the onslaught holes appearing like magic as soamess gun crews fired reloaded and fired again when he peered forward bolitho saw that the headland had eased back to starboard the schooner already tiny as she scuttled around it and into the next bay mudge yelled west by north sir full an bye he was mopping his eyes with his handkerchief clinging to the mizzen mast pike rack to hold himself upright he gestured towards the gaff where the red ensign streamed almost abeam close as we can get sir bolitho winced as the sixpounders barked out again and saw the nearest one bounding inboard until caught and held by its tackle its crew was already sponging out and groping for fresh charges and another ball from the shot garland eyes white and staring through the grime voices lost in the crash and roar of cannon fire the squeal of trucks as like angry hogs the heavy guns were run out towards the enemy the argus had at last followed bolithos lead she was swinging round her yards braced almost fore and aft to hold the wind and keep undine under her lee even as he watched bolitho saw the long orange tongues flashing from her ports the bombardment unhurried and carefully aimed as gun by gun she fired through the swirling curtain of smoke and spray a ball screamed above the quarterdeck and slapped through the maintopsail before dropping far abeam others were hitting the hull above or below the waterline bolitho had no idea he heard someone screaming through the choking smoke saw men dashing hither and thither like prisoners in hell as they rammed home the new charges and threw their shining blackened bodies to the tackles again and again above the din he heard soamess deep voice rallying and cursing as he kept his men at their guns a swivel banged out from the top and he imagined the marines were firing more to ease their own fears than with much hope of hitting anything a quarterdeck gun port seemed to explode in a great burst of flame and bolitho saw men and pieces of men hurled in all directions at once as a ball tore splinters from the bulwark and transformed them into hideous darts one marine ran sobbing from the nettings his hands clawing at what remained of his face others stood or knelt by their fallen companions firing reloading firing reloading until it seemed life itself had stopped a downdraught of wind swirled the smoke away and bolitho saw the other frigates yards and punctured sails barely fifty yards abeam he saw the filtered sunlight touching pikes and cutlasses as the enemy prepared to board or to fight off their attempt to do likewise he gasped as another line of bright tongues darted through the smoke felt the planks buck under his feet the crash and clatter of a gun being overturned or smashed to fragments when he peered upwards he saw that the maintopsail was little better than a rag but every spar was still intact a wounded seaman clung to the mainyard his blood running down one leg unheeded to the deck far below another seaman managed to reach him and drag him to safety and together they crouched below the maintop caught in the severed ratlines like two broken birds herrick was yelling hes trying to cripple us sir take us as a prize bolitho nodded and stopped to drag an injured man clear of a sixpounder he had already guessed arguss intentions another ship for muljadis use or perhaps to replace argus so that she could return to france the thought seemed to drive into his heart like a knife well put the helm hard down swing the bows right into him he did not recognise his own voice tell davy to get ready to grapple he seized herricks arm we must grapple hell pound us to splinters at this rate he felt the blast of a ball past his head heard it strike the opposite bulwark and send a mass of wood splinters scything across the deck like arrows herrick was yelling to mudge and the men at the braces and through the smoke bolitho saw arguss shadowy outline loom above the forecastle the sudden movement of figures in her bows as the two ships drove together above the din of gunfire and shouting he heard the sails jerking and banging the wind lost to them the ship already falling sluggishly abeam herrick staggered in some blood and gasped no use cant grapple bolitho stared past him the enemy was already edging ahead and across undines larboard bow a few guns firing as she went holding the wind and changing course very slightly while undine floundered helplessly her remaining sails almost aback she was going to rake undine with every available gun but give bolitho time to haul down his colours before she reached his stern and finished what she had begun he felt herrick tugging his arm what now herrick pointed up through the smoke where the sunlight was making a small path through the drifting smoke the lookout sir hes reported a sail to the westrd his eyes were shining with hope the frenchmans making off bolitho looked at him dully it was true and he had heard nothing deafened by gunfire or fogged in his own despair he did not know but the argus was already spreading her mainsail and was driving downwind with gathering power towards the open strait bolitho said hands to the braces mr herrick lay her on the larboard tack again if we can signal this newcomer we may still be able to give chase he heard a small cry and when he turned he saw two seamen kneeling beside keens body the midshipman was trying to reach down to his stomach but one of the seamen was gripping his wrists while the other slit open his bloodstained breeches with a dirk and threw them aside a few inches above the groin there was something like a broken bone but bolitho knew it was far worse a wood splinter blasted from the deck and probably held tight by its own barbs he knelt down and touched it with his fingers seeing the blood pulsing across the youths thigh hearing his sobs as he tried not to scream bolitho thought of whitmarsh far away in pendang bay helping to heal the sick and wounded from the garrison one of the seamen said ell not last sir without elp ill fetch a surgeons mate allday was kneeling beside him and said no ill do it bolitho looked at him seeing the determination on his face then he turned and said easy mr keen youll be about again soon he felt the rising anger and despair pricking his eyes what had he brought them all to he touched the midshipmans bare shoulder it was smooth like a womans he had not even begun to live yet he snapped are you sure allday the coxswain eyed him calmly im as good as those other butchers davy came hurrying aft and touched his hat masthead has reported the other ship to be the bedford sir the frenchman must have thought her to be a manofwar he looked at keens wound and said hoarsely my god bolitho stood up slowly watching the midshipmans fingers opening and closing like trapped animals in the seamans strong grip very well allday take him aft to the cabin ill be down myself as soon as ive attended to things here allday looked at him dont you fret captain its the luck of the game our turn will come he nodded to the two seamen pick him up keen gave a sharp cry as they moved him to the cabin hatch and before he vanished below bolitho saw that his eyes were fixed unwinkingly on the sky above the tattered sails trying to hold on to it so that by keeping the picture in his mind he might retain his life itself bolitho bent and picked up the midshipmans dirk from the stained deck he handed it to davy and said we will make contact with the bedford there is nothing more we can do for the present but return to the settlement herrick said the old bedford he sounded bitter a bloody storeship from madras full of seasick soldiers and their womenfolk bolitho watched the helmsman bringing undine carefully back on course the skilful way they were allowing for the punctured sails loss of power if argus had known that shed have done for both of us he saw the surprise and sudden concern and added simply but not before we had rendered her equally useless he glanced aloft at the masthead pendant how many times had he done that he took out his watch and flicked open the guard remembering the whole seafight had taken less than two hours and already argus was almost lost in the offshore haze which marked the coming of evening he shaded his eyes to look for the bedford and saw her topsails on the horizon like small yellow shells then he looked around at the splintered planking the small line of corpses which had been dragged below the weather gangway there was much to do and he must not give way for an instant if his men were to keep the will to fight again if the time came he saw another corpse being carried up from the forehatch and knew he would have to deal with the reports of damage arrange for replacements and repairs and burials he heard another sharp cry through the cabin skylight and thought of keen being spreadeagled there while allday tried to extract the splinter he said i am going below mr herrick deal with reports on damage and casualties he saw him nod thank you as he hurried below iherrick said quietly no thankyou bolitho brushed past the sentry at his door and then stopped it was very quiet in the cabin and when he saw keens naked body lying on the deck he thought he was too late allday said all done captain he held up the jagged red lump in some pincers i think he did very well for a lad bolitho looked down at keens ashen face there was blood on his lips where one of the seamen had held a strap between his teeth to prevent him from biting through his tongue noddall and he other seamen were finishing tying the dressing around the wound and there was a thick smell of rum in the air bolitho said quietly thank you allday i never knew you understood such things allday shook his head did it to a sheep once poor thing fell down a cliff on to a broken sapling very much the same really bolitho walked to the stern windows and sucked in a lungful of air you must tell mr keen that when he is well again he turned and watched him gravely do you think he will fully recover allday nodded yes another inch or so and it might have been the end he forced a grin seeing the strain on bolithos face for the ladies anyway the door opened and herrick said we are within signalling distance of bedford sir i come up he paused and looked down at keen even a glance told him his breathing was easier casualties herrick dropped his eyes ten killed sir twenty wounded its a miracle we didnt lose far more the carpenter and his mates are below but it seems most of the holes are above the waterline shes a lucky ship sir bolitho looked from him to allday im the lucky one then he walked from the cabin allday shook his head and sighed releasing more rum into the smoke air my advice is to leave him be mr herrick sir herrick nodded i know but he has taken this setback badly though i know of no captain who could have done better allday dropped his voice but one captain did do better today and oursll not rest until hes met with him again im thinking keen gave a soft moan and allday snapped come on you idlers basin to his head ive poured so much grog into his guts hell spew all over the cabin when he comes to the surface again herrick smiled and walked out towards the ladder seeing the men replacing the lashings on the guns glancing at him and grinning as he passed one of them called we showed the bastards eh sir herrick paused that we did lads the captain was proud of you the seaman grinned more broadly aye sir i seed im in the thick of it walkin about like e was on plymouth oe i knew then that we was goin to be all right herrick climbed towards the sunlight and stared up at the torn sails if only you knew he thought sadly he found the other lieutenants and warrant officers already assembled on the quarterdeck giving their various reports while bolitho leaned against the mainmast trunk when he saw herrick he said there is still a good span of daylight left well put the hands to replacing canvas and runningrigging while it lasts i have ordered the galley fire to be lit and well see that our people get a good meal he gestured towards the labouring storeship which was now less than a mile away we might even poach a few extra hands from her eh herrick saw the others watching bolitho dully their bodies almost limp with exhaustion and delayed shock he guessed that this other bolitho cool confident filled with ideas again was the one the seaman on the gun crew had pictured throughout the battle the fact that he knew the real bolitho behind the shield made him feel suddenly privileged and restored in for a blow rear admiral beves conway made a dark silhouette against the windows colourful rectangle but bolitho could recognise his impatience even though his back was turned beyond him still and peaceful above their own varying shadows the anchored ships shone in the late sunlight undine lay apart from the heavy transport and the little brig rosalind and it was impossible to see the damage she had received from the french frigates eighteenpounders occasionally when there was a lull in the voices bolitho heard the echoes of thudding hammers the rasp of saws to show that only distance made undines trim appearance a lie the air in the big timbered room was cool after the open bay and although the various figures sitting around it looked as if they had barely moved since his last visit bolitho noticed that the place itself had changed considerably in so short a time more furniture some rugs and a whole array of gleaming decanters and glasses made it look lived in rather than a fortress under siege don luis puigserver sat on a brassbound chest sipping wine while james raymond tightlipped and unsmiling faced him across a littered table the brigs master captain vega of the original garrison and two redcoated soldiers from the bedford made up the rest of the gathering one of the latter a heavyfaced man introduced briefly as major frederick jardine and who commanded the soldiers brought from madras bolitho instantly recognised as the one he had seen there when he had been escorting viola raymond he had a fat belligerent face and his small piggy eyes had hardly left bolitho since he had arrived the other soldier a captain strype was his secondincommand and a complete opposite tall and stickthin with a black moustache he spoke with a lisp and had a short barking laugh he was probably rather stupid bolitho thought but was obviously much in awe of his superior conway said sharply naturally i am very distressed to learn of arguss attack captain bolitho raymond said unwarranted too conway turned lightly on his heels his hair yellow in the sunlight but not unexpected raymond not by me that is it was obvious from the beginning that the french were implicated they have to be for their own interests sake we are lucky that bedfords arrival put paid to their intention to take captain bolithos ship from him he shifted his gaze his tone incisive and he would have done so eh bolitho felt all their eyes on him i believe so sir conway bobbed his head good good bolitho i wanted the truth and believe me i know what it cost you raymond tried again to put his point of view i think sir that we should despatch the brig to madras without delay sir montagu strang may consider that further operations here might be imprudent he ignored conways stiffening shoulders later perhaps some new plan may be conceived until then we must take this affair as a warning conway rasped a warning do you imagine that for one instant i will let some damned pirate work off his wrath on me and so imperil the very task i have just undertaken he stepped closer well do you raymond paled but replied stubbornly i am here on behalf of the government sir as an adviser the french must realise that you are outmanoeuvred before you have begun if this muljadi is allowed to plunder and ravage these waters then there is no chance of using pendang bay as a new and flourishstation for trade no shipping master would risk it he turned towards the brigs captain is that not so the man nodded glumly we need more protection sir raymond sounded triumphant exactly which is what the french intend if we ask for more menofwar to patrol the area they too will even the balance by sending additional consorts for argus conway stared at him then so be it no sir it would mean war argus is protected by her letter of marque muljadi is protected by his own power and backed up by his french friends there are a thousand muljadis in the indies some who are genuine rulers and some who reign over fewer people than captain bolitho does at present we all want to extend our trade and influence to china if need be and beyond there are riches we can only dream of lands where people have never heard of king george or louis either for that matter bolitho said quietly you are advising the governor to admit defeat sir do i understand correctly raymond smiled calmly as you have done eh bolitho walked to the window and stared down at his ship it gave him time allowed the sudden blinding anger to depart in the lower enclosure he saw midshipman keen sitting with one of the ships boys rescued from the nervion he had been detailed to look after keen to assist him if only by making him rest it was still not possible to be sure he would recover from his wound was it really only the day before yesterday the smoke and noise the aftermath of hard heavy work to put their ship to rights the seaburials each corpse heavily weighted to ensure it went straight down to avoid the prowling sharks he said i take it mr raymond you have never borne arms for your country he did not wait for an answer had you ever worn the kings coat you would have known that one defeat if admitted is not the end of a battle he heard captain strype say in his thin voice by gad thats not much of an argument what bolitho turned swiftly his tone hard i was addressing mr raymond sir not some damned mercenary who because of his rank imagines himself to be a solider don puigserver brought his glass down to the table with a loud bang gentlemen i know that vega and i are no longer involved here i also believe that both senor raymond and the governor he bowed slightly to conway are both right with muljadi free to use his ruthless power and so influence other friendly rulers in the indies you can make no advances with more military strength you would only excite a hostile reaction and further french involvement he paused and gave an eloquent shrug which i doubt my own country could ignore bolitho nodded towards him grateful for his interruption another second and he knew he would have said too much and conway even had he wanted to would have been unable to help him major jardine cleared his throat despite what the gallant captain has said he did not look at bolitho i believe my force will be sufficient i have two hundred sepoys and a mule battery all experienced he had a thick voice and sweated badly despite the rooms comparative coolness puigserver regarded him gravely if nervion had been here none of this could have happened an additional ship the men and the showing of our flag to the argus would certainly have delayed if not defeated muljadis intentions conway said but she is not here only the undine jardine said thickly and she does not seem to have acquitted herself too well he turned to bolitho his small eyes like steel even as a mere soldier a mercenary i can see that neither of the schooners lies at anchor and as far as we know the argus still flies muljadis colours what sayyou captain bolitho faced him the first schooner turned turtle and sank the other took advantage of arguss presence to escape he could feel little emotion now words and taunts were inevitable it was better to get it over with clear the air indeed yes jardine leaned back in his chair his polished boots squeaking and then the bedford arrived to give you help the poor muchmaligned companys own ship was the one to drive argus away had you been there major jardine spread his plump hands but i was not sir i am a soldier i am supposed to be able to leave such matters to our navy surely conway said coldly i have heard enough i will brook no more hostility here not from you bolitho he looked at jardine nor from anyone else he thrust his hands behind him making his sloping shoulders droop even further had undine been beaten in open combat i would have removed captain bolitho from command he knows that well enough and so should the rest of you the navy is too often expected to fight greater forces than itself possesses and has been so successful in the past that victory against ridiculous odds is now taken for granted by the emptyminded men of politics and those who care more for quick profit than lasting security as it is captain bolitho will be required to sail without further delay other than completing necessary repairs for muljadis own territory in the strait he looked at bolitho calmly you will make contact with arguss captain under flag of truce and convey a message which i will give you raymond said quickly may i suggest plead with you sir that you allow don puigserver to go with captain bolitho he has the right to demand the freedom of spains last governor here colonel pastor he could explain his displeasure at such conway shouted his voice bounding back from the timbered walls i have been appointed governor raymond i dont need your apron strings nor do i need the help of the king of spain dyou understand raymonds defiance wilted under conways sudden anger he said nothing puigserver stood up and walked slowly towards the door followed gratefully by capitan vega he paused and looked back at them his eyes very dark i would have accompanied capitan bolitho with pleasure of course he smiled briefly i have a great admiration for his courage his he searched for the word his integrity but i have much to do my task is to embark the remaining spanish soldiers and their dependents on to the bedford he glanced at conway his smile fading as you remarked this morning the flag of spain no longer has authority here bolitho watched him stride out he had sensed the tension as soon as he had arrived it could not have been easy for conway fretting over lack of news waiting for supplies and troops to arrive but he was wrong to antagonise puigserver if things went badly here conway would need all the references he could get even in spain jardine remarked vaguely id better be off then settle the sepoy s in their company lines and replace the marines as sentries and pickets no thanks no admiration for what captain bellairs and his marines had achieved in so short a time bolitho glanced through the window again the encroaching brush and creeper cleared away and corpses buried the place used as a hospital had been cleaned and painted and even whitmarsh had been full of praise for their efforts conway nodded i will meet you here after sunset major bolitho waited until the two soldiers had left the room and then said i am sorry about my outburst sir but i have had my bellyful of his kind conway grunted perhaps but you will hold your tongue in future if jardine commanded only a handful of crippled beggars i would say the same i need every man i can get raymond stood up and yawned this damned heat i think ill take a nap before dinner he too walked out he did not look at bolitho conway said softly he disliked your remark about bearing arms you know he chuckled his wife has been singing the praises of seaofficers in general during your absence and you in particular he frowned i seem to be plagued with those intent on disruption is she well sir he could not face him i have not seen her since my return shes been assisting that sot of a surgeon with the sick and wounded his eyebrows mounted surprised by god bolitho youve much to learn about women he nodded sharply but youll see all in good time bolitho recalled her refusal to help tend the injured aboard undine after puigserver had been carried aboard more dead than alive and her reasons he sighed perhaps puigserver and conway were both right he had much to learn he replied i will return to the ship sir there will be a lot to arrange yes conway watched him thoughtfully and remember when you meet arguss captain keep your personal feelings to yourself he is doing his own work as best he can you would do the same if so ordered if le chaumareys is still in command and not killed by one of your guns he will be eager to meet you also he is older than you but i think you may have something in common his lines deepened as he added dryly a disrespect for your superiors if nothing else bolitho picked up his hat you could never be sure about conway where the warmth ended and the steel began conway said please come ashore tonight and dine with the rest of he waved one hand around the room the castaways bolitho recognised the dismissal and walked from the room beyond the palisades the jungle was as thick and as overpowering as ever and yet already the place felt familiar lasting he found allday lounging in the shade below the main entrance he was watching some native women who were washing clothes in a large wooden trough they were small and oliveskinned and although well covered displayed supple charm which allday apparently admired greatly he straightened his back and said all done captain he saw bolithos glance and nodded fair little wenches we will have to watch our people captain only the people allday grinned ah well now at that moment bolitho saw the surgeon emerge from the makeshift hospital wiping his hands on a rag and squinting into the slanting sunlight he saw bolitho and nodded two of the men wounded in your battle can return to work sir two more died as you know but the rest stand a good chance of survival he looked away until the next time bolitho considered his words a total of twelve had died because of argus despite the luck at there being few in comparison to the fierceness of the battle it was too many he sighed perhaps herrick had got some more volunteers from the other ships whitmarsh said your coxswain did a good job by the way the boy should have died by rights he looked at allday wasted you should make something of your life bolitho said quietly i am glad you thanked him for his efforts on mr keens behalf but i am sure he will decide his own future allday could have been stonedeaf for all the notice he paid to their comments whitmarsh said well anyway sir ive cleaned up a bit here most of them will heal although a few more will die before they reach spain disease mostly of course of course whitmarsh looked him full in the eyes rotten with it just as they have given it to these poor ignorant savages too if any one of your sailors comes to me with that damned pox ill make him wish hed never touched a woman in his life they are your sailors too mr whitmarsh bolitho regarded him searchingly despite his usual attitude where naval matters were concerned he looked a great deal better or perhaps there was little to drink here either way he was nothing like the drunken hulk who had tumbled aboard in england so there you are captain he turned and saw her watching him from the entrance she was almost covered by a white smock and wore the same straw hat she had brought from santa cruz her eyes were in shadow but there was no doubting the warmth of her smile he replied i am grateful for what you have done maam whitmarsh nodded she is the one who took charge here organised the whole hospital from top to bottom his admiration was genuine she smiled at allday and then slipped her hand through bolithos arm ill walk with you to the beach if i may it is so refreshing to have you back again bolitho could feel whitmarsh and allday watching them he said you are looking er very well her hand tightened very slightly say viola he smiled viola better when she spoke again her voice was different i saw your ship dropping anchor and was half mad with anxiety i wanted james to take me out to her by boat he refused he would then i saw you with a telescope it was like being there with you and today i have spent a little time with valentine valentine bolitho looked at her profile who is that she laughed of course you would never remember a thing like a mere name why i am speaking of your mr keen the mood changed again the poor boy he looks so ill yet can speak of no one but you she gripped his arm hard i am almost jealous bolitho looked past her to where the gig lay beached on the sand the small breakers hissing and receding around it the boats crew were engaged in noisy conversation with some seamen from the brig and it was plain they were describing what they still saw as their victory over the argus and the schooners he smiled despite his earlier bitterness and disappointment perhaps they were right to remain alive under such circumstances could well be seen as a victory she was looking at him standing slightly apart as if searching for something you smile captain at me at my boldness perhaps he reached out and took her hand not that never she tossed her head that is better captain he heard alldays shoes on the sand the sudden silence from the gig the name is richard he said gravely allday heard their combined laughter and felt suddenly worried this was a danger he could recognise well enough far better than his captain he thought he removed his hat as bolitho walked down the beach towards the gig and heard him say i will be ashore later maam she held the hat brim to shade her eyes until then captain but allday had seen the look on her face before it was hidden in shadow that too was something he could recognise he glanced quickly at the tower above the fort and took a deep breath squalls ahead he decided and not too far away bolitho looked at him well alldays face was rigid so it would appear captain three days after returning to teluk pendang his majestys frigate undine weighed anchor again and put to sea by late afternoon of that day she stood well out in the glittering expanse of the java sea with not even a cormorant for company to any casual observer who might have watched her departure there was little to betray her mauling from arguss cannon but as bolitho came on deck he was well aware of it shrouds and stays which had been cut by grape and catus shone brightly in their fresh tar deck planking hastily placed looked duller than the welltried and holystoned wf which had been in the ship since she had been built the s maker and his mates had been busier than most and even nccr as he walked slowly along the weather side bolitho saw jots tait squatting with some helpers his one eye gleaming watdr fully as with needles and palms they continued with th patching fowlar who was masters mate of the watch touched forehead and reported southwest by south sir he gestwcd abeam a bit of a swell and mr soames has gone forrard check the gun lashings bolitho glanced at the compass and then the set of each by turn he had already noticed the steep sickening motion but it was too early to gauge its importance the barornett was unsteady but that was usual in these latitudes and wl he had consulted mudge he had chosen his words carefully could be in for a storm sir you never know in these waters he nodded to fowlar and walked to the quarterdeck feeling the sun lingering on his shoulders and face it was a wind he thought but sultry and somehow depressing he saw herrick speaking with soames by the starboard twelvepounders the boatswain was there too pointing various repairs yet to be done and through the main hatch he heard the lively sounds of a jig from the ships fiddler normal everyday sights and noises he shifted wearily and begano pace up and down the weather side from one corner of his eye he saw soames climb from th gun deck make as if to approach him and then return to the opposite side of the deck bolitho was relieved soames had proved himself a tower of strength in a fight but as a conversationalist he was heavy and limited and bolitho needed to be left alone to think to examine the rights and the wrongs of what he had done with the lajd left far astern and once more abandoned to his own resources he could view everything much more clearly now as his shadow bobbed and swayed above the black sixpounders he decided there were far more wrongs than rights inevitable something which either of them could have stopped in a second merely by a word a hint even he recalled the way she had watched him across the table while the others had talked and chattered the night away capitan vega had entertained them with a song so sad it had brought tears to his eyes puigserver had spoken of his adventures in the south americas and the west indies before the war raymond had become steadily drunk after getting into a fruitless argument with major jardine on the possibilities of a lasting peace with france conway had remained terribly sober or if not bolitho thought he must be a better actor than he had imagined when then had the actual moment of decision arrived he had found himself on the upper rampart with her at his side leaning over the rough timber to look at the anchored ships in the bay they had made a fine picture tiny lights reflected on the uneasy water the pale splash of oars as a guardboat patrolled monotonously around its heavier charges without looking at him she had said i want you to stay on shore tonight will you perhaps that had been the moment he had felt reckless dangerously so ill send a message to my first lieutenant he turned to stare along the deck herrick was still talking to shellabeer and he wondered if he had guessed what had occurred he could remember the room exactly more like a cell with fewer luxuries than a lieutenants cabin in a manofwar he had lain on the bed his fingers locked behind his head listening to the strange noises beyond the walls and the rapid beats of his own heart cries from the jungle the occasional call of a picket challenging one of the sergeants of the guard wind murmuring around the square tower without response from deck or rigging which was his normal life then he had heard the sound of her footstep in the passageway a quick whisper to her maid before she opened the door and shut it quickly behind her it was becoming harder to remember in perfect sequence the continuity was confused he could recall holding her tightly against his body the warmth of her mouth on his the sudden overwhelming desperate need which threw all last caution to the winds there had been no light in the tiny room but that from the moon he had seen her only briefly her bare shoulder and thigh shining like silver before she had climbed on to the bed pulling him down and down until at last spent and gasping with the extent of their desire they had lain together as one he could not remember sleeping at all just holding her needing her tortured by the realisation it could not last once during the night and towards dawn she had whispered in his ear do not reproach yourself it is not a question of honour it is a part of life she had put her lips to his shoulder and had added softly what a lovely smell you have of the ship salt and tar she had giggled quietly i must have it too then the nervous tap on the door the quick scramble to pull on her gown as her faithful maid warned of the coming of another day but for bolitho it had been different from all other days he felt totally unlike anything he had been before alive yet restless replete but needing more he heard steps on the deck and saw herrick watching him yes mr herrick winds freshening again sir shall i call the hands to reef topsls he ran his eyes across the ship riggings straining apiece by the sound of it well give her her head a while longer until eight bells if possible when we change tack and run to the westrd no sense in tiring the hands when one operation will suffice he leaned back hands on hips as he stared at the main topgallant masthead the long pendant undulating in the wind shes a lot of power to offer us yet aye sir herrick sounded tired is anything wrong bolitho walked to the weather rail and out of earshot of soames and two seamen who were splicing halliards herrick said quietly you know already sir ive said my piece whats done is done bolitho watched him gravely then let us leave it well alone herrick sighed very well sir he looked at the helmsmen im sorry i could only get four extra hands neither bedford nor the rosalind were eager to part with any more and those i did obtain are troublemakers by the cut of them he gave a slow smile although mr shellabeer assures me they will change their ways before another dawn midshipman armitage ran up the ladder and touched his hat to herrick he stammered mr taprils respects sir and would you join him in the magazine herrick asked is that all the boy looked uncomfortable he said youd promised sir and so i did mr armitage as the midshipman hurried away herrick said i was going to arrange to have the powder casks inspected and marked again no sense in losing good powder he lowered his voice look sir are you sure you cannot see the folly of what you are doing there is no telling what damage it might do to your career bolitho swung towards him and then saw the anxious concern on herricks face he replied i am relying on your lady luck thomas he walked towards the cabin hatch adding for soamess benefit call me the moment there is a change soames watched him go and then walked aft to the compass fowlar watched him warily once back in england he too would get the chance to obtain a commission as lieutenant the captain had said as much and that was good enough but if he did make that first allimportant step up the ladder he hoped he would be happier about it than lieutenant soames appeared to be soames rasped mr fowlar your helmsmen are wandering off a point or so damn my eyes i dont expect that from you fowlar watched him move away and smiled to himself there was nothing wrong with the helm and soames knew it it was part of the game he said watch your helm mallard mallard transferred a plug of tobacco from one cheek to the other and nodded aye mr fowlar sur the watch continued before the last dog watch had run its course it was obvious the rising wind made it necessary to reef topsails bolitho gripped the hammock nettings and faced along his ships length as he watched the petty officers checking their men in readiness for going aloft while shellabeer and his own hands were already busy scrambling about the boattier with further lashings herrick shouted above the wind a second reef within the hour sir if im any judge bolitho turned aft and felt the spray as it hissed freely above the weather quarter the wind had backed rapidly and now blew lustily from the southeast making the motion both violent and uncomfortable he replied we will steer due west once we have reefed on the larboard tack she will be steadier he watched the great steeply banked swell like serried lines of angry glass hills when the wind got up further those rounded rollers would break into heavy waves bolitho heard mudge shout were in for a blow right enough sir he wasclinging to his misshapen hat his small eyes watering in the wind the barometer is poppin about like a pea on a drum davy shouted all mustered sir very well hands aloft herrick held up his hand keep them from racing each other and stop the bosuns mates from using their ropesends he glanced at bolitho one slip and a man would go overboard without a chance of recovery bolitho agreed herrick always remembered things like that he said i hope this doesnt last too long if we have to ride it out it will upset admiral conways other arrangements i have no doubt he looked up as faint shouts and curses told him of the struggle the topmen were having with the violent unruly canvas fisting and kicking pitching this way and that with the deck far below the very sight of their efforts made him feel queasy it took the best part of an hour to master the sails to herricks satisfaction and by then it was time to take in yet another reef spray and spindrift whipped across the weather side and every timber and stay seemed to be groaning in a protesting chorus bolitho shouted lay her round another point mr herrick we will steer westbysouth herrick nodded his face running with spray afterguard to the mizzen braces he shook his speaking trumpet angrily keep together damn you a marine had slipped and fallen in a scarlet heap knocking several of his comrades into confusion bolitho pointed abeam to the first glitter of white crests as the wind did its work shes steadier mr herrick he relaxed as the experienced seamen rushed aft to help the marines and less skilled hands on the mizzen braces and not a man hurt by the looks of it undine had paid off stiffly to the wind her shrouds and ratlines shining jetblack against the rising swell but with her yards comfortably braced and canvas reduced to topsails and jibs she was making the best of it davy panted on to the quarterdeck his shirt wringing and sodden all secure sir he lurched backwards tottered and then reeled against the nettings adding savagely by the lord id forgotten what a real gale felt like bolitho smiled dismiss the watch below but tell the boatswain to make regular inspections we cant afford to lose precious gear for want of a good lashing he turned to herrick come below with me despite the din of sea and strained timbers it seemed warm and inviting in the cabin bolitho watched the spray making diagonal patterns across the stern windows heard the rudder grinding and squeaking while the helmsmen held the frigate on her new course noddall pattered into the cabin his small body steeply angled as he fetched goblets for the two officers herrick wedged himself in a corner of the bench seat and regarded bolitho questioningly if we have to run before the wind would it make so much difference sir bolitho thought of his written orders conways brief but lucid instructions it might he waited until they both had goblets and said to what we can achieve thomas errick chuckled ill share that toast bolitho sat at the desk feeling the deck tilting and then sliding into yet another trough he was glad he had insisted that keen and some of the other wounded had been left at pendang bay too much of this sort of motion would burst open even the finest stitches he said admiral conway intends to let bedford put to sea as soon as we are on our way to the benua islands i think he wishes to get rid of the spanish troops and dependents as soon as possible herrick watched him bit risky isnt it sir with the damned argus still at large bolitho shook his head i think not i am certain the french or muljadi will have agents watching conways settlement they will have seen us weigh anchor argus will know we are coming well enough herrick looked glum they are as clever as that eh we must assume so i think conway is right better to get bedford away with her passengers and despatches for madras before things get any worse if theres a real storm itll put paid to everything herrick cheered up somewhat the frogs dont like bad weather bolitho smiled at herricks confidence this one may not care he has been in these waters a long time i believe he is not one of the hitandrun kind who used to dash out of brest or lorient and flee for home again at the sight of an english ship he rubbed his chin this le chaumareys interests me i would like to know more of him than his record in battle herrick nodded he appears to know a lot about you sir too much a steep roller cruised beneath the quarter holding the ship up and tilting her forward at a steeper angle before freeing her again to sidle into the next rough beyond the closed door them heard the marine sentry slip and fall his musket clattering away while he cursed and fought to regain his composure bolitho said slowly when we meet with arguss captain ve must keep our eyes well opened if he agrees to parley we may learn something if not we must be ready to fight herrick frowned id rather fight sir its the only way l know how to be at ease with a frenchman bolitho thought suddenly of that room at the admiralty the calm features of admiral winslade as he had given a brief outline of undines mission four months back a time of peace yet ships had foundered and men had been killed or crippled for life but even the lordly power of admiralty the guile and experience of politics were useless out here a solitary windswept frigate minimum resources and no guiding hand when one might be needed herrick took bolithos quiet mood as a signal he placed his goblet inside the table fiddles and rose carefully to his feet time to do my rounds sir he cocked his head to listen as water gurgled and sluiced along the quarterdeck scuppers i have the middle watch and may snatch a catnap before i face the breeze bolitho pulled out his watch and felt herrick looking at it i will turn in now i have a notion we may all be needed before long in fact it felt only minutes after his head had touched the pillow that someone was clinging to the cot and tapping his shoulder it was allday his shadow rising and falling like a black spectre as the cabin lantern swung violently from the deckhead sorry to wake you captain but its getting far worse up top he paused to allow bolithos brain to clear mr herrick told me to pass the word bolitho stumbled out of the cot instantly conscious of a new more uneven motion as he pulled on his breeches and shoes and held out his arms for a heavy tarpaulin coat he asked what time is it allday had to shout as the sea thundered against the hull and surged angrily along the upper deck morning watch is about to be called sir tell mr herrick call them now he gripped his arm and together they lurched half across the cabin like two tipsy sailors i want all hands directly im going to the chart space he found mudge already there his lumpy figure sprawled across the table while he peered at the chart blaspheming quietly as the lantern went mad above his head bolitho snapped how is it he glanced up at him his eyes red in the feeble glow bad sir well ave the canvas in shreds unless we lie to for a bit bolitho peered at the chart plenty of searoom that was the only consolation he hurried towards the quarterdeck ladder and almost fell as the ship swayed and corkscrewed in two separate motions he fought his way to the wheel where four helmsmen their bodies lashed firmly to prevent their being caught unawares by an incoming wave were fighting the spokes their eyes glowing in the flickering compass light herrick shouted ive called all hands sir and ive put extra ones on the pumps bolitho peered at the jerking compass card very well we will lie to under shortened maintopsl get davy to put the best men aloft at once he turned as a sound like gunshot echoed above the shriek of wind and sea and saw the mizzen topsail rip itself apart the fragments tearing yet again into ragged streamers pale against the low scudding clouds he could hear the dismal clank of pumps hoarse cries as men blundered to their stations dodging below the gangways as more frothing water flooded amongst them fowlar shouted the sailmaker has only just repaired that crojack sir he was grinning in spite of the confusion hell not be pleased bolitho was watching the black shapes of the topmen as they climbed cautiously up the vibrating ratlines the wind flattened them occasionally against the shrouds so that they hung motionless before starting up again for the topsail yards mudge yelled th quarter boat as carried away sir no one paid any heed and herrick spluttered in spray before saying there goes the foretopsl sir those lads are doing fine something dropped amongst the taut rigging before falling to the gun deck with a sickening thud herrick shouted man from aloft take him to the surgeon bolitho bit his lip it was unlikely he could live after such a fall fighting every yard of the way undine came round into the wind her hull awash from quarterdeck to beakhead and with men clinging to tethered guns or stanchions as each wave surged and broke across her reeling deck mudge bellowed hoarsely shell ride it out now sir bolitho nodded his mind cringing from the onslaught the very vehemence of the storm well set the spanker if the tops carries away tell the boatswain to have his hands ready therell not be time for regrets if that one goes he felt a bowline being bent around his waist and saw alldays teeth bared in a grin you look after us captain thisll take care of you bolitho nodded the breath knocked out of him then he clung to the dripping nettings peering through the painful needles of spray as he watched over his command a lucky ship perhaps he had spoken too soon tempted fate herrick gasped could be over by first light sir but when dawn did come and bolitho saw the angry coppercoloured clouds reflected upon the endless jagged wavecrests he knew it was not going to give up so willingly high above the deck torn and broken cordage floated to the wind like dead creeper and the solitary braced topsail looked so fullbellied that it could follow the fate of the other at any second he looked at herrick seeing the angry sores on his neck and hands where the blown salt had done its work the other crouching battered figures nearby were no better he thought of the other frigate probably snug in a protected anchorage and felt the anger welling up inside him get some hands aloft mr herrick theres work to be done herrick was already clawing his way along the nettings towards the rail bolitho wiped his face and mouth with his arm if they could weather this one he thought they would be ready for anything no quarter some more ot coffee sir noddall held his pot above bolithos mug without waiting for a reply bolitho sipped it slowly feeling the scalding liquid running through him a taste of rum too noddall was certainly doing his best he eased his shoulders and winced every bone and fibre seemed to ache as if hehad been in actual battle he studied the weary figures who were moving about the upper deck made curiously ghostlike and unreal by the heavy vapour which rose from sodden planking and clothing alike it had been just that he thought gravely a battle no less than if cannon had been employed for three days and nights they had fought it out their confined world made even smaller by the great roaring expanse of wavecrests their minds blunted by the ceaseless shriek of the wind like him the ship seemed to have had the breath knocked from her now under barely drawing topsails her littered decks steaming once more beneath an empty sky she was thrusting only slowly above her reflection in places paint had been pared away to display wood so bare it could have been the work of a carpenter everywhere men were at work marlin spikes and needles hammers and tackles endeavouring to restore the ship which had carried them through such a frenzy that even mudge had admitted it was one of the bitterest he had endured he came across the deck now his coat steaming gently his jowls almost hidden in white stubble accordin to me reckonin sir weve overreached the benua group by a fair piece when we checks the noon sights ill be appier he squinted upwards towards the flapping pendant which had lost almost half its length in the storm but the winds veered as i thought it might i suggest we old your new course nor noreast until we gets a better fix of our position he blew his nose loudly an id make so bold as to say ow well you andled er sir he puffed out his cheeks a couple o times i thought we was done for bolitho looked away thank you he was thinking of two men less fortunate one had gone during the second night swept away without a sound nobody had seen him go the other had slipped from the larboard cathead where he had been working feverishly to repair chafing lashings around the anchor stock a solitary wavecrest had pulled him from his perch almost casually so that for a while longer he had still imagined he would be saved willing hands had reached out for him but another wave had flung him not outwards but high in the air like a kicking doll before hurling him against the massive anchor with savage force roskilly a bosuns mate had insisted he had heard the mans ribs cave in before he had been dragged screaming into the frothing water alongside including the man who had fallen from aloft that made three dead with some seven others injured broken bones fingers torn raw by bucking sodden canvas skin inflamed by salt by wind and by lines snaking through clutching hands in pitch darkness made up most of the surgeons list herrick strode aft and said im having a new jib bent on now sir the others only fit for patching he took a mug from noddall and cradled it gratefully to his mouth heaven help the poor sailorman bolitho looked at him youd not change it herrick grimaced a few times back there i wondered if id get the choice davy who had the watch joined them by the rail what are our chances of a landfall sir he looked older less assured than he had before the action with the frigate during the storm he had behaved well so perhaps he still believed the only real menace came from a cannons mouth bolitho considered his question that will depend on fixing our position allowing for our drift and the shifting of the wind id say we might sight the islands before nightfall he smiled the effort making him more conscious of the strain he had been under herrick said dourly the damned frog will be laughing at us sitting in harbour under that bloody pirates guns bolitho looked at him thoughtfully the same idea had only left him occasionally and that when he had needed all his thoughts elsewhere to parley with the french captain was one thing to accept that he was serving under muljadis flag meant far more it would be an open admission of failure an acceptance that muljadis sovereignty did exist if conway agreed to the latter every other european power which had trading and protection rights in the indies especially the powerful dutch east india company would see it as englands move to take all the advantages for herself which was exactly what the french would like what should he do if the french captain refused to be moved by conways message patrol up and down outside the islands and draw argus into combat it would be a onesided affair le chaumareys was an old hand in these waters knew every islet and cove where he had once hidden to avoid british frigates in time of war equally he would be well advised to lie at anchor living off the land until undine was made to withdraw he felt his tiredness putting an edge to his anger if only the politicians were here to see what their ideas of world strategy actually represented in flesh and blood in wood and canvas land ho fine on th starboard bow davy rubbed his hands nearer than you thought sir mudge said quickly never he fumbled with his slate and made some rapid calculations theres a small islet some forty miles to the southrd of the benuas sir he peered round until he had discovered midshipman penns diminutive shape by the taffrail aloft with ye mr penn an fetch the big glass for company he eyed him fiercely take a look an make me a sketch just like i taught you he waited until the boy had scampered for the main shrouds and chuckled capn cook ad the right idea sir sketch an describe every damn thing you see timell come when every manowar will ave a complete set o pictures to study he watched penns progress not that somell eed em o course bolitho smiled at herrick better than i had expected well have a man in the chains and begin soundings as we pass this islet of the masters the chart describes some nineteen fathoms hereabouts but id prefer to be certain twenty minutes later penn returned to the deck his brown features sprinkled with sweat he held out his grubby pad and stood back to watch mudges reactions over his shoulder davy said looks like a whale to me mudge eyed him coldly so it does to penn he said fair work it is ow i recalls it his small eyes returned to davy exactly like a great rocky whale the merest pause sir anything there bolitho took a glass and trained it above the gun deck as yet he could see nothing but the same painful glare he wondered momentarily where the storm had gone how it could vanish after showing so much fury bless you no sir mudge beamed at davys discomfort just a fistful o rocks like the tip of some undersea ridge as no doubt it was one time but i suppose it could be used as shelter in a full gale bolitho watched some seamen hauling a new length of hemp along the larboard gangway tired and unshaven perhaps but there was something else too the way they worked together confidently he said we will alter course a point mr davy and take a look at your whale davy hurried to the rail mr penn pipe the hands to the braces herrick watched him smiling easily any reason sir bolitho shrugged more of a feeling he watched the men thronging along the decks where the steamy vapour continued to drift amongst them from forward he saw real smoke as bogle the cook got busy with the first hot meal they would have eaten since the storm had come and gone he saw the yards swinging to the pull of the braces heard the helmsman cry norcast by north sir davy hurried past to consult the binnacle and the set of the sails another pull on the weather mainbrace mr shellabeer he dabbed his streaming face now belay bolitho smiled when davy was irritated he always performed his duties better for some reason he said put another good lookout aloft if you please i want that islet watched until we are up to it he glanced at the suns blinding patterns beyond the gently pitching bowsprit i am going below to shave and to bribe noddall into finding a clean shirt later as he lay back in a chair while allday busied himself with his razor he found time to wonder what he would do if or when he met with arguss captain the hastily heated water the skilful movement of the blade against his skin was making him relax muscle by muscle and he could feel the air from the open stern windows across his bare shoulders like a soothing embrace all around the world the kings captains were going about their affairs fighting scurvy and disease carrying despatches for an admiral or some lonely outpost not marked on any schoolboys map or pondering behind a cabin bulkhead in dread of mutiny or planning some diversion to prevent one fighting maybe with some dissident ruler who had attacked the kings subjects defiled the flag butchered men and women he smiled and some would be like himself a tiny extension to a halfformed plan through the open skylight he heard the lookouts cry deck there ship at anchor close inshore he jumped to his feet seizing the clean shirt and using it to dab away the soap from his chin allday stood aside and grinned admiringly by god captain you must have more wiles than a farmyard cat how did you know there was a ship bolitho was tucking the crumpled shirt inside his breeches magic allday he hurried for the door and then forced himself to wait until midshipman penn appeared in the entrance a ship sir mr davys respects and he believes it may be a schooner thank you mr penn it was all he could do to appear calm i will come up when i have completed dressing my complimmts to the first lieutenant and please ask him to meet me on the quarterdeck he turned and saw allday hiding a smile is something amusing you why no captain allday watched him gravely but i am always ready to see my betters at their affairs bolitho smiled then i hope you learn from it he walked into the passageway and made for the ladder herrick greeted him excitedly a schooner sir the man in the foremast crosstrees is my best lookout and i had a glass sent aloft to him he stared at bolitho with open astonishment it is uncanny bolitho smiled shortly a fair guess if the truth be told but it was a bad storm and when the master suggested this small isle as a place for shelter i began athinking he took penns telescope and trained it towards the bows there was the islet now an uneven blob of greyblue the masthead would be able to see much more where is the wind davy said from the southwest sir bolitho let his mind move accordingly alter course and lay her on the larboard tack he crossed to the binnacle seeing the helmsmen watching him curiously we will steer nor norwest he waited as a bosuns mate dashed to pipe the hands to the braces again then to herrick and davy he added slowly this way we will keep the isle between us and the other vessel and hold our advantage to windrd get the courses on her but keep the tgallants furled for the present herrick understood at once aye sir the less canvas we display the less likely they are to sight us bolitho glanced at mudge who had appeared with fowlar beside the helm you put the thought in my mind i have always wondered why muljadi has good warning of our movements i think we shall soon know his methods he looked at the washedout blue sky above the tapering masts but for the storm we would have approached directly from the eastrd thanks to the weathers rough mood we have gained something for once herrick asked softly what of the admirals instructions sir then he grinned i can see from your expression that you intend to choose your own moment sir bolitho smiled one cannot bargain if one is a beggar i have learned that long since he looked up as with sails cracking and shivering to the new tack undine turned purposefully to larboard the small humped islet moving away from the weather bow as if released from an anchor nor norwest sir full an bye bolitho beckoned to davy get the courses on her now to mudge he called how long by your consideration mudge pouted two hours sir good then once the sails are drawing well we can send both watches for their meal he watched the scurrying figures clawing along the yards others standing below on deck ready to sheet home the great fore and main courses herrick nodded approvingly bit different from when they came aboard sir bolitho found he was desperately hungry i think that applies to most of us he strode to the cabin hatch knowing that the unknown vessel might be harmless or an old wreck long abandoned or one more trick to delay or deceive him noddall watched him warily its salt beef again sir that will be excellent he ignored the amazement on noddalls rodent features and ill take some claret to wash it down he leaned over the sill and stared at the frothing wake below the counter chance luck call it what you will he thought it was all they had and he intended to make good use of it by th mark seventeen the leadsmans cry rose easily above the sounds of flapping canvas as undine her courses again brailed up to the yards glided steadily towards the islet bolitho saw shellabeer touch the leadsmans shoulder and reach out to feel the tallow arming in the bottom of the heavy weight before calling rocky bottom sir bolitho nodded as mudge had described it the small islet was more like an isolated rock pile than part of the seabed prepare to anchor mr herrick he took a glass from penn and moved it slowly over the raggedoutline they were five cables offshore but it was close enough to see that the first smooth impression of a surfaced whale had changed severely the rocks were bluegrey like cornish slate and cut by wind and tide into massive steep gullies as if some giant had hacked the islet into slices apart from a few clumps of gorse or rock flowers it looked bare and unwelcoming but there were plenty of seabirds perched in little clefts or circling busily above the highest point which he estimated to be some three hundred feet above the water he heard herrick shouting his orders the creak of rigging as undine dipped and rose again in a sudden swell the water looked deep but it was an illusion he could see some narrow stony beaches at the foot of the nearest cliff and guessed that the safest anchorage was on the opposite side where the other vessel lay hidden there was surf too steep and angry as it licked and spluttered around the one visible landing place helm alee he moved his glass in time with the ship as she turned easily into the wind watching for any sign of life the merest movement to show their approach had been seen let go anchor the sound of the anchor hitting the water seemed unusually loud and he imagined he could hear it echoing back from those desolate cliffs herrick shouted lively lads secure those lines to davy he added lowering parties man the tackles bolitho said have the leadsman watch his line now and see that the anchor is holding fast if we begin to drag because of the rocky bottom we will veer more cable directly aye sir herrick hurried away his face totally absorbed in his own duties with the ship swaying and pulling lazily to her cable it was even quieter and bolitho saw some of the birds quitting their precarious perches to flyand circle above the mastheads herrick returned breathing heavily we seem safe enough sir but ive told the anchorwatch to keep alert he squinted towards the shore it looks like a graveyard we will need two boats bolitho spoke his thoughts aloud gig and cutter will suffice they will have to run smartly through that surf the beach is steep by the look of it so put a good coxn in the cutter he saw allday signalling with his fist as the gig rose jerkily from its chocks the guyropes tautening to swing it round and above the gangway he added with a smile i think my boat is in safe hands herrick looked at him anxiously areyou going sir it is not for want of glory thomas he lowered his voice watching the chosen hands as they mustered by the arms chests but i need to know what we are against if anything herrick sounded unconvinced but if the other craft is one of the pirates sir what then surely youll want to sweep round and rake the devil as he slips his cable no he shook his head firmly he will be safely anchored yonder in shallower water than id dare enter close enough to rake him once clear he could lead us a merry maypole dance and i fear we would never match his agility in these conditions his tone hardened besides which i want to take himv boats lowered alongside sir davy came aft a curved hanger dangling from his belt bolitho touched his own swordhilt and saw captain bellairs watching the boats with visible irritation at being left behind he called captain bellairs i would be obliged if i could have three of your very best sharpshooters in each boat bellairs brightened considerably and snapped at sergeant coaker well lively sarnt although they should all be excellent marksmen what herrick grinned that was thoughtful sir perhaps bolitho shifted the glass again to watch some birds landing delicately along the clifftop they would never do that if men were close by but if seamen are better at scaling cliffs there is no beating a wellaimed ball at the right moment he nodded to davy man your boats to herrick he added casually if things go wrong you will find the admirals orders in my cabin you can rely on me sir herrick was looking troubled again but im certain that bolitho touched his arm and smiled yes but just bear it in mind if you have to act upon them asyou see fit he walked slowly towards the entry port seeing the watching seamen and marines as he passed familiar now he could put a name and a value on all of them midshipman armitage was looking confused and embarrassed sir the sharpshooters will not remove their coats sir he blushed as some of the oarsmen in the boats nudged each other and chuckled bellairs snapped cant have my fellows tramping about like damn vagrants what he saw bolitho and added quickly i mean can we sir bolitho slipped out of his blue coat and tossed it to noddall who was hovering by the quarterdeck ladder it is all right he nodded to the unsmiling marines if ii can shed a little authority i am certain your men can he saw the sergeant gathering up the red coats and shakos honour apparently restored he added and it will be a rough climb with who knows what at the end of it he paused above the swaying boats trying to think of some thing he might have missed or forgotten herrick said quietly good luck sir bolitho ran his glance along the crowded gangway and up to the men in the shrouds and you thomas have the people standto watch and watch about you know what to do he saw armitage staggering between the oarsmen in the gig it was almost cruel to take him a liability but he had to begin somewhere it was a marvel he had ever got to sea at all with a mother like his if keen had been here he would have taken him he saw penn peering wistfully from the gun deck he would have gone with the boats like a shot he smiled to himself no wonder the seamen called him the tiger then he climbed down into the gig no ceremony this time as the boats shoved away from the side he was conscious of sudden tension take the lead allday he watched the rocky cliffs rising higher and higher with each pull of the oars and could feel the strong undertow as the inshore swell frothed and mounted into seething lines of breakers when he glanced astern he saw the cutters stem lifting and plunging through the flashing spray davys head and shoulders swaying above the oarsmen while he too peered at the land what was he thinking about being killed in this godforsaken place taking a step nearer that badly needed prizemoney bolitho wiped the spray from his face and concentrated on the swift approach there was more chance of being drowned than of anything in the immediate future he glanced at allday who was standing in a half crouch one fist gripping the tillerbar as he peered from bow to bow gauging the set of the angry surf the diagonal lines of breakers as they hurried noisily into the shadows below the cliffs no need to warn him any suggestion at all might have the opposite effect and bring disaster allday remarked very steep beach captain his sturdy figure swayed with the hull go in fast put her bow round at the last moment twards the surf and beach her broadsideto he glanced down at him quickly does that sound fair captain bolitho smiled very fair it would also give them time to scramble ashore and help the cutter as she followed them in he felt a sudden chill and realised that the shadows had finally reached out to cover them and he heard the slap of water the creak of oars in rowlocks echoing back from the cliffs as if there was a third and invisible boat nearby they almost planed across the last of the surf the oars desperately keeping with the stroke until allday yelled now and as he slammed the tiller hard round he added backwater to larboard floundering and tilting dangerously the gig came to the beach almost broadside the keel grinding across loose pebbles and weed in a violent protesting shudder but men were already leaping into the spray holding the gunwale guiding the gig to safety with sheer brutestrength clear the boat allday steadied bolithos arm as with armitage and the others he waded reeled and finally walked on to firm beach bolitho ran to the foot of the cliffs leaving allday to supervise the business of getting the gig safely secured he waved his arm towards the three marines spread out see if you can find a way to the top v this they understood and with barely a glance towards the onrushing cutter they loped up the first crumbling rockslide their muskets primed and held ready bolitho waited staring up at the jagged clifftop the pale blue sky above no heads peering down no sudden fusilade of musket balls he breathed moreevenly and turned to watch the cutter as it edged round and plunged wildly before driving on to the beach and amongst the waiting seamen davy staggered towards him gasping for breath but loading his pistol with remarkably steady fingers bolitho said muster the men and send your three marines after the others he looked for armitage but he was nowhere to be seen in gods name davy grinned as the midshipman came round a large boulder buttoning his breeches bolitho said harshly if you must relieve yourself at such times mr armitage i would be obliged if you would remain in sight armitage hung his head ssorry sir bolitho relented it would be safer for you and i will try and hide any embarrassment you might cause me allday crunched over the loose shingle chuckling as he too loaded a brace of pistols with fresh dry powder bless me mr armitage but i can understand how you feel p the youth stared at him unhappily you can why once i was hiding in a loft he winked at the cutters coxswain from the bloody pressgang believe it or not and all i could think of was pumping my bilges bolitho said to davy that seems to have helped his mind a little he forgot armitages troubles and said well leave four hands with the boats he saw undine swaying like a beautiful model her sterq windows flashing in the sunlight and imagined herrick watch ing their progress he could send aid to the beached boats i f trouble arrived he looked up at the cliffs again damp clammy deceptively cool that would change as soon as they reached the top and the waiting sun bolitho waited for davy to rejoin him best be moving off he examined his landing party carefully as allday waved them towards the cliffs thirty in all apart from davy anti armitage he had brought a masters mate named carwithen knowing the man would have resented being left behind after fowlars previous involvements a dark unsmiling man he was like bolitho a cornishman and hailed from the fishing village of looe he waited while they checked their weapons his chain of command ship or shore it made no difference to them carwithen said i hope theyve a drop to drink when we get tother side bolitho noticed that hardly anybody smiled at his remark carwithen was known as a hard man given to physical vio lence if challenged good at his work according to the master but little beyond it how different from fowlar bolithc thought lead your party to the left mr davy but allow the marine to set the pace he looked at armitage you keep with me he saw a marine waving from a high ledge indicating tht path up the first section of cliff it was strange how sailors always hated the actual moment of leaving the sea behind like having a line attached to your belt dragging you back bolitho eased the sword further around his hip and reached out for the nearest handhold smoothed away by timeless weather stained with dropping from a million seabirds no wonder ships avoided the place as he moved carefully up the fallen boulders he felt a small pressure against his thigh the watch she had given him ir madras he thought suddenly of that moment when she hay offered him far more and he had taken it without even smallest hesitation how soft how alive she had felt in hip arms he grimaced as his fingers slipped in a pile of fresh droppings and how quickly circumstances could change he thought grimly the passage across the small islet was to prove harder and more exhausting than anyone could have expected from the moment they topped the first cliff and the sun engulfed them in its searing glare they realised they must climb immediately into a treacherous gully before they could begin scaling the next part and so it went on until they were finally tramping across an almost circular depression which bolitho guessed was the central part of the islet it held the heat and shielded them from any seabreeze and their progress was further delayed by the clinging carpet of filth which covered the depression from side to side allday gasped will we rest up once we get to the far side captain like the others his legs and arms were caked with muck and his face masked in a fine film of dust i am as dry as a hangmans eye bolitho refrained from looking at his watch again he could tell from the suns angle that it was late afternoon it was taking too long he peered across to the other side of the unsheltered depression seeing davys straggling line of men the marine sharpshooters walking like hunters through a cloud of pale dust their muskets over their shoulders he replied yes but we must go carefully with the water ration it was like being on top of the world the curving sides of the depression hiding everything but the sun and open sky one of the long slanting shadows behind him faltered and then sprawled in the inchesdeep bird droppings and without turning he knew it was armitage he heard a seaman say hoarsely give us yer and gawd you do look a sight beggin yer pardon sir poor armitage bolitho kept his gaze fixed on the pale breeches of the marine directly ahead of him his body smoking in haze and dust there were rocks beyond the marine probably marking the end of the depression they could take a rest find brief shelter while they regained their senses he turned and sought out the seaman who had helped armitage to his feet can you raise the breath to carry a message to the scouts ahead lincoln the man bobbed his head small and wiry his face was disfigured by a terrible scar from some past battle or in a tavern brawl a surgeon had made a bad job of it and his mouth was drawn up at one side in a permanent lopsided grin aye sir the man shaded his eyes tell them to halt at those rocks he saw lincoln hurry ahead of the column his tattered trousers flapping and stirring up more choking dust it took another hour to reach those rocks and bolitho had the impression he was taking two paces backwards for every one he advanced davys party arrived amongst the tall rocks almost at the same time and while the men threw themselves down into the small patches of shade gasping and wheezing like sick animals bolitho called the lieutenant aside and said we will take a look he saw davy nod wearily his hair bleached so much that it was like corn in the sunlight they found a marine on the far side of the rocks his eyes slitted with professional interest as he stared at the gently sloping hillside which continued without a break towards the sea and there cradled inside the narrowest sweep of the islet the whales tail was the schooner she was so close inshore that for an instant longer bolitho imagined she had been driven aground in the storm then he saw the drifting smoke from a fire on the beach heard the muffled tap of hammers and guessed her crew were carrying out repairs they might even have had the schooner careened to put right some damage to her bilge or keel but at first glance she looked well enough now tiny figures moved about her deck and there were several more on the beach and scattered amongst the rocks the heaviest part of their work was apparently completed davy said theyre looking in rock pools sir after shellfish or the like bolitho asked how many dyou reckon davy frowned two dozen at a guess bolitho fell silent it was a long way down the hillside and no cover at all his own men would be seen long before they could get to grips he bit his lip wondering if the schooner intended to wait another day or longer carwithen had joined them and said hoarsely theym not ready to quit yet sir he was whispering as if the schooners crew were a few feet away theyve got their boats hauled well up the beach davy shrugged i expect they feel very safe bolitho took a small glass and trained it carefully between the rocks one false move and the sunlight would throw a reflection from the telescope which would be seen for miles a lookout there must be at least one on the shore a man so placed that he could watch over the tiny cove and see everything but the far side of the island where undine now lay at anchor he smiled grimly it was hardly surprising they had found no sentries when they had landed when he thought of their exhausting trek from the beach he stiffened seeing a small movement on a ridge almost in line with the motionless schooner he adjusted the glass very slowly a white floppy hat the darker blob of a face underneath theres a lookout on that ridge the one with the rock pools directly below it carwithen said easy from the sea no but i could take him from behind with no trouble at all he sounded brutally eager the crash of a shot made them crouch lower while from behind bolitho heard the sudden clatter of weapons as his men dived for cover something white and flapping fell from the sky and lay quite still on the beach the searching sailors from the schooner paid very little attention as one of their number walked over to it and picked it up carwithen said one of ems shot a booby they make fair eatin if youve nothin better the marine said then e must be a bloody good shot sir bolitho looked at him his own thought exactly it would make a frontal assault virtually fatal for all of them he said ill send a message back to the ship we must wait until dark to the marine he added take this glass but keep it well shielded no need to add a warning or a threat the marine had just proved he could think as well as shoot they found the others relaxed again amidst the rocks and allday said take a drink captain he held out a flask tastes like bilge water bolitho scribbled on his pad and handed it to one of the seamen take it back to the beach and give it to the petty officer there he saw the despair on his face and added gently you need not return you will have earned a rest by the time you reach undine he heard another shot muffled this time by the rocks but it was followed by a different sound a soft thud carwithen was on his feet in a second nother bird sir bolitho followed him to where they had left the marine he was staring with amazement at the big booby which had dropped almost at his feet wings outspread its breast clotted with bright blood davy said harshly now how in the name of hell did but bolitho held up his hand freezing them all to silence faintly at first and then more insistently he heard the scrape and clatter of loose stones as someone hurried up the hillside to collect the dead seabird he looked round swiftly you could not hide thirty men amongst these few rocks he saw allday signalling everyone to remain quite still saw the anxiety in armitages eyes as he stared transfixed at the last barrier where the seas edge shone against the sky and rocks like the top of a great dam the sounds were much louder and bolitho could hear the mans heavy gasps as he struggled up the last part of the hill nobody moved and he saw the marine staring at his musket which was two feet away from his fingers the slightest sound and they were done for it was then carwithen acted he was closest to the rock barrier and with barely a sound he reached out and gathered up the dead bird holding it just a few inches below the top of the nearest rock his free hand he held under his short blue coat and bolitho could see his fingers moving beneath the cloth trying to free something while all the time his eyes were fixed unblinkingly on the bird it seemed to take an eternity before anything else happened when it did it was all too fast to follow the mans dark face gaping down at them his eyes flicking from the bird to carwithen even as he groped forward to retrieve his prize the masters mate dropped the booby the movement so swift that the man was thrown off balance his hand groping at his belt and the gleaming butt of a pistol carwithen murmured not so my pretty one it was said quietly almost gently then the other hand came out of his coat a boarding axe twisting in his fingers as he brought the rearmost end with its short savage barb hard down in the mans neck with a great heave he gaffed him bodily over the rocks withdrawing the axe turning it again just as swiftly before hacking him full across the throat with its blade armitage fell against the marine whimpering and retching blood spurting over his legs as the axe jerked free hesitated and cut down again bolitho seized carwithens arm seeing the axe quivering above the bulging eyes and that great gaping wound he could feel the pentup hatred and madness in his biceps the effort to shake him away and drive the axe again and again into the choking bubbling thing at his feet easy enough damn you there was another terrible silence while they stared at each other or at the corpse which was sprawled across the dead booby carwithen whispered hoarsely that buggerll never raise hell again bolitho forced himself to examine the victim probably javanese dressed in little better than rags but the pistol was inscribed with the crest of the east india company he heard carwithen say took it off some poor sailor the bastard nobody looked at him bolitho knelt by the rocks and studied the beach with the glass carwithen had acted quickly and efficiently but he had enjoyed it relished it he watched the distant lookout in his rocky ledge the small figures still searching aimlessly amongst the pools he said quietly they saw nothing davy looked at the sobbing midshipman and asked quietlywill this change things for us sir bolitho shook his head only when this man is missed by his companions he looked at the slanting shadows from the rocks so we must bide our time and hope for darkness to come he saw carwithen wiping his boardingaxe on some cloth he had just cut from the dead mans smock his face was devoid of anything but satisfaction davy gestured to the others take this thing away and cover it with stones he swallowed hard ill not forget this day in a hurry bolitho gripped the midshipmans shoulder and pulled him away from the rocks listen mr armitage he shook him roughly seeing the youths eyes as he stared at the red smudge left by the corpse get a grip on yourself i know it was a foul thing to witness but you are not here today as a mere onlooker dyou understand he shook him again hating to see the pain and the revulsion in his eyes you are one of my officers and our people will have to look to you armitage nodded dazedly yyes sir ill try to he retched again bolitho added gently im sure you will he saw allday watching him over the midshipmans quivering shoulders the almost imperceptible shake of his head now be off with you and check that my message has been sent allday said quietly poor lad hell never get used to this sort of thing bolitho looked at him gravely did you did i allday shrugged we learned to hide what we thought captain its all a man can do perhaps he saw davy kicking dust across the drying blood then he looked at carwithens dark features as he examined the dead mans pistol although there are some who have no feelings at all and i have always found them to be less than men allday followed him back into the shade bolithos mood would soon change at a hint of action and for the present it was best to leave him to his thoughts the bristol sailmaker time to move is it sir davy watched bolitho as he craned over the rocks his shirt pale against the darkening sky i believe so tell carwithen to muster the hands he shivered as the seabreeze explored his body once the sun had dipped over the hills at his back it grew cool even cold in minutes they had been too long in the heat plagued by sun and thirst and a multitude of flies which had appeared as if by magic he watched the anchored schooners outline the soft glow of lights from poop and forepeak the fire on the beach had died to a blotch of red embers and he could see nobody near it but guessed the lookout was still in his refuge beyond the pools allday whispered all ready captain he held his cutlass clear of the rocks mr davys making sure they all know what to do bolitho nodded without answering trying to gauge the distance they must cover surprisingly it seemed greater in the growing darkness but he was reassured by the occasional snatches of voices from the vessel to show they had given no heed to their missing comrade davy slithered down beside him ive sent carwithens party away sir he looked at the sky the isolated puffs of light cloud winds steady enough yes bolitho checked his pistol and tightened his belt follow me single file like ghosts they topped the last rock barrier the sounds of loose stones and rubble seemingly very loud in the gloom but as davy had observed the wind held steady and was making a lively chop along the beach and narrow spur of headland noisy enough to drown any small sound they might be making once as they followed the curve of the hillside they all froze in their tracks as two dozing seabirds rose flapping and screaming almost from under their feet bolitho waited listening to his heart to the sharp breathing of the men at his back nothing he lifted his arm and they began to move forward and downwards again when he looked across his shoulder he saw the rough edge of the rock barrier where they had waited fretting for sunset far above his slowmoving party they were almost down to beach level now and he heard a man curse quietly as he slipped in the first of the small pools davys party were having to wade in the shallows to his right and he hoped none of them would fall headlong into one of the rock pools there now hidden by the rising tide he thought momentarily of the ship anchored on the other side of the islet the familiar sounds and smells herrick waiting anxiously for news of success or disaster if it was to be the latter he could do nothing to help this time his would be the task of contacting the enemy and making what he could of it it was easier to think of them as the enemy it never helped to picture them as men flesh and bone like himself allday touched his arm urgently boat coming inshore captain bolitho held up his hand and brought both parties to a shuffling silence the boat must have come around the schooners hidden side he could see the splash of oars the lively froth of the stem as it bounced across the first leaping surf he thought of carwithen and his handful of men who were creeping up and around the solitary lookout they should have been there by now he recalled carwithens brutal madness with the boarding axe and wondered if he had been the one to strike the luckless lookout down a voice echoed suddenly in the darkness and for an instant bolitho imagined carwithen had been delayed or that the lookout was calling an alarm but the voice came from the boat louder this time and despite the strange tongue bolitho knew the man was calling a question or a name perhaps allday said theyve come alooking for their mate captain he dropped to one knee to keep the grounding boat framed against the surf six of em bolitho said quietly stand fast lads let them come to us he heard a man clicking his jaws together tense nervous probably terrified in these unfamiliar surroundings allday said one of ems going up the cliff to the lookout bolitho drew his sword very carefully of course it would be the first place a searcher would go ask if the missing man had been seen he watched the other five strolling up the beach swinging their weapons casually chatting as they approached bolitho glanced behind him his men were barely visible as they crouched or knelt amongst fallen rocks or squatted in the sea itself he turned to study the oncoming shadows twenty yards fifteen surely one would see them soon a terrible cry tore the stillness apart hanging above the ridge long after the man had died bolitho saw the five shadows turn in confusion knew the dying scream must have been the man sent to the lookout lie yelled at em lads without a shout or a cheer they were all up and rushing after the five figures who had turned back towards the surf one of them slipped and fell headlong tried to rise but was slashed into a sobbing heap by a seamans cutlass as he dashed past the others had reached the boat but deprived of two of their strength were unable to shift it steel gleamed in the shadows and as the seamen charged amongst them the fight became confused and deadly a seaman caught his foot in the boatrope and before he could recover his balance was pinned bodily to the shingle by a long sword his killer died almost simultaneously the remaining two threw down their weapons and were instantly clubbed into unmoving heaps by the maddened sailors davy snapped tersely one of ours is dead sir he rolled the man over on to his back and dragged the cutlass from his fingers bolitho eased the sword back into its scabbard his legs felt shaky from running from nervous tension he looked at the anchored schooner no shouts no calls to arms he thought he heard the same singsong voice chanting above the seething surf remote and vaguely sad davy said hoarsely damned poor lookout sir bolitho watched his men gathering around the two boats the one which had been there all day was furthest up the shingle and would need the more men to move it he replied wouldyou have expected trouble in their place davy shrugged i suppose not carwithen came hurrying down from the ridge his helpers hard put to keep up with him he said savagely that bloody fool lincoln was too slow with his dirk he glared at the watching men around him ill see to him later bolitho said boats in the water he sought out the six marines you take the second one you know what to do one the man who had first sighted the schooner grunted we knows sir we holds the boat where we can see the poop an pin down anyone who tries to pass the lanterns there bolitho smiled captain bellairs was right about you allday whispered this way captain he felt the surf engulfing his legs and waist the boats scarred planking as allday reached down to drag him over the gunwale shove off bolitho restrained the urge to watch the frantic oars the efforts to steer the boat clear of the surf just one blast of canister would be enough to nip his flimsy plan in the bud the boat lifted and then surged heavily forward the blades taking control as the hull freed itself from the strong undertow bolitho saw the schooners tall masts rising to greet him the tracery of rigging and shrouds almost lost against the sky allday stood straddlelegged and wary the tiller bar held lightly in his fingertips easy all he craned forward as if to impress them more bowman ready astern bolitho heard the regular splash of oars as the other boat pulled hastily towards the schooners bows allday said quickly its now or never captain his teeth were bared with concentration so that some men in the forward part of the boat thought he was smiling bolitho stood up beside him and reached out to fend off the overhanging quarter as like a moving object it loomed right above the boat now there was a yell and a quick clatter as the bowman hurled his grapnelup and over the bulwark with a jerking grinding crash the boat came alongside some men falling in confusion while others climbed eagerly over their sprawled bodies and entangled oars as if using a living bridge to reach the vessels main deck figures were already dashing from the forecastle but as a man ran wildly from aft there was a muffled bang the wellaimed musket ball hurling him round like an insane dancer his agony clearly silhouetted against the poop lanterns bolitho felt rather than saw a figure coming at him from the scuppers something hissed above his head even as he ducked round and struck for his attacker with his sword the swaying figure backed and came on again and bolitho realised he was holding a huge axe swinging it from side to side as he advanced carwithen exclaimed a plague on that bastard and fired his pistol full in the mans face to bolitho he snarled thatll teach him another of the crew had climbed frantically into the foremast shrouds and was being pursued by a yelling seaman once again a musket stabbed the darkness from the other boat and with a faint cry the man fell headlong to the deck where he was promptly despatched by a waiting cutlass allday yelled most of em have gone below captain he ran to a hatchway and fired his pistol into it the fights gone out of em now im thinking bolitho peered aft at the poop lanterns call the other boat to give assistance it was suddenly very quiet on the schooners deck and as bolitho walked slowly towards the small cabin hatch just forward of the wheel he was conscious of his own footsteps and the feeling the fight was not yet over he moved warily around the outstretched corpse which had been the first to fall to a marine sharpshooter its face shining in the lantern light the lower jaw broken away as if by an axe stroke allday said stand aside captain but a seaman was already clambering over the hatch coaming his face suddenly screwing up in terrible agony as a pistol exploded beneath him a shadow darted through the pluming smoke and bolitho saw it was the scarfaced seaman called lincoln his eyes like stones as he allowed his lean body to drop straight through the hatch using his dead companion to cushion the fall his feet thudded into the corpse and as he turned he whipped a knife from between his teeth hitting out twice in the darkness the second blow bringing a scream of pain more men were swarming down after him and bolitho yelled bring a lantern drag those men clear feet pounded over the planking and he heard armitage calling anxiously from the boat alongside carwithen was already down on the cabin deck knocking a seaman aside even as he made to finish the wounded pirate with his dirk bolitho paused on the ladder searching for davy his mind still able to grapple with the realisation that allday had saved his life but for his warning he and not that poor seaman would be lying there dead mr davy hoist both boats inboard once you have secured our prisoners aye aye sir he sounded jubilant and mount a guard on them i want no fanatic opening the bilges to the sea before we can even make sail he followed allday down the ladder the seanoises suddenly muffled and lost a seaman kicked open the cabin door and darted inside with a levelled pistol nothin zur he swung round as a shadow moved beyond an upended chair belay that zur theres another rascal ere ill get im for ee then he fell back in horror by jesus zur es one of us bolitho stepped into the cabin ducking low between the deckhead beams he could appreciate the seamans shocked surprise it was a small cringing wreck of a man he was on his knees fingers interlocked as in prayer while he swayed back and forth in time to the ships motion bolitho sheathed his sword stepping between the quivering creature and his fierceeyedseaman who are you he made to move closer and the man threw himself bodily at his feet have mercy captain i done nothin sir im just an honest sailorman sir he gripped bolithos shoes and when he reached down to pull him to his feet bolitho saw with horror that every nail had been torn from his fingers allday said harshly on your feet you are speaking to a kings officerv easy bolitho held up his hand look at him he has suffered enough a seaman dropped his cutlass and lifted the man into a chair oill get im a drink capn he dragged open a cupboard and gaped as the little man screamed wildly dont touch ell flay you alive if you dare lay yet ooks on it bolitho asked who will then he seemed to realise what was happening that it was not part of another in a whole procession of living nightmares he stated at bolithos grave features tears running unheeded down his sunken cheeks mu jadi carwithen muttered what here the creature peered around bolitho his terrified eyes search ing the crowded passageway the dead seaman below the hatch there is son bolitho turned swiftly and stooped above the man brought down by lincolns knife of course he should have seen it instead of congratulating himself on being spared a horrible death the man was still alive although the seamans blade had laid open his neck and shoulder in a great gaping wound must have missed the artery by a whisker and no more he was naked to the waist but his loose trousers now blotchy with his own and the seamans blood were of the finest silk his eyes were tightly shut his chest moving in quick uneven thrusts carwithen said let me finish the bastard sir he was almost pleading bolitho ignored him the man was not aged much more than twenty and around his throat he wore a gold pendant in the form of a prancing beast like the one on muljadis flag it was just possible he snapped bind his wound i want him to live he turned to the ragged figure in the cabin my men will take care of you but first i want the figure edged nearer the door is it really over sir he was shaking violently and close to collapse its not a cruel trick allday said quietly this is captain bolitho matey of his majestys ship undine now tell us who you are the little man sank down to the deck again like a cowed dog i was sailmaker sir in the portuguese barque alvares took on in lisbon when i lost me own ship we was carryin a mixed cargo from java when we was attacked by pirates when was this bolitho spoke carefully very aware of the other mans confusion a year back sir i think he dosed his eyes with the effort we was taken to muljadis anchorage wot there was left of us muljadis men killed most of em only kept me cause i was a sailmaker i tried to escape once didnt know i was bein eld on an island ysee they caught me before id been free an hour put me to torture he was shaking more violently now all of em sat there watchin enjoyin it laughin he lurched to his feet and threw himself towards the door snatching up a cutlass as he screamed pulled out all my nails with pincers an worse the bloody bastards lincoln caught his wrist and turned the cutlass away from the unconscious figure in the passageway easy mate you could cause a mischief with that eh the mans cheerful voice seemed to steady him in some way he turned and looked at bolitho very steadily me names jonathan potter once of bristol bolitho nodded gravely well jonathan potter you can be of great service to me it will not bring back your friends but it may prevent others suffering in the same manner he glanced at allday look after him he walked from the cabin grateful for the clean air which greeted him on deck the sense of purpose as davys men prepared to get under way potter had probably been the only englishman aboard the portuguese barque for that and no other reason had his life been spared kept like a slave a downtrodden creature less than a man from what he had heard of muljadi it seemed a far more truthful reason davy crossed to his side i am about ready to weigh sir he paused sensing bolithos mood that poor devil must have suffered terribly sir he is scars and scabs from head to toe little more than bones bolitho studied his pale outline thoughtfully something kept him alive mr davy fear of death a need for revenge i know not which he grasped a stay as the deck swayed restlessly in the swell but whatever it was i intend to use it to good purpose and the schooners master sir if he is really muljadis son we have a catch indeed but either way i want him kept alive so pass the word to that effect he thought of carwithens eyes to all hands he peered abeam at the small islet where so much had happened the craggy distortions were lost in deep shadow it was a whale once again we will run to the soueast directly and gain searoom i am not yet acquainted with these waters by dawn we should be able to come about and make contact with undine he looked at the men hurrying about the schooners deck shes a fine little prize davy stared at him and then at the vessel the realisation coming to him apparently for the first time i see sir a prize he nodded happily worth a good price ill be bound bolitho walked to the opposite side i thought that might interest you mr davy he added now have the capstan manned and break out the anchor while the wind holds he thought of herrick we are no longer beggars davy shook his head not understanding then he looked at the helmsman and at the others gathering at the capstan bars and grinned broadly a prize at last perhaps the first of many noddall hovered by the cabin table and bobbed his head with satisfaction as bolitho pushed his empty plate aside more like it sir a man works the fairer on a full belly bolitho leaned back in his chair and let his eyes move slowly around the cabin it felt good to be back aboard undine and with something to show for their efforts the lantern above the table seemed much dimmer and when he glanced through the stern windows he saw that dawn had already given way to an empty sky the horizon slanting across the thick saltstained glass like a thread of gold in the captured schooner he had rejoined undine at almost the same hour as this the previous day the strain and tension of their short bitter fight lost momentarily in the cheers from the watching seamen and marines herrick had been almost beside himself with pleasure and had insisted that bolitho should go to his cabin without delay and rest the schooner had once been under the flag of the dutch east india company although it was impossible to tell how long she had been in the pirates hands but from her filthy condition and disorder between decks it seemed likely it had been a considerable while since dutch sailors had manned her he let his mind drift as he listened to bare feet padding overhead the sluice of water and the clank of a pump as the decks were washed down for another day noddall was right he had eaten a good breakfast thinly sliced fat pork fried pale brown with biscuit crumbs always his favourite helped down with strong coffee and some treacle herrick tapped on the door and entered the cabin winds holding steady from the souwest sir he looked alert and cleareyed bolitho smiled good thomas have some coffee it was always strange how herrick relaxed once there was a set plan to perform if he really guessed how hazy it was in his captains mind he gave no sign mr mudge informs me that we are logging some ten knots sir herrick took a mug from the servant and grinned hes up there beaming away as if hes just won a fortune at the tables bolitho frowned that means we should make a landfall at any time now if yesterdays wind had been more than a snails pace we could have been there now he spread his arms feeling the touch of a clean shirt against his chest and back but there was plenty to do herrick smiled mr davys well on his way to pendang bay by now bolitho replied aye hell be feeling like a postcaptain if im not mistaken when he had put davy in charge of the schooner and had sent him back to conway he had seen his face come alight as if from within he must have looked like that himself once he thought he had been put in charge of a prize when he had been a lieutenant far younger than davy the first step to real command was said to be the greatest so perhaps it would work for davy too he looked up at the open skylight as a voice pealed deck there land on the lee bow bolitho smiled feeling the chill on his spine if the argus is elsewhere i will have to think again the door opened slightly and midshipman armitage reported mr soamess respects sir masthead has sighted land on the lee bow bolitho said thank you mr armitage he saw the deep hollows around his eyes the nervous way his fingers twitched against his patched breeches unlike any of the others who had returned he was unable to hide his real feelings his fear his knowledge that he could no longer contain it my compliments to mr soames tell him we will exercise both watches at gun drill in half an hour he hesitated and added if there is anything troubling you it would be as well to confide in the first lieutenant here or myself if you feel it might help armitage shook his head nno sir i am better now he hurried away bolitho looked at his friend and asked quietly what are we to do about that one herrick shrugged you cannot carry them all sir he may get over it weve all had to go through it at one time or another now then thomas that does not sound like you at all he smiled broadly admit you are concerned for the lad herrick looked embarrassed well i was thinking of having a word with him i thought as much thomas you havent the right face for deceit another knock at the door announced the surgeon had arrived well mr whitmarsh bolitho watched him framed in the doorway the early sunlight from the cabinn hatch making a halo around his huge head is our prisoner worse whitmarsh moved through the cabin like a man in a prison ducking under each beam as if seeking a way of escape he is well enough sir but i still believe as i told you when you returned to the ship that he should have been sent back to the settlement in the schooner bolitho saw herricks jaw tighten and knew he was about to silence the surgeons aggressive outburst like the other officers herrick found it hard to cover his dislike for him whitmarsh was little help in the matter either bolitho said calmly i cannot answer for a prisoner if he is there and we are here surely he watched the beads of sweat trickling down the mans forehead and wondered if he had taken a drink this early it was a wonder it had not killed him already above his head he heard the regular stamp of boots the click of metal as the marines mustered for morning inspection he made himself say you must trust my judgement mr whitmarsh as i do yours in your own profession the surgeon turned and glared at him you are admitting that if youd sent him back to pendang bay he would have been seized and hanged herrick retorted angrily damn your eyes man the fellow is a bloody pirate whitmarsh eyes him fiercely in your opinion no doubt bolitho stood up sharply and walked to the windows you must live in reality mr whitmarsh as a common pirate he would be tried and hanged as well you know but if he is the son of muljadi he is something more than a catspaw he could be used to bargain there is more at stake here more lives in peril than i feared ill not falter because of your personal feelings whitmarsh seized the edge of the table his body hanging over it like a figurehead if youd suffered as i have bolitho turned on him his voice harsh i know about your brother and i am deeply sorry for him but how many felons and murderers have you seen hanging rotting in chains without even a thought he heard someone pause beside the open skylight and lowered his voice humanity i admire hypocrisy i totally reject he saw the fury giving way to pain on the surgeons flushed features so take care of the prisoner if he is to be hanged then so be it but if i can use his life to advantage and in doing so save it then amen to that whitmarsh moved vaguely towards the door and then said thickly and that man potter you brought from the schooner sir you have put him to work already bolitho smiled really mr whitmarsh you do not give up easily potter is with the sailmaker as his assistant he will not be worked to death and i think that keeping busy will be a quicker cure than brooding over his recent sufferings whitmarsh stalked from the cabin muttering under his breath herrick exclaimed what impertinence in your shoes id have laid about him with a belayingpin i doubt that bolitho shook the coffee pot but it was empty but i feel that ill never win his confidence let alone his trust bolitho waited for noddall to bring his dress coat and best cockedhat feeling rather ridiculous as the servant fussed and tugged at cuffs and lapels herrick said bluntly i think its a bad risk sir one ill have to take thomas he saw noddall pull a long strand of hair from one of the buttons her hair he wondered if herrick had noticed he continued we have to trust the french captain all the rest is so much supposition noddall had taken the old sword from its rack on the bulkhead but held it across his arm knowing by now it was more than his life was worth to usurp alldays ritual bolitho thought of whitmarshs anger and knew that much of it had good foundation had the prisoner been sent back in the schooner he would doubtlessly have been taken by puigserver if he was still at the settlement or held in irons until he could be sent to the nearest spanish authority then if he was lucky he would certainly be hanged if not his fate hardly bore thinking about like father like son as it was the schooners surviving crewmen a savagelooking collection of halfcastes javanese and indians would meet a swift fate before much longer how many lives had they taken he wondered how many ships plundered crews murdered or broken into husks like potter the bristol sailmaker the bargain was probably onesided he walked from the cabin still pondering the rights and wrongs of instant justice on deck it was remaining fresh the days heat yet to come and he took a few paces along the weather side while there was still time in the heavy dress coat he would be dripping unless he held to the sails curved shadows fowlar touched his forehead and said awkwardly may i thank you sir bolitho smiled you have earned it mr fowlar have no fear he had made the masters mate an actinglieutenant to fill the gap left by davy had young keen been aboard it would have been his chance another would be put in fowlars place and so it went on as in all ships herrick took fowlar aside and waited until bolitho was pacing again a word of warning never interrupt the captain when he is taking his walks he smiled at fowlars uncertainty unless in real emergency of course which does not include your promotion he touched his shirt but congratulations all the same bolitho had already forgotten them he had seen the dark smudge of land which just topped the glittering horizon and was wondering what he might find there it looked at this distance like one great spread of land but he knew it consisted of a crowded collection of islets some even smaller than the one where they had captured davys schooner the dutch had originally occupied them because of their shape and position ships anchored amidst the surrounding islets would have the advantage of using any wind to put to sea the use of several channels to avoid delay the fortress had been built to protect the place from marauders such as the one who now commanded it and challenged all authority and every flag the dutch still listed the benuas as one of their possessions but it was in name only and they were no doubt glad to be rid of it and its unhappy history he saw the sailmaker speaking with potter below the forecastle and wondered if he would ever really recover from his suffering it could not be easy for him to be drawing so near to muljadis stronghold again but of all the people aboard he was the only man apart from the prisoner who had seen what lay beyond the protective reefs and sandbars where he had endured so much he shivered slightly in spite of his heavy coat suppose he had misjudged his opponents he too might become another potter a pitiful broken thing which even his friends and his sisters in england might wish to think of as dead and viola raymond how long would she take to forget him he shook himself out of his mood and said mr soames you may beat to quarters and clear for action now he saw the ripple of excitement run through the men on the gun deck exercise the larboard battery first allday walked up the slanting deck and turned the sword over in his hands before buckling it to bolithos belt youll be taking me of course captain he spoke calmly but bolitho saw the anxiety in his eyes not this time calls shrilled along the berth deck and the marine drummer boys ran breathlessly to the quarterdeck rail pulling their sticks from their white crossbelts to begin their urgent tattoo allday said stubbornly but youll be needing me captain yes bolitho looked at him gravely i will always do that the rest of his words were lost in the rattle of drums the stampede of feet as the undines people ran to quarters once again face to face bolitho levelled his telescope across the hammock nettings and studied the overlapping islets in silence all morning and into the forenoon watch while undine had cruised steadily towards them he had noted each unusual feature and had compared his findings with what he already knew the main channel through the islets opened to the south and almost in the centre of the approach was one stark hump of rock upon which stood the old stone fortress even now with the nearest spurs of land less than two miles distant it was impossible to see where the fortress began or the craggy hilltop ended we will alter course again mr herrick he lowered the glass and dabbed his eye with his wrist steer east noreast he saw the men by the larboard twelvepounders peering through their open ports the guns already shimmering in the sunlight as if they had just been fired herrick shouted hands to the braces alter course two points to larboard mr mudge bolitho sought out the frail figure of potter amongst the unemployed hands below the forecastle and when he glanced up beckoned him aft he slipped out of his heavy coat and handed it with his hat to allday saying as calmly as he could i will go aloft myself allday said nothing he knew bolitho well enough to understand what it was costing him potter hurried on to the quarterdeck and knuckled his forehead sir dyou think you could climb to the maintop with me potter stared at him dully if you says so sir herrick called east noteast sir he looked from bolitho to the mainyard stretching athwartships and vibrating to the great press of canvas below it bolitho unbuckled his sword and gave it to allday i may need your eyes today potter feeling every man watching him he swung out on to the weather shrouds and began to climb his fingers locking so tightly around each ratline that the pain helped to steady him up and up with his gaze fixed on the futtock shrouds which leaned out and around the sturdy maintop where two marines were studying his progress with unblinking curiosity bolitho gritted his teeth and fought the urge to look down it was infuriating unfair he had first gone to sea at the age of twelve year by year he had studied and matured had replaced his childs infatuation for the navy with a genuine understanding which had amounted almost to love he had overcome seasickness and had learned to hide his loneliness and grief from his companions when his mother had died while he had been at sea so too his father was buried while bolitho had been fighting frenchman and american in and around the caribbean he had watched men suffer horribly in battle and his body bore enough scars to show the narrow margin between his own survival and death why then should he be cursed with this hatred of heights he felt his shoes scrabbling on the ratlines as he hauled himself out and around the futtock shrouds his body hanging in space and supported only by fingers and toes a marine said admiringly by god sir that was a fair climb bolitho arrived beside him his chest heaving painfully he watched the marine to see if he was disguising his sarcasm but saw it was the same sharpshooter who had discovered the anchored schooner just two days back he nodded and allowed himself a glance at the ship far below foreshortened bodies moved about the quarterdeck and when he looked forward he saw the leadsman in the chains the blur of his arm as he hurled the heavy weight deftly beyond the bows he relaxed and waited for potter to scramble up beside him for a moment longer he toyed with the idea of forcing himself up the next length of quivering shrouds to the maintopsail yard but rejected it apart from proving something to himself or showing his capability to those who might be watching from below it would serve for little potter was exhausted by the climb and if herrick needed him urgently on deck he would look even more foolish if he fell headlong from his perch he unslung the telescope from his shoulder and trained it on the channel between the islets in the time it had taken him to climb from the deck and regain his wind undine had cruised over a cable and it was possible to see the next overlapping islet behind the central hill with its forbidding fortress and steep sunbaked cliff potter said i never bin to the eastrd side sir theres a good channel there too im told he shuddered they used to bury the corpses in the sandbars at low water what there was left of em bolitho stiffened and momentarily forgot the deck far beneath him he saw the blacker silhouette of a ships masts and yards almost hidden around the curve of the inner channel a frigate potter saw his interest and added dolefully best place to anchor sir the battery on the fortress can protect two channels at once an any craft wot chooses to lay there something pale flapped and broadened against the furthest islet a small boat hoisting its sail bolitho glanced quickly at the foretopmast where herrick had run up a big white flag one way or another they would soon know there was a hollow boom and after what seemed like an age a tall waterspout shot skywards about a cable off the larboard beam he trained the glass quickly towards the fortress but the smoke had already fanned away so it was impossible to gauge the angle of the shot he shifted the glass again and saw the boat moving more quickly around a litter of broken rocks the sail braced back like the fin of a great shark he let out a long breath as he saw a white flag flapping from her masthead his request to parley was accepted the single shot from the battery was a warning bolitho slung the telescope across his shoulder you stay here potter keep an eye on everything and try to remember any item which might be of use it could well save lives one day he nodded casually to the twomarine marksmen i hope youll not be needed he slung a leg over the low barricade and tried not to lower his eyes argus intends us to do all the sweating the men grinned and nudged each other as if he had just given them access to some priceless and vital information bolitho swallowed hard and began to make the journey to the deck when he reached the point where he could see the nettings on the opposite side again he allowed himself to look at the group which awaited him by the bulwark herrick was smiling although whether from relief or amusement it was hard to tell bolitho jumped down to the deck and glanced ruefully at his fresh shirt it was dripping with sweat and bore a black streak of tar across one shoulder he said never mind the coat will hide that in a brisker tone he added a boat is coming out mr herrick heaveto if you please and prepare to anchor he glanced up at the great yards again it had not been quite so bad as he had imagined that time then he thought of the ideal conditions as compared with a screaming gale or making the same climb in pitch darkness and changed his mind bolitho allowed herrick to shout his orders before asking mudge what did you make of that shot the master regarded him dubiously old gun id say sir from where i was standin it sounded like a bronze piece bolitho nodded as i thought too it would be likely that theyd still have the original cannon he rubbed his chin thinking aloud so theyd be loath to use heated shot for fear of splitting them he grinned at mudges mournful expression not that it matters much i daresay if they fired solid rock they could scarcely fail to hit a ship trying to force the channel fowlar shouted the boat has an officer aboard sir he grinned most o the hands are the colour of coffee but hes a frog if ever i saw one bolitho took a glass and watched the oncoming boat locally built with the familiar high prow and lateen sail it was moving fast and well on a converging tack he saw the officer in question standing easily below the mast his cocked hat pulled down over his forehead to shade his eyes from the fierce glare fowlar was right there was no mistaking this one he made himself walk a few paces away from the side as with her courses brailed up and her topsails in booming confusion undine turned noisily into the wind to await her visitors bolitho gripped the rail and watched in silence as the boat surged round and under the main chains where some of undines seamen and mr shellabeer waited to secure her lines and if necessary fend off any risk of collision he said and now mr herrick we shall see he walked along the swaying gangway to the entry port and waited for the officer to scramble aboard he stood quite alone framed against the cruising ranks of small whitecaps his eyes exploring undines gun deck the watching seamen and marines above and below him seeing bolitho he removed his hat with a flourish and gave a small bow lieutenant maurin msieu at your service he bore no marks of rank and his blue coat showed plenty of evidence of patching and repairs he was tanned to the shade of old leather and his eyes were those of a man who had been at sea for most of his life tough selfassured competent it was all there on his face bolitho decided bolitho nodded and i am captain bolitho of his majestys ship undine the lieutenant gave a wry smile my capitaine as been expecting you bolitho glanced briefly at the cockade on maurins hat it bore the small red beast instead of a french insignia he asked and what is your nationality lieutenant the man shrugged i am employed in the service of prince muljadi he shrugged again naturally bolitho gave a wry smile naturally he added sharply i wish to meet your captain and without delay i have certain matters to discuss but of course msieu the lieutenant was looking at the men on deck his eyes were always moving calculating he continued capitaine le chaumareys is prepared forme to remain aboard as ostage to ensure your er good ealth bolitho hid his relief had le chaumareys been killed or replaced he might have had to alter his tactics he said calmly it will not be necessary i have every faith in your captains honour herrick exclaimed but sir you cannot mean it keep him i say your life is too valuable to risk on a frenchmans word bolitho looked at him and smiled if le chaumareys is the callous brute you describe do you imagine he would care about losing a lieutenant if it were to gain him a better bargaining point he touched his arm i have made some notes in my cabin they may help you to pass the time in my absence he touched his hat to the quarterdeck and said to maurin i am ready for a moment longer he stood in the port looking down into the boat alongside there were about a dozen men aboard naked but for a few scraps of rags but armed to the teeth and with the looks of men prepared to kill without question maurin said quietly you will be safe with me msieu he lowered himself swiftly on to the boats gunwale adding for the moment bolitho jumped the last few feet and steadied himself against a crude backstay very conscious of the acrid stench of sweat and filth which floated unheeded in the bilges you choose strange allies lieutenant maurin signalled for the boat to be cast off one hand resting casually on his pistol lie with a dog and you arise with fleas msieu it is quite common bolitho glanced at his profile another herrick perhaps then as the sail billowed and cracked to the wind and the slim hull began to gather way he forgot maurin even the anxious faces on undines quarterdeck as he considered what he was about to do bolitho clung to the backstay as the boat scudded dangerously close to a line of blacktoothed rocks and then went about to enter the main channel he noticed that the current was strong and at odds with the incoming sea and felt the hull leap and stagger as it straightened up for the final leg of the ourney when he looked astern he could see nothing of his own ship she was already hidden by a wedge of land the side of which lay deep in shadow maurin asked suddenly why dyou take such risks msieu bolitho looked at him impassively why do you maurin shrugged i obey orders but soon i will be going ome again to toulon i ave not seen my family for he smiled sadly too long bolitho glanced across the lieutenants shoulder and studied the grim fortress which was slipping past the port beam it was still difficult to see the extent of its buildings a high wall undulating with the edge of the clifftop the spaced windows were little more than black slits like mournful eyes while above on the weatherworn battlements he could see the muzzles of several large guns just visible through their individual embrasures maurin said a foul place is it not but they are not like us they live like crabs in the rocks he sounded contemptuous bolitho saw several small boats bobbing at anchor and a schooner similar to the one they had captured moored to a stone pier maurin did not try to stop him looking at everything to prevent his interest in the many figures which moved about the pier and up the sloping track to the fortress gates bolitho decided he was being brought by the main channel by careful design so that he should see the growing strength of muljadis private army and it was impressive to think that a pirate an alien to the indies could muster this force and instil such discipline was enough to impress anyone even a pompous fool like major jardine he turned as the boats crew began to shorten sail and saw the anchored frigate lying directly across the bows close to in a confined space she seemed even larger far bigger than undine even his last command would have been reckless to match her deadly broadside of eighteenpounders he remarked a fine ship maurin nodded the best we ave been together for so long we even think alike bolitho saw the activity around the entry port the gleam of sunlight on fixed bayonets where a guard awaited his arrival a very carefully staged performance he thought he noticed that boarding nets were furled along the gangways where they could be spread without delay fear of a cuttingout attack more likely he was taking no chances with his new ally it was the only promising thing bolitho had seen so far a small fishing dory drifted abeam and he saw some natives standing in it shaking their fists at him and baring their teeth like wild beasts maurin said simply they probably think you are a prisoner eh it seemed to depress him bolitho pushed him from his thoughts as the boat swung heavily towards the frigates main chains capitaine paul le chaumareys a man about whom many tales had been told battles won convoys harried and settlements destroyed his record in the war had been formidable just as conway had described but as an individual he was a mystery mostly because he had spent much of his service far away from his own beloved france he ran his eyes the full length of the ships side argus the hundredeyed messenger of hera very appropriate for a man as elusive as le chaumareys he thought sturdily built and showing the scars and blemishes of hard service she was a ship he would have been proud to command she lacked undines grace but had a heavier toughness which could not be ignored the boat had made fast to the chains and the crew stood grouped by the mast as bolitho climbed up to the gunwale nobody attempted to assist him then a young seaman jumped down from the chains and held out his hand msieu he grinned broadly a votre service bolitho seized his wrist and levered himself towards the entry port the french seaman could have been one of his own he removed his hat to the broad quarterdeck and waited while the calls shrilled a salute and a guard presented muskets not crisply like bellairs marines would have done but with a familiar jauntiness of long practice like the upper deck itself he thought not dirty but not gleaming and in perfect order either well used ready for anything ah capitaine le chaumareys stepped forward to greet him his eyes fixed on bolithos face he was quite unlike anyone he had expected older a good deal so perhaps in his middle forties and one of the largest men he had ever met taller than six feet with shoulders so broad that his bared head seemed tiny by comparison especially as he wore his hair very short like a convict i welcome you to my ship he waved his hand around the deck to my world as it has been for so long he smiled the effect lighting up his face in an instant so come below to the cabinhe nodded to maurin i will call for you when it is time bolitho followed him to the cabin hatch seeing the eyes watching from both deck and gangways the way they studied his every move as if to discover something le chaumareys said casually i hope maurin took good care of you very thank you his english is excellent yes one of the reasons i chose him for my ship he is married to an englishwoman he chuckled you of course are not married so why not a french bride for you eh he threw open the door and watched bolithos reactions the cabin was large and well furnished and like the rest of the ship vaguely untidy lived in but bolithos attention was immediately drawn to a table which was laden with food le chaumareys remarked much of it is locally obtained he jabbed a large joint with his finger like this it is very much the same as smoked ham you must eat your fill while you can eh he chuckled the sound rising from what bolitho now saw to be a large belly he replied i am here to present the other captain wagged a finger you are aboard a french ship msieu first we drink he shouted a brief command and a servant hurried from the adjoining cabin with a tall crystal jug of wine it was extremely good as cool as spring water bolitho glanced from the jug to the table genuine or was it one more trick to show they were superior even in their supplies and comforts a chair was brought for him and when he was seated le chaumareys seemed to relax he said i have heard of you bolitho you had a fine record in the war for one so junior his eyes did not flicker as he added it was difficult for you the unfortunate affair of your brother bolitho watched him calmly le chaumareys was a man he could understand like a duellist relaxed one moment making a thrust the next he said thank you for your concern the small head bobbed back and forth you should have been in these waters during the war independence an ability to work beyond the reach of some admiral eh i think it would have fitted you well bolitho felt the servant refilling his glass i have come to speak with muljadi he tightened his grip on the glass it had come out just like that as if the words had been lying in his mind for months instead of seconds le chaumareys stared at him with amazement are you insane he would have you screaming for death in a moment and i could not help you no msieu it would be a lunatic thing even to think of bolitho said then i will return to my ship but what of your admiral conway his despatches is there nothing from him for me it would be pointless now bolitho watched him warily besides which you are not here as a french captain but as a subordinate to muljadis authority le chaumareys took a deep swallow from his glass his eyes slitted against the reflected sunlight from the windows he said abruptly listen to me curb your impatience as i have had to do when i was your age eh he looked around the cabin i have my instructions i obey them as you must yours but i have served france well and i am near finished in the indies perhaps i made my services too valuable to be allowed home earlier but that is as may be i know these seas like my own face during the war i had to live off the islands for food and shelter for repairs and to glean intelligence about your patrols and convoys when i was told to continue in these same waters i resented it but i suppose i was flattered also i am still needed eh not like many who fought so bravely and are now without bread he looked at bolitho sharply and added as in your country too no doubt bolitho replied yes it is much the same le chaumareys smiled well then my impetuous friend we must not fight again we are too much the same needed one minute expendable the next bolitho said coldly many have died because of your actions but for our arrival at pendang bay all the garrison would have i been killed and you must know it a spanish frigate was des troyed to delay our arrival to allow this prince muljadi to give his piracy some sort of repute to make him an ally of france and a constant threat to peace le chaumareys eyes widened well said but i had no part in nervions destruction he held up one large fist of course i heard about it i hear many things i do not like that is why i brought the spanish commandant here to parley for his garrisons safety he was still the representative of his own king he could agree to terms which but for your intervention would have given muljadi certain rights in pendang bay he became very grave i did not know an attack would be launched the very moment i had left the bay you have my word as a french officer and i accept it bolitho tried to remain calm but could feel the blood tingling in his veins like ice water it was exactly as he had imagined a set calculated plan which had begun perhaps in europe in paris and london even madrid and which had almost worked but for his decision to take undine and the nervions few survivors to their destination and puigservers arrival in pendang bay the matter would be settled and le chaumareys probably on his way home at last his work done and done well he heard himself say i have come to take the commandant back to his own kind don luis puigserver the king of spains representative will be expecting his return he hardened his tone is colonel pastor still alive or is his death another thing you know of but did not approve le chaumareys stood up and moved heavily to the quarter window he is here a prisoner of muljadis in that ruin on the hill he will never allow you to take him dead or alive his presence can still give legality to his demands can show that england is unable to honour her word and protect the rights and citizens of spain a hard story to believe but time and distance can make truth a mockery then why would muljadi fear to see me bolitho watched him as he moved away from the window his face lined and grim id have thought he would have been eager to throw his power in my face le chaumareys walked across the cabin the deck creaking under his corpulent frame he halted by bolithos chair and looked directly into his eyes it is i who fear foryou bolitho out here in my argus i am muljadis arm his reach to him i am not merely a sea captain but a symbol a man who can spring his plans into reality but beyond these timbers i cannot answer for your security and that is the truth he hesitated his eyes still on bolithos face but i see i am wasting time you are determined no bolitho smiled gravely yes le chaumareys added i have met many englishmen in war and peace some i liked many i hated few did i respect he held out his hand you i admire he smiled sadly a fool but a brave one that i can admire he rang a bell and then gestured to the table and you eat nothing bolitho reached for his hat if what you say is true then it would be wasted eh he smiled despite his tumbling thoughts and if not i will have to content myself with salt pork in the future a tall lankhaired officer entered the cabin and le chaumareys spoke to him swiftly in french then he picked up his own hat and said my senior lieutenant bolitho i have changed my mind i am coming with you he shrugged curiosity or to prove my original beliefs i know not which but without me you are a dead man when they reached the quarterdeck bolitho saw there was a boat already alongside and that the gangways were filled with silent spectators having a good look he thought grimly a oneway journey if he had miscalculated le chaumareys held his arm listen to me i am older and i expect wiser than you i can have you taken back to your ship you will suffer no disgrace in a year all this will be forgotten leave politics to those who daily dirty their hands without remorse bolitho shook his head in my position would you he forced a smile your face tells me what i need to know le chaumareys nodded to his watching officers and then led the way to the entry port bolitho glanced quickly along the gun deck noting the fresh repairs to timbers and cordage where undine had made her own challenge and when he had felt the battle was nearly lost it was an uncanny feeling to be walking with arguss captain more like compatriots than men who had so recently tried to destroy each other if they met again after this there could be no more truces the boat pulled steadily across swirling water towards the pier below the fortress the french seamen watching bolitho the whole time curious or merely seeing the face of an enemy le chaumareys spoke only once on the short crossing do not lose your temper with muljadi one sign and he will have you seized he is without pity and what about your position here the frenchman gave a bitter smile he needs me msieu once alongside the pier bolitho gained a new understanding of the hatred he had seen earlier with the french seamen surrounding him as an escort he was made to hurry up the steep slope towards the fortress while on all sides voices rose in shouts and curses and it was obvious that without le chaumareys massive presence even the sailors would have been set upon the lower part of the fortress was little more than an empty shell its courtyard littered with rushes and rags which the defenders and muljadis growing army of followers used for bedding he looked up at the blue sky above the ramparts and saw the guns old but powerful each with balls nearby and long ropes which trailed carelessly to the courtyard and some crude baskets which presumably were used to haul fresh powder and shot when required more rough steps the sun probing across his shoulders then sudden shadows making his body feel chilled and damp le chaumareys grunted you will wait here he led bolitho into a roughly hewn room no bigger than a cable tier and strode towards an ironstudded door at one end it was guarded by some heavily armed natives who faced the french seamen as if hoping for a fight le chaumareys seemed to sail right through them like a threedecker breaking the line of battle supreme confidence or a wellpractised bluff bolitho did not know he did not have to wait long the door was dragged open and he saw a large room a chamber which seemed to span the whole breadth of the upper fortress against the dull stone and smoky walls the dais at the far end made a fine splash of colour muijadi was arranged on a pile of silk cushions eyes fixed on the door his body completely at ease he was naked to the waist and wore only white baggy trousers and red leather boots underneath he had no hair so that in the sunlight from the slitted windows his head seemed pointed and his single ear very prominent and grotesque le chaumareys was standing to one side of the dais his face stern and alert around the walls were some of the dirtiest and cruellestlooking men bolitho had ever seen in his life although the quality of their weapons marked them as leaders or lieutenants in muljadis command he walked towards the dais half expecting one of the onlookers to rush forward and cut him down but nobody moved or spoke when he was within a few feet of the cushions muijadi said flatly that is close enough he spoke good english but with a strong accent which was probably spanish he continued before i have you killed captain is there anything you wish to say bolitho wanted to lick his parched lips he heard the rustle of expectancy behind him saw le chaumareys watching him with despair on his tanned face bolitho said on behalf of his britannic majesty king george i have come to demand the release of colonel don jose pastor subject of spain and under my countrys protection muijadi sat bolt upright the stump of his severed wrist pointing like a gun demand you insolent dog le chaumareys stepped forward hastily let me explain msieu muljadi screamed you will address me highness to bolitho he added savagely call on your god for help i will make you plead for death bolitho could feel his heart pumping against his ribs the sweat pouring down his spine and gathering around his waist like icerime deliberately he reached into his pocket and pulled out his watch as he flicked open the guard he heard muljadi leap to his feet the gasp of disbelief as he threw himself from the dais to seize bolithos wrist in a grip like a manacle he screamed into bolithos face where did you get that he jerked up his wrist and the watch upon which the prancing gold beast dangled like a fob bolitho forced himself to keep his voice level to stop his gaze from falling on the similar pendant which hung on muljadis chest from a prisoner he added sharply a pirate muljadi twisted his wrist slowly his eyes like fires as he snarled you lie and you will suffer for it now le chaumareys called in gods name do not make him kill you bolitho kept his eyes on muljadis feeling his power his hatred but something more anxiety he said if you take a telescope you will be able to see my ship you will also see there is a halter at the mainyard if i do not return before dusk your son will hang there you have my word on it i took this from his neck when i captured him and his schooner some forty miles to the southrd of where we are standing muljadis eyes seemed to be bulging right out of his head you lie bolitho eased his wrist from muljadis grasp the fingers had left marks like rope burns he said quietly i will exchange him for your prisoner he looked atle chaumareys astonished face the capitaine can arrange it i am certain muijadi ran to a window and snatched a telescope from one of his men over his shoulder he said hoarsely you will stay as a hostage bolitho replied no hostages a fair bargain you have my word as a kings officer muljadi threw the telescope to the ground shattering the lens in all directions his chest was heaving violently and his shaven head was glittering with tiny jewels of sweat kings officer do you think i care for you he spat on the stones by bolithos shoes you will suffer that i promise you le chaumareys called let it be done he hesitated highness but muljadi was almost beside himself like a madman he suddenly grasped bolithos arm and propelled him to the opposite end of the chamber and thrust him against the window look down there captain he was spitting out each word like a pistol ball i will give you your colonel but it is too late to save you now bolitho stared down at the glittering water which snaked around and amongst the next cluster of islets anchored in a bend of the channel her decks alive with hurrying figures was a frigate he felt muljadis hatred turning to aa wild jubilation as he shouted mine all mine well my kings officer are you still so confident le chaumareys said harshly why did you have to do muljadi whirled round on him his eyes wild do you think i have to be told what to do that i am a child i have waited long enough the waiting is over now a door grated open and bolitho saw the spanish command ant supported on either side by an armed pirate his eyes blinking in the light as if he was almost blind bolitho strode past muljadi and his men i have come to take you home senor he saw the filth on his torn clothing the shackle marks on his thin wrists it was a brave thing you did the old man peered blearily at him his beard quivering as he said jerkily i do not understand le chaumareys said come now under his breath he added or i will not answer for your safety it was like a dream down the sloping track to the pier and into the boat and for most of the way pursued by muljadis voice which had lapsed into another language although the threat was no less evident bolitho said coldly the frigate she was english le chaumareys nodded wearily yes damaged in battle in she was beached near here and her company removed by another vessel we have been working on her for two years almost putting her to rights i was ordered to hand her to muljadi ready for use before i am allowed to return home bolitho did not look at him he was supporting the spanish commandant against his knees feeling his sobs and his misery then i hope you are proud of your work msieu and what it may mean when muljadi puts her to work the french frigates yards loomed above the boat and bolitho followed the other captain up to the entry port le chaumareys said abruptly maurin will attend to the transfer he looked searchingly at bolitho for several seconds you are still young one day you might have understood now that is past he thrust out his hand when we meet again as i fear we must it will be for the last time he turned on his heel and strode to the cabin hatch bolitho pulled out his watch and examined the gold pendant if he had been mistaken or potter had given him wrong information he stopped his train of thought there and then it did not bear even conjecture then he thought of the captured frigate but for muljadis flare of anger he would never have known of it the knowledge was little help but it was better than nothing he decided maurin said cheerfully i will take a boat away to your ship msieu they will be surprised to learn of your safety as i am bolitho smiled i was well protected thank you he glanced at the cabin hatch but was uncertain what he meant no better no worse than most bolitho walked slowly along the upper rampart at the inland side of the settlement watching the steamy haze rising from the jungle the afternoon sunlight playing on the dripping leaves and fronds nearest the palisade undine had anchored shortly before noon below an empty blue sky and yet during their slow approach towards pendang bay he had seen the land dark under the weather and had almost envied the isolated downpour he sighed smelling the thick heady scents from the jungle the drowsy aromas of rotting leaves and roots hidden in deep shadow below the trees for the last two days undine had been plagued with opposing wind and when at last it had changed in their favour there had been little more than a breath to bring life to the sails he watched some redcoated sepoys working beyond the palisade and two native women approaching the gateway with heavy bundles on their heads at a glance it seemed nothing had changed but now as he waited to confront conway for the second time within the hour he knew everything was different he continued his walk to the next corner of the crude timber rampart and saw undine riding easily to her cable the captured schooner close abeam as he looked towards the shallows where he had last seen the brig rosalind when undine had set sail for muljadis stronghold it was all he could do to stop himself from cursing aloud like the transport bedford she had gone back to madras to carry despatches and raymonds own appreciation of the situation to sir montagu strang bolitho had been shocked by conways appearance when he had reported ashore within thirty minutes of dropping anchor wildeyed more shrunken than ever he had been almost beside himself with anger and despair he had shouted you dare to stand here and tell me that you actually chose to ignore my orders that despite the importance of my instructions you made no attempt to parley with le chaumareys bolitho had stood very still his eyes on conways distorted features an empty decanter lay on the table and it was obvious he had been drinking heavily for some time i could not parley sir to do so would have been to recognise muljadi which is exactly what the french want are you telling me something i do not already know conway had gripped the table violently i ordered you to tell le chaumareys to return colonel pastor unharmed the spanish government would have raised a savage argument against england if we had allowed him to remain a prisoner and right under my nose bolitho recalled his own voice taut and flat not daring to arouse conways fury any more than it was when i found i had captured muljadis son i knew i could bargain sir there was a good chance i would succeed as it turned out we arrived in time i fear that pastor would have died in a few more days conway had screamed pastor be damned you took muljadis son and you dared to release him we could have had that bloody pirate crawling at our feet pleading for his sons life bolitho had said abruptly there was a frigate lost in these waters during the last months of the war conway had been taken off guard yes yes the imogene captain balfour he had squinted against the suns glare from a window twentyeight guns had been in battle with the french and then got caught by a gale drove aground and her people were taken off by one of my sloops what the hell does she have to do with it everything sir but for my meeting with muljadi i would never have known until we were totally unprepared the frigate the imogene is there sir in the benuas and from what i saw about ready to weigh anchor conway had lurched against the table as if bolitho had actually struck him if this is some trick some ruse to deter my she is there sir refitted and repaired and i have no doubt well trained by le chaumareys officers he could not conceal his bitterness i had hoped the brig would still be here you could have sent word demanded help there is no choice in the matter now the next part had been the worst conway walking unsteadily to the sideboard and fumbling with another decanter and muttering betrayed right from the start raymond insisted on sending the brig to madras shes a company vessel and i could hold her no longer he had all the arguments all the answers too claret had slopped over his shirt like blood as he had shouted and me nothing but a catspaw a tool for strang and his friends to use as they please he had smashed a goblet with the decanter and groped hurriedly for another adding and now you the one man i trusted tells me that muljadi is ready to attack my settlement not merely content with showing me to be incompetent raymond will now tell his damned superiors that i cannot even hold this territory under the british flag the door had opened noiselessly and puigserver had moved into the room he had glanced briefly at conway and had said to bolitho i stayed until your return my men have sailed in the bedford but i could not leave also without offering my gratitude for securing don pastors release you seem to make a habit of risking your life for others i trust that this time it will not go unrewarded his black eyes had moved to conway again eh admiral conway had stared at him vaguely i must think we all must the spaniard had settled in a chair his eyes still on conway i heard some of it through the door he had shrugged not spying you understand but your voice was somewhat forceful conway had made a new effort to control himself conference immediately he had fixed bolitho with a bleary stare you wait outside i must think now as he looked emptily at the small figures below the palisade bolitho could feel his returning anger a sense of urgency richard he swung round and saw her at the corner of the square tower she was well covered against the sun and wore the same widebrimmed hat as before he hurried to her and seized her hands viola i was wondering she shook her head later but listen she reached up and touched his cheek very gently her eyes suddenly sad it has been so long eleven days but they were years when the storm came i worried about you he tried to speak to break the pain in her voice but she hurried on i think james suspects he has been very strange lately probably my maid let slip something a good girl but easily flattered into words she studied him searchingly but no matter he will do nothing it is you i am concerned for she dropped her head and it is all my fault i wanted him to be something in this world mostly i suspect for my own gain i drove him too hard too fast wanting him to be the man he could never be she squeezed his hand but you know all this voices echoed below the parapet and bolitho thought he heard footsteps she said huskily james will have sent his own report to sir montagu he knows now that conway is not the man for this appointment and will use this knowledge to his own advantage but you my darling richard will be included in his report i know him so well you see to get at you to use his petty revenge he will also blameyou for the inability to destroy an ignorant pirate french aid or no he replied quietly it is worse than that muljadi has many men at his back when once he has overthrown this settlement the whole area will rise to support him they have little choice the pirates will become saviours the protectors the invaders it is not uncommon she turned her head quickly and he saw a pulse jumping in her throat listen to me richard do not become further involved you are valuable to your country and to all who look up to you do not i implore you continue to look up to those who are unfit even to lick your boots she cupped his face in her hands save your ship and yourself and damn their eyes i say he held her wrists very gently it is no longer so simple he thought of le chaumareys encouraging him to quit to get away and still retain his honour and i wish to god you had sailed in the brig muljadi has more strength now and when he comes he let his gaze move outward and down towards the anchored frigate how small she appeared in the harsh glare there is only undine between him and these walls she stared at him her eyes wide and suddenly understanding and you intend to fight all of them bolitho prised her hands away as a sepoy corporal rounded the tower and said captain bolitho sahib the governor will meet you please bolitho looked at her and said now we will see viola he tried to smile the battles not done yet he found conway seated behind the table his stained shirt covered by his heavy dress coat puigserver had not moved and raymond was standing with his back to a window his face hidden in black shadow major jardine and his secondincommand made up the conference conway said sharply i have told them bolitho word for word as you described it to me thank you sir bolitho looked at raymond knowing it would come from him you took a great deal upon yourself captain more i suspect than the governor intended yes sir but i was taught to use initiative especially when beyond the fleets apron strings he saw puigserver examining one shoe with sudden interest the fact is muljadi intends to attack this settlement it is all he can do now that he has lost his hostage and understands that we are informed of his additional frigate it has changed everything jardine said harshly if he comes my men can hold him off until help arrives when the brig reaches madras theyll soon send a force to finish this ruffian even when the navy is apparently incapable of so doing what bolitho waited watching raymonds hands on the window sill well mr raymond is the gallant major right he saw the hands take a firmer grip and added or did you suggest is your report to sir montagu strang that pendang bay is i your opinion no longer an asset jardine bared his teeth rubbish he hesitated and askectt well sir raymond sounded very calm i told the truth no ship will be sent other than transports to remove the company soldiers and their dependents jardine exploded but i can manage sir you should have told me first bolitho said you cannot manage major muljadi will have more than a thousand men when he comes his stronghold is crammed to capacity that i did see you may have been able t hold the walls until help was forthcoming from madras without it your only chance is a forced march through dens jungle to the eastrd to contact the dutch east india company base and find safety his tone hardened but through dense jungle and at this time of the year i doubt if many would survive even without attack from those who will want to impress muljadi with their loyalty raymond said thickly no blame can fall on my shoulders i reported what i knew i had no knowledge of this othei frigate he tried to recover his original calm any more that you did conway stood up very deliberately each movement aii effort of will but you could not wait mr raymond you used your authority to seek your own ends and despatched the brig even after i requested she be held here until undines return he walked to the opposite side of the room and stared un seeingly at the closeknit jungle so what can we do how best can we prepare ourselves for slaughter he turned with the speed of light and yelled well ms raymond will you explain for indeed it is beyond me major jardine stammered surelyit cannot be that hopeless puigserver was watching bolitho well capiaan you have been inside the lions den not us bolitho looked at conway may i suggest something sir the admiral nodded his wispy hair in disorder if there is anything left to say bolitho walked to the table and moved the heavy silver inkwells into a pattern the benuas are much as they appear on our charts sir although i suspect some of the smaller channels between the islets are silted and shallow the fortress stands high on a central islet a rockpile if you like his fingers made a sweeping gesture down the front of one inkwell the seaward face of the islet is sheer and what i first took to be reefs at its foot i now believe are fragments of cliff which have fallen away over many years of wear he heard captain strype say gloomily that rules out any hope of a scaling attempt it is hopeless conway glared at him and then snapped continue what about this cliff bolitho looked at him calmly if we attack at once sir he ignored the gasps before muljadi is ready we might nip his whole plan in the bud conway exclaimed attack when you have just finished destroying our hopes even of staying alive the main gun battery is on the seaward rampart sir bring it down and the ships at anchor will be without immediate protection conway was rubbing his chin in quick nervous movements yes i can see that but how jardine sneered an act of god maybe the schooner sir bolitho kept his gaze fixed on conways lined forehead seeing all the doubts and apprehension gathering like a storm we could use the prevailing wind sail her straight on to the fallen rocks at the foot of the cliff filled to the deck beams with powder and a goodly fuse the explosion would i believe bring down more of the cliff he hesitated feeling the sudden tension around him and the battery captain strype was staring at the inkwell as if seeing the actual explosion it might well work sir a damn fine idea jardine growled hold your tongue what sort of fool would do such a thing anyway he fell back as conway snapped be still to bolitho he added and you think this is a reasonable risk i do the schooner would be lightly manned and her crew could get clear in their boat once the final course was laid a long fuse would allow them time enough he kept his eyes steady the moment the charge explodes i will force the channel in undine and take the anchored frigates before they can recover after an explosion like that they will not be expecting a further intrusion puigserver nodded grimly fair justice too conway glared at him it is the wildest plan i have ever discussed bolitho said quietly i must argue that point sir what conway swung on him are you questioning me again i recall a certain captain sir years back when i was a stupid midshipman he took a fair chance or so when he considered it necessary conway reached out and gripped his wrist thank you for that he looked away patting his pockets as if searching for something id forgotten bolitho said the troops will have to remain here of course he thought he saw relief on jardines heavy face resentment on his aides strange he thought that the one who appeared the weaker was the stronger after all he added if this plan fails and we must face that possibility it will be up to the sepoys to evacuate the settlement as best they can but please take my word for this no parley with muljadi for to him victory means only one thing extinction for all those who have represented his enemies throughout his entire life he pointed towards the window and once through those palisades there will be no time left for regrets conway returned to the table his face very composed i agree he glanced at jardine set your men to work transferring powder to the schooner every barrel and cask from our magazine if that is what is needed he looked at bolitho and who will command the schooner have you thought of that i am not decided sir he smiled gravely yet he turned as raymond walked around the table show ng his face at last in the sunlight raymond said i acted as i thought fit conway nodded his eyes contemptuous if we survive this affair you may yet share the advantages if there are any his tone was like ice if we fail you will probably receive the knighthood you covet so dearly he paused as raymond hurried to the door posthumously of course when he faced the table again conway seemed about ten years younger now that i am decided bolitho i cannot wait bolitho nodded he could feel his muscles and bones aching as if from physical effort and could barely realise what he had done what he had committed himself and his ship to he said i will return aboard now sir i need fresh water and fruit if there is any faces flashed across his thoughts carwithen with his axe embedded in the pirates neck davys pride at being given command of the schooner fowlars genuine pleasure with his temporary promotion and herrick most of all what would he say to this pathetic desperate plan smile shake his head accept that at last his captain had made the one fatal mistake for all of them conway was saying you are a slyboots bolitho more than i ever suspected he made as if to reach for the new decanter but changed his mind if i am to lose my head then it had better be a clear one eh puigserver was touching one of the silver inkwells with a spatulate finger when will it be capitan early bolitho watched him thoughtfully puigserver too hehadbeeninthe story from thevery beginning dawn attack conway nodded and if ever you have prayed for the wind to set fair then do it from now on bolitho smiled aye sir i will bear that in mind he made to leave but halted as the admiral added gruffly whatever the outcome we will have tried done our best when he turned towards the sunlight bolitho was shocked to see the moisture in his eyes raymond was right of course im not the man for the appointment nor do i suppose it was ever intended i should retain it once the settlement had been founded he hesitated or lost but we will show them he strode to his private door and slammed it behind him puigserverwhistled the old lion awakes eh bolitho smiled sadly if you have known him as i once did senor if you had seen the people cheering themselves hoarse with the smoke of battle still thick between decks then you would have understood perhaps puigserver grinned broadly now away with you i think you have learned a great deal since we first met about many things eh bolitho walked out past a nodding servant and then startd as someone touched his sleeve it was viola raymonds nud her face screwed up with fright as she whispered this way sir just down here bolitho followed her quickly and then saw the pale figure by a door at the far end of the passageway he asked what is it we should not meet like this she stared at him her eyes blazing you are going toet killed he just told me she threw her big hat on the floor and added angrily and i dont care i dont care what happens to you then she threw herself against him her voice breakingsn sobs as she cried its a lie i do care my darling richard ill die if anything happens to you i didnt mean to say those things he held her chin in his hand easy viola he pushed the hair from her forehead it was hot and feverish i had no choice her body shook uncontrollably and she gripped his axts even tighter oblivious to her maid and the real possibility that someone might walk into the passage at any second and no chance no chance at all bolitho held her away and waited until she was calmer i must go now and i will take care he saw her returning anguish and said quickly i must not damage my new watch now must i she tried to return his smile the tears flowing freely down her face as she said i would never forgive you he turned and walked towards the stairway and then stripped again as she called his name but she did not follow him instead she held up one hand as if he was already a long eay off beyond reach he found allday waiting by the beached gig and said sharply back to the ship allday watched him curiously theyre taking powder casks to the schooner captain is that a question he glared at him but alldays face was unmoved i was just thinking mr davys not going to be happy about this bolitho clapped his arm i know and i have no excuse for taking out my temper on you allday squinted up at the timbered fort above the palisades the white figure in one of the windows under his breath he said i know just how it feels captain bolitho twisted in the sternsheets to watch the boats busying themselves alongside the schooner it had sounded so simple so neat to take two anchored frigates in a confined space was better than matching gun for gun in open waters but many would curse his name as they died nonetheless he sighed as the gig gathered speed towards the frigate puigserver had been right he had learned a great deal since their meeting at santa cruz mostly about himself all present sir herrick seated himself beside the cabin door and waited for bolitho to speak beyond the stern windows it was very dark but it was possible to see the yellow lanterns moving back and forth between the settlement and the surf as the business of loading the schooner continued without pause bolitho looked at the faces around the cabin everyone was here he let his gaze rest briefly on midshipman keen even him although the surgeon had told him he would not be responsible for his condition keen looked strained and whenever he moved it was easy to see the pain on his mouth and eyes but he had insisted on rejoining the ship mudge and soames fowlar looking slightly selfconscious at his first important conference davy whose handsome features were still showing some of the dismay remaining from bolithos news about the schooner captain bellairs debonair and blandfaced in the gently spiralling lantern light the purser as mournful as ever armitage and penn like illmatched brothers and lastly below the skylight whitmarsh the surgeon his face glowing like a great beetroot bolitho clasped his hands behind him an average wardroom he thought no better no worse than most yet he was about to ask more of them than would be expected from a veteran company you know me well enough by now to understand that i dislike speeches making or listening to them he saw herrick grin and mudges tiny eyes vanish on either side of the great nose at the beginning of this commission there were many aboard wardroom included who thought my methods too hard my ideals too high for a ship on a peacetime mission now all of us know that things have changed and our experience our training is the only thing of value we have to protect us and more to the point those who are depending on our ability he nodded to herrick open the chart as mudge leaned forward to weigh down herricks chart with books and brass dividers he took another glance at their faces anviety trust it was too early to know he continued the schooner will sail directly into the main channel using the easterly headland for cover until the last available moment once on course for the rocks at the foot of the cliff he paused to lay the dividers on the small cross the helm will be lashed and the crew will take to the boat they will be recovered later he made himself smile although his heart felt strangely heavy after we have excised the two frigates while their people are still collecting their wits penn said well show em sir he quailed under mudges withering stare and sve bolitho smiled at the scarletfaced midshipman driven on by mr penns enthusiasm will move into the channel rake both anchored ships come about and rake em again he looked at davy so tell all gun crews to look alive the first broadsides will be the telling ones bellairs drawled bit of a chance for the schooner id say sir all that gunpowder aboard one heated ball from the battery and up she goes he blinked under bolithos level stare and added no disrespect to the bold fellows aboard her of course but where would it leave us bolitho shook his head the battery is old i am almost certain that heated shot will not be available for fear of splitting the guns normally they would not need it with such an arc of fire the battery can hit any vessel once itis within the two main channels he smiled to hide the sudden doubt which bellairs had laid in his mind suppose there was heated shot already simmering in furnaces but he would have seen them surely no baskets could hoist glowing balls to that high rampart he said and we will know that most of that battery is lying in the sea where it should have been years ago we will weigh at first light tomorrow the wind seems to be in our favour and with luck it will serve our purposes there remains just one matter he paused and saw herrick watching him from across the cabin but he must not think of his friend the best and firmest one he had ever had he was his first lieutenant the most competent officer in the ship nothing more counted it must not he continued mr herrick will command the schooner herrick nodded his face expressionless aye sir ill take six good hands should be enough bolitho held his gaze the rest of the officers fading around him as he said i will leave it to you if potter wishes to join with you then take him he saw whitmarsh rising to protest and added harshly he knows the channel we need all we can get the door opened slightly and carwithen thrust his head into the lantern light beg pardon sir but the water casks ave been stowed an a message as been sent to say that the schooner is fully loaded his gaze shifted to fowlar but there was no recognition fowlars first step to promotion had already marked them apart although it was possible they had never had much in common bolitho thought very well bolitho waited for the door to close carry on gentlemen you all have your duties to attend he faltered wondering why there were never the rightwords when you needed them most we will have little time for discussion until this matter is settled or we are all dead remember this and remember it well our people will be looking to you more than they or you ever expected most of them have never been in a real sea fight and when we last met with argus many still believed we had won a battle rather than secured a retreat this time there can be no retreat for us or the enemy le chaumareys is a fine captain probably the best ever produced by france but he has one weakness he smiled gravely one which we have not yet enjoyed that of supreme confidence in his ship and himself his belief and your skill and determination will win the day for us if anything can they stood up silent and grimfaced as if only just aware of their responsibilities the finality of their position then as they moved towards the door bolitho said a moment mr herrick alone together in the gently pitching cabin bolitho said i had no choice i would have been dismayed had you selected a junior sir herrick smiled so theres an end to it bolitho held out his hand may god protect you thomas if i have misjudged this affair or the enemy outwits us then pull back at once if i signal a recall then abandon your attempt if die we must then i want you with me herrick gripped his hand tightly his blue eyes suddenly concerned enough of this talk sir it is not like you win we must and heres my hand on it bolitho followed him towards the door hating the moment conscious of the weight which he had caused to fall on his own shoulders she had seen his danger as had le chaumareys perhaps herrick also on deck in the noise and bustle of preparing for sea the contact was at last broken herrick said ill go and pick my hands sir bolitho nodded his heart aching carry on mr herrick the second lieutenant will relieve you forthwith as herrick melted into the shadows davy crossed the quarterdeck and touched his hat bolitho said i am sorry about your schooner i seem to have little choice in anything at the moment davy shrugged it does not seem to matter any more sir for once i cannot see further than the next few days nor care either bolitho seized his arm savagely and swung him round has nothing i said to you made any sense davy struggled in his fierce grip and blurted out ii am sorry sir you will be if i hear you talking like that again your responsibility is to me the ship and the people you command not to your own personal considerations when a man starts to believe there are no more tomorrows he is as good as sewn up in a hammock between two roundshot think of the tomorrows believe in them and the men who depend on your skill or lack of it will see their own survival on your face he relaxed his hold and added in a steadier tone now be off with you he began to pace along the larboard side his feet stepping automatically over ringbolts and gun tackles although his eyes saw none of them he had not been reprimanding davy but himself it was no time for doubt or recrimination but only for living the role he had adopted had earned in a dozen battles or more boat ahoyl the challenge rang out from the gangway where lanterns glintedonlevelledmusketsand bayonets from the bay itself came the reply don luis puigserver wishes to come aboard davy came hurrying aft is that in order sir bolitho smiled calm again i was expecting him i believe the stocky figure rose through the port and hurried across the deck to greet him puigserver said i had to come capitan nervions loss made me a part of this i cannot withdraw until the matter is settled he patted the ornate pistols beneath his coat and i am an excellent shot no i could order you to leave senor but puigserver tilted his head to one side but you will not in any case i have left written word to explain my deeds and my reasons if we survive the battle i will tear it to pieces if not he left the rest unsaid then i accept your offer senor with gratitude puigserver walked to the nettings and stared across at a glittering ridinglight when will the schooner set sail before dawn she will need all the time available to work into her position to best advantage again the ache the thought of herrick sailing his floating magazine into the muzzles of muljadis battery i see puigserver yawned then i think i will join your offwatch officers for a glass in the wardroom you will need your solitude tonight i am thinking some hours later bolitho was awakened by alldays hand on his shoulder he had fallen asleep in the cabin his head on his forearm across the chart where he had been working allday watched him anxiously schooners weighed captain bolitho rubbed his eyes was it almost dawn he felt suddenly chilled desperate for sleep aliday added quietly mister pigslivers gone too bolitho stared at him wondering if he had expected this had known it was what puigserver had wanted from the moment he had outlined his plan is she well clear aye captain allday stretched and yawned stood round the headland half an hour back he added slowly hell be good company for mr herrick and thats no error bolitho looked at him you knew didnt you aye captain allday watched him sadly i thought it for the best bolitho nodded i expect it is he walked to the windows as if to see the ridinglight still twinkling above the water it is a bad thing to be alone aliday glanced at the tarnished sword which hung from the bulkhead for a moment he thought about bolithos other coxswain who had died protecting his back from french marksmen at the saintes they had come a long way together since those times he thought soon now it might all end he looked at bolithos shoulders as he peered through the stern windows but you will never be alone captain not while ive a breath left close action bolitho rested his hands on the quarterdeck rail and peered searchingly along his command in the darkness the decks and gangways made a pale outline against the sea beyond the bows and only the irregular drift of spray the swirling white arrowhead from the stem gave any true hint of their progress he restrained himself from going aft again to examine his watch by the shaded compass light nothing had changed since his last inspection and he was well aware of the danger of adding to the tension around him three days since they had left the anchorage in pendang bay making good speed with favourable winds for most of the time they had stood well clear of the land even the approaches to the little whaleshaped islet in case muljadi or le chaumareys had thought fit to place another craft there to warn of any unwelcome sail the previous evening just before sunset they had sighted herricks schooner a tiny dark sliver on the copperedged horizon seemingly motionless as she idled to await undines arrival at the arranged point of rendezvous a brief dipping signal from a lantern before both vessels had lost each other again in darkness bolitho shivered feeling the cool clammy air exploring his face and throat the middle watch had only just run its course and there was still an hour or so before any lightening of the sky could be expected but overnight while all hands had worked to prepare the ship for action the clouds had gathered and thickened brushing out the stars so that undine seemed to be sailing remorselessly into a void he heard mudge moving restlessly below the hammock nettings rubbing his palms together to keep warm the sailing master seemed unusually preoccupied perhaps his rheumatism was troubling him or like bolitho he was thinking of herrick somewhere out there on undines larboard bow bolitho straightened his back and looked up at the blacker outlines of yards and rigging the ship was sailing under topsails and jibs and with only the great forecourse hiding the sea ahead of the bowsprit it was strange to feel so chilled when within hours the sun would be back to torment them to add to whatever else lay in store he asked how is the wind mr mudge mudge was glad to break the silence still souwest sir by an large he coughed noisily under most occasions id be grateful for that what are you thinking not sure sir mudge moved away from the seamen waiting by the quarterdeck sixpounders its too uneven for my tastes bolitho turned to peer forward again the big forecourse seemed to echo mudges doubts undine was steering almost due north and with the wind coming across her quarter she should have been making easygoing of it but she was not the forecourse would billow and harden making the stars and shrouds hum and vibrate holding the ship firm for several minutes then it would flap and bang in disorder before falling almost limp against the foremast for another frustrating period mudge added doubtfully you never knows in these waters not for sure bolitho looked at his untidy outline if mudge was worried with all his experience how much worse it would be for many of the others he called mr davy i am going forrard directly he saw the lieutenants shape detach itself from the rail tell mr keen to keep me company he slipped out of his tarpaulin coat and handed it to allday he had been so occupied with his own thoughts and doubts he had not fully realised how heavily these dragging hours must be affecting his company he had ordered the ship to be prepared for action as soon as he was satisfied with the final leg of their course towards the benua islands working in almost total darkness the hands had completed the task almost as quickly as in broad daylight so familiar had they become with their surroundings their home it was a simple precaution sound travelled too easily at sea and the clatter of screens being torn down the scrape and squeak of nets being spread above the gun deck and chain slings being rigged to every yard seemed loud enough to wake the dead but from then on they had nothing to do but wait to fret on what daylight might bring or take away keen came out of the darkness his shirt pale against a black sixpounder bolitho asked how is the wound much better thank you sir bolitho smiled he could almost feel the pain which was probably showing on keens face then take a stroll with me together they walked along the lee gangway ducking below the taut nets which shellabeers men had rigged to catch falling cordage or worse seeing the upturned faces of each gun crew the restless shapes of the marine sentries at hatchways or powdermonkeys huddled together while they waited to serve the silent cannon on to the forecastle where the squat carronades pointed from either bow like tethered beasts their crews shivering in the occasional dashes of spray bolitho paused one hand gripping the nettings as undine sidled unsteadily into a deep trough most of the seamen were stripped to the waist their bodies shining faintly above the d rk water alongside all ready lads he felt them crowd around him their sudden interest at his arrival of necessity the galley fire had been doused when the ship had gone to quarters a hot drink now would be worth more than a dozen extra guns he thought bitterly to keen he said pass the word to mr davy with my compliments a double tot of rum for all hands he heard the instant response around him the murmur of appreciation as it flowed aft along the gun deck if the purser complains tell him hell have me to reckon with thankee sir that was right thoughtful sir he strode to the ladder turning away in case they could see his face through the darkness or sense his mood it was too easy to raise their spirits so simple that it made him feel cheap hypocritical a double tot of rum a few pence whereas within hours they might have given their lives or their limbs bolitho paced aft beside the main hatch seeing soamess great figure towering above that of tapril the gunner he nodded to fowlar nearby and to the larboard crews of the twelvepounders all were his men his responsibility he thought suddenly of rear admiral sir john winslade all those weeks and months ago in his office at the admiralty he had needed a frigate captain he could know and trust one whose mind he could follow even though it was on the other side of the globe he thought too of the ragged soldiers below the admiralty window one blind the other begging for the both of them all the brave schemes and plans the lofty preparations for a new world yet when it was boiled down nothing was changed undine and argus were but two ships and yet their presence and their needs made them no less important than opposing fleets and if undine failed what would they say in those fine residences in whitehall and st jamess square and in the busy coffee houses where mere rumour grew into fact in minutes would they care that men had fought and died for them in the kings name someone gave a hoarse cheer in the gloom and he guessed the rum had arrived on deck he continued aft hardly aware that he had stopped short in his tracks as his bitterness had given way to anger how spacious the deck seemed without the boats lying one upon the other across their tier all were now towing astern awaiting the moment to be cast adrift mute spectators of the battle which might come which had to come it was always a bad moment he thought boats were frail things but in battle they made an additional menace with their splinters flying like savage darts despite the danger most men would wish them kept aboard a link a hope for survival if things went badly keen came back panting hard all done sir mr triphook was a trifle perturbed at the extra issue his teeth shone in the darkness wouldyou care for a glass sir bolitho disliked rum but he saw the seamen and marines watching him and exclaimed indeed i would mr keen he raised the glass to his mouth the powerful stench of rum going straight to his empty stomach to us lads he pictured herrick and puigserver aboard their floating bomb and to you thomas then he was glad he had accepted the rum and added i can noww understand what makes our jacks so fearsome it brought more laughs as he knew it would he glanced at the sky still without light or sign of a star he said ill go below he touched the midshipmans arm you remain here by the hatch call if i am needed bolitho climbed down into the darkness his feet less certain here anyone could call him when required but he must spare keen an unnecessary visit to the surgeons domain it might come soon enough he recalled the great pulsating wound alldays gentleness as he had searched out that bloody splinter another ladder he paused feeling the ship groaning around him different smellsabounded on this deck tar and oakum and that of tightly compressed humanity even though the tiny messes were now deserted and from forward the reek of the great anchor cables of bilge water and damp clothing of a living working ship a feeble lantern showed him the rest of the way to whitmarshs crude surgery the seachests lashed together where terrified wounded would be saved or driven to despair leather straps to jam between teeth dressings to contain the pain the surgeons great shadow swayed across the tilting deck bolitho watched him narrowly there was a stronger smell of brandy in the damp air to quench pain or to prepare whitmarsh for his own private hell he was not certain all well mr whitmarsh aye sir the surgeon lurched against the chests and braced his knee to the nearest one he waved one hand around his silent assistants the loblolly boys the men who would hold their victims until the work was done brutalised by their trade without ears for the screams beyond pity we are all awaiting whatyou send us sir bolitho stared at him coldly will you never learn the surgeon nodded heavily i have learned well oh yes indeed sir as i have sawed away at a mans leg or plugged carpenters oakum into his empty eyesocket with nothing to ease his torment but neat spirits i have come closer to god than most if that be true then i pray you get no closer bolitho nodded to the others and strode towards the ladder whitmarsh called after him perhaps i shall be greeting you sir bolitho did not reply the surgeon was obviously going completely mad his obsession with his brothers horrible death his drinking and the very way he earned his living were taking their toll but he had to hang on to what remained of that other man the one who had spoken of suffering with compassion of serving others less fortunate he thought again of herrick and prayed he would get his boat away when the schooner was set upon her final course to destruction strange companions he had too puigserver and the frightened sailmaker from bristol finding courage from somewhere to sail back to that place which had broken his mind and body captain sir he quickened his pace as keens voice came down the next ladder what is it but as he gripped the ladder and turned his face towards the skys faint rectangle he knew the answer slow heavy drops of rain were falling across the hatchway like small pebbles dropped from the yards as they tapped on planking or bounced across the gangways he dragged himself up the last few steps and hurried aft to the quarterdeck he was within a few feet of it when the clouds opened and the rain came down in a great roaring deafening torrent he yelled above the deluge how is the wind now mudge was cringing by the binnacle his hat awry in the fury of the downpour veerin sir far as i can tell water hissed and gurgled down decks and scuppers and the chilled gun crews pressed beneath the gangways and cowered behind the sealed ports to escape the torrential rain bolitho felt allday trying to throw the tarpaulin coat over his shoulders but pushed him away he was already soaked to the marrow hair plastered over his forehead his mind ringing to the din of rain and spray yet through it all he managed to keep contact with the ship and her affairs the deck felt steady enough despite the angry downpour and above his head he managed to make out the maintopsails shape flapping and shining wetly as the wind eased round still further he snapped hands to the braces mr davy we will be full and bye directly he heard the men groping and cursing as they lurched to obey the orders the protesting squeak of swollen cordage being hauled through blocks while yards were trimmed to hold the ship on her larboard tack he called bring her up a point men slithered around the big double wheel and he saw carwithen punch one of the helmsmen as he bowed under the sheeting rain nor by west sir full an bye she is hold her so bolitho mopped his face with his sleevethe probing downpour helped to clear his aching mind to make him accept what was happening if the wind continued to veer even if it stayed where it was herrick would be unable to place his schooner in position where he could destroy muljadis battery the disastrous change of wind made the rain feel like tears tears for all their hopes their pathetic determination which minutes ago had made even the impossible seem undaunting he lurched to mudges side and shouted how far now dyou reckon four or five mile no more sir mudge was staring at the rain with dismay this lotll pass over quick enough but then he shrugged bolitho looked away he knew well enough a rising wind was most likely once the sun appeared a wind which would do no service to herrick and keep le chaumareys in the safety of his anchorage undine would be helpless she would be made to stay offshore until the enemys double strength was prepared and ready to fight on their terms or they could turn and run for pendang bay with nothing to offer but a final warning davy shouted by god life is hard mudge glared at him lifes a bloody rearguard action mr davy from the day youre born bolitho swung round to silence both of them and then saw that the masters mates face was clearer than before he could even see carwithen scowling at the same luckless helmsman the dawn was forcing itself to be taken notice of he felt the blood racing in his head as he snapped we will attack as before pass the word to all hands davy gaped at him without destroying the battery sir it might not have worked anyway he tried to sound calm the enemy will be listening to the rain and thanking god for being at anchor he added harshly are you deaf man tell mr soames to prepare for loading once the rain is passed davy nodded jerkily and hurried to the rail captain bellairs strode to bolithos side and remarked coolly damn risky thing sir if youll pardon my sayin so bolitho felt his shoulders beginning to sag under the rain the sudden spark deserting him what wouldyou have me do bellairs turned up his collar and pouted ohid fight sir no choice in the matter what pity though all the same waste damn bloody waste bolitho nodded heavily no argument there deck there land ho bolitho walked stiffly to the lee side his shoes squeaking on the puddled deck a darker blur reaching out on either bow deceptively gentle in the feeble light a voice said rains goin he sounded surprised as if to mark its passing the dripping forecourse lifted and boomed dully to receive a fresher gust of wind it made bolitho shiver and grit his teeth tell mr soames load and prepare to run out when i pass the word he looked around for keen run up the colours if you please another voice muttered no chance mates theyll do for the lot of us bolitho heard the halliards squeaking as the ensign dashed up to the peak and broke out to the wind unseen as yet in the clinging darkness as soon as it is light enough mr keen have your party make a signal to the schooner discontinue the action mr herrick can stand off and retrieve our boats keen said aye aye sir ill see to it when he turned angrily as a voice murmured from the shadows pick up our bloody corpses mores the like keen shouted keep silence there masteratarms take that mans name bolitho said quietly easy if it helps them to curse then let it be so keen faced him his fists doubled at his sides but its not fair sir its not your doing bolitho smiled gravely thank you mr keen he recalled with sudden clarity his lieutenant in his first command the little sloop sparrow an american colonist he had endured the worst of the war serving his king but fighting his own kind at the same time what would he have replied i aint so sure bolitho could almost hear him as if he was present at this very moment he turned quickly to starboard seeing the glowing rim of sunlight as it probed above the bare horizon very soon now he discovered he was dreading the daylight that which would lay them naked under the guns as they drove into the narrow channel where he had met le chaumareys bolitho heard a step behind him and alidays voice firm unruffled better go below and get out of those wet things captain he swung towards him his voice cracking with strain do you think i have nothing else to do the coxswain regarded him stubbornly not just yet you havent he added in the same flat tone you remember the saintes captain he did not wait for an answer it was a bad time all those frogs the sea abounding with their damned ships until it was nigh on bursting i recalls it well i was right forrard on one of the carronades the lads were all quaking with fright at what was to come then i looked aft and saw you pacing the quarterdeck like you were going to church instead of to hell bolitho stared at him his mind suddenly steady i remember allday nodded slowly aye you wore your best uniform bolitho looked past him recalling another voice his coxswain who had died that day theyll want to seeyou he replied quietly very well but if im called allday gave a slow smile immediately captain mudge said hoarsely that was fool advice man the capnll make a fine target for sharpshooters in is gold lace allday eyed him angrily i know he does too he also knows we are depending on himtoday andthatmeans seeinghim mudge shook his head mad youre all mad deck there schooner fine on th weather bow keen called hoist the signal to recall her allday was standing with his arms folded his eyes on the spreading carpet of early light as it reached towards the islands mr herrick wont see it davy glared at him it will be light enough very soon now i know sir allday looked at him sadly but hell not see it not mr herrick without furniture or fittings the cabin felt strangely hostile like an empty house which mourns a lost master and awaits another bolitho stoodbythe shuttered stern windows his arms limp at his sides while noddall clucked around him and patted the heavy dress coat into position like the boat cloak it had been made by a good london tailor with some of his prizemoney through the wide gap left by the screens which had now been bolted to the deckhead he could see straight out along the gun deck the shapes and restless figures still only shadows in the frail light even here in the cabin where he had found peace in solitude or had sat with viola raymond or shared a pipe with herrick there was no escape the chintz covers had gone from the twelvepounders and had followed the furniture to a safer stowage below the waterline and by the guns on either beam the crews stood awkwardly like unfinished statuary conscious of his presence wanting to watch him as he completed dressing yet still held apart by the rigidity of their calling bolitho cocked his head to listen to the rudder as it growled and pounded in response to the helm the wind was fresher heeling the ship over and holding it so he saw the nearest gun captain checking his firing lanyard and noted how his body was angled to the deck noddall was muttering more like it sir much more like it he said it fervently as if repeating a prayer capn stewart was always most particular afore a fight bolitho wrenched his mind back from his doubts and misgivings stewart then he remembered undines last captain had he felt the same too he wondered feet stamped over the deck above and he heard someone shouting he snapped that will have to suffice he snatched up his hat and sword and then paused to pat noddalls bony shoulder he looked so small with his hands held in front of him like paws that he felt sudden compassion for him take care noddall stay down when the iron begins to fly youre no fighting man eh he was shocked to see noddall bobbing his head and tears running down his face in a small broken voice he said thankee capn he did not hide his gratitude i couldnt face another battle an id not want to let you down sir bolitho pushed past and hurried to the ladder he had always taken him for granted the little man who fussed over his table and darned his shirts content in his own small world it had never occurred to him that he was terrified each time the ship cleared for action he ran up the last steps and saw davy and keen with telescopes trained towards the bows what is the matter davy turned and then stared at him he swallowed hard his eyes still on bolithos goldlaced coat schooner has not acknowledged sir bolitho looked from him to the streaming flags now bright against the dull topsails are you sure mudge growled yer coxn seems to think she wont neither sir bolitho ignored him his eyes exploring the spread of land across the bows still lost in deep shadow with only an occasional lip of light to betray the dawn but the schooner was clear enough indirect line with undines plunging jibboom her canvas looked almost white against the cliffs and ragged hills herrick must have seen the recall he would have been anticipating it as soon as the wind veered he peered up at the masthead pendant god how the wind had gone round it must be westsouthwest he shouted hands aloft mr davy get the tgallants on her he swung round seeing them all in those brief seconds mudges doubts carwithen behind him his lips compressed into a thin line the helmsmen the barebacked gun crews keen with his signal party the calls shrilled and shadows darted up the ratlines on either beam as the topmen hurried to set more canvas davy shouted maybe mr herrick intends to go ahead with the plan sir bolitho looked at allday saw the way he was watching the schooner he said quietly it would seem so mr davy under a heavier press of sail undine thrust her shoulder into the creaming water with added urgency the spray hurling itself above the forecastle and nettings in long spectres of foam the hull shook and groaned to the pressure and when he peered aloft bolitho saw the upper yards bending forward to the wind from the peak the ensign was clearly visible like the marines tunics as they stood in swaying lines by the hammock nettings or knelt in the tops by their muskets and swivels like blood he heard himself say repeat the signal mr keen he barely recognised his own voice soames stood on the breech of a twelvepounder gripping the gangway with both hands as he stared towards the land then he looked aft at bolitho and gave a brief shrug in his mind herrick was already dead keen said huskily it will not work the windll carry the schooner clear at best shell explode in the centre of the channel penn shrilled from the gun deck i heard a trumpet bolitho wiped his eyes feeling the salt raw and smarting a trumpet some sentry on the fortress had left the protection of the wall to look seaward he would see the schooner immediately and undine within the next few minutes the sea noises seemed louder than ever with every piece of rigging and canvas banging and vibrating in chorus as the ship drove headlong towards the land and the pale arrowhead which marked the entrance to the channel a dull bang echoed across the water and a man yelled theyve opened fire sirl bolitho reached out for a telescope seeing the grim faces of the seamen by the nearest guns waiting behind closed ports hoping dreading he trained the glass with difficulty his legs well braced on the swaying slippery planking he saw the schooners masts swim past the lens the patch of scarlet which had not been there before he felt himself smiling although he wanted to weep to plead unheard words across those two miles of tossing whitehorses herrick had hoisted his own ensign to him the schooner was not merely a floating bomb she was a ship his ship or perhaps he was trying with that one simple gesture to explain to bolitho too to show he understood another bang and this time he saw the smoke from the battery before it was whisked away a feather of spray lifted well out beyond the schooner to mark where the massive ball had fallen he kept his glass on the schooner he saw the way the deck was leaning over showing the bilges above the leaping spray and knew herrick could not lash the tiller for the final and most dangerous part of the journey davy yelled that ball was over sir bolitho lowered the glass davys words reaching through his anxiety the fortress lookout must have sighted undine and not herricks little schooner and by the time muljadis men had realised what was happening herrick had tacked too close inshore for the gunners to depress their muzzles sufficiently to hit him he looked again as a double explosion shuddered across the water he saw the flashes only briefly but watched the twin waterspouts burst skyward directly in line with the schooner but on the seaward side of her captain bellairs forgot his usual calm and gripped the sergeants arm and shouted by god sarnt coaker hes goin to sail her aground himself it took a few more seconds before the truth filtered the length and breadth of the frigates decks then as the word moved gun by gun towards the bows men stood and yelled like maniacs waving their neckerchiefs or capering on the sanded decks like children from the tops and the forecastle others joined and even midshipman armitage who moments earlier had been gripping a belaying pin rack as if to stop himself from falling waved his hat in the air and yelled go on youll show them bolitho cleared his throat ask the masthead can he see the frigates he tried not to think of the schooners crammed holds the fuse perhaps already hissing quietly in the peace of the lower hull aye sir he can see the yards of the first one around the point even davy was wildeyed indifferent to the fight still to come overwhelmed by herricks sacrifice there was more cannon fire now and he could see splashes all around the schooners hull probably from the nearest anchored frigate or some smaller pieces on the spit of land which guarded the entrance bolitho found he was gritting his jaw so hard it was hurting badly the french were at last aware that something was happening but they would not have guessed the full extent of the danger there was a combined groan from the watching hands bolitho raised the glass and saw the schooners maintopmast buckle and then plunge down in a flailing mass of canvas and rigging half to himself he whispered fall back thomas in gods name come about allday said shes hit again captain badly this time bolitho dragged his mind away knowing he must not think of herrick later but in minutes those guns would be ranging on undine as she made that last desperate dash into the channel he drew his sword and held it above his head see yonder lads he only vaguely saw their faces turn towards him it was like looking through a mist mr herrick has shown us the way shes struck davy was almost beside himself hard and fast the schooner had hit lifted and then plunged firmly across the litter of broken rocks and stones exactly as they had pictured it had planned it with conways silver inkwells even without a glass it was possible to see some small boats moving from the fortresss pier towards the stranded hull which now lay totally dismasted the spray leaping over it like some old hulk occasional stabs of fire showed where marksmen were firing into the wreckage and bolitho prayed that the fuse was still alight that herrick would not be captured alive the explosion when it came was so sudden so violent in colour and magnitude that it was hard to face harder still to gauge a solid wall of orange flame exploded from the rocks and spread out on either hand like huge fiery wings engulfing the circling boats searing away men and weapons and reducing them into ashes and then the sound came when it reached the frigate it was with a steadily mounting roar which went on and on until men stood clutching their ears or staring stupefied at the miniature tidal wave which rolled past the frigates hull lifting it easily before dissipating itself astern in the last departing shadows then it died away as did the fires leaving only tiny glowing pinpricks of red and orange like slowmatches to show where gorse and brush still smouldered on the hillside once again the sea and wind the sounds of tackle and canvas returned and bolitho heard men talking almost whispering as if they had just witnessed an act of god he said harshly brail up the forecourse mr davy he walked to the rail each step like physical pain mr shellabeer cast all but the quarter boat adrift he must keep talking get them moving again clear that dreadful pyre from his own brain he saw soames watching him and shouted load and run out if you please his words were almost lost in the flap and thunder of rebellious canvas as the big forecourse was brailed up to its yard like a curtain he thought dully pulled away for the final scene so that nothing should be missed he heard the port lids squeaking in unison and then as soames barked his command the gun crews threw themselves on their tackles and with increasing haste the black muzzles rumbled towards the daylight thrusting out above the creaming water on either beam davy touched his hat all guns run out sir he looked strained thank you bolitho kept his eyes on the dark hump astride the channel no flashes from those great muzzles it had worked even if the garrison managed to manhandle some of the guns from the far side of the fortressit would be too late to fire on undine as she surged into the drifting curtain of smoke he shaded his eyes and stared towards the spit of land the dark lines which marked the masts and yards of the first anchored ship soon soon he gripped the sword until his knuckles showed white he could feel the hurt and the anger the rising madness which only revenge for herrick would control and there was the sunlight growing stronger every dragging minute he climbed into the weather shrouds heedless of the wind and leaping spray which dappled his coat like bright gems abeam he could see undines shadow reaching away across the broken water his own blurred outline like part of the fabric itself he looked down at mudge get ready to alter course once we are past that spit he waited while those at the braces took the strain each man an individual now as the sunlight found his naked back or a tattoo or some extra long pigtail to mark a seasoned sailor he jumped down to the deck tugging at his neckcloth as if it were strangling him marines stand to bellairs had drawn his elegant hanger and was watching while his men nestled their long muskets on the closely packed hammock nettings at every open port a gun captain crouched with his lanyard almost taut as he watched for the first sign of a target the spit of land reached out as if to touch the bilges as the ship swept inshore her bow wave causing a ripple amongst some jagged rocks which bolitho remembered from his other visit braces there mudge shouted put the wheel to larboard lively now like a thoroughbred undine heeled round under pressure of canvas and rudder the yards swinging together as she turned into the sunlight steer noreast by east mudge heaved his ungainly bulk to assist the helmsmen old er you buggers there were several muffled bangs and a ball cracked through the foretopsail with the sound of a whiplash but bolitho barely noticed it he was staring at the anchored frigate the scrambling activity along her yards and deck where her company prepared for sea davy echoed his dismay shes not the argus sir bolitho nodded it was the other frigate the one which had been abandoned by her crew he screwed up his eyes trying to watch every movement still attempting to accept what had happened le chaumareys had gone by chance or had he once again proved his superiority a cunning which had never been outmatched almost savagely he lifted the old blade over his head and yelled starboard battery as you bear the sword caught the glare as it cut down fire the broadside roared and flashed along undines starboard side gun by gun each captain taking his aim while soames strode past every recoiling breech yelling and peering towards the enemy bolitho watched the smoke spouting from the ports and rolling towards the other ship which seemed suspended in the fog her hull lying almost diagonally across the starboard bow here and there a gun flashed out in reply and he felt the deck planking jerk under his feet as at least one ball smashed into the side the quarterdeck gun crews were all shouting and cursing as they too joined in the battle the stocky sixpounders hurled themselves inboard on the tackles the wildeyed seamen sponging out and ramming home fresh charges within seconds overhead and splashing violently into the channel on either beam came a fusilade of smaller shot from fortress or frigate bolitho neither knew nor cared as he paced briskly athwart the deck by the quarterdeck rail he saw nothing but the other ships raked masts the patch of colour from the prancing beast of her flag the rising pall of smoke as again and again undines broadside thundered into her once he chilled as he saw some charred flotsam bobbing past the quarter a headless corpse pirouetting in undines crisp bow wave tendrils of scarlet moving around it like obscene weed herrick had known the argus had gone he must have seen the anchorage long before anyone in undine he would never have faltered bolitho felt his eyes stinging again the hatred boiling inside him as the quarterdeck guns cracked out their sharp detonations making his mind cringe even as their crews scrambled with handspikes to edge their weapons round for another salvo herrick would have accepted it as he had in the past it was what he had lived for bolitho shouted aloud heedless of mudge and davy nearby god damn them for their plans and their stupidity keen called theyve cut their cable sir bolitho ran to the nettings feeling a musket ball punch into the deck by his feet it was true muljadis frigate was yawing sluggishly in wind and current her stern swinging like a gate across undines path someone must have lost his nerve or perhaps in the confusion of the exploding schooner and undines savage attack an order had been misunderstood he yelled well go alongside her stand by the topsl halliards put the helm alee as men dashed to the braces again and topsails flapped and thundered wildly to their sudden freedom undine turned deliberately to larboard her jibboom sweeping round until it pointed to the distant pier and the litter of smouldering craft left by the explosion soames bellowed point ready he was peering redeyed along his panting gun crews his sword held out like a staff drag that man away he ran forward to help pull a wounded seaman from a twelvepounder now his sword flashed down broadside this time the whole battery exploded in a single wall of flames the long tongues darting into the smoke making it rise and twist as if it too was dying in agony someone gave a hoarse cheer there goes th bastards fore bolitho ran to the gangway marines and seamen pounding behind him high above the smoke the nimble topmen were already hurling their steel grapnels jeering at one another as they raced even here to beat their opposite numbers on the other masts another cheer as with a shuddering lurch undine drove alongside the drifting frigate her bowsprit rising above the poop while the impetus carried them closer and closer together the guns still bellowed louder now as their fury matched across a bare thirty feet of tormented water boarders away bolitho waited gripping the main shrouds gauging the moment as soames roared cease firing at em lads cut the bastards down then he was across clinging to the enemys boarding nets which had been rent in great holes by the broadsides muljadis own plans must have been ready for there seemed to be hundreds of men surging to meet the cheering cursing rush of boarders muskets and pistols while from somewhere overhead a swivel banged out the packed canister tearing across the enemys quarterdeck hurling wood splinters and bodies in all directions a bearded face loomed out of the smoke and bolitho slashed at it holding to the nets to keep from falling outboard and being crushed between the hulls the man shrieked and dropped from view a marine thrust bolitho aside screaming like a madman as he pinned a man with his bayonet before wrenching out the blade and ramming the muskets butt into a wounded pirate who was trying to crawl out of the fight allday ducked under a cutlass and caught his attacker off balance he even pushed the man away with his left fist giving himself room for a proper stroke with his own blade it sounded like an axe on wood bellairs was striding in the centre of a squad of marines snapping unheard commands his elegant hanger darting in and out like a silver tongue as he forced his way aft towards the enemys quarterdeck another wave of insane cheering and bolitho saw soames leading his own boarding party up and over the frigates main shrouds muskets barking pointblank into the press below him his sword crossing with that of a tall lankhaired officer whom bolitho remembered as le chaumareys first lieutenant soames slipped and sprawled across an upended cannon and the frenchman drew back his arm for the fatal thrust but a marine was nearby the musket ball taking away most of the lieutenants skull and hurling him from the deck like a rag doll bolitho realised that allday was shaking him by the arm trying to make him understand something he yelled the hold captain he jabbed at the wide hatchways with his cutlass the bastards have set her afire bolitho stared at it his brain and mind reeling from the screams and cheers the grate of steel the madness of close action the smoke was already thicker perhaps allday was right or maybe a burning wad from one of undines guns had found its way into the hull when soames had sent his last broadside crashing home either way both ships would be destroyed unless he acted and at once he yelled captain bellairs fall back he saw bellairs gaping at him blood dripping unheeded from a gash on his forehead then he too seemed to get a grip on his own lust of battle and shouted sound the retreat he sought out his sergeant whose massive frame had somehow avoided both steel and musket ball coaker take that fools name if he dont do as i ask coaker gripped a small marine drummer boy but he was dead his eyes glazed and unseeing as coaker wrenched the trumpet from his hands and blew it with all his might it was almost harder to discontinue the battle thanto board the other frigate back and back here and there a man falling or being hauled bodily across the gap between the hulls to avoid capture the pirates had at last seen their own danger and without the french lieutenant in command they seemed intent only on abandoning their ship as quickly as they could the first tongue of flame licked through a hatch bringing a chorus of shrieks from the abandoned wounded and within seconds the gratings and surrounding boat tier were well ablaze bolitho gripped the ratlines and took a last look as his men threw themselves on to undines gangway forward shellabeers men were already cutting the lashing which held the hulls together and with the topsails once more braced round and the helm over undine began to sidle clear the wind holding the smoke and sparks away from her own canvas and vulnerable rigging mudge panted what now sir bolitho watched the frigate slipping past a few crazed men still firing across the widening gap he shouted a final broadside mr soames but it was already too late a great sheet of flame burst upwards through the vessels gun deck setting the broken foremast and sails alight and leaping to the mainyards like part of a forest fire bolitho heard himself reply get the forecourse on her and smartly with it well not be able to beat back the way we came that ships magazine will go at any moment so we will try the eastern channel mudge said may be too shallow sir would you burn mr mudge he strode to the taffrail to watch the frigate as the blaze engulfed the poop an english ship it were better this way he thought vaguely he turned and added harshly mr davy i want a full report of damage he waited seeing the wildness draining from his eyes and the bill for all this bolitho saw the yards edging round the sails pockmarked and blackened by the fight hardening to the wind the channel seemed wide enough about a cable to starboard more on the other side he had managed worse boat in the water sir keen was standing in the shrouds with his telescope just two men in it mudge called ill old er steady sir were steerin almost noreast again but i dunno the rest of his words were lost as keen yelled sir sir he stared down at bolitho his face shining with disbelief davy snapped keep your head mr keen but keen did not seem to hear its mr herrick bolitho stared at him and then clambered up beside him the boat was a wreck and the scrawny figure who was now standing to wave a scrap of rag above his head looked like a scarecrow lying in the bottom of the boat halfcovered with water was herrick as he held the telescope bolitho could feel his hands shaking violently and saw herricks face ashen beneath a rough bandage then he saw his eyes open imagined the other man shouting the news to him his words as plain as if he could hear them himself he said pass the word to the bosun i want that boat grappled alongside he gripped the midshipmans wrist and tell him to be careful therell be no second chance allday had gone below for something now he was back his eyes everywhere until bolitho said quietly the first lieutenant is coming aboard go forrard and bid him welcome for me eh as the frigate slipped past another shelving hump of land the sun came down to greet them to warm their aching limbs to hold the shock of battle at arms length a while longer a deep explosion came from the main channel and more smoke spouted high above the nearest land to show the wind which awaited them in open water and to sound the other vessels final destruction muljadi may or may not have been aboard and the real fight was still ahead bolitho heard shouts from forward and then a cheer as some seamen clambered into the sinking boat to pluck herrick and his companion back on board but whatever was waiting beyond the green humps of land no matter how hopeless their gesture might be they would be together in the kings name alter course two points bolitho tried to pace along the littered deck but was unable to overcome his anxiety it was an hour since they had edged into the eastern channel under minimum canvas and with two leadsmen in the chains they had felt their way towards the sea an hour of answering demands and listening to reports ten killed fifteen wounded half of them seriously considering what they had done it was a small enough bill but as he watched the familiar bundles awaiting burial or heard occasional cries from the main hatch he found little comfort in it if only allday would come on deck and tell him about herrick he had already questioned the surviving seaman it had been the little man called lincoln the one with the permanent grin made by a grotesque scar bolitho had watched him reliving it as he had stammered out his description oblivious to his captain and officers crowding around him and seemingly only half aware he was actually alive it had been much as bolitho had imagined herrick had decided to destroy the battery drive his schooner aground regardless of risk and the inevitability of death at the last moment with the fuse lit and the vessel being fired on from a hillside herrick had been struck by a falling block from the mainmast the little seaman had said in a whisper then up comes mister pigsliver as cool as you please take to th boat he shouts ive an old score to settle though e didnt say wot e meant like by then there was only three ands left so me an jethro lowers mr errick into the dory but tother bloke the little sailmaker named potter e decides to stay with the don he had given a great shudder so off we goes then the schooner blows up like the gates of ell an poor jethro was lost overboard i just kept paddlin and prayin that mr errick would stir to is senses an tell me wot to do he had paused sobbing soundlessly then i looks up an there she is large as life th old undine i shakes mr errick and calls to im look alive sir the ships a comin for us an ewelle just looks at me an says an wot did you expect bolitho had said quietly thank you lincoln i shall see you do not go unrewarded the little man had added an youll not forget to mention a piece about mister pigsliver sir ii mean e may be a don sir but but then he had broken down completely now as he moved restlessly past the sixpounders where the gun captainsknelt in the sunlight checking their equipment testing the tackles their bodies stained with smoke and dried blood bolitho said to himself no i will not forget deck there he looked up his eyes smarting in the glare open water ahead sir shoes scrapedby the cabin hatch and he swung round allday where the devil have you been but it was not allday bolitho strode across the deck and held out both hands thomas he gripped herricks hands in his oblivious to the watching faces on every side it dont know what to sayl herrick smiled sadly i am the same sir you should remain below until deck there ship to the eastrdt herrick withdrew his hands and replied quietly i am the first lieutenant sir he looked slowly around the quarterdeck at the protruding splinters and the flapping edges of torn hammocks where musket balls had ripped home my place is here davy crossed the deckand touched his hat beat to quarters again sir yes davy looked at herrick and smiled it seems you had no better luck in holding on to the schooner than i he added i am relieved you are here and thats the truth herrick touched the fresh bandage on his head and winced if it had not been sworn otherwise i would have said that don puigserver struck me down himself he was that eager to finish what we had begun he fell silent as the drums rattled out their tattoo and the lolling figures by guns and braces stirred themselves into life bolitho was watching the last shoulder of land sliding away the expanse of blue water and lively wavecrests growing and spreading to reveal an endless dazzling horizon to larboard her hull and spars black against the glare lay the argus she appeared to be moving very slowly her yards well braced to hold her on a converging tack herrick muttered four miles id say about that bolitho studied the other ship unable to look away she reminded him of a wild cat the way she edged across the busy whitecapped waves stealthy purposeful lethal he imagined he could hear the squeak of trucks as her smooth sides became barbed by gun muzzles le chaumareys was taking his time waiting for bolitho to make the first move he looked away at last feeling the tension returning but heavier than before perhaps le chaumareys had planned it this way distrusting his ally muljadi guessing that bolitho might bring off a stalemate if not a victory if he chose his own method of attack the undines company had fought hard he looked searchingly at the shot holes and punctured sails heard the hammers as pryke the portly carpenter and his mates got busy on repairs in the lower hull and knew it was asking much of them to fight yet again and to win against this great blackhulled veteran of the french navy then he glanced at those nearest him he needed every bit of skill and experience they possessed not least their courage well mr mudge what of the wind now itll get up sir mudge took out his handkerchief and blew his great nose violently might back a bit he gestured up at the masthead pendant it was stiff like a spear id suggest beggin yer pardon sir that you fights under topsails only bolitho turned to herrick what do you say herrick was watching the other ship his eyes like slits get to grips sir hell pound us to pieces with those long guns otherwise the deck lifted across the first true roller and spray drifted high above the nettings lets be about it then bolitho licked his parched lips get the forecourse off her he dropped his voice and have those corpses buried directly it does no good to see where some of us will end this morning herrick watched him calmly i can think of better reasons for dying he glanced at the motionless seamen by the guns but no better place for it bolitho walked to the rail and watched the argus for several minutes le chaumareys had a good position he had probably considered it very carefully he was over there now watching him expecting him to act to try and take the windgage or to alter course and attempt to cross his stern and cripple him with one good broadside as he passed the french frigate dipped to the swell showing her copper for several seconds the wind was tight across her exposed side but le chaumareys was holding back keeping on undines larboard bow barely making headway bolitho bit his lip his eyes running in the suns fierce stare his men would find it hard to shoot well into the blinding sunlight when he looked at the gun deck again he saw that corpses were gone herrick came aft and said all done he saw bolithos intent features and asked quietly is something wrong sir i think i am starting to understand le chaumareys he could feel his heart beginning to pound again the familiar chill at his neck and spine i think he wants us to have the windgage but sir herricks blue eyes darted to the argus and back again is the sun in our eyes of greater value to him understanding spread across his round face it might well be he can stand off and use his heavy artillery to better result bolitho turned his eyes flashing well its not to be mr herrick get the tgallants on her directly he added i am sorry mr mudge but if we lose the sticks out of her to your damned wind it may be better than losing them the other way herrick was already raising his speaking trumpet hands aloft loose tganslswhen he looked at bolitho again there was little to show what he had so recently endured by god sir what we miss in weight we can show that bastard in agility today bolitho grinned at him his lips painful alter course two points to starboard well run for his bows allday folded his arms and watched bolithos shoulders and then glanced up at the flag as it rippled in the freshening wind and that is all the running youll be doing im thinking east noreast sir carwithen had one hand resting on the polished spokes as the helmsmen concentrated on the compass and the set of the sails overhead steady as she goes mudge rubbed his hands on his coat shes movin well sir bolitho lowered his telescope and nodded thoughtfully the extra power of the topgallants was laying undine firmly in line across the other ships path argus had not set any additional sail yet he winced as the sunlight lanced down from the lens le chaumareys still held the best position he could alter course to leerd and present his broadside as undine tried to pass him equally he could allow her to cross his bows and while she lost time in changing tack he could take the windgage suns glare or not and attack him from the other side herrick said hoarsely hes holding the same course he may have let her fall off a point but theres nothing in it he breathed out slowly she makes a fair sight god rot her bolitho smiled tightly argus had barely changed her bearing but that was because undine had altered course to starboard she was much closer now a bare two miles so that he could see her red and yellow figurehead the purposeful movement of figures about her sloping quarterdeck there was a sudden bang and seconds later a thin waterspout rose lazily amongst the tossing wavecrests slightly ahead of undines path and half a cable short ranging shot or merely to unnerve undines own gun crew another of le chaumareys little ruses herrick muttered fervently if i know the frogs hell try and dismast us with chainshot and langridge another prize for his bloody allyp you dont know this frenchman mr herrick bolitho recalled le chaumareys face when he had spoken of home his france which he had been denied for so long my guess is hell want a complete victory the word made him feel uneasy he could even picture undine dismasted and wallowing amongst her own dead and dying before her final plunge like the one he himself had just destroyed like nervion and so many he had watched crumble and perish the stage was set two ships with not even a seabird to watch their manoeuvres their dedicated efforts to outwit each other there sir hes setting his tgallants carwithens voice jarred him from his thoughts herrick exclaimed he intends to outreach us after all bolitho watched intently as the arguss upper yards filled with freshlyset bulging canvas he could see the instant effect it had around her raked stem as she bit into the waves and thrust forward with sudden haste from his position behind the rail it looked to bolitho as if the other ships jibboom was actually touching his own although she was still over a mile away smoke wreathed above her hull and he held his breath as the bright tongues of fire licked from her exposed ports the sea boiled and shot skywards as the heavy balls ploughed into the windruffled water or ricocheted away far abeam one ball smashed hard down alongside the shock transmitting itself to the very mastheads trying to rattle our wits herrick was grinning but bolitho saw the anxiety behind his eyes le chaumareys had not seemed the kind of man who wasted gestures on the wind he was preparing his gun crews showing them the range probably telling them right now in his resonant voice exactly what he expected of them by god the devils shortening sail again bolitho saw the topgallants vanishing along the arguss yards and leaned across the rail stand by the larboard battery perhaps he had found le chaumareys one real weakness that he needed to win and to survive bolitho knew that the two did not always walk hand in hand alter course three points to larboard he heard the rush of feet the confused shouts as his orders were relayed to the waiting seamen mudge asked is that wise sir bolitho waited as the helm went down and then turned to watch the bowsprit swinging slowly and then more quickly to larboard the other frigate suddenly enmeshed in the crisscross of rigging and shrouds hold her so he waited impatiently while herrick bellowed through histrumpet and the hands on the braces hauled feverishly to retrim the yards noreast by north sir the helmsman sounded breathless with the wind sweeping tightly across the larboard quarter undine swept straight down towards the other ship as if to cut her in halves more flashes darted from the frenchmans side and bolitho clenched his fists as metal shrieked overhead parting rigging slapping through sails and hurling spray in profusion on either beam now we shall see bolitho craned forward gripping the rail his eyes stinging painfully in the hazy glare another rippling line of flashes the sounds of the broadside rolling across the water like the thunder of mighty drums he felt the hull stagger violently and saw some of the seamen below the quarterdeck exchanging quick desperate glances argus was still holding her course and speed lying across undines path and growing in size with every agonising minute more shots and a savage jerk below his feet told bolitho undine was being hit again but arguss broadsides were more ragged now and fewer balls were falling near their target herrick said fiercely hell have to do something bolitho did not reply but stared fixedly through his telescope at the cluster of figures on arguss quarterdeck he could see le chaumareys powerful bulk his small cropped head bobbing as he shouted commands to his subordinates he would be missing his first lieutenant bolitho thought quickly as he would have missed herrick but for their unlikely reunion he called the wind mr mudge he dared not look at him backed a point sir from the pendant id say it was near souwesterly herrick shouted argus is standing away sir somebody gave an isolated cheer but bolitho snapped keep the people quiet he added quickly stand by to alter course hard to larboard ill want her as close to the wind as you can lay her mr mudge he watched barely able to move as arguss yards edged round her outline shortening as she stood off making a triangle between the two converging ships she loosed another slow broadside and bolitho heard a scream from aloft then saw a marine fall headlong on to the nets blood gushing from his mouth and splashing on the gun crew immediately below him le chaumareys had mistaken bolithos headlong charge as an act of empty bravery he had waited for the right moment before swinging clear to present his full broadside to cripple undine completely as she attempted to cross the bows bolitho held up his hand praying that those flashing guns would give him time to act larboard battery fire as you bear relieved eager to hit back the gun crews pounced on their weapons stand by davy watched as soames hurried to the leading gun fire bolitho felt the hull quiver and drew breath again as the smoke billowed away from the hull towards the enemy stand by to alter course he held herricks gaze no we are not going to embrace him just yet he felt the insane grin on his lips well cross his stern he has left the door open a heavy ball smashed through the larboard bulwark upending a twelvepounder and painting the planking and gratings in bright spreading scarlet screams and curses were drowned as soames bellowed stop your vents sponge out he glared wildly through the smoke you manners take that handspike and move yourself damn you the man in question was gaping at his legs which had been spattered with blood and fragments from the neighbouring crew bolitho dropped his hand now helm alee to the mounting wind and the sudden change of direction undine swayed over and down the gun crews firing off another uneven salvo before argus was plucked from their open ports bolitho yelled mr davy starboard battery men dashed from the stillsmoking guns and threw themselves to assist the opposite side overhead spars and blocks strained and bucked in protest and more than one seaman fell headlong as the ship came thundering up close to the wind her yards almost foreand aft the fore topgallant sail split suddenly and violently the fragments like streamers in the wind but bolitho ignored it he was watching arguss black shape sliding out and away from the starboard bow while his own ship turned steeply towards her poop shots crashed into hull and rigging alike and bolitho watched sickened as two seamen were pulped into offal and broken weapons against the opposite side davys voice was almost a scream starboard battery as you bear the order to fire was lost in the first crash from the forward guns followed instantly along the deck as the argus loomed up and over the nettings like a black cliff sponge out reload run out the crews had no trouble in running out for the ship was heeling so steeply to the wind that each gun squealed down the deck like an enraged hog on the rampage bolitho cupped his hands hold your fire he gestured to the men by the carronades on the forecastle several corpses lay near them and he guessed le chaumareys marksmen had realised his intention a musket ball clanged against a sixpounder and one of the helmsmen fell kicking and spluttering his chin shot away by the ricochet bolitho shouted above the din let her fall off a point mr mudge you know what i expect today shadows danced across the decks as pieces of broken rigging blocks a musket and other fragments bounced on the nets above and here was the argus plunging heavily to starboard trying to follow undine round but losing the chance as the english frigate swept across her stern fire a carronade banged loudly biting fragments from arguss stern and smashing her small quartergallery to fragments gun by gun the twelvepounders followed its example the balls slamming into the stern or scything through the gaping windows to create death and confusion within men were cheering despite threats and blows from their petty officers and above the great writhing wall of smoke bolitho saw the french frigates masts moving slowly away and beyond the starboard quarter but it was no time to falter now we will wear ship mr herrick lay her on the starboard tack aye sir herrick wiped his streaming face above the stains on his cheeks and mouth his bandage shone in the filtered sunlight like a turban its lively work today sir man the braces stand by to wear ship a man screamed as he was dragged from a gun bleeding badly as whitmarshs mates lifted him he struggled and kicked to free himself more terrified of what waited below than of dying on deck sails thundering and spilling wind from countless shotholes undine changed tack yet again turning her bowsprit away from the islands and towards the sun the sea looked much wilder now with short wavecrests crumbling to the wind or throwing sheets of spray above the gangways with hardly a break bolitho wiped his eyes and tried to restrain from coughing like his eyes his lungs were raw with powder smoke the stench of battle he watched the other ship as she swam above the leaping spindrift willingly or not le chaumareys had the windgage and his ship now stood off undines starboard bow a bare cables length away if undine continued to overhaul her both ships would run parallel a musket shot apart argus would get her revenge at such a murderous range he glanced quickly at mudge he too was watching the sea and the masthead pendant but was it for the same reason but to ask him now to show that he was in need of a miracle and had nothing to replace one would take the fight out of his men no less than an instant defeat he saw them at their guns panting and gasping tarred hands gripping tackles and rammers sponges and handspikes their naked bodies were streaked with sweat which cut through the powder grime like the marks of a fine lash their eyes shone through their blackened faces as if trapped the marines were reloading their muskets and bellairs was strolling with his sergeant by the taffrail at the helm another had taken the dead mans place and carwithens coarse face was working on a plug of tobacco his eyes cold without expression there were fewer men on the gun deck although bolitho had not seen many fall yet they had gone had died or been maimed without a word from him to give reason for their sacrifice he reached out to steady himself as the deck tilted more steeply when he peered over the riddled hammocks he saw the seas face forming into short steep ranks ranging towards the two ships as if to push them away he yelled mr davy are yon ready davy nodded dully every gun loaded with chainshot sir good bolitho looked at herrick i hope to god that the master knows his weather in a sharper tone he added get the forecourse on her with the great foresail set and drawing undine began to overhaul the other ship at a remarkable pace bolitho flinched as more balls crashed alongside from arguss sternchasers one of them hurling the quarterboat into spinning pieces a last challenge that was what it had to look like gun to gun no quarter until undine was a sinking wreck he said we will alter course when i give the word he waited aching in ever muscle his mind jumping to each gunshot from the frenchmans poop undines jibboom seemed to be prodding her larboard quarter like a lance a few stabs of fire above her shattered stern showed where marksmen had taken fresh positions and bolitho saw two of his marines drop like red fruit from the foretop their cries lost to the mounting wind mudge said worriedly we may lose our sticks when we comes round sir bolitho ignored him ready lads he watched the sea rising and breaking against arguss opposite quarter the mounting pressure against her yards now he gripped the rail as the helm went over and the bows started to pull towards theenemy he saw argus trimming her yards the hull tilting steeply as she followed undines turn sunlight flashed on her quarterdeck and then her side exploded in a line of great flashes the air rent apart with the savagery of her broadside bolitho almost fell as the massive weight of iron crashed into the hull or screamed and tore through the rigging overhead he was choked by swirling smoke his mind reeling from the combined noises of screams and yells of musket fire from all angles somehow he dragged himself up the angled deck and peered towards the argus smoke was drifting from her last broadside so fast that undine seemed to be moving abeam to meet her the illusion told him mudge had been right and as he watched arguss sails bellying out towards him he also saw her gunports awash as the wind thrust her over thank god for the wind fire he had to repeat the order to make himself heard fire undines disengaged gunports were also awash and her runout battery was pointing almost towards the sky as each captain jerked his lanyard even above the roar of cannon fire and the wail of the wind bolitho heard the chainshot whimpering through the air and ripping into arguss fully exposed topsails and braced yards he heard too the immediate clatter of severed rigging the louder explosions of bursting stays and shrouds as foremast and maintopmast swayed together like great trees before booming and splintering into the smoke bolitho waved his sword above his head hold her steady mr mudge shell be alongside directly he ran to the gangway and then stopped dead as the wind sucked the smoke downwind and away from the two drifting hulls dead and wounded lay everywhere and as the marines ran to their places for boarding bolitho saw shellabeer mangled beneath a gun and pryke the carpenter pinned across a hatch coaming by a broken length of gangway his blood linking with all the rest around him and fowlar could that thing really be him but there was no more time to regret or to think argus was here alongside and as soames led his men across the bows bolitho shook his sword and yelled hoarsely over you go lads the french seamen were struggling to free themselves from the great tangle of spars and rigging the broken cordage lying in heaps like giant serpents but the steel was ready enough bolitho crossed swords with a petty officer and then slipped in some blood the breath driven from his body as the frenchman pitched headlong across him he felt the man jerk and kick saw the awful agony in his eyes as carwithen pulled him away a boarding axe locked into his collar bone on every hand men were fighting and yelling the pikes and bayonets waving above the more desperate work of sword and cutlass davy was heading for the quarterdeck ladder shouting to the men at his back when a rally of french seamen left him momentarily isolated and alone bolitho watched his contorted face above the thrusting shoulders saw his mouth shaping unheard screams as they cut him down their weapons not still even after he had dropped from sight midshipman armitage stood shaking on the gangway his skin like chalk as he shouted follow me then he too was dead pushed aside and trodden underfoot as the two opposing groups surged together again bolitho saw it all as he fought his way aft towards the main quarterdeck ladder saw it and recorded it in his mind but without sequence like a nightmare as if he were a mere onlooker he reached the ladder and saw the french lieutenant facing him the one named maurin who had an english wife the rest seemed to fade into a swirling embattled fog as the two swords reached out and circled each other bolitho said harshly strike maurin you have done enough l the frenchman shook his head it is not possible msieu then he lunged forward taking bolithos sword on the hilt and deftly turning it towards the sea bolitho let himself fall back to the next step seeing the desperation on maurins face knowing without understanding why that this man alone stood between victory and senseless slaughter le chaumareys is deadl bolitho tested the next step with his left foot am i not right he had to shout at the top of his voice as more of undines men burst yelling on to the gun deck and attacked the french crew from behind they must have climbed through the shattered stern bolitho realised dully again it was more of a reaction than anything he added coldly so for gods sake strike maurin hesitated the uncertainty plain on his face and then made up his mind he sidestepped and raised his hilt almost level with his eyes before lunging towards bolithos chest bolitho watched him with something like despair maurin had been too long in the one ship had forgotten the need for change it was easy too sickeningly easy bolitho took his weight on his foot parried the blade as it darted towards him and struck the lieutenants weight was more than enough and bolitho almost had the sword wrenched from his grip as maurin fell gasping to the deck below a pigtailed seaman raised his boarding pike but bolitho shouted touch him and ill kill you myself he saw herrick walking between the french seamen who were throwing their weapons on to the bloodied deck the fight over their strength going at the sight of maurins last gesture he thrust the sword into its scabbard and walked heavily up the last few steps he knew allday was behind him and herrick took his place at his side as together they stood in silence looking at le chaumareys body where it lay beside the abandoned wheel he looked strangely peaceful and amidst so much carnage and horror almost unmarked there was a dark stain below his shoulder and a small trickle of blood from a corner of his mouth probably one of bellairs sharpshooters bolitho thought vaguely bolitho said quietly well we did meet captain just as you said we would lieutenant soames knelt to unfasten le chaumareys sword but bolitho said leave it his was a bad cause but he fought with honour he turned away suddenly sick of the watching dead their pathetic stillness and cover him with his flag his proper flag he was no pirate he saw davys body being carried to the gangway and added a moment longer and he would have seen argus taken enough prizemoney even for his debts perhaps as they climbed across the trapped water between the drifting hulls bolitho turned startled as some of the seamen gathered to cheer him he looked at herrick but he shrugged and gave a sad smile i know how you feel sir but they are glad to be alive it is their way of thanking you bolitho touched his arm survival i suppose it is a fair cause for battle he forced a smile and for winning herrick picked up his hat and handed it to him ill set the people to work sir the pumps sound too busy for my liking bolitho nodded and walked slowly towards the stern his shoes catching at splinters and broken cordage by the taffrail he paused and looked wearily along his command at the broken planking and stained decks the figures which were picking their way amidst the debris more like survivors than victors then he leaned back and loosened his neckcloth and shook open his best dress coat which was torn and slashed in a dozen places above his head the flag was flapping more easily the sudden squall having passed on as quickly as it had arrived to save them from arguss great guns but for it he looked round suddenly anxious but saw mudge in his place near the helm cutting at a piece of cheese with a small knife which he had fished from one of his pockets he looked very old in the dusty sunlight little penn was squatting on a gun truck having his wrist bandaged and dabbing at his nose which had started to bleed when a charge had exploded prematurely nearby bolitho watched them with something like love mudge and penn age and innocence there was keen speaking with soames and looking very strained but a man now feet crunched on the debris and he saw noddall approaching him cautiously a jug of wine clasped against his chest i am afraid i cant yet find the glasses sir he kept his eyes fixed on bolithos face and had probably had them shut as he had groped past some of the horror below bolitho held the jug to his lips and said but this is some of my best wine noddall dabbed his eyes and smiled nervously aye sir all of it the rest was destroyed by the battle bolitho let the wine fill his mouth savouring it needing it they had come a long way since that shop in st jamess street he thought and in a few weeks they would be ready again the missing faces would still be remembered but without the pain which even now was getting stronger terror would emerge as bravado and courage be recalled as duty he smiled bitterly remembering the words from so long ago in the kings name he heard penn say in his squeaky voice i was a bit frightened mr mudge an awkward pause just a bit old mudge looked across the deck and held bolithos gaze frightened boy gawd ell never make a capn will e sir bolitho smiled sharing the moment with mudge alone for he knew better than most that the truth of battle was not for children then he looked along his command again at the gleaming shoulder of the proud figurehead below the bowsprit undine was the real victor he thought and he was suddenly grateful to have her to himself epilogue lieutenant thomas herrick stepped into the stern cabin and tucked his hat beneath his arm you sent for me sir bolitho was standing by the open windows his hands on a sill watching the weed on the seabed and tiny bright fish darting around the motionless rudder it was afternoon and along the shoreline of pendang bay the trees and green fronds waved and shone in a dozen hues to a steady breeze good sailing weather he thought absently but not for undiae not just yet he turned and gestured to a chair sit down thomas he saw herricks gaze resting on the opened despatches which had been brought aboard that day a brig from madras orders and news another indiaman will be arriving shortly thomas this despatch is from the admiral commanding the inshore squadron he is sending fresh hands to replace some of those we lost in battle how easily said lost in battle he glanced slowly around the cabin knowing that herrick was watching him sharing his memories there was little to show of the mauling the ship had suffered under le chaumareys guns fresh paint covered the repaired timbers and the smell of tar and woodshavings lingered throughout the hull a month and two days since they had gone alongside argus but despite the backbreaking work and the rewards of seeing the ship looking her old self again the pictures of the fight hung in bolithos mind as if it were yesterday and how they had worked perhaps like himself the rest of the company had needed it if only to hold the memories at bay a little longer small moments stood out when you least expected them midshipman penn crouching down as a gun recoiled inboard wreathed in smoke while its crew dashed forward again with sponge and rammer a man had been hurled to the deck in a wave of flying splinters had lain there staring unwinkingly at jthe sky penn had reached out to touch him and had tried to ump away as the man had reached out to seize his wrist he must have died at that very instant bolitho did not remember seeing the incident at the time but it had lurked in wait within his mind and armitage leading his squad of boarders after davy had fallen under those plunging blades the clumsy awkward midshipman blind with terror yet gathering his few reserves of strength only to find they were not enough and after the battle the smells and the sounds not least the surgeon fightingdrunk and being dragged bodily to his sickbay by three of his men when the wild cheering had given way to the realisation of victory they had faced up to their own immediate situation wounded to be tended the dead to be buried and the work begun without delay looking back it was surprising they had reached pendang bay at all bolitho thought fore and main lower yards badly sprung the mainmast itself so splintered and pitted that it was only quick work on stays and rigging which kept it upright the tasks had seemed unending more than a dozen holes below the waterline had kept the hands working at the pumps through every watch as with the battered argus in tow they had crawled painfully towards the land and safety the captured frigate had already sailed under juryrig for a yard in india where she would be quickly refitted and included in the companys own private fleet herrick asked any further instructions sir bolitho reached for a bottle of wine it is confirmed that pendang bay will be exchanged for another station now held by the dutch east india company he looked up seeing the astonishment in herricks eyes now that we have established the settlement the dutch are more than willing to make the exchange apparently he recalled with sudden clarity rear admiral conways face when the first despatch had been opened brought from madras by raymond himself he had said hoarsely so it was all for nothing raymond had looked away no sir the other settlement in the north is far more suitable to our requirements sir montagu strang has explained you will see that your part in all this is highly thought of later when raymond had left the room conway had said highly thought of but a new governor will be appointed bolitho had replied i am sorry sir it is a bitter victory bitter surprisingly he had laughed this sort of work is more for shopkeepers than sailors bolitho remember that well he pushed a goblet across the table and realised that herrick was still awaiting an answer once our replacements have been signed on we will maintain a local patrol until ordered otherwise he smiled gravely i am temporarily the senior officer in these waters not too surprising since undine is the only kings ship herrick grinned and well earned sir when i realised how you had put yourself inside the french captains mind i bolitho looked away if the wind had dropped thomas you might think differently lady luck sir the grin was broader there was a tap at the door and penn stepped into the cabin mr davys respects sir the indiaman has just weighed he said you wished to be told sir thank you bolitho waited for the door to close his heart suddenly heavy even penn had not helped keen now stood above as acting lieutenant and soames had replaced davy the same story one dies another profits herrick said quietly the indiamans sailing for madras sir our wounded will get better treatment there bolitho picked up his hat well see her off the sun across the quarterdeck was harsh enough but in the steady offshore wind felt less severe as with herrick he stood by the nettings to watch the deephulled indiaman spreading her topsails her paintwork and company flag very bright against the land bolitho looked along undines deck and saw the hands pausing in their work to watch the big ship as she tilted to the pressure her hull shining while she continued to tack clear of the anchorage thinking of home perhaps where the indiaman would eventually make her landfall or of old friends lying bandaged within her fat hull and of the others who were not here to see anything at all bolitho beckoned to penn your glass if you please only once had he been able to see viola raymond alone since undines return because of raymond or because she understood better than he that it was pointless to add to the pain of parting bolitho was still not certain a fine ship sir herrick too had a glass to think my old father wished me to go to sea in an indiaman things would have been very different i suppose bolitho tensedseeing the pale green gown on the ornate poop that same wide hat she had brought from santa cruz he could hear her words to him as if she had just spoken across the broad expanse of lively whitehorses in the bay if you come to london please visit me my husband has gained his promotion what he wanted what i thought i wanted too she had squeezed his hand i hope you got what you wanted from me a gun boomed dully from the settlement and another from the indiamans forecastle flags dipped in mutual respect bolitho felt the ache returning she was right there must be no pain only understanding peace as after a great gale of wind something which they had seized if only for a moment he thought of raymond going to a better appointment while conway returned to obscurity it was impossible to fathom while he was much as before except for that one moment or was he by trying to mould him as she would have wished her husband perhaps she had indeed changed him penn called signal sir from wessex to undine he was straining his eye to a telescope to watch the flags breaking from the indiamans yards as she laboriously spelled out her message good luck go with you acknowledge bolitho kept his eye on the pale green figure she was waving her hat slowly back and forth her autumn hair blowing unrestricted to the wind half to himself he said and with you my love some of the seamen were cheering and waving as the other vessel spread more canvas and heeled ponderously on a new tack bolitho handed the telescope to a ships boy and said well mr herrick herrick watched him and then nodded aye sir a glass of wine i think we deserve it bolitho held on to the mood keeping his eyes away from the indiaman as she stood purposefully towards the headland at least we have earned it allday watched them pass seeing bolithos hand touch his sidepocket where he carried his watch just a brief gesture but it told aliday a great deal he walked to the nettings and stared after the departing indiaman sail away my lady you have left your mark and for the better but a closer embrace he sighed neither of them would have weathered it keen joined him by the bulwark she makes a goodly sight eh allday allday looked at him aye sir you dont know the half of it but a bit too good for a poor sailorman sir keen walked away and began to pace the quarterdeck as he had watched bolitho do a hundred times or more he knew allday was laughing at him but did not care he had been tested and he had won through that was more than he had dared to hope and it was more than enough he paused by the skylight hearing bolithos laugh and herricks quiet rejoinder and he had shared all of it with them when he looked again for the indiaman she had slipped past the headland and gone from view he started to pace the deck once more actinglieutenant valentine keen of his majestys frigate undine was content span idepigraph to the contessa with love danger and death dance to the wild music of the gale and when it is night they dance with a fiercer abandon as if to allay the fears that beset the sailor men who feel their touch but see them not george h grant the admirals choice an admiralty messenger opened the door of a small anteroom and said politely if you would be so good as to wait sir he stood aside to allow captain richard bolitho to pass and added sir john knows you are here bolitho waited until the door had closed and then walked to a bright fire which was crackling below a tall mantel he was thankful that the messenger had brought him to this small room and not to one of the larger ones as he had hurried into the admiralty from the bitter march wind which was sweeping down whitehall he had been dreading a confrontation in one of those crowded waitingrooms crammed with unemployed officers who watched the comings and goings of more fortunate visitors with something like hatred bolitho had known the feeling too even though he had told himself often enough that he was better off than most for he had come back to england a year ago to find the country at peace and the gowns and villages already filling with unwanted soldiers and seamen with his home in falmouth an established estate and all the hardearned prize money he had brought with him he knew he should have been grateful he moved away from the fire and stared down at the broad roadway below the window it had been raining for most of the morning but now the sky had completely cleared so that the many puddles and ruts glittered in the harsh light like patches of pale blue silk only the steaming nostrils of countless horses which passed this way and that the hurrying figures bowed into the wind made a lie of the momentary colour he sighed it was march only just over a year since his return home from the west indies yet it seemed like a century whenever possible he had quit falmouth to make the long journey to london to this seat of admiralty to try and discover why his letters had gone unanswered why his pleas for a ship any ship had been ignored and always the waiting rooms had seemed to get more and more crowded the familiar voices and tales of ships and campaigns had become forced less confident as day by day they were turned away ships were laid up by the score and every seaport had its full quota of a wars flotsam cripples and men made deaf and blind by cannon fire others half mad from what they had seen and endured with the signing of peace the previous year such sights had become too common to mention too despairing even for hope he stiffened as two figures turned a corner below the window even without the facings on their tattered red coats he knew they had been soldiers a carriage was standing by the roadside the horses nodding their heads together as they explored the contents of their feeding bags the coachman was chatting to a smartly dressed servant from a nearby house and neither took a scrap of notice of the two tattered veterans one of them pushed his companion against a stone balustrade and then walked towards the coach bolitho realised that the man left clinging to the stonework was blind his head turned towards the roadway as if trying to hear where his friend had gone it needed no words the soldier faced the coachman and his companion and held out his hand it was neither arrogant nor servile and strangely moving the coachman hesitated and then fumbled inside his heavy coat at that moment another figure ran lightly down some steps and wrenched open the coach door he was well attired against the cold and the buckles on his shoes held the watery sunlight like diamonds he stared at the soldier and then snapped angrily at his coachman the servant ran to the horses heads and within seconds the coach was clattering away into the busy press of carriages and carts the soldier stood staring after it and then gave a weary shrug he returned to his companion and with linked arms they moved slowly around the next corner bolitho struggled with the window catch but it was stuck fast his mind reeling with anger and shame at what he had just seen a voice asked may i help sir it was the messenger again bolitho replied i was going to throw some coins to two crippled soldiers he broke off seeing the mild astonishment in the messengers eyes the man said bless you sir youd get used to such sights in london not me i was going to tell you sir that sir john will see you now bolitho followed him into the passageway again conscious of the sudden dryness in his throat he remembered so clearly his last visit here a month ago almost to the day and that time he had been summoned by letter and not left fretting and fuming in a waitingroom it had seemed like a dream an incredible stroke of good fortune it still did despite all the difficulties which had been crammed into so short a time he was to assume command immediately of his britannic majestys ship undine of thirtytwo guns then lying in the dockyard at portsmouth completing a refit as he had hurried from the admiralty on that occasion he had felt the excitement on his face like guilt aware of the other watching eyes the envy and resentment the task of taking command of gathering the dockyards resources to his aid to prepare undine for sea had cost him dearly with the navy being cut down to a quarter of its wartime strength he had been surprised to discover that it was harder to obtain spare cordage and spars rather than the reverse a weary shipwright had confided in him that dockyard officials were more intent on making a profit with private dealers than they were on aiding one small frigate he had bribed threatened and driven almost every man in the yard until he had obtained more or less what he needed it seemed they saw his departure as the only way of returning to their own affairs he had walked around his new command in her dock with mixed feelings above all the excitement and the challenge she represented gone were the pangs he had felt in falmouth whenever he had seen a manofwar weathering the headland below the castle but also he had discovered something more his last command had been phalarope a frigate very similar to undine if slightly longer by a few feet to bolitho she had been everything perhaps because they had come through so much together in the west indies at the battle of the saintes he had felt his precious phalarope battered almost to a hulk beneath him there would never could never be another like her but as he had walked up and down the stone wall of the dock he had sensed a new elation halfway through the hurried overhaul he had received an unheralded visit from rear admiral sir john winslade the man who had greeted him at the admiralty he had given little away but after a cursory inspection of the ship and bolithos preparations he had said i can tell you now im sending you to india thats all i can reveal for the moment he had run his eye over the few riggers working on yards and shrouds and had added dryly i only hope for your sake youll be ready on time there was a lot in what winslade had hinted officers on halfpay were easy to obtain to crew a kings ship without the urgency of a war or the pressgang was something else entirely had undine been sailing in betterknown waters things might have been different and had bolitho been a man other than himself he might have been tempted to keep her destination a secret until he had signed on sufficient hands and it was too late for them to escape he had had the usual floweryworded handbills distributed around the port and nearby villages he had sent recruiting parties as far inland as guildford on the portsmouth road but with small success and now as he followed the messenger towards some high gilded doors he knew undine was still fifty short of her complement in one thing bolitho had been more fortunate undines previous captain had kept a shrewd eye on his ships professional men bolitho had taken charge to discover that undine still carried the hard core of senior men the warrant officers a first class sailmaker and one of the most economical carpenters he had ever watched at work his predecessor had quit the navy for good to seek a career in parliament or as he had put it ive had a bellyful of fighting with iron from now on my young friend ill do it with slander rear admiral sir john winslade was standing with his back to a fire his coattails parted to allow the maximum warmth to reach him few people knew much about him he had distinguished himself vaguely in some singleship action off brest and had then been neatly placed inside the admiralty there was nothing about his pale austere features to distinguish him in any way in fact he was so ordinary that his goldlaced coat seemed to be wearing him rather than the other way round bolitho was twentyseven and a half years old but had already held two commands and knew enough about senior officers not to take them at face value winslade let his coattails drop and waited for bolitho to reach him he held out his hand and said you are punctual it is just as well we have much to discuss he moved to a small lacquered table some claret i think he smiled for the first time it was like the sunlight in whitehall frail and easily removed he pulled up a chair for bolitho your health captain he added i suppose you know why i asked for you to be given this command bolitho cleared his throat i assumed sir that as captain stewart was entering politics that you required another for winslade gave a wry smile please bolitho modesty at the expense of sincerity is just so much tophamper i trust you will bear that in mind he sipped at his claret and continued in the same dry voice for this particular commission i have to be sure of undines captain you will be on the other side of the globe i have to know what you are thinking so that i can act on such despatches as i might receive in due course bolitho tried to relax thank you he smiled awkwardly i mean for your trust sir quite so winslade reached for the decanter i know your background your record especially in the recent war with france and her allies your behaviour when you were on the american station reads favourably a full scale war and a bloody rebellion inamerica must have been a good schoolroom for so young a commander but that war is done with it is up to us he smiled slightly some of us to ensure that we are never forced into such a helpless stalemate again bolitho exclaimed we did not lose the war sir we did not win it either that is more to the point bolitho thought suddenly of the last battle the screams and yells on every side the crash of gunfire and falling spars so many had died that day so many familiar faces just swept away others had been left like the two ragged soldiers to fend as best they could he said quietly we did our best sir the admiral was watching him thoughtfully i agree you may not have won a war but you did win a respite of sorts a time to draw breath and face facts you think the peace will not last sir an enemy is always an enemy bolitho only the vanquished know peace of mind oh yes we will fight again be sure of it he put down his glass and added sharply now about your ship are you prepared bolitho met his gaze i am still short of hands but the ship is as ready as she will ever be sir i had her warped out of the dockyard two days ago and she is now anchored at spithead awaiting final provisioning how short two words but they left no room for manoeuvre fifty sir but my lieutenants are still trying to gather more the admiral did not blink i see well its up to you in the meantime i will obtain a warrant for you to take some volunteers from the prison hulks in portsmouth harbour bolitho said its a sad thing that we must rely on convicts they are men that is all you require at the moment as it is you will probably be doing some of the wretches a favour most of em were to be transported to the penal colonies in america now with america gone we will have to look elsewhere for new settlements there is some talk of botany bay in new holland but it may be rumour of course he stood up and walked to a window i knew your father i was saddened to hear of his death while you were in the west indies i believe he did not wait for a reply this mission would have been well cut for him something to get his teeth into selfdependence decisions to be made on the spot which could make or break the man in command everything a young frigate captain dreams of right yes sir he pictured his father as he had last seen him the very day he had sailed for the indies in phalarope a tired broken man made bitter by his other sons betrayal hugh bolitho had been the apple of his eye four years older than richard he had been a born gambler and had ended in killing a brother officer in a duel worse he had fled to america to join the revolutionary forces and later to command a privateer against the british it had been that knowledge which had really killed bolithos father no matter what the doctor had said he tightened his grip on his glass much of his prize money had gone into buying back land which his father had sold to pay hughs debts but nothing could buy back his honour it was fortunate that hugh had died if they had ever met again bolitho imagined he might kill him for what he had done more claret winslade seemed absorbed with his own thoughts im sending you to madras there you will report to well it will be in your final orders no sense in idle gossip he added just in case you cannot get your ship manned eh ill get them sir if i have to go to cornwall i hope that will not be necessary winslade changed tack again during the american campaign you probably noticed that there was little cooperation between military and civilian government the forces on the ground fought the battles and confided in neither that must not happen again the task i am giving you would be better handled by a squadron with an admirals flag for good measure but it would invite attention and that parliament will not tolerate in this uneasy peace he asked suddenly where are you staying in london the george at southwark i will give you an address a friends residence in st jamess square he smiled at bolithos grave features come dont look so gloomy it is time you made your way in affairs and put the line of battle behind you your mission may bring you to eyes other than those of jaded flag officers get to know people it can do nothing but good i will send a courier with instructions for your first lieutenant he darted him a quick glance herrick i gather from your last ship yes sir it sounded like of course there had never been any doubt whom he would ask for if he got another ship well then mr herrick it is he can take charge of local matters ill need you in london for four days he hardened his tone as bolitho looked about to protest at least the admiral regarded bolitho for several seconds craving to get back to his ship uncertain of himself in these overwhelming surroundings it was all there and more besides as bolitho had entered the room it had been like seeing his father all those long years ago tall slim with that black hair tied at the nape of his neck the loose lock which hung above his right eye told another story once as he had raised his glass it had fallen aside to display a livid scar which ran high into the hairline winslade was glad about his choice there was intelligence on bolithos grave features and compassion too which even his service in seven years of war had not displaced he could have picked from a hundred captains but he had wanted one who needed a ship and the sea and not merely the security such things represented he also required a man who could think and act accordingly not one who would rest content on the weight of his broadsides bolithos record had shown plainly enough that he was rarely content to use written orders as a substitute for initiative several admirals had growled as much when winslade had put his name forward for command but he had got his way for winslade had the weight of parliament behind him which was another rarity he sighed and picked up a small bell from the table you go and arrange to move to the address i will give you i have much to do so you may as well enjoy yourself while you can he shook the bell and a servant entered with bolithos cocked hat and sword winslade watched as the man buckled the sword deftly around his waist same old blade eh he touched it with his fingers it was very smooth and worn and a good deal lighter than more modern swords bolitho smiled aye sir my father gave it to me after i know forget about your brother bolitho he touched the hilt again your family have brought too much honour for many generations to be brought down by one man he thrust out his hand take care i daresay there are quite a few tongues wagging about your visit here today bolitho followed the servant into the corridor his mind moving restlessly from one aspect of his visit to another madras another continent and that sounded like a mere beginning to whatever it was he was supposed to do every mile sailed would have its separate challenge he smiled quietly and reward he paused in the doorway and stared at the bustling people and carriages open sea instead of noise and dirt a ship a living vital being instead of dull pretentious buildings a hand touched his arm and he turned to see a young man in a shabby blue coat studying him anxiously what is it the man said quickly im chatterton captain i was once second lieutenant in the warrior seventyfour he hesitated watching bolithos grave face i heard you were commissioning sir i was wondering im sorry mr chatterton i have a full wardroom yes sir i had guessed as much he swallowed i could sign as masters mate perhaps bolitho shook his head it is only seamen i lack im afraid he saw the disappointment clouding the mans face the old warrior had been in the thick of it she was rarely absent from any battle and men had spoken her name with pride now her second lieutenant was waiting like a beggar he said quietly if i can help he thrust his hand into his pocket tide you over awhile thank you no sir he forced a grin not yet anyway he pulled up his coat collar as he walked away he called good luck captain bolitho watched him until he was out of sight it might have been herrick he thought any of us his majestys frigate undine tugged resentfully at her cable as a stiffening southeasterly wind ripped the solent into a mass of vicious whitecaps lieutenant thomas herrick turned up the collar of his heavy watchcoat and took another stroll across the quarterdeck his eyess slitted against a mixture of rain and spray which made the taut rigging shine in the poor light like black glass despite the weather there was still plenty of activity on deck and alongside in the pitching store boats and water lighters here and there on the gangways and right forward in the eyes of the ship the red coats of watchful marines made a pleasant change from the mixtures of dull grey elsewhere the marines were supposed to ensure that the traffic in provisions and lastmoment equipment was one way and none was escaping through an open port as barter for cheap drink or other favours with friends ashore herrick grinned and stamped his feet on the wet planking they had done a lot of work in the month since he had joined the ship others might curse the weather the uncertainties offered by a long voyage the prospect of hardship from sea and wind but not he the past year had been far more of a burden for him and he was glad no thankful to be back aboard a kings ship he had entered the navy when he was still a few weeks short of twelve years old and these last long months following the signing of peace with france and the recognition of american independence had been his first experience of being away from the one life he understood and trusted unlike many of his contemporaries herrick had nothing but his own resources to sustain him he came of a poor family his father being a clerk in their home town of rochester in kent when lie had gone there after paying off the phalarope and saying his farewell to bolitho he had discovered things to be even worse than he had expected his fathers health had deteriorated and he seemed to be coughing his life away day in day out herricks only sister was a cripple and incapable of doing much but help her mother about the house so his homecoming was seen in rather different ways from his own sense of rejection a friend of his fathers employer had gained him an appointment as mate in a small brig which earned a living carrying general cargo up and down the east coast and occasionally across the channel to holland the owner was a miserly man who kept the brig so shorthanded that there were barely enough men to work ship let along handle cargo load lighters and keep the vessel in good repair when he had received bolithos letter accompanied by his commission from the admiralty charging him to report on board undine he had been almost too stunned to realise his good fortune he had not seen bolitho since that one last visit to his home in falmouth and perhaps deep inside he had believed that their friendship which had strengthened in storm and under bloody broadsides would be no match for peace their worlds were after all too far apart bolithos great stone house had seemed like a palace to herrick his background his ancestry of seafaring officers put him in a different sphere entirely herrick was the first in his family to go to sea and that was the least of their differences but bolitho had not changed when they had met on this same quarterdeck a month ago he had known it with that first glance it was still there the quiet sadness which could give way to something like boyish excitement in the twinkling of an eye above all bolitho too was pleased to be back keen to test himself and his new ship whenever a chance offered itself a midshipman scuttled over the deck and touched his hat cutters returning sir he was small pinched with cold he had been aboard just three weeks thank you mr penn thatll be some new hands i hope he eyed the boy unsympathetically now smarten yourself the captain may be returning today he continued his pacing bolitho had been in london for five days it would be good to hear his news to get the order to sail from this bitter solent he watched the cutter lifting and plunging across the whitecaps the oars moving sluggishly despite the efforts of the boats coxswain he saw the cocked hat of john soames the third lieutenant in the sternsheets and wondered if he had had any luck with recruits in the phalarope herrick had begun his commission as third lieutenant rising to bolithos secondincommand as those above him died in combat he wondered briefly if soames was already thinking of his own prospects in the months ahead he was a giant of a man and in his thirtieth year three years older than herrick he had got his commission as lieutenant very late in life and by a roundabout route mostly as far as herrick could gather in the merchant service and later as masters mate in a kings ship tough selftaught he was hard to know a suspicious man quite different from villiers davy the second lieutenant as his name suggested he was of good family with the money and proud looks to back up his quicksilver wit herrick was not sure of him either but told himself that any dislike he might harbour was because davy reminded him of an arrogant midshipman they had carried in phalarope feet thumped on deck and he turned to see triphook the purser crouching through the drizzle a bulky ledger under his coat the purser grimaced evil day mr herrick he gestured to the boats alongside god damn those thieves theyd rob a blind man so they would herrick chuckled not like you pursers eh triphook eyed him severely he was stooped and very thin with large yellow teeth like a mournful horse i hope that was not seriously meant sir herrick craned over the dripping nettings to watch the cutter hooking on to the chains god their oarsmanship was bad bolitho would expect far better and before too long he snapped easy mr triphook but i was merely reminding you i recall we had a purser in my last ship a man called evans he lined his pockets at the peoples expense gave them foul food when they had much to trouble them in other directions triphook watched him doubtfully what happened captain bolitho made him pay for fresh meat from his own purse cask for cask with each that was rotten he grinned so be warned my friend hell have no cause to fault me mr herrick he walked away his voice lacking conviction as he added you can be certain of that lieutenant soames came aft touching his hat and scowling at the deck as he reported five hands sir ive been on the road all day im fair hoarse from calling the tune of those handbills herrick nodded he could sympathise he had done it often enough himself five hands they still needed thirty even then it would not allow for death and injury to be expected on any long voyage soames asked thickly any more news none just that we are to sail for madras but i think it will be soon now soames said good riddance to the land i say streets full of drunken men prime hands we could well do with he hesitated with your permission i might take a boat away tonight and catch a few as they reel from their damn ale houses eh they turned as a shriek of laughter echoed up from the gun deck and a woman her breasts bare to the rain ran from beneath the larboard gangway she was pursued by two seamen both obviously the worse for drink who left little to the imagination as to their intentions herrick barked tell that slut to get below or ill have her thrown over the side he saw the astonished midshipman watching the spectacle with wideeyed wonder and added harshly mr penn jump to it i say soames showed a rare grin offend your feelings mr herrick herrick shrugged i know it is supposed to be the proper thing to allow our people women and drink in harbour he thought of his sister anchored in that damned chair what he would give to see her running free like that portsmouth trollop but it never fails to sicken me soames sighed half the bastards would desert otherwise signed on or not the romance of madras soon wears off when the rum goes short herrick said what you asked earlier i cannot agree it would be a bad beginning men taken in such a way would harbour plenty of grievances one rotten apple can sour a full barrel soames eyes him calmly it seems to me that this ship is almost full of bad apples the volunteers are probably on the run from debt or the hangman himself some are aboard just to see what they can lay their fingers on when we are many miles from proper authority herrick replied captain bolitho will have sufficient authority mr soames i forgot you were in the same ship there was a mutiny it sounded like an accusation not of his making he turned on him angrily be so good as to have the new men fed and issued with slop clothing he waited watching the resentment in the big mans eyes he added another of our captains requirements i suggest you acquaint yourself with his demands life will be easier for you soames strode away and herrick relaxed he must not let him get into his skin so easily but any criticism or even hint of it always affected him to herrick bolitho represented all the things he would like to be the fact he also knew some of his secret faults as well made him doubly sure of his loyalty he shook his head it was stronger even than that he peered over the nettings towards the shore seeing the walls of the harbour battery glinting like lead in the rain beyond portsmouth point the land was almost hidden in murk it would be good to get away his pay would mount up and go towards helping out at home with his share of prize money which he gained under bolitho in the west indies he had been able to buy several small luxuries to make their lot easier until his next return and when might that be two years it was better never to contemplate such matters he saw a ships boy duck into the rain to turn the hourglass beside the deserted wheel and waited for him to chime the hour on the bell time to send the working part of the watch below he grimaced the wardroom might be little better soames under a cloud of inner thought davy probing his guard with some new smart jest or other giles bellairs the captain of marines well on the way to intoxication by this time knowing his hefty sergeant could deal with the affairs of his small detachment triphook probably brooding over the issue of clothing to the new men typical of the purser he could face the prospect of a great sea voyage with each league measured in salt pork and beef ironhard biscuit juice to prevent scurvy beer and spirits to supplement fresh water which would soon be alive in its casks and all the thousand other items under his control with equanimity but one small issue of clothing while they still wore what they had come aboard in was too much for his sense of values he would learn he grinned into the cold wind they all would once bolitho brought the ship alive more shouts from alongside and penn the midshipman called anxiously beg pardon sir but i fear the surgeon is in difficulties herrick frowned the surgeons name was charles whitmarsh a man of culture but one with something troubling him most ships surgeons in herricks experience had been butchers nobody else would go to sea and face the horrors of mangled men screaming and dying after a savage battle with the enemy in peacetime he had expected it might be different whitmarsh was a drunkard as herrick peered down at the jolly boat as it bobbed and curtsied at the chains he saw a boatswains mate and two seamen struggling to fit the surgeon into a bowline to assist his passage up the side he was a big man almost as large as soames and in the grey light his features shone with all the brightness of a marines coat herrick snapped have a cargo net lowered mr penn it is not dignified but neither is this by god whitmarsh landed eventually on the gun deck his hair awry his face set in a great beaming smile one of his assistants and two marines lifted him bodily and took him aft below the quarterdeck he would sleep in his small sickbay for a few hours and then begin again penn asked nervously is he unwell sir herrick looked at the youth gravely a thought tipsy lad but well enough to remove a limb or two i daresay he relented and touched his shoulder go below your relief will be up soon he watched him hurry away and grinned it was hard to recall that he had been like penn unsure frightened with each hour presenting some new sight and sound to break his boys illusions a marine yelled guardboat shovin off from the sallyport sir herrick nodded very well that would mean orders for the undine he let his gaze move forward between the tall spiralling masts with their taut maze of shrouds and rigging the neatly furled canvas and to the bowsprit below which undines beautiful fullbreasted figurehead of a waternymph stared impassively to every horizon it also meant that bolitho would be returning today and for thomas herrick that was more than enough free of the land captain richard bolitho stood in the shelter of the stone wall beside the sallyport and peered through the chilling drizzle it was afternoon but with the sky so overcast by low cloud it could have been much later he was tired and stiff from the long coach ride and the journey had been made especially irritating by his two jovial companions businessmen from the city of london they had become more loudvoiced after each stop for change of horses and refreshment at the many inns down the portsmouth road they were off to france in a packet ship to contact new agencies there and so with luck expand their trade to bolitho it was still hard to accept just a year back the channel had been the only barrier between this country and their common enemy the moat the last ditch as some newssheet had described it now it seemed as if it was all forgotten by such men as his travelling companions it had become merely an irritating delay which made their journey just so much longer he shrugged his shoulders deeper inside his boatcloak suddenly impatient for the last moments to pass so that he could get back to the ship the cloak was new from a good london tailor rear admiral winslades friend had taken him there and managed to do so without making bolitho feel the complete ignoramus he smiled to himself despite his other uncertainties he would never get used to london too large too busy where nobody had time to draw breath and noisy no wonder the rich houses around st jamess square had sent servants out every few hours to spread fresh straw on the roadway the grinding roar of carriage wheels was enough to wake the dead it had been a beautiful house his hosts charming if slightly amused by his questions even now he was still unsure of their strange ways it was not just enough to live in that fine fashionable residence with its splendid spiral staircase and huge chandeliers to be right you had to live on the best side of the square the east side winslades friends lived there bolitho smiled again they would bolitho had met several very influential people and his hosts had given two dinner parties with that in mind he knew well enough from past experience that without their help it would have been impossible aboard ship a captain was next only to god in london society he hardly registered at ail but that was behind him now he was back his orders would be waiting and only the actual time of weighing anchor was left to conjecture he peered round the wall once more feeling the wind on his face like a whip the signal tower had informed undine of his arrival and very soon now a boat would arrive at the wooden pier below the wall he wondered how his coxswain allday was managing his first ship as captains coxswain but bolitho understood him well enough to know there was little to fear on his behalf it would be good to see him too something familiar a face to hold on to he glanced up the narrow street to where some servants from the george inn where the coach had finally come to rest were guarding his pile of luggage he thought of the personal purchases he had made maybe london had got some hold on him after all when bolitho had got his first command of the sloop sparrow during the american revolution he had had little time to acquaint himself with luxuries but in london with the remains of his prize money he had made up for it new shirts and some comfortable shoes this great boatcloak which the tailor had assured him would keep out even the heaviest downpour it had been partly winslades doing he was certain of that his host had casually mentioned that bolithos mission in undine required not merely a competent captain but one who would look the part no matter what sort of government official he might meet there was he had added gently a matter of wine together they had gone to a lowbeamed shop in st jamess street it was not a bit what bolitho might have imagined it had the sign of a coffee mill outside its door and the owners names pickering and clarke painted in gold leaf above it was a friendly place even intimate it could almost have been falmouth it was to be hoped the wine had already arrived aboard undine otherwise it was likely he would have to sail without it and leave a large hole in his purse as well it would be a strange and exciting sensation to sit in his cabin hundreds of miles from england and sample some of that beautiful madeira it would bring back all those pictures of london again the buildings the clever talk the way women looked at you once or twice he had felt uneasy about that it had reminded him bitterly of new york during the war the boldness in their faces the confident arrogance which had seemed like second nature to them an idler called yer boats acomin capn he touched his hat ill give ee a and he hurried away to call the inn servants his mind dwelling on what he might expect from a frigates captain bolitho stepped out into the wind his hat jammed well down over his forehead it was the undines launch her largest boat the oars rising and falling like gulls wings as she headed straight for the pier it must be a hard pull he thought otherwise allday would have brought the gig he found he was trembling and it was all he could do to prevent a grin from splitting his face in two the dark green launch the oarsmen in their checked shirts and white trousers it was all there like a homecoming the oars rose in the air and stood like twin lines of swaying white bones while the bowman made fast to the jetty and aided a smart midshipman to step ashore the latter removed his hat with a flourish and said at your service sir it was midshipman valentine keen a very elegant young man who was being appointed to the undine more to get him away from england than to further his naval advancement bolitho suspected he was the senior midshipman and if he survived the round voyage would probably return as a lieutenant at any rate as a man my boxes are yonder mr keen he saw allday standing motionless in the sternsheets his blue coat and white trousers flapping in the wind his tanned features barely able to remain impassive theirs was a strange relationship allday had come aboard bolithos last ship as a pressed man yet when the ship had paid off at the end of the war allday had stayed with him at falmouth servant guardian trusted friend now as his coxswain he would be ever nearby sometimes an only contact with that other remote world beyond the cabin bulkhead allday had been a seaman all his life but for a period when he had been a shepherd in cornwall where bolithos pressgang had found him an odd beginning bolitho thought of his previous coxswain mark stockdale a battered exprizefighter who could hardly speak because of his maimed vocal cords he had died protecting bolithos back at the saintes poor stockdale bolitho had not even seen him fall allday clambered ashore everythings ready captain a good meal in the cabin he snarled at one of the seamen grab that chest you oaf or ill have your liver the seaman nodded and grinned bolitho was satisfied alldays strange charm seemed to be working already he could curse and fight like a madman if required but bolitho had seen him caring for wounded men and knew his other side it was no wonder that the girls in farms and villages around falmouth would miss him better though for allday bolitho decided there had been rumours enough lately about his conquests then at last it was all done the boat loaded the idler and servants paid the oars sending the long launch purposefully through the tossing water bolitho sat in silence huddled in his cloak his eyes on the distant frigate she was beautiful in some ways more so than phalarope if that were possible only four years old she had been built in a yard at frindsbury on the river medway not far from herricks home one hundred and thirty feet long on her gun deck and built of good english oak she was the picture of a shipbuilders art no wonder the admiralty had been loath to lay her up in ordinary like so many of her consorts at the end of the war she had cost nearly fourteen thousand pounds as bolitho had been told more than once not that he needed to be reminded he was lucky to get her there was a brief break in the scudding clouds and the watery light played down along undines gun ports to her clean sheathing as she rolled uneasily in the swell best anglesey copper stout enough for anything bolitho recalled what her previous captain stewart had confided in a fierce skirmish off ushant he had been raked by heavy guns from a french seventyfour undine had taken four balls right on her waterline she had been fortunate to reach england afloat frigates were meant for speed and hitandrun fighting not for matching metal with a line of battleship bolitho knew from his own grim experience what that could do to so graceful a hull stewart had added that despite careful supervision he was still unsure as to the perfection of the repairs with the copper replaced it took more than internal inspection to discover the true value of a dockyards overhaul copper protected the hull from many sorts of weed and clinging growth which could slow a ship to a painful crawl but behind it could lurk every captains real enemy rot rot which could change a perfect hull into a ripe treacherous trap for the unwary admiral kempenfelts own flagship the royal george had heeled over and sunk right here in portsmouth just two years ago with the loss of hundreds of lives it was said that her bottom had fallen clean away with rot if it could happen to a lofty firstrate at anchor it would do worse to a frigate bolitho came out of his thoughts as he heard the shrill of boatswains calls above the wind the stamp of feet as the marines prepared to receive him he stared up at the towering masts the movement of figures around the entry port and above in the shrouds they had had a month to get used to seeing him about the ship except for the unknown quantity the newly recruited part of the company they might be wondering about him now what he was like too harsh or too easygoing to them once the anchor was catted he was everything good or bad skilful or incompetent there was no other ear to listen to their complaints no other voice to reward or punish easy all allday stood half poised the tiller bar in his fist toss your oars the boat thrust forward and the bowman hooked on to the main chains at the first attempt bolitho guessed that allday had been busy during his stay in london he stood up and waited for the right moment knowing allday was watching like a cat in case he should slip between launch and ship or worse tumble backwards in a welter of flailing arms and legs bolitho had seen it happen and recalled his own cruel amusement at the spectacle of his new captain arriving aboard in a dripping heap then with the spray barely finding time to catch his legs he was up and on board his ears ringing to the shrill of calls and to the slap of marines muskets while they presented arms he doffed his hat to the quarterdeck and nodded to herrick and the others good to be back mr herrick his tone was curt welcome aboard sir herrick was equally so but their eyes shone with something more than routine formality something which none of the others saw or shared bolitho removed his cloak and handed it to midshipman penn he turned to allow the fading light to play across the broad white lapels of his dress coat they would all know he was here he saw the few hands working aloft on last minute splicing others crowded on gangways and down on the main deck between the twin lines of black twelvepounder guns he smiled amused at his own gesture i will go below now i have placed the orders in your cabin sir herrick was bursting with questions it was obvious from his flat formal voice but his eyes those eyes which were so blue and which could look so hurt made a lie of his rigidity very well i will call you directly he made to walk aft to the cabin hatchway when he saw some figures gathered just below the quarterdeck rail in mixed garments they were in the process of being checked against a list by lieutenant davy he called new hands mr davy herrick said quietly we are still thirty under strength sir aye sir davy squinted up through the light drizzle his handsome face set in a confident smile i am about to get them to make their marks bolitho crossed to the ladder and ran down to the gun deck god how wretched they all looked halfstarved ragged beaten even the demanding life aboard ship could surely be no worse than what had made them thus he watched davys neat elegant hands as he arranged the book on top of a twelvepounders breech come along now make your marks they shuffled forward selfconscious awkward and very aware that their new captain was nearby bolithos eye stopped on the one at the end of the line a sturdy man wellmuscled and with a pigtail protruding from beneath his battered hat one prime seaman at least he realised bolitho was watching him and hurried forward to the gun davy snapped here now hold your damn eagerness bolitho asked your name he hesitated turpin sir davy was getting angry stand still and remove your hat to the captain damn your eyes if you know anything you should know respect but the man stood stockstill his face a mixture of despair and shame bolitho reached out and removed an old coat which turpin had been carrying across his right forearm he asked gently where did you lose your right hand turpin the man lowered his eyes i was in the barfear sir i lost it at the chesapeake in he looked up his eyes showing pride but only briefly gun captain i was sir davy interjected i am most sorry sir i did not realise the fellow was crippled i will have him sent ashore bolitho said you intended to sign the articles with your left hand is it that important turpin nodded im a seaman sir he looked round angrily as one of the recruited men nudged his companion not like some he turned back to bolitho his voice falling away i can do anything sir bolitho hardly heard him he was thinking back to the chesapeake the smoke and din the columns of wheeling ships like armoured knights at agincourt you never got away from it this man turpin had been nearby like hundreds of others cheering and dying cursing and working their guns like souls possessed he thought of the two fat merchants on the coach so men like that could grow richer he said harshly sign him on mr davy one hand from the old barfleur will be more use to me than many others he strode aft beneath the quarterdeck angry with himself and with davy for not having the compassion to understand it was a stupid thing to do pointless allday was carrying one of the chests aft to the cabin where a marine stood like a toy soldier beneath the spiralling deckhead lantern he said cheerfully that was a good thing you just did captain dont talk like a fool allday he strode past him and winced as his head grazed an overhead beam when he glared back at allday his coxswains homely features were quite expressionless he could probably do your work allday nodded gravely aye sir it is true that i am overtaxed damn your impertinence it was useless with allday i dont know why i tolerate you allday took his sword and walked with it to the cabin bulkhead i once knew a man in bodmin captain he stood back and studied the sword critically used to hammer a block of wood with a blunt axe he did i asked him why he didnt use a sharper blade and finish the job properly allday turned and smiled calmly he said that when the wood was broken hed have nothing to work his temper on bolitho sat down at the table thank you i must remember to get a better axe allday grinned my pleasure captain he strode out to fetch another chest bolitho pulled the heavy sealed envelope towards him with some education behind him allday might have become almost anything he slit open the envelope and smiled to himself without it he was quite bad enough herrick stepped into the cabin his hat tucked under one arm you sent for me sir bolitho was standing by the great stern windows his body moving easily with the ships motion undine had swung her stern to the change of tide and through the thick glass herrick could see the distant lights of portsmouth point glimmering and changing shape through the droplets of rain and spray in the pitching deckhead lanterns the cabin looked snug and inviting the bench seat around the stern was covered with fine green leather and bolithos desk and chairs stood out against the deck covering of black and white checked canvas like ripe chestnut sit down thomas bolitho turned slowly and looked at him he had been back aboard for over an hour reading and rereading his orders to ensure he would miss nothing he added we will weigh tomorrow afternoon i have a warrant in my orders which entitles me to accept volunteers from the convict hulks in portsmouth i would be obliged if you would attend to that as soon after first light as is convenient herrick nodded watching bolithos grave features noting the restless movements of his hands the fact that his carefully prepared meal lay untouched in the adjoining dining space he was troubled uncertain about something bolitho said we are to sail for teneriffe he saw herrick stiffen and added quietly i know thomas you are like me it comes hard to tack freely into a port where months back we could have expected a somewhat different welcome herrick grinned heated shot no doubt there we will embark two maybe three passengers after replenishing whatever stores we lack we will proceed without further delay to our destination madras he seemed to be musing aloud over twelve thousand miles long enough to get to know one another and our ship the orders state that we will proceed with all haste for that reason we must ensure our people learn their work well i want no delays because of carelessness or unnecessary damage to canvas and rigging herrick rubbed his chin a long haul aye thomas a hundred days that is what i intend he smiled the gravity fading instantly with your help of course herrick nodded may i ask what we are expected to accomplish bolitho looked down at the folded sheets of his orders i still know very little but i have read quite a lot between the lines he began to pace from side to side his shadow moving unevenly with the roll of the hull when the war ended thomas it was necessary to make concessions to restore a balance we had captured trincomalee in ceylon from the dutch the finest naval harbour and the best placed in the indian ocean the french admiral suffren captured it from us and when war ended gave it back to holland we have returned many west indian islands to france as well as her indian stations and spain well she has been given back minorca he shrugged many men on both sides died for nothing it seems herrick sounded confused but what of us sir did we get nothing out of all this bolitho smiled i believe we are about to do so hence the extreme secrecy and our vague orders concerning teneriffe he paused and looked down at the stocky lieutenant without trincomalee we are in the same position as before the war we still need a good harbour for our ships a base to control a wide area a steppingstone to expand the east indies trade herrick grunted id have thought the east india company had got all it wanted bolithos mind returned to the men on the coach others he had met in london there are those in authority who see power as the essential foundation of national superiority commercial wealth as a means to such power he glanced at a twelvepounder gun at the forward end of his cabin its squat outline masked by a chintz cover and war as the means to all three herrick bit his lip and we are to be the probe so to speak i may be quite wrong thomas but you must know my thinking just in case things go against us he remembered winslades words at the admiralty the task i anm giving yon would be better handled by a squadron he wanted someone he could trust or did he merely need a scapegoat should things go wrong bolitho had always complained bitterly about being tied to too strict orders his new ones were so vague that he felt even more restricted only one thing was clear he would take on board a mr james raymond at teneriffe and place the ship at his disposal raymond was a trusted government courier and would be carrying the latest despatches to madras herrick remarked it will take some getting used to but being at sea again in a ship such as undine will make a world of difference bolitho nodded we must ensure that our people are prepared for anything peace or no peace where we are going they may be less inclined to accept our views without argument he sat down on the bench and stared through the spattered glass i will speak with the other officers at eight bells tomorrow while you are in the hulks he smiled at herricks reflection i am sending you because you will understand youll not frighten them all to death he stood up quickly now thomas we will take a glass of claret herrick leaned forward that was a goodly selection you had sent from london sir bolitho shook his head we will save that for more trying times he lifted a decanter from its rack this is more usual to our tastes they drank their claret in comfortable silence bolitho was thinking how strange it was to be sitting quietly when the voyage which lay ahead demanded so much of all of them but it was useless to prowl about the decks or poke into stores and spirit rooms undine was ready for sea as ready as she could ever be he thought of his officers the extensions of his ideas and authority he knew little of any of them soames was a competent seaman but was inclinded to harshness when things did not go right immediately his superior davy was harder to know outwardly cool and unruffled he had a ruthless streak like many of his kind the sailing master was called ezekiel mudge a broad lump of a man who looked old enough to be his grandfather in fact he vas sixty and certainly the oldest master bolitho had met old mudge would prove to be one of the most important when they reached the indian ocean he had originally served in the east india company and had endured more storms shipwrecks pirates and a dozen other hazards than any man alive if his record was to be believed he had a huge beaked nose with the eyes perched on either side of it like tiny bright stones a formidable person and one who would be watching his captains seamanship for flaws bolitho was certain of that the three midshipmen seemed fairly average penn was the youngest and had come aboard three days after his twelfth birthday keen and armitage were both seventeen but whereas the former showed the same elegant carelessness as lieutenant davy armitage appeared to be forever looking over his shoulder a mothers boy four days after he had reported aboard with his gleaming new uniform and polished dirk his mother had in fact come to portsmouth to visit him her husband was a man of some influence and she had swept into the dockyard in a beautiful carriage like some visiting duchess bolitho had greeted her briefly and allowed her to meet armitage in the seclusion of the wardroom if she had seen the actual quarters where her child was to serve his months at sea she would probably have collapsed he had had to send herrick in the end to interrupt the embraces and the mothers plaintive sobs with a feeble excuse about armitage being required for duty duty he could hardly move abous the ship without falling headlong over a block or a ringbolt giles bellairs the debonair captain of marines was more like a caricature than a real person incredibly smart shoulders always rigidly squared he looked as if he had had his uniforms moulded around his limbs like wax he spoke in short clipped sentences and barely extended much beyond matters of hunting wildfowling and of course drill his marines were his whole life although he hardly ever seemed to utter much in the way of orders his massive sergeant coaker took care of the close contact with the marines and bellairs contented himself with an occasional carry on sarnt coaker or i say sarnt that fellahs like a bundle of old rags what he was one of the few people in bolithos experience who could get completely drunk without any outward change of expression triphook the purser appeared very competent if grudging with his rations he had taken a lot of care to ensure that the victualling yard had not filled the lower hold with rotten casks to be discovered too late to take action that in itself was rare bolithos thoughts came back to the surgeon he had been aboard for two weeks had he been able to get a replacement he would have done so whitmarsh was a drunkard in the worst sense sober he had a quiet even gentle manner drunk which was often he seemed to come apart like an old sail in a sudden squall he tightened his jaw whitmarsh would mend his ways or else feet scraped across the planks overhead and herrick said theres a few below decks tonight wholl be wondering if theyve done aright by signing on he chuckled too late now bolitho stared astern at the black swirling water hearing the urgent tide banging and squeaking around the rudder aye its a long step from land to sea far more so than most people realise he returned his glass to the rack i think i shall turn in now it will be a long day tomorrow herrick stood up and nodded ill bid you goodnight sir he knew full well that bolitho would stay awake for hours yet pacing and planning searching for lastminute faults possible mistakes in the arrangement of watchbills and delegation of duties bolitho would know he was aware of this fact too the door closed and bolitho walked right aft to lean his hands on the centre sill he could feel the woodwork vibrating under his palms the hull trembling all around him in time to the squeak of stays the clatter and slap of halliards and blocks who would watch them go would anyone care one more ship slipping down channel like hundreds before her there was a nervous tap at the door and noddall the cabin servant pattered into the lantern light a small man with the pointed face of an anxious rodent he even held his hands in front of him like two nervous paws yer supper sir youve not touched it he started to gather up the plates wont do sir it wont do bolitho smiled as noddall scampered away to his pantry he was so absorbed in his own little world it seemed as if he had not even noticed there was a change of command he threw his new cloak across his shoulders and left the cabin on the pitchdark quarterdeck he groped his way aft to the taffrail and stared towards the land countless lights and hidden houses he turned and looked along his ship the wind blowing his hair across his face the chill making him hold his breath the riding light reflected on the taut shrouds like pale gold and right forward he saw a smaller lantern where the lonely anchor watch kept a wary eye on the cable it felt different he decided no sentries on each gangway to watch for a sneak attack or a mass attempt at desertion no nets to delay a sudden rush of enemy boarders he touched a quarterdeck sixpounder with one hand it felt like wet ice but for how long he wondered the masters mate of the watch prowled past and then sheered away as he saw his captain by the rail alls well zur he called thank you bolitho did not know the mans name not yet in the next hundred days he would know more than their names he thought as they would about him with a sigh he returned to his cabin his hair plastered to his head his cheeks tingling from the cold there was no sign of noddall but the cot was ready for him and there was something hot in a mug nearby a minute after his head was or the pillow he was fast asleep the next day dawned as grey as the one before but overnight the rain had stopped and the wind held firm from the southeast all forenoon the work went on without relaxation the petty officers checking and rechecking their lists of names putting them to faces making sure seasoned hands were spaced among the untried and untrained bolitho dictated a final report to his clerk a driedup man named pope and then signed it in readiness for the last boat he found time to speak with his officers and seek out mr tapril the gunner in his magazine to discuss moving some of the spare gun parts and tackle further aft and help adjust the vessels trim until she had consumed some of her own stores to compensate for it he was changing into his seagoing coat with its faded lace and dull buttons when herrick entered the cabin and reported he had brought fifteen new man from the hulks what was it like herrick sighed it was a sort of hell sir i could have got treble the number a whole company of em if id been able to bring their women and wives too bolitho paused as he tied his neckcloth women in the hulks aye sir iierrick shuddered i hope i never see the like again very well sign them on but dont give them anything to do just yet i doubt theyve the strength to lift a marlin spike after being penned up like that a midshipman appeared in the open door mr davys respect sir his eyes darted around the cabin missing nothing and the anchors hove short thank you bolitho smiled next time stay awhile mr penn and have a better look the boy vanished and bolitho looked steadily at herrick well thomas herrick nodded firmly aye sir im ready its been a long wait they climbed up to the quarterdeck together and while herrick moved to the forward rail with his speaking trumpet bolitho stood aft a little apart from the others who were gathered restlessly at their stations clink clink clink the capstan was turning more slowly now the mens backs bent almost double as the hull pulled heavilyy on the anchor bolitho looked at the masters untidy shape beside the double wheel he had four helmsmen he was taking no chances it seemed with the helm or his new captains skill get the ship under way if you please he saw herricks trumpet moving once clear of this local shipping we will lay her on the larboard tack and steer souwest by west old mudge nodded heavily one eye hidden beyond the headland of a nose aye aye sir herrick yelled stand by on the capstan he shaded his eyes to peer up at the masthead pendant loose headsls the answering flap and clatter of released canvas made several new men peer round confused and startled a petty officer thrust a line into a mans hand and bellowed old it you bugger dont stand there like a bloody woman bolitho saw a bosuns mate right forward astride the bowsprit one arm circling above his head as the cable grew stiffer and more vertical beneath the gilded waternymph hands aloft loose topsls bolitho relaxed slightly as the nimblefooted topmen swarmed up the ratlines on either beam no sense in rushing it this first time the watching eyes ashore could think what they liked hed get no thanks for letting her drive ashore man the braces herrick was hanging over the rail his trumpet moving from side to side like a coachmans blunderbuss lively there mr shellabeer get those damned idlers aft on the double i say shellabeer was the boatswain a swarthy taciturn man who looked more like a spaniard than a devonian bolitho leaned back his hands on his hips watching the swift figures dashing out on the vibrating yards like monkeys it made him feel sick to watch their indifference to such heights first one then the next great topsail billowed and banged loosely in confusion while the seamen on the yards clung on calling to each other or jeering at their opposite numbers on the other masts anchors aweigh sir like a thing released from chains the frigate swung dizzily across the steep troughs men falling and slithering at the braces as they fought to haul the great yards round to cup the wind and master it lee braces there heave away herrick was hoarse bolitho gritted his teeth and forced himself to remain quite still as she plunged further and further astride the wind here and there a bosuns mate struck out with his rope starter or pushed a man bodily to brace or halliard then with a booming roar like thunder the sails filled and hardened to the winds steady thrust the deck canting over and holding steady as the helmsmen threw themselves on their spokes he made himself take a glass from midshipman keen and trained it across the starboard quarter keeping his face impassive even though he was almost shaking with excitement and relief the sail drill was very bad the placing of trained men too sketchy for comfort but they were away free of the land he saw a few people on the point watching them heel over on the larboard tack the top of a shining carriage just below the wall perhaps it was armitages mother weeping as she watched her offspring being taken from her the master shouted gruffly souwest by west sir full an bye when bolitho turned to answer him he saw that the master was nodding with something like approval thank you mr mudge we will get the courses on her directly he walked forward to join herrick at the rail his body angled steeply to the deck some of the confusion was being cleared with men picking their way amidst loose coils of rope like survivors from a battle herrick looked at him sadly it was terrible sir i agree mr herrick he could not restrain a smile but it will improve eh by late afternoon undine had beaten clear of the isle of wight and was standing well out in the channel by evening only her reefed topsails were visible and soon even they had disappeared a mixed gathering on the morning of the fourteenth day after weighing anchor at spithead bolitho was in his cabin sipping a mug of coffee and pondering for the countless time on what he had achieved the previous evening they had sighted the dull hump of teneriffe sprawled like a cloud across the horizon and he had decided to heaveto and avoid the hazards of a night approach fourteen days it felt an eternity they had been plagued by foul weather for much of that time flicking over the pages of his personal log he could see the countless frustrating entries headwinds occasional but fierce gales and the constant need to shorten sail to reef down and ride it out as best they could the dreaded bay of biscay had been kind to them that at least was a mercy otherwise with almost half the ships company too seasick to venture aloft or too terrified to scramble out along the dizzily pitching yards without physical violence being used on them it was likely undine might have reached no further bolitho appreciated what it must be like for many of his men shrieking winds overcrowded conditions in a creaking rolling hull where their food if they could face it often ended up in a mess of bilge water and vomit it produced a kind of numbness like that given to a man left abandoned in the sea for a while he strikes out bravely swimming he knows not where until he is too exhausted too dazed to care he is without authority or any sort of guidance it is his turning point bolitho recognised all the signs well enough and knew it was the same sort of challenge for him give in to his own understanding and sympathy listen too much to excuses from his hardworked lieutenants and warrant officers and he would never regain control or be able to rally his company when the real pressure came he knew that many cursed him behind his back prayed for him to fall dead or vanish overboard in the night he saw their glances sensed their resentment as he pushed them through each day each hour of every one of those days sail drill and more drill against herricks watch while he himself made sure all engaged knew he was following their efforts he made the men on undines three masts race each other in their struggle to shorten or make more sail until finally he drove them even harder to work not in competition but as a gasping silently cursing team now as he sat with the mug in his hands he found some grudging satisfaction in what they had done what they had achieved together willingly or otherwise when undine dropped her anchor in the roads of santa cruz today the watching spaniards would see a semblance of order and discipline of efficiency which they had come to know and fear in times of war but if he had driven his company to the limit he had not spared himself either and he was feeling it despite the inviting rays of early sunshine which made reflections dance across the low deckhead barely a watch had passed without his going on deck to lend his presence lieutenant davy had little experience of handling a ship in foul weather but would learn given time soames was too prone to lose patience when faced with a disaster on deck he would knock some luckless seaman aside and leap into his place yelling youre useless id rather do it myself only herrick rode out the storm of bolithos persistent demands and bolitho felt sorry that his friend had been made to carry the brunt of the work it was too easy to punish men when in fact it was an officers fault for losing his own head or not being able to find the right words in the teeth of a raging gale herrick stood firmly between wardroom and lower deck and twixt captain and company there had even been two floggings something which he had hoped to avoid each case had been within the private world of the lower deck the first a simple one of stealing from another sailors small hoard of money the second far more serious had been a savage knifefight which had ended in a man having his face opened from ear to jaw it was still not certain if he would live a real grudge fight a momentary spark of anger caused by fatigue and constant work he did not really know in a welltrained ship of war it was likely he would never have heard about either case the justice of the lower deck was far more drastic and instant when their own world was threatened by a thief or one too fond of his knife bolitho despised captains who used authority without consideration for the misery it might entail who meted out savage punishment without getting to the root of the trouble and thereby avoiding it herrick knew how he felt when bolitho had first met him he had been the junior lieutenant in his ship a ship where the previous captain had been so severe so unthinkingly brutal with his punishments that the seeds of mutiny had been well and truly laid herrick knew better than most about such things and yet he had intervened personally to persuade bolitho to avoid the floggings it was their first real disagreement and bolitho had hated to see the sudden hurt in herricks eyes bolitho had said this is a new company it takes time to weld people together so that each can rely on his companion under all circumstances many are entirely ignorant of the navys ways and its demands they hate to see others getting away with crimes they themselves avoid at this stage we cannot allow them to split into separate groups old hands and the new recruits professional criminals and the weak ones who have no protection but to ally themselves with some other faction herrick had persisted but in peacetime sir maybe it takes all the longer we cant afford the luxury of finding out he had hardened his voice you know how i feel it is not easy the thief had taken his punishment without a whimper a dozen lashes at the gratings while undine had cruised along beneath a clearing sky some gulls throwing their shadows round and round across the tense drama below as he had read from the articles of war bolitho had looked along his command at the watching men in shrouds and rigging the sharp red lines of bellairs marines herrick and all the rest the second culprit had been a brute of a man called sullivan he had volunteered to a recruiting party outside portsmouth and had all the looks of a hardened criminal but he had served in a kings ship before and should have been an asset three dozen lashes little enough in the navys view for half killing a fellow seaman had he laid a hand on an officer he would have faced death rather than a flogging the actual punishment was terrible sullivan had broken down completely at the first blow across his naked back and as the boatswains mates took turns to lay the lash over his shoulders and spine he had wriggled and screamed like a madman his mouth frothing with foam his eyes like marbles in his distorted face mr midshipman armitage had almost fainted and some of those who had just recovered from their own sickness had vomited in unison despite the harsh shouts from their petty officers then it had ended the watching men giving a kind of sigh as they were dismissed below sullivan had been cut down and carried to whitmarshs sickbay where no doubt he had been restored by a plentiful ration of rum each day following the punishment as he had paced the quarterdeck or supervised a change of tack bolitho had felt the eyes watching him seeing him perhaps as enemy rather than commander he had told himself often enough that when you accepted the honour of command you carried all of it not just the authority and the pride of controlling a living vital ship but the knocks and kicks as well there was a tap on the door and herrick stepped into the cabin about another hour sir with your permission i will give the order to clew up all canvas except topsls and jib it will make our entrance more easy to manage have some coffee thomas he relaxed as herrick seated himself across the table i am burning to know what we are about herrick took a mug and tested the coffee with his tongue me too he smiled over the rim once or twice back there i thought we might never reach land yes i can feel for many of our people some will never have seen the sea let alone driver so far from england now they know that africa lies somewhere over the larboard bulwark that we are going to the other side of the earth some are even beginning to feel like seamen when just weeks back they had thumbs where their fingers should be herricks smile widened due to you sir i am sometimes very thankful that i hold no command or chance of one either bolitho watched him thoughtfully the rift was healed i am afraid the choice may not be yours thomas he stood up in fact i shall see that you get command whenever the opportunity offers itself if only to drive some of your wild idealism into the bilges they grinned at each other like conspirators now be off with you while i change into a better coat he grimaced to show our spanish friends some respect eh a little over an hour later gliding above her own reflection undine moved slowly towards the anchorage in the roads in the bright sunlight the island of teneriffe seemed to abound with colour and bolitho heard several of the watching seamen gasping with awe the hills were no longer hidden in shadow but danced on the glare with every shade and hue and everything was brighter and larger at least it appeared so to the new hands shimmering white buildings brilliant blue sea with beaches and surf to make a man catch his breath and stare allday stood aft by the cabin hatch and remarked ill bet some dond like to rake us as we come by bolitho ran his eye quickly along his ship trying to see her as those ashore would she looked very smart and gave little hint of the sweat and effort which had gone to make her so the best ensign fluttered from the gaff the scarlet matching that of the marines swaying lines athwart the quarterdeck on the larboard gangway tapril the gunner was having a last hurried discussion with his mates in readiness to begin a salute to the spanish flag which flew so proudly above the headland battery old mudge was beside the wheel hands hidden in the folds of his watchcoat he seemed to retain the same clothing no matter what the weather might do hot or cold rain or fine he kept a variety of instruments and personal items in his capacious pockets and bolitho guessed that sometime long past he had been made to rush on deck and stay there with half of his things still scattered around his cabin he growled to the helmsmen and they edged the wheel over a few spokes the main topsail filling and then drooping again as the ship idled beneath the lands protection herrick trained his glass on the land and then said passing the point now sir very well bolitho waved his hand to tapril begin the salute and as the english frigate continued slowly towards her anchorage the frail morning air shook and trembled to the regular crash of cannon fire gun for gun the spanish replied the smoke hanging almost motionless above the shallowing water bolitho gripped his hands together behind him feeling the sweat exploring his spine under his heavy dress coat and making one of his new shirts cling like a wet towel it was strange to stand so impassively as the slow barrage went on around him like some trick or dream at any moment he halfexpected to see the bulwark blast apart or a ball to come screaming amongst the rigid marines and cut them to a bloody gruel the last shot hammered his ears and as the drifting smoke moved away from the decks he saw another frigate anchored at the head of the roads spanish larger than undine her colours and pendants very bright against the green shore beyond her captain too had probably been remembering he thought he glanced up at the masthead pendant as it whipped halfheartedly in the breeze soon now more orders a new piece to fit into the puzzle mudge blew his great nose loudly a thing he always did before carrying out some part of his duties ready sir very well man the braces hands wear ship if you please bare feet padded across the newlyscrubbed decks in a steady rush to obey his repeated order and bolitho breathed out slowly as each man reached his station without mishap topsl sheets the flag above the battery dipped in the glare and then returned to its proper place some small boats were shoving off from the land and bolitho saw that many were loaded with fruit and other items for barter with all their bread ruined in the first storm and few fresh fruits to rival those in the boats triphook the purser would be busy indeed topsl clew lines a boatswains mate shook his fist at some anonymous figure on the fore topsail yard yew clumsy bugger you old on with one and or yewll never see yer dozy again bolitho watched the narrowing strip of water his eyes half closed against the searing glare helm alee he waited as with dignity undine turned quietly into the wind her remaining canvas shivering violently let go there was a yell from forward followed by a splash as the anchor plunged down beneath the golden figurehead herrick waited until the last of the canvas had vanished as if by magic along the yards and said they did quite well i thought sir bolitho watched him holding back the smile then relent ing he replied quite well mr herrick herrick grinned youll not need the gig today sir a boats heading out to us in fine style allday strode forward and presented bolithos sword he frowned and muttered not the gig captain he sounded aggrieved bolitho held out his arms to allow the coxswain to buckle the belt around his waist not this time allday it was terrible how both herrick and allday watched over his every move the marines were stamping and shuffling into a new formation by the entry port sergeant coakers face shining beneath his black shako like a great sweating fruit bolitho turned to watch the approaching launch a grand affair with a gilded and canopied cockpit beside it alldays poor gig would look like a falmouth harbour boat a resplendent officer stood watching the anchored frigate a scroll under one arm the usual welcoming words the first link to w hatever lay ahead he said quietly you will remain aboard mr herrick mr davy will accompany me ashore he ignored the obvious disappointment take good care of matters here and make certain our people are ready for anything herrick touched his hat aye aye sir he hurried away to tell davy of his good fortune bolitho smiled gravely with shore boats and other temptations it would need all of herricks skill to keep the ship from being swamped by traders and less respectable visitors he heard flerrick say sojou are to accompany the captain mr davy davy hesitated gauging the moment and herricks mood then he said calmly a wise choice if i may say so mr herrick bolitho turned away hiding his smile as herrick snapped well you are damn little use here are you then as the four minute drummer boys struck up with their flutes and drums hearts of oak and bellairs sweating guard presented muskets bolitho stepped forward to greet his visitor the governors residence was well situated on a gently sloping road above the main anchorage on his way from the ship by barge and carriage bolitho was relieved to discover that his official escort a major of artillery spoke very little english and contented himself wtih occasional exclamations of pleasure whenever they passed anything unusual it was obvious that everything was well planned and that from the moment undines topgallants had been sighted the previous evening things had begun to move bolitho barely remembered meeting the governor a bearded courteous man who shook his hand received bolithos formal greetings on behalf of king george and who then withdrew to allow an aide to conduct the two british officers to another room davy who was not easily impressed whispered by god sir the dons live well no wonder the treasure ships stop here en route for spain a ready market for em i would think the room into which they were ushered was spacious indeed long and cool with a tiled floor and a plentiful selection of wellcarved furniture and handsome rugs there was one huge table in the centre made entirely of marble it would take seven gun crews to move it bolitho decided there were about a dozen people standing around the table arranged he thought so that without wasting time he could distinguish those who counted from those who did not the man he guessed to be james raymond stepped forward and said quickly i am raymond captain welcome we had expected you earlier perhaps he spoke very abruptly afraid of wasting time unsure of himself it was hard to tell he was in his early thirties well dressed and had features which could pass as handsome but for his petulant frown he said and this is don luis puigserver his most catholic majestys personal emissary puigserver was a sturdy man with biscuitcoloured features and a pair of black eyebrows which dominated the rest of his face he had hard eyes but there was charm too as he stepped forward and took bolithos hand a pleasure capstan you have a fine ship he gestured to a tall figure by the window capstan alfonso triarte of the nervion had much praise for the way she behaved bolitho looked at the other man very senior he would be to command the big frigate in the roads he returned bolithos examination without much show of pleasure like two dogs who have fought once too often perhaps he forgot all about triarte as the emissary said smoothly i will be brief you will wish to return to your ship to make last arrangements for sailing to our destination bolitho watched him curiously there was something very compelling about the man his stocky figure his legs which looked so muscled despite the fine silk stockings even the rough handshake could not disguise his confident assurance no wonder the governor had been quick to pass bolitho on to him puigserver obviously commanded respect he snapped his spatulate fingers and a nervous aide hurried forward to take bolithos hat and sword another beckoned to some servants and in minutes everyone was seated around the altarlike table a beautifully cut goblet at his elbow only puigserver remained standing he watched the servants filling the goblets with sparkling wine his face completely unruffled but when bolitho glanced down he saw one of his feet tapping very insistently on the tiled floor he raised his glass gentlemen to our friendship they stood up and swallowed the wine it was excellent and bolitho had a mental picture of his own doubts and fumblings in the shop at st jamess street puigserver continued little came out of the war but a need to avoid further bloodshed i will not waste our time by making empty promises which i cannot keep but i can only hope that we may further our separate causes in peace bolitho glanced quickly at the others raymond leaning back in his chair trying to appear relaxed but as taut as a spring the spanish captain looking at his wine eyes distant most of the others had the empty expressions of those who pretend to understand when in fact they do not it seemed likely to bolitho that they only understood one word in ten davy sat stiffly on the opposite side of the table his clean features glowing with heat his face set in a mask of formality it all boiled down to the three of them don luis puigserver raymond and himself the former said thankfully spain has received back minorca and certain other islands as concessions following the unfortunate war his eyes rested on bolitho very briefly dark almost black they were like spanish olives in return his most catholic majesty has seen fit to bless this new venture between us he looked at raymond perhaps you would be good enough to expand the details yes raymond made to stand up and changed his mind as you will know captain bolitho the french admiral suffren was responsible for many attacks on our ships and possessions in the east indies and india itself holland and spainhe hesitated as ca pitaa triarte coughed gentlywere frances allies but they had not the available squadrons and men to protect their possessions in that area suffren did it for them he captured trincomalee from us and restored it to the dutch after the war there were several other instances but you will know of most of them captain now in exchange for certain other considerations which need not concern you spain has agreed in principle to hand over to britain one of her remaining possessions in er borneo he eyed bolitho flatly which is where you will eventually be going of course of course it sounded so simple another two or three thousand miles added to their present voyage the way raymond spoke it could have been plymouth bolitho said quietly i am not certain i understand the purpose of all this puigserver interjected of that i am sure capitan he glanced coldly at raymond let us be frank to avoid further trouble in this uneasy truce for that is what it is we must move with caution the french gained next to nothing in the indies despite all their efforts and they are how you say touchy about any swift expansions around their dwindling influence there your final destination will be teluk pendang a fine anchorage a commanding position for any country with the will to expand elsewhere in that area a bridge to empire as some greek once remarked bolitho nodded i see senor he did not nor had he even heard of the place mentioned raymond said sharply when peace was signed last year our government despatched the frigate fortunate to madras with the bones of this present agreement in her care on her way around the cape of good hope she met with two of suffrens frigates which were returning to france naturally enough they knew nothing of the peace and fortunates captain was given no time to explainthe point they fought and fortunate so battered one of the enemy that she took fire and sank unfortunately she too was set ablaze and was lost with most of her company bolitho could picture the scene three ships on an open sea countries at peace at last but their captains eager to fight as they had been conditioned to do however one of the french captains the surviving one was a veteran called le chaumareys one of frances best bolitho smiled i have heard of him raymond seemed flustered yes i am sure of it well it is believed in some quarters that france through le chaumareys now knows about this arrangement we are making with spain if that is so then france will be troubled at the prospect of our gaining another possession one which she fought for on spains behalf bolitho did understand now all the veiled remarks at the admiralty the secrecy no wonder one hint that england was about to push her way further into the east indies no matter for what outward reason and a war might burst out again like an exploding magazine he asked what are we to do raymond replied you will sail in company with the nervion he swallowed hard she will be the senior ship and you will act accordingly upon arrival at madras you will embark the new british governor and convey him with whatever forces he may have to his new destination teluk pendang i will accompany you with despatches for him and to advise in any way i can puigserver beamed at them his black eyebrows arched like great bows and i will be there to ensure that there is no nonsense from our people eh raymond added wearily the french have a fortyfourgun frigate in that area the argus it is said that le chaumareys is with her he knows the sunda isles and borneo as well as any european can bolitho breathed out slowly it was a good plan as far as it went a british squadron would invite an open battle sooner or later but two frigates one from each nation would be more than a match for the heavilyarmed argus both verbally and in artillery puigserver walked slowly to the broad window and stared down at the anchored ships a long voyage gentlemen but i hope a rewarding one for us all he turned towards bolitho his square face in shadow are you ready to sail again aye senor my people are preparing to take in more water and fresh fruit if that is possible it is being attended to capitan he showed his teeth i am sorry i cannot entertain you now but in any case this island is a dismal place if you come to bilbao he kissed his fingertips then i will show you how to live eh he laughed at raymonds grim features and i suspect we will all know ourselves much better after this voyage is done the spanish aides bowed politely as puigserver walked to the door and he called we will meet before we sail he turned away but tomorrow we raise our anchors come what may raymond walked round the table as the babble of conversation broke out again he whispered fiercely that damned fellow one more day with him and i would have told him a thing or two bolitho asked in which vessel will you be sailing mine is a fine ship but smaller by far than the spaniard raymond twisted round to watch the spanish captain who was discussing something with his companions in a low voice sail in the nervion if your ship were a damned collier brig id take her in preference davy whispered i think they expect us to leave sir raymond scowled i will come to your ship and arrange things there where no ears listen even to ones breathing bolitho saw his escort waiting outside the door and smiled to himself raymond seemed to have a very vital role in things tact however was beyond him they returned to the jetty with hardly a word but bolitho was very conscious of the tension within the man raymond on a knife edge tortured by something his work was overreaching him perhaps as the scarletcoated oarsmen propelled the governors barge towards undine bolitho felt a sense of relief a ship he could understand raymonds life was as alien as the moon raymond clambered up from the barge and stared vaguely at the assembled sideparty at the comings and goings of undines seamen as they worked the tackles on the opposite side casks and nets of fruit and straw hats to protect the unwary from sunburn bolitho nodded to herrick all well he touched raymonds arm mr raymond will be a passenger with us he turned sharply as he heard a shrill of laughter from the cabin hatch who let that woman on board in gods name mr herrick this is not the nore or portsmouth point then he saw the girl small and dark in a bright red dress she was talking to allday who was obviously enjoying himself raymond said heavily i had hoped to explain earlier captain that girl is a maidservant my wifes maid he looked as if he was going to be sick herrick tried to dispel bolithos sudden anger she came out with her lady just an hour back sir she had authority he looked worried i had little choice in the matter i see bolitho strode aft all those thousands of miles in a small crowded shipofwar raymond was bad enough but his wife and a maid were too much he saw some seamen nudging each other they had probably been waiting just to see his reactions very calmly he said perhaps you would er introduce me mr raymond they went aft together and davy whispered gods teeth mr herrick what a mixed gathering we are fast becoming herrick glared at him and i suppose you have been out there damn well enjoying yourself a little wine some fair company he chuckled but i thought too of you sir herrick grinned to hell with you get into your working clothes and help with this loading you need a million eyes today in the meantime bolitho had reached his cabin and stared at it in dismay there were boxes everywhere and clothing spilled across furniture and guns as if there bad been a violent robbery aboard mrs raymond was tall unsmiling and almost beside herself with anger her husband exclaimed you should have waited viola this is our captain bolitho bowed slightly richard bolitho maam i had just mentioned that a thirtytwogun frigate has barely the room for luxury however since you have chosen to sail with us i will do all that i can to he got no further chosen her voice was husky with scorn please do not delude yourself captain he does not wish me to travel in the nervion her mouth twisted in contempt he fears for ray safety when i am with spanish gentlemen bolitho noticed noddall hovering anxiously by the dinin compartment and snapped help mrs raymonds maid to stow all thishe looked round helplesslygear he save raymond slump down on the bench seat like a dying mad no wonder he looked troubled and pass the word for the first lieutenant he glanced around the cabin speaking his thoughts aloud we will have these twelvepounders removed temporarily and put quakers in their place that will allow a little more room raymond looked up dully quakers wooden muzzles they give an appearance that we are still fully armed he forced a smile quakers having an opposition to war herrick appeared by the door sir we will rig extra screens here mr herrick a larger sleeping compartment for our passengers to larboard i think mrs raymond said calmly for me and my maid if you please she looked at her husband he will bed elsewhere on this ship herrick studied her curiously but said mr raymond to starboard then and what about you sir bolitho sighed chart space he looked at the others we will dine together here if you agree nobody answered midshipman keen hovered by the door his eyes on the woman mr soamess respects sir and the captain of nervion is about to board us bolitho swung round and then gasped as his shin cracked against a heavy chest he said between his teeth i will endeavour to be hospitable mr herrick herrick kept his face blank i am certain of it sir it was early morning by the time bolitho had pulled himself wearily into his cot his mind still reeling from entertaining capitan triarte and some of his officers he had been made to go across to the nervion where the captain had again made a point of comparing the spacious comfort with undines overcrowded quarters it had not helped at all now the ship lay quiet again and he tried to picture mrs raymond who was sleeping beyond the newlyrigged screen he had seen her in the cabin when the spanish officers had come aboard aloof yet tempting with little to reveal her true feelings for her husband a dangerous woman to cross he thought how still the ship felt perhaps like himself everyone was too weary to move guns had been trundled away and lowered with difficulty into the holds more stores and heavy gear had had to be swayed aft to readjust the trim once again it was surprising how much larger the cabin looked without the guns there he groaned as his head found some new ache to offer him he would not see much of it though he turned his face to the pillow the sweat running across his chest with the effort one thing was certain he had rarely had better incentive for a fast passage he was up and about at first light eager to get his work done before the heat of the day made thinking more difficult in the afternoon to the distant strains of a military band and the cheers of a crowd along the waterfront undine weighed anchor and with nervion in the lead her great foresail displaying a resplendent cross of scarlet and gold worked clear of the roads before setting more canvas to the wind some small craft followed them across the glittering water but were soon outpaced by the graceful frigates by dusk they had the sea to themselves with only the stars for company death of a ship ezekiel mudge undines sailing master sat comfortably in one of bolithos chairs and peered at the chart which was laid across the desk without his hat he looked even older but there was assurance in his voice as he said this windll freshen in the next day or so sir you mark my words he tapped the chart with his own brass dividers which he had just fished from one of his pockets for now the noreast trades will suit us and well be up to the cape verde islands in a week with any luck he sat back and studied bolithos reactions much as i thought bolitho walked to the stern windows and leaned his hands on the sill it was hot like wood from a fire and beyond the frigates small frothing wake the sea was blinding in the glare his shirt was open to the waist and he could feel the sweat running down his shoulders a dryness in his throat like dust it was almost noon and herrick would be waiting for the midshipmen to report to him on the quarterdeck to shoot the sun for their present position a full week but for a few hours since they had sailed from santa cruz and daily the sun had pinned them down had defied the light airs which had tried to give them comfort today the wind had strengthened slightly and undine was ghosting along on the starboard tack with all sails drawing well there was little satisfaction in bolithos thoughts for undine had suffered her first casualty a young seaman who had fallen overboard just as darkness had been closing in the previous day signalling his intention to the spanish captain bolitho had gone about to begin a search for the luckless man he had been working aloft on the main topsail yard framed against the dying sunlight like a bronze statue had he been a raw recruit or some heavyhanded landsman it was likely he would still be alive but he had been too confident too careless perhaps for those last vital seconds as he had changed his position one cry as he had fallen and then his head had broken surface almost level with the mizzen his arms beating at the sea as he tried to keep pace with the ship davy had told him that the seaman was a good swimmer and that fact had given some hope they might pick him up they had lowered two boats and for most of the night had searched in vain dawn had found them on course again but to bolithos anger he had discovered that the nervion had made no attempt to shorten sail or stay in company and only in the last halfhour had the masthead reported sighting her topgallant sails once again the seamans death had been an additional thorn to prod at his determination to weld the ship together he had seen the spanish officers watching their first attempts at gun drill through their telescopes slapping their thighs with amusement whenever something went wrong which was often they themselves never drilled at anything they seemed to treat the voyage as a form of entertainment even raymond had remarked why bother with gun drill captain i do not know much about such matters but surely your men find it irksome in this damned heat he had replied it is my responsibility mr raymond i daresay it may be unnecessary for this mission but ill take no chances raymonds wife had kept aloof from all of them and during the day spent much of her time under a small awning which herricks men had rigged for her and the maid right aft by the taffrail whenever they met usually at meal times she spoke only briefly and then touched on personal matters which bolitho barely understood she appeared to enjoy hinting to her husband that he was too backward that he lacked assurance when it was most needed once he had heard her say hotly they ride right over you james how can i hold up my head in london when you suffer so many insults why margarets husband was knighted for his services and he is five years your junior and so on now as he turned to look at mudge he wondered what he and the others were thinking of their captain driving them all too hard and for no purpose making them turn to and work at those stubborn guns while aboard the spaniard the offwatch hands sprawled about sleeping or drinking wine like passengers as if reading his thoughts mudge said dont mind what some o the buggers are sayin sir youre young but youve a mind for the right thing if youll pardon the liberty he plucked at his great nose ive seen many a capn taken all aback cause he wornt ready when the time came he chuckled his small eyes vanishing into his wrinkles an as you well knows sir when things do go wrong its no blamed use slappin yer hip an blastin yer eye an blamin all else he tugged a watch the size of a turnip from an inner pocket i must away on deck if you can spare me sir mr errick likes me to be there when we compares our reckonin it seemed to amuse him as i said sir you stand firm you dont ave to like a capn but by god youve got to trust un he lumbered from the cabin his shoes making the deck creak as he passed bolitho sat down and tugged at his open shirt it was a beginning allday peered into the cabin can i send your servant in now captain he darted a glance at the table hell be wanting to get your meal laid bolitho smiled very well it was stupid to let small things prey on his mind but with mudge it was different important he had probably sailed with more captains than bolitho had met in his whole life they both looked round as midshipman keen stood in the doorway already he was well tanned and looked as healthy and fresh as a veteran sailor mr herricks respects sir masthead has just reported sighting another vessel ahead of the spaniard on a converging tack small maybe a brig i will come up bolitho smiled the voyage appears to agree with you mr keen the youth grinned aye sir though i fear my father sent me away for other reasons but my health as he hurried away allday murmured young devil that one got some poor girl into trouble ill wager bolitho kept his face impassive not like you of course allday he strode out past the sentry and climbed quickly to the quarterdeck even though he was expecting it the heat came down on him like the mouth of an open furnace he felt the deck seams sticking to his shoes the searing touch on his face and neck as he crossed to the weather side and looked along his command with her pale lightweight canvas bent on and her deck tilting to the wind undine was moving well spray leapt up and round the jib boom at irregular intervals and far above his head he saw the pendant streaming abeam like a thin whip mudge and herrick were muttering together their sextants gleaming in the sunlight like gold while two midshipmen armitage and penn compared notes their faces screwed in worried concentration soames was by the quarterdeck rail and turned as bolitho asked about this newcomer what is she do you reckon soames looked crushed with the heat his hair matted to his forehead as if he had been swimming some trader i expect sir he did not sound as if he cared maybe she intends to ask the spaniard for her position he scowled not that theyll know much bolitho took a glass from the rack and climbed into the mizzen shrouds moving it gradually he soon found the nervion far ahead on the larboard bow a picture of beauty under her great spread of canvas her hull gleaming in the sun like metal he trained the glass further to starboard and then held it steady on the other vessel almost hidden in heat haze but he could see the tancoloured sails well enough the uneven outline of her rig square on the fore foreandaft on the mainmast he felt vaguely angry a brigantine mr soames aye sir bolitho looked at him and then climbed back to the deck in future i want a full report of each sighting no matter how trivial it might appear at the time soames tightened his jaw sir herrick called it was my fault sir i should have told mr keen to pass a full description to you bolitho walked aft mr soames has the watch i believe herrick followed him well yes sir bolitho saw the two helmsmen stiffen as he moved to the compass the card was steady enough south by west and with plenty of sea room the african coast lay somewhere across the larboard beam over thirty leagues distant there was nothing on their ocean but the three ships coincidence a need to make contact perhaps soamess indifference pricked at his mind like a burr and lie snapped make certain our watchkeepers know what they are about mr herrick he saw keen leaning against the nettings send him aloft with a glass an untried eye might tell us more mudge ambled towards him and said gruffly near as makes no difference sir cape blanco should be abeam now he rubbed his chin the most westerly point o that savage continent an quite close enough if you ask me his chest went up and down to a small wheezing accompaniment it was as near as he ever got to laughing keens voice came down from the masthead deck there brigantine is still closing the nervionl herrick cupped his hands does she show any colours none sir herrick clambered into the shrouds with his own telescope after a while he called the dons dont seem worried sir mudge growled artily likely to be bothered about that little pot o paint is they bolitho said bring her up a point mr mudge it would be best if we regain company with our companion he turned as a voice asked are you troubled captain mrs raymond was standing by the trunk of the mizzen mast her face shadowed by a great straw hat which she had brought from teneriffe he shook his head merely curious maam in his crumpled shirt and breeches he felt suddenly clumsy im sorry there is not more to amuse you during the day she smiled things may yet improve deck there keens voice made them all look up the other vessel is going about sir herrick called hes right the brigantines going to cross clean over the dons bows he turned grinning broadly thatll make em hop about the grin vanished as a dull bang echoed and reechoed over the water keen yelled shes fired on the nervion a second bang reached the quarterdeck and he cried again and another he was almost screaming with excitement hes put a ball through her forecourse bolitho ran to the shrouds and joined herrick let me see he took the big glass and trained it on the two ships the brigantines shape had shortened and she was presenting her stern to him even as she idled across the frigates broader outline even at such a distance it was possible to see the confusion aboard the spanish frigate the glint of sunlight on weapons as her company ran to quarters herrick said hoarsely that brigantines master must be mad no one but a crazy man would cross swords with a frigate bolitho did not reply he was straining his eye to watch the little drama framed in his lens the brigantine had fired two shots one of which if not both had scored a mark now she was tacking jauntily away and it was evident as the nervion began to spread more sail that capitan triarte intended to give chase he said nervionll be up to her within the hour theyre both changing tack now perhaps that fool imagined nervion was a fat merchantman eh davy had arrived on deck but no it is not possible herrick followed bolitho down from the shrouds and watched him dubiously shall we join in the chase sir mudge almost pushed him aside as he barked chase be damned i say they looked at him we must stop that mad don sir he waved his big hand across the nettings off cape blanco sir theres a powerful great reef an it runs near on a undred miles to seaward nervions in risk now but if er master brings er up another point hell be across that damned reef afore e knows it bolitho stared at him get the royals on her mr herrick lively now he walked quickly to the helm we must make more speed soames called the dons come up another point by the look of her sir mudge was already squinting at the compass bowl jesus es steerin sousoueast he looked at bolitho imploringly well never catch im in time bolitho paced to the quarterdeck rail and back again weariness the scorching heat all was forgotten but that distant pyramid of white sails with the smaller willothewisp brigantine dancing ahead mad a confused pirate it made no difference now he snapped clear away a bow chaser mr herrick we will endeavour to distract the nervion herrick was peering aloft shading his eyes with his speaking trumpet as the topmen set the additional sails aye aye sir he yelled fetch mr tapril but the gunner was already forward supervising the crew of a long ninepounder bolitho said sharply nervions pulled over still further mr mudge he could not hide the anguish in his voice how could it be happening the sea so huge so empty and yet the reef was there he had heard of it before from men who had passed this way many good ships had foundered on its hard spine larboard gun ready sir fire it crashed out the brown smoke drifting downwind and dispersing long before the telltale waterspout lifted like a feather far astern of the other frigate another keep firing he looked at mudge bring her up a point mudge protested ill not be responsible sir no i will he strode forward to the rail again his shirt flapping open across his chest yet feeling no benefit from the wind when he looked up he saw the sails drawing firmly as would the spaniards with such power to drive her she would disembowel herself on the reef unless triarte acted and at once the deck shook as another ball whined and ricocheted across the blue water bolitho yelled masthead what are they doing the lookout replied his rougher voice leaving no doubt in bolithos mind th dons is gainin sir theyre runnin out their guns right this moment maybe the spaniards had heard the bow chaser even observed a fall of shot but imagined the stupid british were still exercising gunnery or perhaps they believed undine was so furious at missing the chase that bolitho was firing at this impossible range merely to take the edge off his temper he heard himself ask how long mr mudge mudge replied thickly she should ave struck sir that damned brigantine must ave crossed the reef in safety shell draw little enough im thinkin bolitho stared at him but if she got through then perhaps the master shook his head no chance sir a great yell came from the watching seamen in the bows when bolitho swung round he stared with horror as the spanish frigate lifted drove forward again and then slewed round on the hidden reef over and around her all her masts and yards the flailing sails and rigging splashed and cascaded in a chaos which was terrible to see so great was the impact that she had presented her larboard side to the reef and through the open gunports the water must now be surging in a triumphant flood while men trapped in the tangled rigging and broken spars floundered in terror or were being crushed by the cannon as they tore from their lashings the brigantine had changed tack she was not even pausing to watch the full extent of her work bolitho said harshly shorten sail mr herrick we will heaveto presently and get every boat in the water we must do all we can to save them he saw some of the men by the bow chasers pointing and chattering as nervion yawed still further on her side spilling more broken timber and shattered planking into the swell above the reef and get those hands to work mr herrick he swung away ill not have them watch others drown as if it was a days amusement he made himself cross the deck once more and when he looked towards the reef he almost expected to see nervions proud silhouette standing before the wind that this was a bad dream a nightmare but why why the question seemed to mock him to hammer at his brain how could it have happened id not venture any closer sir mudge was watching him grimly if we gets a shift of wind we could still run foul of the reef bolitho nodded heavily i agree he looked away and thank you mudge said quietly it wornt your fault you done all you could heave to mr herrick he could barely keep his voice level have the boats swayed out soarnes remarked a long pull sir near on three miles bolitho did not even hear him he was seeing the little brigantine it was no coincidence no rash act of the moment mudge said therell not be many sir he fumbled in his pockets theres sharks aplenty in these waters as undine came up into the wind her remaining sails thundering and flapping noisily in protest the boats were lowered with surprisingly little delay it was as if something had reached out across the three miles of smiling water to touch each and every one of them a plea for help a cry of warning it was difficult to define but as the first boat shoved off from the side and the seamen at the oars picked up the stroke bolitho saw that their faces were grim and suddenly determined as he had not seen them before allday said ill take the gig if i may captain yes their eyes met do what you can i will then he was gone yelling for his men warn the surgeon to be prepared mr herrick he saw the quick exchange of glances and added coldly and if he is the worse for drink i will have him flogged all the boats were away now while far beyond their busy oars he could see the remains of the other ship writhing on the invisible reef the great foresail with its red and gold crucifix still floating around the wreckage like a beautiful shroud bolitho began to pace up and down below the nettings his hands behind him his body swaying to the untidy motion as the ship rolled in each undulating trough he heard raymond say captain triarte was wrong he made a stupid error of judgement he paused and looked at him he has paid for it mr raymond raymond saw the contempt in bolithos grey eyes and walked away i was only saying but nobody looked at him herrick watched bolitho pacing back and forth and wished he could say something to ease his despair but better than most he knew that at such moments bolitho was the only one who could help himself hours later as the boats pulled wearily back towards their ship bolitho was still on deck his shirt dark with sweat his mind aching from his deliberations herrick reported no more than forty survivors sir some are in a bad way i fear he saw the question in bolithos eyes and nodded the surgeons ready sir i saw to that bolitho walked slowly to the nettings and craned over to watch the first boat the gig as it hooked on to the chains one man cradled against alldays legs and held firmly by two seamen was shrieking like a tortured woman a shark had taken a piece from his shoulder big enough to thrust a roundshot through he turned away sickened in gods name thomas send more hands to help those poor devils herrick said it is being done sir bolitho looked up at the flapping ensign at the gaff by heaven if this is how we behave in peace then i would we were at war he watched some of the oarsmen clambering aboard hands blistered backs and faces raw from the sun they said very little as they went below perhaps what they had seen at the reef had taught them more than drill and would act as a warning to all of them he began to pace again and to me bolitho strode into the cabin and paused below the skylight it was almost sunset and the open stern windows shone in the dying glare like burnished copper within the cabin the shadows bobbed this way and that to the frigates steady motion and the swinging deckhead lanterns and he watched the little group by the windows with something like disbelief don luis puigserver sat awkwardly on the bench seat one arm in a sling his chest and ribs encased in bandages when he had been dragged aboard with the other survivors a few hours earlier he had passed unrecognised until a gasping spanish lieutenant the only one of tervions officers to be rescued had managed to explain the truth then bolitho had thought it was too late the thickset spaniard had been unconscious and covered with angry scars and bruises the fact he had survived that long had been hard to accept when bolitho had recalled the nervions final destruction of the forty or so to reach undines protection ten had already died and several of the remainder were in a bad state crushed under falling spars half drowned by the inrush of water the nervions original complement of two hundred and seventy men had been totally unprepared for the horror which had awaited them on the reef while their vessel had foundered and smashed herself to pieces the surging waters had suddenly erupted in a maelstrom of dashing shapes as the sharks had hurried to the attack terrified men had seen their companions torn to bloody remnants when moments before they had been setting more sail and manning their guns to run down the impudent brigantine when undines boats had arrived it had been nearly over a few men had swum desperately back to the capsized frigate only to be dragged down as she had slid from the reef for her last plunge others had clung to floating spars and upturned boats and had watched in terror as one by one their grey attackers had plucked them screaming into the churned scarlet water and now puigserver was sitting here in the cabin his face almost composed as he sipped steadily from a goblet of wine he was naked to the waist and bolitho could see some extent of the bruising on his body evidence of his will to survive he said quietly i am grateful that you are in better spirits seror the spaniard made to grin but winced at the effort he waved the surgeon and one of his assistants aside and asked my men how many bolitho looked past him towards the horizon a thread of copper fading even as he watched thirty he shrugged many were badly mauled puigserver took another swallow it was terrible to behold his dark eyes hardened capitan triarte was so enraged by that other ships attack that he went after her like a man possessed he was too hotblooded not like you bolitho smiled gravely not likeyon but suppose he had not had a sailing master like mudge one so experienced so travelled as to feel the reefs danger like another of his stored memories it was likely undine might have shared the spaniards fate it made him chill despite the lifeless air in the cabin somewhere beyond the bulkhead a man screamed a thin longdrawn sound which stopped abruptly as if a door had been slammed on it whitmarsh wiped his hands on his apron and straightened his back his head bowed beneath the beams he said don puigserver will be comfortable for a while sir i would like to return to my other charges he was sweating very badly and a muscle at one corner of his face twitched uncontrollably bolitho nodded thank you please inform me of any help you might require the surgeon touched the spaniards bandages vaguely gods help perhaps he gave a wry smile out here we have little else as he left with his assistant puigserver murmured a man with an inner torment capitan he grimaced but a gentle one for his trade allday was folding up a towel and some unused dressings and said mr raymond was asking to see you captain he frowned i told him you had given orders that the cabin was to be kept for the surgeon until his work was done with don puig he coughed the spanish gentleman what did he want bolitho was so weary he hardly cared he had seen little of raymond since the survivors had been brought aboard and had heard he had been in the wardroom allday replied he was wishing to make a complaint captain his wife took a displeasure at you asking her to help tend the injured he frowned again i told him you had more important work to do he picked up his things and walked to the door puigserver leaned back and closed his eyes without the others present he seemed willing to reveal the pain he was really enduring he said your allday is a remarkable fellow eh with a few hundred of his kind i might think again about a campaign in the south americas bolitho sighed he worries too much puigserver opened his eyes and smiled he seems to think you are worth worrying about capitan he leaned forward his face suddenly intense but before raymond and the others come amongst us i must speak i want your opinion about the wreck i need it bolitho walked to the bulkhead and touched the sword with his fingers he said i have thought of little else senor at first i believed the brigantine to be a pirate her captain so confused or so in dread of his crew as to need a battle to keep them together but i cannot believe it in my heart someone knew of our intentions the spaniard watched him intently the french perhaps maybe if their government is so concerned at our movements it must mean that when they sank the fortunate they did indeed capture her despatches intact it would have to be something really vital to play such a dangerous game puigserver reached for the wine bottle a game which did work then you too are of the same mind senor he watched the mans outline paler now against the darkened windows he did not reply directly if and i am only saying if this someone intended such a course of action he will have known we were two ships in company he paused and then said sharply a reaction capitan quickly bolitho said it would make no difference he would realise that this is a combined mission one ship without the other makes further progress impossible and puigserver was banging his hip with the goblet wine slopping over his leg like blood he shouted excitedly and go on capitan and what bolitho looked away and replied firmly i must return either to england or to teneriffe and await further orders when he looked again at the spaniard he saw he was slumped back on the seat his square features strained his chest heaving as if from a fight puigserver said thickly when you came to santa cruz i knew you were a man of thoughts and not merely of words he shook his head let me finish this man these creatures whoever they are who would let my people die so horribly want you to turn back bolitho watched him fascinated awed by his strength without you being here senor he looked away i would have had no option exactly capitan he peered at bolitho over the rim of the goblet his eyes shining in the lantern light like tawny stones bolitho added by the time i returned to england and new plans were made and agreed upon something might have happened in the east indies or elsewhere which we could not control give me your hand capitan he groped forward his breathing sharper in a moment i will sleep it has been a wretched day but far worse for many others bolitho took his hand suddenly moved by puigservers obvious sincerity the latter asked slowly how many have you in this little ship bolitho pictured the riffraff brought aboard at spithead the ragged men from the prison hulks the smartlydressed ones fleeing from some crime or other in london the gun captain with only one hand all of them he said they have the makings senor two hundred all told including my marines he smiled if only to break the tension and i will sign on those of your men who have survived if i may puigserver did not seem to hear but his grip was like iron as he said two hundred eh he nodded grimly it will be sufficient bolitho watched him we go on senor you are ey capitan now what do you say bolitho smiled but you know already senor puigserver gave a great sigh if you will send that fool raymond in to me and your clerk i will put my seal on this new undertaking his voice hardened today i saw and heard many men die in fear and horror whatever made that foul deed necessary i intend to set the record right and when i do capitan i will make it a reckoning which our enemies will long remember there was a tap at the door and midshipman armitage stood outlined by the swinging lantern in the passageway mr herricks respects sir the winds freshening from the noreast he faltered like a child repeating a lesson to his tutor i will come up directly bolitho thought suddenly of mudge how he had prophesied a better wind he would be up there with herrick waiting for the nights orders armitages message told him all that and more whatever was decided now might settle the fate of the ship and every man aboard he looked at puigserver it is settled then senor yes capitan he was getting more drowsy you can leave me now and send raymond before i sleep like some drunken goatherd bolitho followed the midshipman from his cabin noting how stiffly the sentry at the door was holding his musket he had probably been listening and by tonight it would be all over the ship not merely a voyage to display the navys reach in foreign parts but one with a real prospect of danger he smiled grimly as he reached the quarterdeck ladder it might make gun drill less irksome for them in future he found herrick and mudge near the helm the master with a shaded lantern held over his slate upon which he made his surprisingly neat calculations bolitho walked up the weather side looking aloft at the bulging canvas hearing the sea creaming along the hull like water in a mill sluice then he returned to where they were waiting and said you may shorten sail for the night mr herrick tomorrow you can sign on any of the nervions people you find suitable he paused as another frantic cry floated up from the orlop deck though i fear it may not be many herrick asked we are not going about then sir mudge exclaimed an a good thing too if i may say so sir he rubbed his bulging rump with one hand me rheumatism will sheer off when we gets to a otter climate bolitho looked at herrick we go forward thomas to finish what was begun back there on the reef herrick seemed satisfied im for that he made to walk to the rail where a bosuns mate awaited his orders but bolitho stopped him saying from this night on thomas we must keep our wits about us no unnecessary pauses for fresh water if prying eyes are nearby we will ration every drop if necessary and stand or fall by our own resources but we must stay clear of the land where an enemy might betray our course or intentions if as i now believe someone is working against us we must use his methods against him gain ourselves time by every ruse we can invent herrick nodded that makes good sense sir then i hope it may seem so to our people he walked to the weather side you may carry on now herrick turned away call the hands we will shorten sail as the shouts echoed between decks and the seamen came dashing on to the gangways herrick said i almost forgot sir mrs raymond is worried about her accommodation it is arranged he paused and watched the hands scampering to the shrouds don puigserver will sleep in the main cabin mrs raymond can retain her own cot with the maid herrick sounded cautious i doubt she will like that sir bolitho continued his pacing then she may say so mr herrick and when she does i will explain what i think of a woman so pampered she will not lift a finger to help a dying man a masters mate strode along the gangway all mustered sir herrick was still watching the pacing figure the open white shirt clearly etched against the nettings and the sea beyond in the next few weeks undine would get much smaller he thought very well mr fowlar get the togansls off her if the weather freshens up we may have to reef topsls before the nights done old mudge rubbed his aching back the weather is a fool but nobody heeded him bolitho saw the topmen sliding down to the deck with barely a word to each other as they were checked again by their petty officers around the vibrating bowsprit the spindrift rode in the wind like pale arrows and high above the deck he saw the topsails hardening and puffing out their bellies to a combined chorus of creaking rigging and blocks dismiss the watch below herricks voice was as usual he took bolithos word as he would a rope to save himself from drowning in the darkness bolitho smiled perhaps it was better to be so in the cabin don puigserver sat at the desk and watched the clerks quill scraping across his written orders raymond was leaning against the quarter windows his face expressionless as he peered into the darkness then across his shoulder he said it is a great responsibility don puigserver i am not sure i can advise in its favour the spaniard leaned painfully against the chairback and listened to the regular footsteps across the deck overhead up and down it is not mine alone senor raymond i am in good company believe me above and around them the undine moved and murmured in time with sea and wind right forward below the bowsprit the golden nymph stared unwinkingly at the darkened horizon decision and destiny triumph and disappointment meant nothing to her she had the ocean and that was life itself the work of a demon bolitho stood loosely by the quarterdeck rail his body partly shaded from the harsh glare by the thick mainmast trunk and watched the routine work around him eight bells chimed from the forecastle and he could hear herrick and mudge comparing notes from their noon sights while soames who was officer of the watch prowled restlessly by the cabin hatch as he awaited his relief just to watch the slow lethargic movements of the men on the gangways and gun deck was enough thirtyfour days since they had seen nervions destruction on the reef and nearly two months since weighing anchor at spithead it had been hard work all the way and from the moment the spanish ship had foundered the atmosphere aboard had been compressed and strained to the limit the last few days had been the worst part he thought for a while his company had gained some excitement at crossing the equator with all its mysteries and myths he had issued an extra ration of rum and for a time he had observed some benefit from the change the new hands had seen the linecrossing as a kind of test which they had somehow managed to pass the old seamen had grown in stature as they had recounted or lied about the number of occasions they had sailed these waters in other ships a fiddler had emerged and after a selfconscious overture had brought some music and scratchy gaiety to their daily lives and then the last of the badly injured spaniards had begun to die it had been like the final pressure on them all whitmarsh had done all he could he had carried out several amputations and as the pitiful cries had floated up from his sickbay bolitho had felt the brief satisfaction of drawing his company together fading once again the dying spaniard had dragged it out for many days nearly a month he had ebbed and rallied sobbing and groaning or sleeping peacefully while whitmarsh had stayed with him hour by hour it had seemed as if the surgeon was testing his own resources searching for some new cracking point the last of his patients to die had been the ones mauled by sharks those which because of their wounds could not be saved or despatched by amputations gangrene had set into their flesh and the whole ship had been pervaded by a stench so revolting that even the most charitable had prayed for the sufferers to die he saw the afternoon watch mustering below the quarterdeck while lieutenant davy strode aft and waited for soames to sign his report in the log even davy looked weary and bedraggled his handsome face so tanned by hours on duty he could have been a spaniard they all avoided bolithos eye as if they were afraid of him or that they needed all their energies merely to get through another day davy reported the watch is aft soames glared at him a moment late mr davy davy regarded him disdainfully and then turned to his masters mate relieve the wheel soames stamped to the hatch and disappeared below bolitho clenched his hands behind him and took a few steps away from the mast the only satisfaction was the wind the previous day as they had changed tack towards the east and the masthead had reported sighting land far abeam the westerlies had made themselves felt as he shaded his eyes to peer aloft he could see the impatient thrust of power in every sail the mainyard bending and trembling like one giant bow that blur of land had been cape agulhas the southernmost tip of the african continent now stretching before the crisscross of rigging and shrouds lay the blue emptiness of the indian ocean and like many of his new seamen who had contemplated their crossing the equator he was able to consider what together they had achieved to reach this far the cape of good hope was to all intents the halfway of their voyage and to this day he had kept his word mile upon mile day after scorching day driving wildly in blustery squalls or lying becalmed with every sail hanging lifeless he had used everything he knew to keep up their spirits when that had faltered he had speeded up the daily routine gun and sail drill and competitions between messes for the offwatch hands he saw the purser and his assistant waiting beside a puncheon of pork which had just been swayed up from the forward hold midshipman keen stood nearby trying to appear knowledgeable as triphook had the new cask opened and proceeded to check through each fourpound piece of salt pork before he allowed it to be carried to the galley keen whose junior authority as midshipman of the watch made him the captains representative on such occasions probably imagined it to be a waste of time bolitho knew otherwise from past experience it was well known for dishonest victualling yards to give short measure or to make up the contents of a cask with hunks of rotten meat even pieces of old canvas knowing as they did that by the time a ships purser discovered the fault he would be well clear of the land and unable to complain pursers too were known to line their own pockets by sharp practice with their opposite numbers ashore bolitho saw the gaunt purser nod mournfully and mark his ledger apparently satisfied then he followed the little procession forward to the galley his shoes squeaking as they clung to the sunheated pitch between the deck seams the heat the relentless unbroken days were testing enough but bolitho knew it only needed a hint of corruption some suggestion that the ships company were being cheated by their officers and the whole voyage might explode he had asked himself over and over again if he was allowing his last experience to pray on his mind even the word itself mutiny had struck fear into the heart of many a captain especially one far from friendly company and higher authority he took a few paces along the side and winced as his wrist brushed against the bulwark the timbers were bonedry the paint cracking despite regular attention he paused and shaded his eyes to watch some large fish jumping far abeam valor it was usually uppermost in his mind with the new hands and the need to use much of their precious water supply to help the sick and injured even rationing might not be enough he saw two negro seamen lounging by the larboard gangway it was a mixed company indeed when they had sailed from spithead it had been varied enough now with the small list of spanish survivors they were even more colourful apart from the sole spanish officer a sadeyed lieutenant named roj art there were ten seamen two boys who were little more than children and five soldiers the latter at first grateful to have survived were now openly resentful of their new status carried aboard nervion as part of puigservers personal guard they were now neither fish nor fowl and while they tried to act as seamen they were usually found watching undines sweating marines with both envy and contempt herrick stepped into his thoughts and reported the master and i agree he held out the slate if you would care to examine this sir he sounded unusually guarded mudge ambled into the shadow of the hammock nettings and said if you are about to alter course sir he dragged out his handkerchief it is as good a time as any he blew his nose violently herrick said quickly i would like to make a suggestion sir mudge moved away and stood patiently near the helmsman it was hard to tell if herrick had just thought of his suggestion or if he had discussed it with the others some were a mite surprised when you stood clear of cape town sir his eyes were very blue in the glare we could have landed our remaining sick people and taken in fresh water i doubt that the dutch governor there would pay much heed to our movements do you mr herrick he saw a puff of dull smoke from the galley soon now the offwatch men would be having a meal in the sweltering heat of their messes the remains of yesterdays salt beef skillygolee as they named it a mixture of oatmeal gruel crushed biscuits and lumps of boiled meat and all that washed down with a full ration of beer it was likely the latter was stale and without life but anything was better than the meagre ration of water he jerked himself back to herrick suddenly irritated and who put you up to this remarkable assessment he saw herricks face cloud over but added it has an unfamiliar ring to it herrick said its just that i do not wish to see you driving yourself sir i felt as you did about nervions loss but it is done and theres an end to it you did all you could for her people bolitho said thank you for your concern but i am not driving myself or our people to no purpose i believe we may be needed even at this moment perhaps sir bolitho regarded him searchingly perhaps indeed but then that is my responsibility if i have acted wrongly then you may receive promotion more quickly than you thought he turned away when the hands have eaten we will lay her on the new course noreast by east he looked at the masthead pendant see how it blows well get the royals on her directly and run with the wind under our coattails while it lasts herrick bit his lip i still believe we should touch land sir if only to collect water as i do mr herrick he faced him coldly and that i will do whenever i can without arousing interest elsewhere i have my orders i intend to carry them out as best i can do you understand they watched each other their eyes angry troubled and concerned by the sudden flareup between them very good sir herrick stood back his eyes squinting in the sun you can rely on me i was beginning to wonder mr herrick bolitho half stepped forward one hand outstretched as herrick swung away his face taut with dismay he had not meant the words to form in that way if he had ever doubted anything in his life herricks loyalty was not one of them he felt ashamed and angry perhaps the strain of this empty monotony of carrying men who wanted to do nothing but crawl away from work and the sun of torturing his mind with plans and doubts had taken a far greater toll than he had imagined he turned on his heel and saw davy watching him curiously mr davy you have only just taken over your watch and i would not wish to disrupt your thoughts but examine the forecourse if you please and set some of your hands to put it to rights he saw the lieutenant fall back from his anger and added it looks as slack as the watch on deck as he strode to the cabin hatch he saw the lieutenant hurrying to the rail the fact that the forecourse was not drawing as it should was no excuse for taking out his temper on davy he strode past the sentry and slammed the cabin door behind him but there was no escape here noddall was laying plates on the table his face stiffly resentful as mrs raymonds maid followed him around the cabin like an amused child raymond was slumped in a chair by the stern windows apparently dozing and his wife sat on the bench seat fanning herself and watching noddalls preparations a look of complete boredom on her face bolitho made to go but she called come along captain we barely see you from day to day she patted the bench seat with the fan sit awhile your precious ship will survive i think bolitho sat down and leaned one elbow on the sill it was good to feel life in the wind again to watch the lift and swirl of foam as it surged freely from the counter or came up gurgling around the rudder then he turned slightly and looked at her she had been aboard all this time and yet he knew little of her she was watching him now her eyes partly amused partly questioning probably two or three years older than himself he thought not beautiful but with the aristocratic presence which commanded instant attention she had fine even teeth and her hair which she had allowed to flow loosely across her shoulders was the colour of autumn while he and the rest of his officers had found difficulty in keeping cool or finding a clean shirt after the suns tyranny or some fierce squall in the south atlantic she had always managed to remain perfect as she was now her gown was not merely worn it was arranged so that he and not she looked out of place against the stern windows her earrings were heavy and he guessed their value would pay most of his marines for a year or more she smiled do you enjoy what you see captain bolitho started i am sorry maam i am tired she exclaimed how gallant i am sorry it is only weariness which makes you look at me she held up the fan and added i am mocking you captain do not look so depressed bolitho smiled thank you he thought suddenly of that other time in new york three years ago another ship his first command and the world opening up just for him a woman had shown him that life was not so kind nor was it easy he admitted i have had a lot on my mind i have been used to action and sharp decisions for most of my life merely to make sail and face an empty sea day by day is something alien to me sometimes i feel more like a grocerycaptain than that of a manowar she watched him thoughtfully i can believe it i should have realised earlier she gave a slow smile her lashes hiding her eyes then maybe i would not have offended you bolitho shook his head much of it was my fault i have been so long in ships of war that i have become used to expecting others to share my dedication if there is a fire i expect all close by to quench it if a man tries to overrun authority by mutiny or in an enemys name i would call for others to strike him down or do so myself he faced her gravely that is why i expected you to aid the men injured in the wreck he shrugged again i expected it i did not ask she nodded that admission must have surprised you as much as it did me captain she showed her teeth it has cleared the air a little yes he touched his forehead unconsciously plucking at the rebellious lock of black hair which clung to the skin with sweat he saw her eyes widen as she caught sight of the livid scar beneath and said quickly forgive me maam i must go and examine my charts before we dine she watched him as he stood up and said you wear your authority well captain she glanced at her sleeping husbandunlike some bolitho did not know how to reply i am afraid that is hardly for me to discuss maam he looked up as feet thudded across the deck and shadows flitted above the open skylight she asked what is it he did not see the annoyance in her eyes i am not sure a ship perhaps i gave orders i was to be informed so that i can take avoiding action noddall paused two forks in his hand i eard no ail from th mastead sir there was a rap at the door and herrick stood in the entrance his chest heaving from exertion i am sorry to burst in he looked past bolitho towards the woman it would be better if you came with me sir bolitho stepped from the cabin and pulled the door behind him in the doorway which opened on to the ships wardroom he saw a small group waiting for him they looked confused stricken like strangers there was bellairs accompanied by his towering sergeant triphook his horse teeth bared as if to snap at an unseen attacker and cowering just behind him was the ships cooper a small hunched petty officer named joseph duff he was the second oldest man aboard and wore steelrimmed spectacles at his work although he usually managed to hide them from his messmates for much of the time herrick said quietly duff has reported that most of the fresh water is undrinkable sir he swallowed under bolithos stare he was doing his usual inspection and has just reported to the ships corporal triphook was murmuring fervently in all my days never never have i seen the like bolitho beckoned to the cooper well duff i am waiting what is this find which you have discovered duff blinked at him through the oval glasses he looked like a greyhaired mole me usual inspection sir he grew smaller as they crowded round him soames had come from his own cabin and loomed over bellairs shoulder like a cliff duff continued shakily the casks was all good uns i saw to that sir first thing i always looks for i learned me work under a fine old cooper in the gladiator when i first took on sir an for gods sake duff herrick sounded desperate tell the captain duff lowered his head most of the casks is foul sir they as to be sergeant coaker stepped forward his boots creaking as the ship tilted in a sudden trough he was holding a small bundle but keeping it away from his tunic as if it were alive open it the sergeant unfolded the parcel very carefully his face set like stone bolitho felt the deck soaring violently tasted the vomit clawing at his throat screwed up as if at the instant shock of amputation it was tl human hand soames choked in the name of christ duff said in a small voice in all of em sir cept the last two casks by the bulkead triphook said heavily hes right sir bits of flesh he trembled violently his face breaking out in sweat the work of a demon there was a sharp cry of horror and bolitho stepped in front of the cooper as mrs raymond gasped im going to be sick he saw her leaning against the marine sentry her face like chalk as she stared fixedly at the group by the wardroom bolitho snapped get rid of that object to noddalls hovering shadow he added call that damned maid and attend to the lady his mind was reeling from duffs gruesome discovery what it meant and what he now had to do fetch the surgeon bellairs dabbed his lips with a handkerchief carry on sarnt coaker pass the word for mr whitmarsh he glanced at the others though i doubt he will be able to assist what herrick asked would you care to come in here sir he stood aside to allow bolitho to enter the wardroom it was small and compact the table laid for a meal and at odds with the twelvepounders which were lashed at each open port bolitho sat down heavily on a sea chest and stared through the nearest gun port the fair wind and dancing water held no more attraction danger was within the ship his ship herrick prompted some wine sir when he turned bolitho saw the others watching him soames at the top of the table bellairs and triphook seated on the opposite side in those fleeting seconds he recalled his own life as a junior lieutenant in a frigate the wardroom was the place you shared not merely your food and your life you shared your doubts and drew on your companions for help whenever it was needed aft behind his bulkhead the captain had been a remote godly character beyond reach at no time that he could recall had he imagined a captain required anything but obedience it even felt different here pistols in a rack some shirts hanging to air which the wardroom servant had just washed the smell of something simmering in a pot he replied thank you i would relish a glass just now they relaxed slightly and soames said it will mean turning back sir he thought about it or making for the african coast mebbee feet creaked outside the door and then mudge pushed his way into the wardroom his grey hair sprouting as he threw his hat into a corner god blast me eyes but whats this bloody deed ive bin told he saw bolitho and muttered beggin yer pardon sir i was not expectin to discover you in ere herrick held out a glass some rhenish sir he did not smile but his eyes were calm almost pleading still fairly fresh i think bolitho sipped it gratefully thank you he tasted the sourness in his throat after what i have just witnessed he swung round as the surgeon lurched through the door his shirt unbuttoned his gaze bleary you have been told the news mr whitmarsh he watched the effort he was making to focus his eyes the growth of stubble on his chin whitmarsh had been quietly making up for all the time he had stayed with his patients well whitmarsh groped his way to a gun and leaned on it with both hands sucking air through the open port like a drowning man i heard sir he retched i heard bolitho watched him impassively as the water casks were fresh when stowed aboard at spithead it would seem likely that these human fragments came from your surgery he waited feeling pity for the man but knowing the need for haste would you agree i expect so whitmarsh lurched to the table and poured a large measure of wine bolitho said sharply if you drink that mr whitmarsh i will see to it that you do not get another drop while you are under my command he stood up now think man who could have done this whitmarsh stared at the glass in his hand his body swaying badly despite the easy motion i was kept busy they were in a poor way sir i had my loblolly boys and my mate to assist me he screwed up his red face in an effort to remember the sweat dripping off his chin like rain it was sullivan i gave him the job of clearing amputated limbs and the like from my sickbay he was very helpful he nodded vaguely its all coming to me now sullivan he turned and stared fixedly at bolitho the manyou had flogged sir herrick said harshly dont be so bloody impertinent to the captain bolitho found he was suddenly very calm in your opinion mr whitmarsh will the casks be any further use after this none the surgeon was still glaring at him they must be scoured at once the contents thrown overboard a mouthful of that water after gangrenous flesh has been in it and youll have a raging fever aboard ive known it happen theres no cure bolitho placed his glass on the table very slowly giving his mind time to steady it seems that you are not the only one who wishes to turn back mr herrick now take hold of sullivan and guard him before he does some other mischief he turned to whitmarsh i have not finished with you yet feet clattered on the quarterdeck ladder and herrick reappeared in the doorway sir that fool sullivan is aloft on the crojack yard hes raving mad nobody can get near him then bolitho heard men shouting more feet pounding overhead he said i will go up he found the gangways crowded with seamen and marines while don puigserver and his spanish lieutenant had joined the work of a demon davy by the quarterdeck rail to watch a bosuns mate who was clinging to the mizzen shrouds and trying to reach sullivan the seaman was perched on the yard totally indifferent to the great billowing sail at his back and the hard sunlight which lanced across his body he was completely naked but for his belt where he carried the broadbladed dirk which had brought about his flogging in the first place davy said anxiously i did not know what to do sir the man is obviously moonstruck or worse the bosuns mate bellowed now yew get down on deck or by the livin jesus ill pitch you there meseif sullivan threw back his head and laughed it was a shrill unnerving sound now now mr roskilly what would you do then lay your little ropes end on me he laughed again and then pulled out the knife come along then matey im awaitin you you goddamned lickspittle bolitho called come down roskilly youll do no good by getting killed sullivan craned under the vibrating yard well blow me down mates an who ave we ere our gallant captain no less he rocked with laughter an es all aback cause poor old tom sullivans spoiled the water for him some of the watching seamen had been grinning at the spectacle on the quarterdeck the mention of water soon altered that bolitho looked at the upturned faces feeling the spreading alarm like the edge of a fire he walked aft his shoes loud in the sudden hush around him below the yard he stopped and looked up come along sullivan he was in the sunlight and with no shade from the bellying sail above he felt the sweat pouring down his chest and thighs just as he could sense the other mans hatred you have done enough today sullivan cackled did you hear that lads done enough he twisted on the yard the glare playing across the scars on his back pale against the tanned skin youve done enough to me capn bloody bolitho herrick snapped sergeant coaker have one of your marksmen brought aft that man is a damned danger up there belay that bolitho kept his eyes on the crossjack yard he is past reason ill not have him shot down like some mad dog he sensed puigserver was watching him and not the man on the yard and that allday was close by a cutlass in his hand but they were all excluded it was between him and sullivan he called i am asking you sullivan he recalled the womans face in the cabin i did not ask you go to hell captain sullivan was screaming now his naked body twisting on the yard as if in torment an ill take you there now bolitho hardly saw his hand move just the brief flash of sunlight on the blade and then gasped as the knife cut through his sleeve before embedding itself in the deck by his right shoe so great was the force that nearly an inch of blade was driven into the planking sullivan was transfixed a long streamer of spittle trailing to the wind as he stared down at bolitho at the foot of the mast bolitho remained motionless feeling the blood running down his elbow and forearm and on to the deck he did not take his eyes off sullivan and the concentration helped to overcome the searing pain left by the blade sullivan stood up wildly and began to scramble outboard along the yard everybody began to yell at once and bolitho felt herrick gripping his arm another wrapping a cloth around it deadening the pain whitmarsh had appeared below the nettings and he too was shouting at the man framed against the clear sky sullivan turned and spoke in a level voice for the first time and you too doctor god damn you to hell then he jumped out and down his body hitting the water with a violent splash for a moment he floated past the quarter and as the spankers great shadow passed over him he clasped his hands above his head and vanished herrick said we could never pick him up if we tried to heaveto under this canvas wed tear the sticks out of her bolitho did not know to whom he was speaking perhaps to himself he walked to the hatch holding his torn and bloodied sleeve with one hand he saw the bosuns mate roskilly pulling the knife out of the deck he was a strong man but it took him two attempts to tug it clear puigserver followed him below and then stepped in front of him that was a brave thing you did capilan he sighed but he could have killed you bolitho nodded the pain was getting worse we have some hard times ahead senor we must find water and soon he tightened his jaw but i am not turning back puigserver eyed him sadly you made a gesture one which might have ended your life and all for a madman bolitho walked to the cabin maybe we were both mad herrick hurried after him and as they entered the cabin bolitho saw there was a chair directly under the skylight raymond must have been standing on it to watch the drama overhead mrs raymond was aft by the windows she looked very pale but came towards him saying your arm captain she shouted to her maid bandages bolitho realised that herrick was in the cabin well herrick watched him worriedly what you did it could have killed me i know bolitho forced a smile i have already been told herrick breathed out slowly and i believed i knew you sir and now he looked at him steadily thomas herrick grinned i only know that you never cease to surprise me and others he gestured to the deckhead a seaman who has been cursing and complaining for near on a month was just heard to damn sullivans soul for threatening the life of his captain his grin faded but id rather you rallied our people in some other way sir bolitho held out his arm as the maid carried a basin to the desk if you know of any way to keep up their spirits thomas id be obliged to hear it in the meantime call the hands and get the royals on her i want every stitch she can carry he checked him as he made for the door and pass the word one pint of water per day he glanced around the cabin officers and passengers included herrick hesitated and the surgeon sir bolitho looked down at the maid as she cleaned the deep cut on his arm she returned his glance boldly he said i am in good hands it seems i will think about mr whitmarsh when i have more time he added grimly and at this moment time is of the greatest value in the world bolitho waited by the open stern windows and watched the moon making a fine path across the water the sea looked unusually choppy but he knew it was from a steep undertow which explored the depths many miles from the african coast at his back he heard the others moving into the cabin and finding somewhere to sit the sounds of goblets and wine as noddall went about his business despite the cool air after the days blazing sunlight his body felt drained and stiff and about him the ship creaked and groaned her timbers so driedout that it was a wonder she was not leaking like an old bucket a week since sullivan had jumped to his death seven long days while he had taken his ship inshore time and time again only to stand off at the report of some sail or an unexplained sighting of a native craft now he could delay no longer he had been visited by whitmarsh that afternoon a man so tormented by his own worries that it had been a difficult interview whitmarsh had made it quite definite that he could no longer be held responsible if bolitho persisted in staying clear of land the two remaining casks of water were almost empty and what remained was little better than scum more men were lying ill on the orlop deck and those fit enough to work ship had to be watched by the minute tempers flared and petty officers went about their duties with an eye on their backs for a knifethrust in a momentary display of madness herrick reported all ready sir like the others tense watchful bolitho turned and looked around his officers all but soames who was on duty were present even the three midshipmen he watched them gravely it might teach them something he thought i intend to close the land again tomorrow he saw don puigserver by the bulkhead with his lieutenant raymond a few feet away from him rubbing his face in sharp agitated movements davy said makes fine sense sir he swallowed some wine if we give our people more rum to drink as we cut down the water well be too tipsy to do anything he forced a smile a fine situation it would be bolitho turned to mudge he was in the largest chair still wearing his thick coat and staring up at the open skylight as a moth darted into the lanterns beam he saw bolithos expression and sighed i called at this place just the once sir when i was masters mate in the windsor indiaman we was in much the same trouble ourselves then no water becalmed for weeks on end an with alf the people goin wild with thirst bolitho asked but there is water available mudge moved his chair towards the desk in short squeaky jerks then he jabbed the open chart with his thumb wem now in th mozambique channel as we all knows he glared at midshipman armitage cept for some too hignorant to learn aright he continued in a more unruffled tone th african coast is fair wild ereabouts an not a lot be known about it ships put in of course his eyes gleamed as he looked up at bolitho tor water to trade mebbee an to find theirselves some black ivory from time to time midshipman keen was leaning over his shoulder his face the only one present which showed little sign of strain black ivory sir herrick said sharply slaves mudge leaned back comfortably it follows that we must be careful land in force get the water if i can recall exactly where it is and stand out to sea agin bellairs said my marines will give a good account thank you mudge regarded him scornfully just so capn bellairs sir in their pretty coats with their drums and fifes i can picture it a fair treat he added harshly theyd ave em for breakfast afore they could polish their bloody boots well really bellairs was shocked bolitho nodded very well then the wind is staying with us so we should be able to anchor by noon tomorrow mudge agreed aye but not close inshore sir theres a fair bit o reef just around the point itll mean every boat in th water an a ard pull for all ands yes bolitho looked at davy you can arrange the arming of each boat with the gunner swivels for launch and cutter musketoons for the rest he glanced round at their intent faces ill want an officer with each party some of our people will need watching if only for their own sakes he let his words sink in remember it well many of them are quite raw to this sort of work although because we have been together for over two months you may see them as veterans they are not so treat them accordingly lead them do not be content to leave your work to others less qualified he saw the midshipmen exchanging glances like boys about to take part in some private escapade keen his eyes sparkling with excitement little penn openly impressed by being included poor armitage his forehead raw red from being on watch for a few moments without a hat they were even less experienced than most of the men he looked at the chart but for sullivan they might have made the whole voyage to madras without a pause despite their shortages herrick had tried to help by saying it was bad luck puigserver had stated that he was behind him whatever he decided was best for the ship but it was still his decision and nobody else could change that some of those present in the cabin had stopped speaking with the surgeon altogether and perhaps for that reason alone bolitho had made no further comment about his choice of sullivan as a helper giving him the opportunity crazy or not of fouling the water supply he saw him only on matters of sick reports and each time was shocked by his appearance the man was boiling inside bitter and yet unable to share his problems he did not even want to he heard a womans voice saw the others look up at the skylight as feet passed overhead mrs raymond and her maid taking their usual stroll under the stars he hoped soames would ensure they did not stray from the quarterdeck he would not answer for their safety at the hands of some of the seamen he could understand how many of them felt to the volunteers it must seem a far cry from the recruiting posters and to the men from the prison hulks it might now appear to be a bad exchange of circumstances even those hiding from crimes committed ashore would find room for doubt and resentment the crimes would have faded with the fear of arrest and trial but the heat and thirst and the daily grind of disciplined duty were only too real he saw raymond biting his lip his eyes following the footsteps as if he was seeing through the deckhead itself if anything he and his wife were moving further apart by being confined in the ship it was a strange relationship he thought back over the past days and one particular incident he had been in his small makeshift cabin in the chart space and allday had been changing the bandage on his arm for him she had entered the cabin without knocking in fact neither of them had heard her approach she had stood by the open port quite relaxed and had watched him without saying a word bolitho had been stripped to the waist and as he reached for a fresh shirt she had said softly i see you bear yet another scar captain bolithos hand had gone to his side suddenly conscious of the ragged mark where a pistol ball had missed his ribs by a thread he had seen it exactly as he was seeing it now the privateers tilting deck the american lieutenant running towards him taking aim the crash of a shot the sharp stabbing agony oblivion allday had said rudely the captains dressing ships ways are different from those ashore it seems but she had stood firm her lips slightly parted while she watched him but how could she have understood what he was thinking that the ball had been fired by one of his own brothers officers a traitor a wanted renegade now dead and forgotten by most but not by me he shook himself out of his brooding thoughts nothing mattered now but the work in hand water all that he needed to take them to madras beyond that was another challenge it could wait he said that is all gentlemen he realised he had spoken more abruptly than intended and added we have a fine ship one of the most efficient and modern devices created by man we can give a good account of ourselves to any vessel but a ship of the line he paused as herrick smiled at him bridging the gap between them as he too remembered except for rare and not to be encouraged occasions but without water to drink we are like stumbling old men with neither the means nor the will to face another day remember what i have said be vigilant for the moment that is all i ask of you they filed out of the cabin leaving him with puigserver and raymond raymond looked hopefully at the spaniard but when he made no attempt to take his usual walk on deck he too left the cabin bolitho sat down and watched the moonlight as it played across the undines bubbling wake what is the matter with him senor it was strange how easy it was to talk to him just over a year back he had been an enemy one bolitho would have killed in battle had he not called for quarter he smiled to himself or the other way round he was a powerful man that was certain and much of his counsel he kept to himself but bolitho trusted him the ships company for the most part had also accepted him as their own like allday who had long given up trying to pronounce his name they called him mister pigsliver but they said it with something near to affection puigserver regarded him with quiet amusement my dear capitan he is like a watchdog he fears for his wife what she will do rather than what others will do to her he chuckled the sound rising from his belly she i think is beginning to enjoy the game knowing that every man aboard sees her in a different eye she stands proudly a tigress in our midst you seem to know a great deal about her senor the smile broadened you know your ships capitan unlike me i fear you still have much to learn about women eh bolitho made to protest and then changed his mind the memory was still too painful to leave room for a denial attack overland well thomas what dyou make of it at close quarters bolithos voice was hushed as with the others around him he stared towards the shore they had made a careful approach since dawn seeing the land gaining shape and substance and then as the sun had found them again they had watched the colour the endless panorama of green with two experienced leadsmenin the chains and under minimum canvas undine had felt her way towards the land it had looked like an untouched world with jungle so thick it seemed impossible for anything to move freely away from the sea herrick replied quietly the master seems satisfied sir he trained his telescope over the hammock nettings as he described it a round headland to the north and that strangelooking hill about a mile inland bolitho stepped onto a bollard and peered down over the nettings undine had finally dropped anchor some four cables offshore to give her searoom and a safe depth at all times nevertheless it looked very shallow and he could even see the great shadow of undines coppered hull on the bottom pale sand like that on the various small crescentshaped beaches they had seen on their cautious approach long trailers of strange weed writhing to the current far below the ship as if in a tired sort of dance but to larboard as the ship swung to her cable he saw other shapes browns and greens like stains in the water reefs mudge was right to be so careful not that anyone would need reminding after nervions fate alongside the first boats had already been swayed out and shellabeer the boatswain was gesticulating with his fists at some spanish seamen who were baling one of them it would do the frail hulls good to be afloat again bolitho thought he said absently i shall go with the boats and you will keep a good watch in case of trouble he could almost feel herricks unspoken protest but added if anything goes wrong ashore it might help some of our people if they see im sharing it with them he turned and clapped herricks shoulder besides which i feel like stretching my legs it is my prerogative on the gun deck davy was striding back and forth inspecting the men mustered for the boats checking weapons and the tackle for hoisting and lowering water casks when the work was begun overhead the sky was very pale as if the sun had boiled the colour from it and had spread it instead across the glittering stretch of sea between ship and shore bolitho marvelled at the stillness just an occasional necklace of white surf along the nearest beach and at the foot of the headland it was as if it was holding its breath and he could imagine a thousand eyes watching the anchored frigate from amongst the trees there were loud thumps as the swivel guns were lowered into the bows of launch and cutter and more shouted orders while the bellmouthed musketoons found their proper mountings in gig and pinnace the jolly boat was to remain with the ship it was too small for the great casks and might be needed in an emergency he rubbed his chin and stared at the land emergency it appeared safe enough all the way along the coast as they had slipped past one bay or inlet after another and all of which had seemed identical to everyone but mudge he had waited for some sign a hint of danger but not a boat drawn up on the sand not a wisp of smoke from a fire not even a bird had broken the stillness boats ready sir shellabeer tilted his swarthy face in the glare bolitho walked to the rail and looked down at the gun deck the seamen seemed altered yet again perhaps because of their cutlasses the way they glanced at each other their torment of thirst momentarily put aside most of them were very different from the men who had first joined the ship their bared backs were well browned with only an occasional scar of sunburn to mark the foolish or the unwary he called over yonder is africa lads he felt the rustle of excitement expanding like a wind over corn youll be seeing many more places before we are homeward bound again do as you are bid stay with your parties and no harm should come to you he hardened his tone but it is a dangerous country and the natives hereabouts have had little cause to like or trust the foreign sailorman so keep a good watch and work well with the casks he nodded man your boats mudge joined him at the gangway as the first men swung their way down the side i should be agoin with you sir ive told me best masters mate fowlar what to look for anes a good man that e be bolitho lifted his arms as allday buckled on his sword then what troubles you mr mudge mudge scowled time was when i could swim alf a mile an then march another with a full load on me back herrick grinned and still have the wind to bed a fine wench ill be bound mudge glared at him your timell come mr errick it aint no pleasure gettin old bolitho smiled your value is here to herrick he said rig boarding nets during our stay with only an anchor watch and the marines at your back you might be in bother if someone tries to surprise you he touched his arm i know i am overcautious i can read your face like a chart but better so than dead he glanced at the shore especially here he walked to the entry port the boats will return two by two send the rest of the men as soon as you can theyll tire easily enough in this heat he saw puigserver wave to him from the gangway and raymond watching from right aft by his wifes little canopy he touched his hat to the side party and climbed quickly down into the gig where allday waited by the tiller shove off one by one the boats idled clear of the frigates shadow and then with oars moving in unison turned towards the land bolitho remained standing to examine his little flotilla lieutenant soames with the launch undines largest boat every inch of space filled with men and casks while in the bows a gun captain crouched over the loaded swivel like some kind of figurehead then the cutter also deeply laden with davy in control his figure very slim against that of mr pryke undines portly carpenter as was proper pryke was going ashore in the hopes of finding timber suitable for small repairs about the ship midshipman keen accompanied by little penn had the pinnace and bolitho could see them bobbing about with obvious excitement as they pulled steadily across the water bolitho glanced astern at his ship seeing the figures on her deck already small and impersonal someone was in the cabin and he guessed it was mrs raymond watching the boats avoiding her husband probably neither then he looked down at the men in the gig at the weapons between their straddled legs at the way they avoided his scrutiny right forward he saw a man moving the musketoon from side to side to free the mount from caked salt and realised it was turpin the one who had tried so desperately to deceive davy at spithead he saw bolitho watching him and held up his arm in place of his hand he had a hook of bright steel he called the gunner had it fixed up for me sir he was grinning bettern the real thing bolitho smiled at him he at least seemed in good spirits he watched the slow moving hulls about eighty officers and men with more to follow when he could spare the boats he sat down and shaded his eyes with his hat as he did so he touched the scar above his eye remembering that other watering party he had been with so long ago the sudden charge screams all about him that great towering savage brandishing a cutlass he had just seized from a dying sailor he had seen it only for a second and then fallen senseless his face a mask of blood it had been a closerun thing but for his coxswain it would have been the end herrick probably resented his landing with this watering party it was work normally given to a lieutenant but that memory like the scar was a constant reminder of what could go wrong without any sort of warning cable to go captain allday eased the tiller bar slightly bolitho started he must have been dreaming undine looked far away now a graceful toy while right across the bows and reaching out on either hand like huge green arms was the land once again mudges memory proved to be sure and reliable within two hours of beaching the boats and sorting the hands into working parties the masters mate fowlar reported finding a little stream and that the water was the freshest thing he had tasted for years the work was begun immediately armed pickets were placed at carefully chosen vantage points and lookouts sent to the top of the small hill below which mudges stream gurgled away into the dense jungle after the first uncertainty of stepping on to dry land with all the usual unsteadiness to their sealegs the sailors soon settled down to the task pryke the carpenter and his mates quickly assembled some heavy sledges upon which the filled casks would be hauled down to the boats and while the cooper stood watchfully at the stream the other men were busy with axes clearing a path through the trees under fowlars personal supervision with midshipman penn trotting at his heels to act as messenger bolitho retained contact between beach and stream making several journeys to ensure the operation was working smoothly lieutenant soames was in charge of the beach and of allocating more men to the work as they were ferried ashore davy had the inland part while keen was usually to be seen with some armed men at his back trudging around the labouring sailors to make sure there were no unwelcome visitors fowlar had discovered two native fireplaces almost immediately but they were decayed and scattered and it seemed unlikely that anyone had been near them for months nevertheless as he paused to watch over the progress of each party bolitho was conscious of a feeling of menace of hostility which was hard to define on his way inland to the stream yet again he had to stand aside as a heavy sledge hauled by some two dozen blaspheming seamen careered past him shaking the undergrowth and making several great red birds flap between the trees squawking discordantly bolitho watched the birds and then stepped back on to the crude trail it was good to know something was alive here he thought beneath the trees where the sky was hidden from view the air was heavy and stank of rotting vegetation here and there something clicked and rustled or a small beady eye glittered momentarily in filtered sunlight before vanishing just as swiftly penn gasped might be makes sir he was panting hard his shirt plastered to his body from his exertions to keep up bolitho found davy beneath a wall of overhanging rock marking his list as yet another cask was sealed by duff for the bumpy ride to the beach the second lieutenant straightened his back and observed going well sir good bolitho stooped and cupped his hands into the stream it was like wine despite the rotten looking roots which sprouted from either bank we will finish before dark he looked up at a patch of blue sky as the trees gave a stealthy rustle it was unmoving air below the matted branches but above and to seaward the wind was holding well i am going up the hill mr davy he thought he heard penn sigh with despair i hope your lookouts are awake it was a long hard walk and when they moved clear of the trees for the final climb to the summit bolitho felt the sun searing down on his shoulders the heat through his shoes from the rough stones like coals off a grate but the two lookouts seemed contented enough in their stained trousers and shirts with their tanned faces almost hidden by straw hats they looked more like castaways than british seamen they had rigged a small shelter with a scrap of canvas behind which lay their weapons water flasks and a large brass telescope one knuckled his forehead and said orizons clear capn bolitho tugged his hat over his eyes as he stared down the hill the coastline was more uneven than he had imagined water glittering between the thick layers of trees to reveal some inlet or cover not marked on any chart inland and towards a distant barrier of tall hills there was nothing but an undulating sea of trees so closeknit it looked possible to walk upright across the top of them he picked up the telescope and trained it on the ship she was writhing and bending in a surface haze but he saw the boats moving back and forth very slowly like tired waterbeetles he felt grit and dust under his fingers and guessed the telescope had spent more time lying on the hillside than in use he heard penn sucking noisily at a water flask and could sense the lookouts willing him to leave them in peace theirs might be a thirsty job but it was far easier than hauling casks through the forest he moved the glass again all those men sledges and casks yet from here he could see none of them even the beach was shielded the boats as they drew near the shore appeared to vanish into the trees as if swallowed whole bolitho turned to his right the movement making the men stir with alarm in the telescopes lens the trees and slivers of trapped water grew and receded as he continued his search something had touched the corner of his eye but what the lookouts were watching him doubtfully each caught in his own attitude as if mesmerised a trick of light he blinked and rubbed his eye nothing he began another slow scrutiny thick characterless forest or was that merely what he expected to see and therefore he stiffened and held his breath when he lowered the glass the picture fell away into the distance he waited counting seconds allowing his breathing to steady the lookouts had begun to whisper again and penn was drinking as before they probably imagined he had been too long in the sun he lifted the glass very carefully there to the right where he had already noticed a faint gleam of water was something darker at odds with the forests greens and browns he stared at it until his eye watered so painfully he could not continue then he closed the glass with a snap and said there is a ship yonder he saw penn gaping at him transfixed to the southrd it must be some sort of inlet which we did not see earlier he shaded his eyes trying to estimate the distance where it lay in relation to undine and the beach where he had come ashore one of the lookouts exclaimed oi never saw nothin sir he looked frightened and worse bolitho stared past him trying to think take this glass and make sure you can see it now he knew the seaman was more frightened of his captain or what might become of him because of his negligence than anything this discovery might mean bolithos mind recorded all these reactions as he said have you found it aye sir the man bobbed unhappily tis a mast right enough thank you bolitho added dryly keep your eye on it i do not want it to vanish again penn dropped the flask and scuttled after him as he strode down the hill whwhat might it mean sir several things he felt the trees looming around him a small relief from the suns torment they may have sighted us and are lying low until we weigh perhaps they are intent on some other mischief i am not certain he quickened his pace ignoring creepers and fronds which plucked at his body but for that brief flaw in the lenss picture he would have seen nothing known nothing about the other vessel perhaps it would have been better that way maybe he was worrying to no purpose he found davy as before lounging in the shade of the hillside his features relaxed as he watched his men filling the casks where is mr fowlar davy came out of his torpor with a jerk er on the beach sir damn another hard mile before he could examine fowlars chart and mudges notes he looked up at the sky hours yet before sunset but when it did come it would be quick shutting out the light like a curtain i have discovered a ship mr davy well hidden to the southrd of us he saw the carpenter emerge from the under growth a saw glinting in one fist take charge here mr pryke he beckoned to davy we are going to the beach pryke nodded his fat face glowing like a ripe apple aye sir he looked at duff there be only five more casks by my reckonin well speed the work i want our people mustered as soon as the last one is filled davy hurried along at his side his handsome face puzzled do you think this ship may be an enemy sir i intend to find out they completed the journey in silence and bolitho knew that davy like the lookouts thought he was making too much of it fowlar listened to him calmly and then examined his chart if it is where i believe then it is not marked here so it must lie somewhere twixt this beach and the next bay he made a mark about there i would suggest sir could we reach it before dark overland fowlars eyes widened but he answered it looks close enough sir no moren three mile or so but that is four times as much in the jungle he dropped his eyes from bolithos gaze you might be able to do it sir davy asked but if we wait until tomorrow sir we could have undine anchored nearer this vessel you have found it would take too long she may have weighed and gone overnight and if they are aware of our presence and purpose a boat attack would be useless in daylight and in a confined inlet you should know that mr davy davy looked at his shoes yes sir another heavy cask lurched down the beach the men panting like animals running from the hounds soames who had trudged up the beach to listen said suddenly she might be a slaver in which case she will be well armed he rubbed his chin and nodded yours is a good plan sir his thick forefinger scratched over the chart we could cross the bottom of the hill where it reaches for the sea and strike south if we travel lightly we should be at the inlet before dark he looked at davy his eyes hard i pick some good men ones who wont falter when the passage gets rough davy said nothing he was obviously smarting because soames had offered a course of action rather than an unthinking suggestion bolitho looked towards the ship very well we will rest the hands for half an hour then we will begin forty men should be sufficient if we are careful it may be a complete waste of time he thought of the silent jungle watching but to be anchored so dangerously inland i doubt it he beckoned to penn i will write my orders for the first lieutenant and you will take them across directly undine will send her boats tomorrow morning and pick us up from seaward by then we should know he glanced at davy one way or the other he saw keen coming out of the trees a pistol hanging casually from his belt as he turned towards the sea he halted and raised one arm to point it was the jolly boat darting across the water at full speed the oars winking in the sunlight like silver eventually it ground on to the beach and without waiting for it to be made fast midshipman armitage leapt over the gunwale and then fell face down on the sand allday who had been watching critically exclaimed god damn me captain that young gentleman will stumble on an acorn armitage hurried up the beach his cheeks scarlet as he dashed past the groups of grinning seamen he stammered mr herricks respects sir he paused to wipe sand from his chin and we have sighted some small craft to the north of here he pointed haphazardly into the trees a whole party of them mr herrick thinks they may come this way although he stopped screwing up his face as he usually did when passing a message although they have vanished for the present he nodded relieved as he recalled the last part mr herrick suggests they have gone into another beach for some purpose bolitho gripped his hands behind him the very thing he had been expecting had happened it could not have come at a worse time thank you mr armitage davy said quietly that has put paid to the venture sir we cannot be divided if hostile natives are about soames said scathingly a plague on that mr davy we have enough powder and shot to scatter a thousand bloody savages that will do bolitho glared at them his mind struggling with the problem mr herrick is probably correct they may have gone ashore to hunt or to make camp either way it makes our mission all the more urgent he watched soames thoughtfully seeing the mixture of anger and triumph in his deepset eyes select your men at once davy asked stiffly what will i do sir bolitho turned away in a handtohand struggle soames would be the better man if things went against them herrick would need brains rather than brawn if he was to continue the voyage on his own resources you will return to the ship with the last of the shore parties he scribbled a note on fowlars pad and you will convey my he hesitated not seeing the desperation which clouded davys face my ideas to him as best you can davy said tightly i am senior to soames sir it is my right to take part in this bolitho looked at him calmly i will decide where your duty lies your loyalty i take for granted he watched soames marching up and down a double line of men your turn will come be sure of that a shadow fell across fowlars chart and bolitho saw the spanish lieutenant rojart watching him his face as sad as ever yes teniente he must have come ashore in one of the other boats rojart said i arrive to offer my services capitan he looked at davy and allday his face very proud don luis as instructed me to do all i can to elp you bolitho sighed rojart had already shown himself to be somewhat of a dreamer or perhaps his cruel experiences in the shipwreck had made him as he was but one more officer spanish or not would be useful he also provided an excuse he said to davy so you see mr herrick will need your services more than ever now to rojart he replied i accept your offer teniente thank you the spaniard gave a flashing smile and bowed your servant capitin allday grinned and murmured god help us all another cask was being manhandled on to the beach and duff puffed out of the trees folding his spectacles as he shouted that be the last un sir he beamed at the onlookers a full load soames tightened his swordbelt and said ready when you are sir he pointed to the assembled seamen all armed but without any unnecessary gear to drag em back he ignored davy keen and his pickets were gathering at the end of the beach and by the shallows pryke stood guard over an odd pile of timber which his mates had collected for him davy touched his hat formally i wish you luck sir bolitho smiled thank you i hope we will not need it just yet he glanced at fowlar lead the way and make notes as we go who knows we may come here again some day then he turned his back on the sea and strode up the beach towards the trees we will rest now bolitho dragged his watch from his breeches pocket and peered at it its face was harder to see than the last occasion when he looked up at a gap in the trees he thought the sky was already duller the trees touched with purple instead of gold around him the seamen dropped wearily on their knees or leaned against the trees trying to gain relief after their forced march the first part had not been too difficult with axes swinging to carve a trail they had made good time but as they drew closer to where bolitho and fowlar estimated the inlet lay they had stopped using axes and had fought their way through the brush and creeper with bare hands he looked at them thoughtfully their shirts were ripped and torn faces and arms bloody from encounters with treacherous branches and thorns at their backs the intertwined trees had grown blacker and seemed to shiver in the vapour of dead vegetation as if in a wind which could not be felt soames was wiping his face and neck with a rag ive sent scouts ahead sir he knocked a water bottle from a mans mouth easy damn you that may have to last awhile yet bolitho saw him with different eyes like the men soames had selected as scouts for instance not the toughest or the most seasoned seamen as a lieutenant of his background might be expected to choose both scouts were from undines newest recruits and had never been to sea before one had worked on a farm and the other had been a norfolk wildfowler excellent choices both he thought they had gone off into the trees with hardly a sound allday muttered what dyou think captain his sturdy figure familiar and reassuring made bolitho relax slightly he replied i think we are very near now he wondered how herrick was managing and whether he had sighted any more native craft he shivered like most of his men he felt out of place here cut off fowlar hissed stand to lads someones acomin muskets moved blindly in the gloom and a few men started to draw their cutlasses soames snapped a scout he strode towards the shadow by god hodges that was quickly done the man stepped into the small clearing and looked at bolitho i found the ship sir she be about alf a mile away he stretched out one arm if we veers a piece we should be able to reach er within the hour what else hodges shrugged he was a lean man and bolitho could well picture him as a wildfowler creeping about in the norfolk marshes he said i didnt stray too near youll understand sir but theyre anchored close in theres more on em ashore in a clearing i card someone he faltered sort of moanin he shuddered it made me flesh tingle i can tell you sir soames said harshly as i thought bloody slavers theyll have a camp ashore they collect the poor devils and sort em into groups girls in one party men in tother they weigh em then decide who will last the voyage to wherever the cargo is bound fowlar spat on the dead leaves and nodded the rest they leave behind cut their throats to save powder and shot bolitho looked at the scout trying to shut fowlars blunt comment from his thoughts everyone knew it happened nobody seemed to know how to deal with it especially when many influential persons reaped a rich profit from the trade are there guards about i saw two sir but they seem well content the ship as two guns run out soames grunted no doubt a bellyful of grape or canister if anyone tries to free those bastards the spanish lieutenant moved amongst them despite the rough passage through the trees he managed to remain very elegant in his ruffled shirt and wide cuffs peraps we should continue towards the shore capitan he shrugged eloquently there is no sense in arousing this ship if she is a mere slaver yes soames turned away saying nothing but bolitho guessed that like most sailors he was disgusted that rojart could accept slavery as a natural state of affairs we go forward teniente in any case our boats will not come for us until tomorrow he looked at soames take charge i am going to see for myself he beckoned to midshipman keen you too as he felt his way out of the clearing he added the rest of you be ready to follow no talking and hold on to each other if you fear getting separated any man who fires a musket by whatever means or accident will feel my anger hodges pushed ahead saying my mate billy norris is keepin a weather eye on em sir follow close ive marked the way bolitho took his word although he could see no marks anywhere it was amazing how near they had been it seemed no time at all before hodges was tapping his arm and gesturing for him to take cover amidst some sharptoothed scrub and here opening up like a theatre was the inlet and how much lighter it seemed the sunlight still lingering on the trees and painting the sluggishly moving water with rippling reflections he eased himself forward trying to ignore the painful jabs in his hands and chest then he froze forgetting all the discomfort and uncertainty as he saw the ship for the first time behind him he heard allday voicing his thoughts by god captain its the one which lured the dons on to that reef bolitho nodded the brigantine appeared larger in the confined inlet but there was no mistaking her he knew he would not forget her for many a year to come he heard the same pitiful moaning hodges had described and then the sharp clatter of steel on thefar side of the inlet allday whispered putting manacles on the wretches yes he wriggled forward again seeing the brigantines anchor cable a boat alongside the glow of light from her poop as before no flag but there was no doubting her watchfulness two guns already run out muzzles depressed to rake any attacker a boat glided from the shore very slowly and bolitho tensed as a woman cried out the sound dragging at his nerves as it echoed around the trees taking slaves aboard allday ground his teeth theyll be off shortly thats my guess bolitho agreed to keen he said fetch the others tell them to take care he sought out the crouching shape of the second scout you go with him to allday he said quietly if we can seize her well know for sure who was behind nervions destruction allday had his cutlass in both hands im for that captain more thuds and sounds from alongside the brigantine and another shrill cry rising to a scream until it was swiftly silenced by a blow bolitho tried to estimate how far this point was from the sea the slavers master would need to be able to slip away as quietly as he had entered he would require stealth as little noise as possible until he was clear it seemed incredible to be watching this same vessel while undine had waited to search for nervions survivors and had then taken wide detours to avoid land and other ships the slaver had pushed on with his own affairs as if nothing had happened it took ironhard nerves for that there were more sharp cries like animals at slaughter slavers had no nerves no pity he heard furtive noises behind him and soamess voice flat unemotional young keen was right then it is the same vessel he squinted at the treetops beyond the brigantine not much time left sir itll be as black as a boot in an hour maybe less what i believe too bolitho looked at the clearing where the slaves were being gathered a few wisps of smoke from fires probably for a blacksmith to work on the manacles but it was the weakest point take twenty men and move around the camp at the first sign of alarm you open fire with everything you have create panic if nothing else aye makes sense bolitho nodded his mind chilling with excitement a kind of madness which always came at such moments ill want ten men who can swim if we can board her while the slaves are being loaded we might be able to hold the poop until you rush the boats and join us he heard soames rubbing his chin a wild plan sir but its now or never it seems to me its settled then tell rojart to keep a few hands here to protect our flank for this is the way we must go if all fails soames started to crawl away hissing his orders into the forest until he appeared satisfied other figures rustled and grunted nearby and keen said our party is ready sir our party keens teeth looked very white in the fading light i am an excellent swimmer sir allday muttered anxiously i hope there are none of those damned serpents in the water bolitho looked around at their faces how well he had got to know most of them he saw it all in these last moments fear anxiety wildness to match his own even brutal eagerness he said shortly we will slide into the water below the bushes leave your shoes and everything else but your weapons he sought out allday see that the pistols are well wrapped it should keep them dry for a while he studied the sky it was darkening swiftly and only the treetops still held the gentle glow of sunlight in the inlet and around the anchored brigantine the water was dull like liquid mud nosy he caught his breath as the water came up to his waist and then his neck it was very warm he waited a few more seconds expecting to hear a shout or the sound of a musket but the muffled cries from the camp told him he had chosen the time well they were too busy to watch everywhere at once the others were in the water behind him their weapons held high as they paddled slowly away from the bank keen was overtaking him his arms moving smoothly he whispered ill make for the cable sir he was actually grinning further and further still until they had passed the halfway and bolitho knew if they were discovered now they would be lost the masts and yards stood high overhead the furled sails sharp against the sky the lantern light shining more brightly in the descending gloom feet thudded on deck and a man laughed wildly a drunkards laugh perhaps you needed extra rum for such work he thought and then as if by magic they were all together clawing the rounded hull below the starboard cathead the current dragging at their legs folding them against the rough timbers as they fought to stay concealed allday gasped the boatsll never see us here were safe for a bit at that very instant a terrible cry floated across the water and for a moment bolitho imagined someone had been killed but the seaman at his side was floundering and pointing towards the bank which they had just left even in the dying light it was easy to recognise rojarts ruffled shirt he was standing in the open his arms held out as if to seize the inlet and everything it contained he yelled again and again waving his fists stamping his feet as if he had gone raving mad rojarts sudden appearance had brought a complete hush to the brigantines deck but now as voices babbled and shouted and more feet thudded along the planking bolitho knew any hope of surprise was gone keen had been clinging to the bobstay below the bowsprit but now allowed himself to drift down towards him he gasped wretchedly nobody told rojart it was the ship which sank nervion he must have just discovered the sound of the shot was deafening and seemed to come from almost overhead the smoke gushed and eddied across the swirling water making more than one man duck his face to avoid a fit of coughing before it hid the bank bolitho saw rojart hurled away by a full charge of canister a bloody rag not a man at all he clung to the line which allday had bent on to the bobstay and tried to clear his mind the unexpected and unforeseen he winced as another shot crashed out from further aft the hull shivering under his fingers as if alive a ball this time he heard it smashing through the trees and then fading away completely and it was then from beyond the hidden camp that soamess men opened fire herricks decision the sporadic bang of musket fire was almost drowned by the mingled cries and screams from the terrified slaves bolitho heard men tumbling into a boat on the opposite side of the brigantine and confused yells which were probably to encourage their companions in the camp he gestured to allday now over the bows his limbs were like lead as he hauled himself up and across the small beakhead his heart pounding his ribs hearing the gasps and frantic whispers from the men below him as they climbed on to the forecastle he saw groups of manacled natives their naked bodies crowded together while they watched what was happening on the land two armed seamen stood beside a swivel gun but as the boat pulled away from the side they were unable to fire without hitting their comrades allday bellowed at em lads then he was flying along the deck his heavy cutlass taking a man across the neck and felling him without even a cry the second guard dropped on one knee and aimed a musket as more and more of bolithos party scrambled aboard faces lit up in the flash and bolitho felt the ball whine past the sickening sound as it smashed into flesh and bone more of the brigantines crew were dashing wildly from the poop firing as they came regardless of the screaming slaves who fell dying in their path a naked girl her body shining with sweat was trying to reach one of the fallen slaves her arms pinioned by a length of chain husband brother bolitho had no time even to guess as one of the crew hacked her down with his cutlass in order to bar the way aft bolitho felt his sword jerk in his hand as he crossed blades with the girls killer he saw the hatred on the mans bearded face the madness in his eyes as they pressed forward and apart feet sliding in someones blood bodies balanced to withstand each parry all round the deck others were fighting and slashing in the shadows with only an occasional pistol shot to throw light on friend and enemy bolitho pushed the man against the main mast forcing him backwards over the spiderband while their hilts stayed locked below his throat he could feel the other mans anger giving way to fear saw the sudden anguish as he jerked the hilt free and struck him hard across the mouth with it as he fell away gasping for breath bolitho turned and thrust the man gave one shriek lifting an arm as the blade drove under his shoulder and deeper still allday dashed to his side and gasped well done captain he rolled the man away with his foot then he snarled and another by god the seaman had jumped from the shrouds to take them by surprise from above to escape the unexpected attack bolitho did not know all he heard was alldays quick breathing the swish of his blade as he slashed the man down and then finished him with one more terrible blow two boats comin sir bolitho ran to the bulwark and then ducked as a ball slammed hard into the rail by his fingers he yelled train that swivel on them someone scuttled past him firing a pistol as he fled from alldays cutlass bolitho spun round sobbing as the pain lanced into his thigh but when he felt his leg and the jagged tear in his breeches there was no blood no agonising splinter of broken bone the man who had fired had inadvertently run too close to the yelling slaves chains swung like serpents and he vanished beneath a struggling heap of screaming shining bodies allday threw his arm around bolithos waist where are you hit captain his anxiety was clear even amidst the din of shouting and screaming bolitho pushed him aside gasping between his teeth hit my watch damn his eyes allday grinned and ducked after him i think his time has stopped too bolitho only glanced at the thing which had rolled away from the panting slaves they had literally torn him to pieces he dragged allday clear stray too close and you will follow him ungrateful dogs bolitho reached the abandoned swivel and swung it towards the nearest long boat probably think we are a different lot of slavers he jerked the lanyard feeling the hot breath from the muzzle as the canister exploded across the crowded boat screams and curses bodies splashing in the water and others still firing from the sternsheets he twisted round trying to see where soames had reached on the shore but it was impossible to be certain shots stabbed and whimpered over the inlet and once he thought he heard steel on steel then he turned and looked inboard how many he caught keens wrist as he lurched past a dirk gleaming in one hand an empty pistol held like a club in the other keen stared at him dazedly we seem to have lost five of our people sir but the slavers have either been killed or have jumped overboard bolitho strained his ears for the sounds of more oars the one thing which would tell him soames was coming to his aid there was a loud thud from aft and he guessed that another boat was grappling in readiness for boarding he peered at his little party five dead one obviously wounded it was not enough allday shouted hoarsely we can manhandle one of the guns to the hold and put a ball through her bottom if we can hold em on the poop while bolitho shook his head pointing at the slaves they are held by more than one chain they would go down with the ship he could feel the fight dying in his surviving men like fire under heavy rain most of them were staring aft each unwilling to be the first to challenge this new attack they did not have long to wait the poop doors burst open and a group of men charged along the littered deck their voices yelling wildly in what seemed like a dozen different languages bolitho balanced himself on the balls of his feet the sword angled across his body cut the cable well let her drift ashore in the shallows a ball shrieked above his head and he turned to see one of his men sprawled headlong blood gushing from his throat he had been struck by a marksman somewhere in the shrouds allday yelled stand fast you bastards but it was useless the remaining seamen were clambering forward again dropping their weapons in their frantic haste to get away only keen remained between him and the beakhead his arms at his sides his young body swaying with exhaustion allday said come on captain its no use he fired a pistol into the advancing shadows and grunted with satisfaction as a man screamed in agony the next seconds were too blurred to understand one moment bolitho was astride the bowsprit and the next he was swimming towards the black wall of trees he could not remember diving or regaining the surface although his lungs were raw from shouting from keeping alive feathers of spray spurted nearby and he heard feet stampeding along the brigantines deck as more men climbed from boats or swam out from the shore shots whimpered above his head and there was one short cry as a seaman was hit and disappeared beneath the surface keep together it was all he could do to speak and the foultasting water was slopping again and again into his mouth he saw a white figure splashing down the beach and when he groped for his sword he stumbled headlong his feet stubbing against sand and stone beneath him but it was soames his chest heaving from exertion his hair wild as he pulled bolitho to dry land bolitho gasped at the air they had failed they had lost several good men for nothing allday was hauling keen from the water and two more figures lay on the sand like corpses only their fierce breathing telling otherwise there were no others a gun banged out from the brigantine but the ball went wide splintering through the trees to a chorus of shrieks from birds and slaves alike soames said harshly i could only capture one boat sir the slaver had a large party ashore he sounded angry despairing when they fired at that damn spaniard my lads started to attack it was too soon im sorry sir not your fault bolitho walked heavily along the waters edge searching for one more swimmer how many did you lose soames replied indifferently seven or eight he gestured to several dark shapes along the beach but we took a dozen of the others he added with sudden fury we could have taken that damn ship i know we could yes bolitho gave up his search muster our people and lead me to the boat we must pick up mr fowlar and his party while its dark the slaver will be ready for us by dawn im thinking it was not much of a boat and leaked badly from a couple of stray musket balls one by one the weary seamen clambered into it hardly looking at each other or even caring where they were if they were called on to fight now they would fail completely bolitho watched them anxiously vaguely he recalled herricks words all those weeks back different in peacetime perhaps they were the wounded men were sobbing quietly and he pushed keen towards them see to them he saw the youth draw back knew that he too was close to breaking he reached out and squeezed his shoulder hold on mr keen to soames he said quietly mr fowlars party can take the oars theyll be in better shape he turned as a new sound intruded from the trees like one huge beast stamping its feet while a combined chorus of yells echoed and reechoed around the inlet allday muttered what in the name of god is that the slaves at the camp soames was standing beside bolitho as the boat edged away from the land they know something we dont bolitho swayed as the overloaded craft rocked dangerously in the current the slaves must realise that despite the brigantines presence and the power of her guns they would not now be taken as captives to the other side of the world not this time anyway he thought of the native craft herrick had sighted they might be here already he snapped easy there i can see mr fowlar the masters mate peered into the boat with obvious dismay ill never get my party in too sir soames jerked his thumb towards the trees you will if you wish to stay alive allday took the tiller and checked each man as he climbed into the boat somehow they all got in barely leaving the oarsmen room to pull and with the hull so low in the water there was hardly six inches of freeboard shove off he winced as a gun banged out the long orange flame of fire darting from the vessels side like a vicious tongue the ball hissed astern of the boat and pounded into the sand bolitho called easy now watch the stroke lads too many splashes and the gunners would have an aiming mark keen whispered one of them has just died sir he added hoarsely hodges heave him over the side watch the trim lads keep her steady poor hodges he would not walk in the marshes again never feel the north sea on his face or see the ducks in flight he shook himself angrily what was the matter with him the corpse drifted clear and another man shifted along the thwart soames observed theyve ceased firing probably licking their wounds like us most likely bolitho felt the bitterness rising again the slaver had lost several men but had still enough captives to make his visit profitable whether he retrieved the rest from the camp or not whereas he tried not to face the fact that they had failed his men had fallen back probably because they had lost whatever faith they had held in him nervions attacker was as much a mystery as before a slavers crew was usually made up from the sweepings of many ports and many tongues perhaps davy had been right after all and he should never have attempted to capture the brigantine his head was aching to match the bruise on his thigh he was barely able to think any more fowlar said mr mudge has explained it to me sir the ship will have to stand well out tomorrow because of the shoals hereabouts the slavers master doubtless knows a better passage but he left the rest unsaid very well bolitho saw an overhanging clump of trees reaching out across the water like a partly demolished bridge we will make fast here rest the men and share out the last of our water and rations nobody replied and some of them appeared to be sleeping where they sat or crouched like so many bundles he tried not to think about the brigantine but for his action she would be in ignorance of undines presence it was obvious they had not seen her nor had they understood who had attacked and tried to capture their ship after all it was not unknown for one slaver to prey upon another for extra profit but now because of his persistence her master would recognise undine as soon as he stood out to sea undine would be unable to venture too close inshore and a long chase would prove just as fruitless so if he had been involved in delaying puigservers mission he would now know that undine at least was on her way he clenched his fingers around his sword until the pain steadied him but for rojart they would have succeeded how many battles had been lost by a single stupid oversight poor rojart the ship which had destroyed his nervion was the last thing he had seen on earth then she had murdered him just as brutally the bowman called i can see a beach to larboard capnl looks safe enough allday glanced at bolithos shoulders feeling his despair as if it were his own bolitho said take her there allday he pushed his other thoughts aside with something like physical force we will work in three watches two hours at a time he tried again post sentries and keep a good lookout the bowman leapt over the stem and waded into the shallows a line across his ragged shoulder like a halter the boat nudged on to hard sand tilting drunkenly to the current and the sudden shift of men as they staggered ashore bolitho listened to soames as he picked out his sentries for the first watch had he been in charge of the boarding party would he have hesitated he doubted it soames would have done what he saw ass his duty helpless slaves or not and put a ball through the brigantines bottom or touched off her magazine in this climate she would have been gutted in minutes leaving the slavers isolated and easy to capture at leisure because he had not been able to destroy the slaves bolitho had gained nothing and he had lost nearly a third of his original party as well allday slumped down beside him and handed him a water flask ive secured the boat captain he yawned hugely i just hope we dont have to pull too far in it thats all then he said dont you fret things arent that bad when bolitho remained silent he added weve seen an done much worse in our time i know some of our people took to their heels instead of rallying when they were most needed but times are different or seem so to many of em bolitho looked at him dully but could not see his expression how so allday shrugged they dont see the sense in getting killed for a few slaves or a ship they know nothing about in the old phalarope it was different ysee a flag to follow an enemy you could recognise bolitho laid back against a tree and closed his eyes hearing the jungle coming alive for the night squeaks and roars groans and rustlings he said you mean that they do not care allday grinned if it was a proper war captain a real one like the last wed soon make em into fighters so unless they are threatened personally they will not fight for those less fortunate bolitho opened his eyes and studied the stars overhead before this voyage is done i fear that some of them may come to understand otherwise but allday had fallen asleep his cutlass across his chest like a dead knight bolitho stood up quietly and walked to the boat to see how the wounded man had settled down for the night he saw the stars reflected on the sluggish water and was surprised to discover he was feeling less despairing he looked back at the trees but alldays shape was lost in darkness by accident or design he did not know but it had often happened with allday he seemed to hit upon the very thing which was troubling him in his simple open manner not dispel it completely but stand back from it and keep it in its proper perspective when he reached the boat he found the seaman sleeping heavily his rough bandage very white against the planking keen looked up startled sorry i did not see you sir bolitho replied rest easy mr keen we are snug here for the night as he walked away fowlar who had been washing his face and hands in the water moved to the boat and said admiringly what a man eh never a one to weep an wail when things go hard keen nodded i know i hope im like him one day fowlar laughed the sound bringing more cries from the forest bless you mr keen im sure hed be flattered to know that keen turned back to watch the wounded seaman under his breath he said fervently well i do and thats an end to it in the pale glow of morning both sea and sky were joined by a filtered milky haze as the overcrowded longboat moved ponderously away from the trees and tiny beaches which lined both sides of the inlet bolitho watched for some sign of life or movement which might betray an ambush a few birds floated overhead and far beyond the last jutting spit of land he saw open water colourless in the strange light he turned his attention to the men in the boat their brief rest seemed to have had little effect they looked tired and anxious their clothes filthy with dirt and dried blood faces dark with stubble there was little to associate them with a kings ship soames was standing upright beside allday peering ahead watching the men who baled away the seeping water keeping an eye on the remaining wounded sailor his eyes were never still keen was right forward squatting on the stemhead his bare legs and feet dangling in the water while he watched the nearest bank his body sagging as if from a great weight the hull lifted and dipped as the first inshore swell rolled into the inlet some of the men croaked with alarm but most merely stared listlessly in front of them beyond caring bolitho said we will turn to larboard when we get into open water it will make our meeting with undines boats all the quicker soames glanced at him could be hours before they come itll be like a damned oven today im thinking bolitho groped for his watch and winced as his fingers touchqd the bruise when he lifted the watch from his pocket he stared at it for several seconds seeing where the ball had lanced from it smashing both shield and mechanism to fragments but saving him from injury but for it he would probably be dying now or at best a prisoner aboard the brigantine soames said quietly made short work of that sir bolitho nodded he could remember exactly when his mother had given it to him he had just been commissioned lieutenant the watch had meant a lot to him partly because it reminded him of her of her gentleness and forbearance over losing her family to the sea the boat tilted and several voices shouted in protest and he saw keen struggling back into the hull his face shocked as he yelled ahead sir larboard bow bolitho stood up one hand on alldays shoulder as he stared at the two low shapes which were emerging around the last spit of land they were moving quite fast the long paddles plunging and rising in perfect unison as they headed purposefully into the inlet fowlar said harshly war canoes i seen plenty on em in my time therell be more close by if im not mistaken he dragged out his pistol and fumbled with a powder horn soames slitted his eyes to watch the two low canoes his face like a mask gods teeth there must be thirty men in each of em one of the seamen shouted wildly it aint fair we got no reason to fear em lads we aint no slavers silence that man fowlar cocked the pistol and rested it on his forearm to them were all the bloody same so hold your noise p bolitho said speed the stroke they may let us pass allday kept his eyes on the oars if you say so captain another man called astern sir i can see the brigantines topsls bolitho turned carefully to avoid unsettling the oarsmen the man had not been mistaken far astern and moving at a snails pace above some low trees was a limp square of sail the slaver must have taken stock of his position and got under way before dawn the lifeless canvas told bolitho that the ship was being warped downstream with the aid of her boats but once in open water she would be free and away he glanced again at the advancing canoes whereas he and his men would stay here and die if they were lucky soames asked what can we do sir we cant outpace those canoes and theyll not let us get near enough to grapple he was fidgeting with his swordhilt showing anxiety for the first time bolitho called check the powder and shot there would not be much left what with the confused battle ashore and his own boarding party leaving their weapons behind he could hope for very little fowlar reported bare enough for one shot per man sir very well send the two best marksmen aft give them all the powder you have to soames he added softly we might hold them off until our own boats come for us the canoes had stopped their paddles glinting as they backed at the water holding the slim hulls motionless like a pair of pike bolitho wished he had a telescope but that too lay somewhere in the jungle he could see the natives clearly enough their skins very black their bodies angled to the paddles in readiness to move at a seconds notice in the stern of each hull was a tall man wearing a bright headdress his body hidden by an oval shield he thought of the slaves in the clearing the girl who had been killed on the brigantines deck these silent watchers would show no mercy for anyone he saw the spears glinting in the growing sunlight only blood would satisfy them nearer and nearer until less than half a cable separated them from the poised canoes bolitho looked at the two muskets in the sternsheets fowlar had one and a scarfaced seaman held the other between them the pile of powder and shot seemed even smaller now bear to starboard aliday he was surprised how unemotional he sounded they will have to move soon as the longboat swung heavily towards the centre of the opening both canoes came alive the paddles darting into the water at a great pace the air suddenly filled with the beat of a drum and the animal cry of a single warrior in the prow of the leading craft bolitho felt the boat thrusting ahead beneath his feet saw the sweat on the oarsmens faces the eyes which turned to watch the oncoming canoes widening with fear he shouted take care keep the stroke eyes in the boat something hit the water alongside and threw spray over his leg it must have been a heavy stone for immediately a whole volley of them rained down on the heads and backs of the struggling seamen knocking some of them unconscious the stroke was failing and one oar had drifted away as still more jagged stones plunged amongst them bolitho said open fire fowlar squeezed his trigger and cursed as the ball went astray the other musket banged out and one of the natives screamed and pitched from his canoe soames yelled keep baling he fired his pistol abeam and swore with satisfaction as another black figure plunged into the water both canoes were swinging round in a wide arc to follow astern one on either quarter they were cut off now from each side of the inlet and ahead the sea was opening up to greet them mocking them with its emptiness fowlar fired again and had better luck bringing down a plumed figure who was apparently beating out the time for the paddles the seamen were all so busy at the oars or peering fearfully astern that hardly any of them saw the real threat until it was almost too late bolitho yelled get forrard mr fowlar fire when you can he stared fixedly at the canoes which had suddenly swept around the green hump of land spreading out like a fan as they surged towards him a dozen at least all filled with whooping screaming savages the first shot made them falter but only for minutes then they came on again the canoes cutting through the inshore swell like swordblades some of the seamen were whimpering and pulling haphazardly at their oars others tried to stand up while a few began to gather fallen stones to defend themselves fowlar yelled that is my last ball sir he cursed as a heavy stone hurled at extreme range by a sling glanced off the gunwale and cut open the back of his hand the leading canoe was drawing very near the din of chanting and the drum almost deafening bolitho drew his sword and shouted ready lads he looked at his cowering men close quarters but it was not to be instead another volley of stones clattered over the boat striking one seaman so badly that he fell overboard the man with the musket fired and brought down two savages with one shot the canoe swung away some of the paddles being dropped so that the floundering seaman could be hauled up into their midst bolitho watched sickened as they dragged the man to his feet pinioning his arms and holding him so that he faced the slowmoving longboat he could see the blood on his neck where the stone had hit him imagine his screams which were drowned by the yelling figures who held him one with a high headdress waved a knife above his head back and forth back and forth so that the captured seamen followed it with his eyes as if watching a snake his mouth like a black hole as he continued to scream the knife came down very slowly the blood shining in the sunlight and making several of the seamen retch and groan with horror allday said tightly jesus christ theyre skinning him alive bolitho seized the marksmans shoulder feeling him jump as if he was dying with the man in the canoe do what you can he had to force the words out when he looked astern again he saw that the man was still alive writhing like a soul in hell as the knife did its work the musket bucked against the sailors shoulder and bolitho turned away fighting back the nausea soames said thickly the only way sir id not let a dog suffer like that fowlar shouted brigantines away sir the slaver had slipped into deeper water almost without anyone noticing her boats hoisted inboard and already her foresail set and drawing well as she rode clear of the protecting land the canoes were forming into two arrowheads again the drums getting wilder as they manoeuvred for the final attack bolitho held his sword towards the hazy horizon pull lads well not go under without a fight it was an empty speech but it was better than merely standing and watching them overwhelmed tortured and killed without lifting a finger allday whispered here they come he held the tiller between his legs and drew his cutlass keep close captain well show the bastards bolitho looked at him they were outnumbered ten to one and his men were already fit to drop the fight gone out of them he said simply we will allday he touched his thick forearm and thank you a great yell made him turn and as the boat swayed dangerously to the sudden shift of bodies he saw the crisp topsails and jib the figurehead shining in the milky glare like pure gold as undine tacked around the headland her starboard battery run out in a line of black teeth soames bellowed sit down youll have us in the sea otherwise allday said hoarsely now there is a sight captain fowlar called shes going about sir in gods name shes acomin through the shoals bolitho could barely breathe as he watched undines graceful outline shortening her sails in momentary disarray until the yards had been trimmed again if she struck now she would share nervions fate and worse when the survivors were taken by the war canoes but she showed no hesitation and he could see the bloodred coats of the marines along the quarterdeck nettings and even imagined he could discern herrick and mudge beside the wheel as the frigate heeled heavily to the wind her gunports almost awash keen was yelling huhza huhza lads he was cheering and weeping waving his shirt above his head the closeness of danger forgotten the brigantine had already changed tack clawing clear of a dark smudge below the surface while she set more sail to carry her to the south fowlar said with disbelief shes goin after the slaver they must be mad bolithodid not speak just watching his ship was enough it told him what herrick was thinking and doing as if he had shouted it aloud herrick knew he could not engage all the canoes in time to save bolitho and his small party he was going to stop the brigantine and so distract the war canoes in the only way he knew as the realisation came to him undine opened fire it was a slow carefullyaimed broadside the guns belching smoke and flame at regulated intervals while the frigate swept further and further amongst the hidden shoals someone gave a cracked cheer as the brigantines foretopmast shuddered and then curtsied down into the sea alongside in a tangle of rigging and canvas the effect was immediate and within seconds she was paying off to the wind her hull broadside on as another volley crashed and ricocheted all around her one twelvepound ball struck the sea near her quarter and shattered into fragments so near was the shoal to the surface shes struck everyone was yelling and screaming like a madman hugging each other and sobbing with disbelief bolitho dragged his gaze from the brigantine which had slewed round either on a shoal or a sandspit her canvas in pandemonium while she continued to drive ashore he held his breath as undine shortened sail the tiny figures on her yards like ants her copper glinting brightly as she thrust round again on the opposite tack another half a cable and she would have been aground allday shouted shes hoveto captain an theres a boat being dropped bolitho nodded unable to answer the canoes were paddling furiously towards the helpless brigantine and more canoes had appeared around the headland the latter very careful to stay clear of undines bared guns the frigates big launch was speeding across the choppy water and when one of the canoes turned towards it the crash of its swivel gun was enough to make the yelling natives join their companions elsewhere davy stood in the sternsheets very erect and proper even his oarsmen seemed totally unreal against the tattered cheering remnants of bolithos landing party the captured longboat was already sinking more planks having been stove open by stones and bolitho doubted if they could have lasted another halfhour even without the attacking canoes as the launch grappled alongside and hands dragged the gasping survivors to safety he turned to watch the listing brigantine even at this distance it was possible to hear the muskets the baying chorus from the canoes as they surrounded her for the final attack revenge or justice the slavers end would be terrible indeed davy took his wrist and helped him into the other boat good to see you again sir he looked at soames and grinned and you of course bolitho sat down and felt his limbs beginning to quiver uncontrollably he kept his eyes on the ship as she grew and towered above him very conscious of his own feelings for her and those who had risked their lives for him herrick was waiting to greet him his anxiety matched only by his relief as he took bolithos hands and said thank god youre safe bolitho fought for time looking at the loosely flapping sails the watching marines the gun crews who had paused in their swabbing to look at him and grin herrick had taken a terrible chance it had been sheer lunacy and he could tell from mudges expression beaming and nodding by the compass that his was an equal share but there was something new here which had been lacking before he tried to name it herrick was saying we heard the shooting sir and guessed you might be in trouble instead of sending boats we came in strength so to speak he let his glance move along the busy figures at the guns and waiting by the braces they did well they were glad to be here bolitho nodded understanding pride that was it to find it had cost them dear and it could have gone much worse he said get the ship under way if you please let us stand away from this damnable coast he paused searching for the words and thomas if you ever doubt your ability to command again i will remind you of today you handled her to perfection herrick looked at mudge and almost winked we have a good captain sir and are beginning to feel the benefit of his drills and exercises bolitho turned aft suddenly spent i shall not forget then he walked to the cabin hatch with allday at his heels mudge ambled to herricks side a near thing mr errick if you adnt given the order i dont know if id ave ad the will to persist through them shoals herrick looked at him remembering bolithos expression the guard no longer hiding his thoughts well mr mudge i reckon it was well worth it he stared at the misty shore line and at a growing plume of smoke the brigantine must have caught fire he thought for a while longer he held on to the picture of the battered listing boat with bolitho upright in the sternsheets that old tarnished sword in his hand if he had not disobeyed bolithos order to put the ships safety before all else he would indeed be in command now and bolitho back there dying in agony get the hands to the braces he walked to the rail with his speaking trumpet and god bless lady luck below the cabin hatch bolitho heard herrick laugh and then the clatter of blocks as the seamen went to their stations for getting under way again allday asked quietly can i fetch you some wine captain or something a mite more powerful bolitho leaned against the mizzen mast trunk and felt it vibrating urgently to the pressure of wind and canvas high overhead dyou know allday i think that after all the trouble we went through to get it i would like a glass of fresh water madras bolitho stood very still by the quarterdeck rail and watched the vast spread of land which reached away on either bow in the morning sunlight the countless white buildings seemed to rise tier upon tier the uneven skyline decorated at irregular intervals by tall minarets and plump golden domes it was breathtaking and he could tell from the quiet way the seamen were moving around the decks that they were equally impressed he turned and looked at herrick very tanned and strangely unreachable in his best uniform we did it bolitho raised his telescope and watched some highprowed dhows scudding abeam their gaunt sails like wings even they were part of the magic mudge said ease off a point then he too fell silent as the wheel squeaked over perhaps he was satisfied and so he should be bolitho thought madras the name itself was like one great milestone for what they had achieved together three months and two days after weighing anchor at spithead back there bolitho had seen disbelief on mudges heavy face when he had suggested they might make the voyage in one hundred days herrick said quietly aye sir since we quit the african coast lady luck came with us for certain he grinned broadly you and your lady luck but he smiled all the same it had seemed much as herrick had described within a few days of leaving the land the dead and dying far astern the wind had risen from the southwest the fringe of the monsoon which on this occasion had acted as a friend day after day with all sail set undine had bounded along freely recklessly her forecastle never clear of bursting spray while dolphins and other strange fish had stayed close in company it was just as if that terrible confrontation with the war canoes seeing the seaman being flayed alive and all else had been one last great challenge he glanced up at the gently flapping topsails and forward to the solitary jib the power barely enough now to carry them into the wide anchorage and between that impressive spread of shipping madras the most important british station on the southeast coast of another continent a steppingstone to advancement elsewhere to trade and further discovery even the names were like fresh challenges siam and malacca southeast to java and beyond to a million unknown islands he saw a towering merchantman spreading more sail as she tacked heavily into a pale bank of seahaze with her chequered gunports and impeccable sail drill she could have been a manofwar but she was one of the east india companys ships and three months back bolitho would have given his right arm for just a few of her seamen well trained and disciplined they were far superior to the navys companies in many respects the company could and did afford better pay and conditions for its people while the navy still had to depend on what it could get by other means and in time of war that usually meant relying on the pressgangs bolitho had often considered the unfairness of the system one day perhaps in his own life he hoped to see the change come when the navy could offer the same fair inducements the big indiamans flag dipped from her peak and bolitho heard keen calling to his signalling party to return the salute then he looked again at his own company knowing he would not willingly change them now merely because it would make life easier browned by the sun toughened by hard work and regular drills with sails and weapons they were a far cry from that motley assortment at spithead he glanced towards the indiaman and smiled perfect or not she had had to dip her flag to a kings ship his undine mudge blewhis nose and called bout five minutes now sir bolitho raised his hand and saw the masters mate with the anchor party acknowledge it was fowlar a man who had proved his worth and his loyalty who had already earned promotion whenever an opportunity came captain bellairs was inspecting his marine drummers and looking even more like a toy soldier in the blazing sunlight davy and soames were on the gun deck with their separate divisions and the ship had never looked better he heard voices behind him and turned to see don puigserver and raymond speaking together by the taffrail like him they were probably eager to discover what awaited them here in madras puigserver was surprisingly elegant his clothing consisted of a lieutenants dresscoat which had been taken apart and refashioned by mrs raymonds maid aided willingly by jonas tait undines sailmaker tait had one eye but was very skilful even if he was the most villainous looking man aboard the maid seemed to find him fascinating well captain you must be pleased with yourself today mrs raymond stepped from the cabin hatch and crossed to his side she walked easily so used had she become to undines motions and behaviour in every sort of sea she too had altered still aloof for much of the time yet lacking the old veil of disinterest in shipboard life which had first irritated bolitho her large stock of personal delicacies which had come aboard at santa cruz had long been consumed and yet she had taken to the cabins simple fare with little complaint i am maam he pointed towards the bows you will soon be able to shed the smells and sounds of a small frigate i have no doubt that an english lady reigns like a queen out here perhaps she turned her head as if to watch her husband i hope to see you when you come ashore here after all you are king she laughed lightly in many ways i am sorry to leave the ship bolitho watched her thoughtfully he remembered when he had arrived aboard after the running battle with the canoes spent almost asleep on his feet as weariness replaced the will to fight and memory pushed aside his immediate relief at his own survival she had guided him to a chair rapping out orders to her maid to a startled noddall and even to allday as she had taken charge she had told someone to fetch the surgeon but when bolitho had said harsly im not hurt the ball hit my damned watch she had thrown back her head and laughed the unexpected reaction had angered him then as she had gripped his hand quite unable to stop her laughter he had found himself joining in perhaps that more than anything else had steadied him had released all the anxiety he had been forced to conceal until that moment some of it must have shown on his face as he remembered for she said softly can i share them my thoughts he smiled awkwardly i was thinking of something my watch he saw her lip begin to tremble again and wondered why he had not noticed the fine shape of her chin and throat until now when it was too late he felt himself flushing for what she nodded it was cruel to laugh so but you lookedso angry when anyone but you would have been grateful she turned her face away as herrick called ready sirv carry on mr herrick aye sir but his eyes were on the woman then he hurried to the rail yelling man the lee braces hands wear ship undine swung easily into the wind her anchor splashing down into water so blue it looked like satin puigserver pointed at a small procession of boats which were already moving towards the ship and said a time for ceremony capitan poor rojart would have enjoyed this part he was a different man now steely eyed impatient to move again to get his plans into order behind him raymond was watching the oncoming boats with a look of apprehension rather than excitement on his face with the anchor down and all sails neatly furled undines decks were bustling with life as her company prepared to take on stores visitors or whatever they were ordered to do above all to be ready to sail again within hours should it be required bolitho knew he would be needed for a dozen things at once even now he could see the purser hovering to catch his eye and mudge waiting to suggest or ask something he said perhaps i will see you on land mrs raymond the others were listening and he could feel their glances their interest it has not been an easy passage for you and i would wish to thank you for your er he faltered seeing her lip quiver very slightly forbearance equally gravely she replied and may i thank you in turn captain for your companionship bolitho made to bow to her but she held up her hand and said until the next time captain he took her hand and touched the back of it with his lips he felt her fingers give his just the merest squeeze and when he glanced at her face he knew it was no accident then it was all over as he was caught up in the turmoil of receiving visitors from the governor and handing his despatches to the officer of the guardboat as a brightlycanopied launch pulled clear of undines black shadow he saw his passengers looking astern towards him growing smaller with each sweep of the oars herrick said cheerfully i expect youll be glad to have the cabin to yourself sir youve waited long enough yes thomas indeed i will now sir concerning extra hands herrick had seen the lie in bolithos grey eyes and decided it was prudent to change the subject immediately it was late afternoon when bolitho received a summons to report in person to the governor he had begun to think that his part of the mission had been cancelled or that in madras his status had shrunk so much he would merely stay at arms length and do as he was bid whenever it might suit the proper authority accompanied by herrick and midshipman keen he was carried ashore in undines gig despite a haughty equerrys insistence that a local boat would be more fitting and comfortable an open carriage was waiting to convey them to the governors residence and for the whole of the short journey they barely exchanged a word the bright colours the surrounding press of chattering people the whole strangeness of the town took their complete attention bolitho found the people very interesting indeed how different their skins were ranging from pale brown no darker than young keens tan to those who were as black as the warriors he had seen in africa turbans and flowing robes cattle and dejected goats all milled across the winding streets in and around the curtained shops and bazaars in an unending panorama of noise and movement the governors residence was more like a fort than a house with slits in the walls for weapons and well guarded by indian troops the latter were most impressive turbaned and bearded yet they wore the familiar red coat of british infantry set off with baggy blue pantaloons and high white gaiters herrick gestured to the flag which drooped barely moving from a high staff and murmured that at least is familiar once through the gates and into the cool shadows of the house it was another world again the noise of the streets was sealed off as if by a great door and all around was an air of watchful elegance fine rugs and heavy brass ornaments barearmed servants who moved noiselessly like ghosts and tiled passageways which led away in every direction as in a maze the equerry said smoothly the governor will see you at once captain he eyed the others without enthusiasm alone bolitho looked at herrick mr keen will remain here in case i need to pass a message to the ship you can make good use of your time as you will he turned to hide his face from the equerry dont forget to keep an eye open for extra hands herrick grinned relieved perhaps at being spared yet another set of questions and answers the visitors to the ship had kept him on his feet since the anchor had been let go the sight of an english frigate seemed to attract far more interest than the comings and goings of merchantmen a link with home some word or hint of what these people had left behind in their search for empire he said good luck sir this is a far cry from rochester the equerry watched him leave and then glanced at keen to bolitho he said ill send the young gentleman to the troops quarters if you wish bolitho smiled i am sure he will be happier here keen met the mans stare calmly and replied indeed i will sir he could not resist adding my father will be glad to learn of your hospitality when next i write bolitho turned away his father owns quite a large portion of your trading agency here the equerry said no more but led the way down the grandest of the passages he opened some double doors and an pounced with as much dignity as he still retained captain richard bolitho of his britannic majestys ship undine bolitho already knew the governors name but little else about him sir montagu strang was almost hidden behind a great desk the sides of which appeared to be made of ebony with feet fashioned of massive silver claws he was a frail greyhaired man with a pallid complexion which told its own story of some past fever hooded eyes a thin unsmiling mouth he was studying bolithos approach along a strip of blue carpet as a hunter might examine a possible victim welcome bolitho the thin mouth turned upwards a fraction as if it hurt him to make the effort it was then and only then bolitho realised that strangs attitude was not one of disdain for as he moved around the desk he saw that the governor had been standing to receive him and not in a chair as he had first thought thank you sir bolitho tried not to show surprise or worse pity down to his waist sir montagu was a normal if slight figure beyond that his legs were tiny those of a dwarf and his neat hands hung seemingly to his knees strang continued in the same crisp tone please select a chair i have a few things to say before we join the others he let his gaze move over him before adding i have read your report and those of certain onlookers you did well and have made a fast passage your action in trying to save nervions people your attack on the slaveship if only partly successful are the two better pieces of news today bolitho sat down on the edge of a thronelike chair and then realised for the first time that the great overhead fan was being worked by a tiny indian who was squatting in a far corner apparently asleep his bare foot jerking a cord to keep it in regular motion strang returned to his desk and sat down bolitho guessed he always behaved in this manner with a new visitor to get it over with and avoid embarrassment he had heard that strang had spent many years in india as a representative of government as an adviser on trade and native affairs a very important man no wonder he had chosen power out here rather than suffer the constant humiliation of gaping eyes in london he said calmly now bolitho to business i have been waiting too long for despatches wondering if my original suggestions have been accepted nervions loss was a serious blow but your apparent determination to continue with the voyage without further advice cancels it out in some ways you have don puigservers admiration it seems although whether that is good or bad remains to be seen his hooded eyes flashed angrily the spaniards lost great opportunities in teluk pendang as a race they are stealers rather than builders the sword and the crucifix are about the most they can offer bolitho gripped his hands together and tried not to let his mind drift on strangs words so the mission was still in being undine would be going to teluk pendang strang said sharply i can see that you are ahead of me bolitho allow me to fill in a few small chinks eh then he smiled but it is refreshing to find one still able to think at all beyond the cool room bolitho heard the distant call of a bugle it sounded strangely sad strang saw his expression and said we were hard put during the war hyder ali the ruler of mysore and one with a real hatred for us had plenty of support from the french but for the navy i fear the fleur de lys and not the union flag would fly above here today he continued in an almost matteroffact tone but that is not your concern the sooner we can install a british governor in pendang bay the better i will be pleased since the end of the war the spanish garrison there which comprised mainly of native soldiers has been in a state of confusion fever and some sort of mutiny made their work impossible i am hardly surprised that the king of spain is so willing to rid himself of the station his voice hardened however under our protection it will prosper the local native ruler is harmless enough he must be to allow the spanish garrison to be alive but further to the west is a vast area almost uncharted and plundered by another less charitable prince muljadi if we are to extend our gains he must be contained is that understood i think so sir bolitho frowned yours is a great responsibility quite the wind always shakes the top of the tree bolitho i am not certain what i will be required to do sir i would have thought a fresh garrison of soldiers would be a better force than mine i know otherwise his voice was scathing as he added native troops for the most part with british officers whose minds have become numbed by heat and other er local attractions i must have mobility your ship in fact the french as you are now aware are very interested they have a frigate somewhere in those waters and that too you know which is why i cannot afford open conflict if we are to succeed we must be in the right and if this muljadi opposes us or those showing friendship sir strang walked to a wall tapestry and touched it lightly you will crush him he swung round with surprising agility in the kings name he picked up a small bell and shook it impatiently i am arranging a transport for the troops and all the stores required the east india company will provide a suitable vessel in due course the rest will be up to you under the new governors hand that is rear admiral beves conway has made many of the arrangements he darted a quick glance at him you know him then why yes sir bolithos mind grappled with a dozen memories at once he commanded the gorgon seventyfour my second ship he smiled despite strangs set features i was sixteen it will be an interesting reunion no doubt strang glared at the open door where a servant stood watching him anxiously take the captain to the chamber and next time i ring this bell i want you here at once as bolitho made to leave strang added you saw a company ship leaving harbour as you entered today yes sir homeward bound a rich cargo for england he smiled gently no i am not full of regrets or pining for the homeland which in any case is scotland i merely wished you to know that the vessels crew had a long nights celebration too much to drink a way sailors have he turned his back some twenty of her hands were too drunk to return on board they are in the care of my officers they have enough to do without the trouble of drunken oafs who had they been in a naval vessel would no doubt have been flogged for desertion i do not wish to know about it further but should your lieutenants care to take over the responsibility i am certain you could make better use of some extra men bolitho smiled thank you sir i will join you shortly now go and take wine with my staff bolitho found keen in the entrance hall and passed the news to him without delay the midshipmans eyes widened and he said ill tell mr davy at once sir though i doubt if john company will thank you for taking hands from an indiaman he chuckled nor will they sir bolitho hurried along the passage where he had seen the servant waiting for him his mind returning to strangs other news beves conway then the captain of a twodecker had always been something of a hero to him cold and remote in many ways but a superb seaman and not one given to undue harshness even with his midshipmen he had left the gorgon before bolitho having held the command for several years after that he had disappeared completely which was unusual in the navy faces like ships came and went repeatedly like the sea and wind which governed their lives with conway in control of things there would be little tolerance for failure he thought he was ushered into the vaulted room described as the chamber and was surprised to find it filled with a variety of people including a number of women he saw puigserver still dressed in his makeshift clothes and raymond in close conversation with a heavyjowled major raymond left his companion immediately and with barely a nod of recognition guided bolitho around the chamber making introductions hardly able to hide his impatience if someone asked about england or what the latest fashion was at home home was somewhat vague but for the most part seemed to be london raymond paused while bolitho took a glass of wine from a bowing servant like a lot of damned farmers he smiled at a lady as she passed but added savagely but they live well enough here bolitho watched him curiously raymond had tried to show his contempt but had sounded only envious then he heard a familiar voice and when he turned observed mrs raymond talking with someone he had not so far met she saw him immediately and called come and join us her smile faded slightly as she noticed her husband we have been talking about local customs raymond said abruptly rear admiral conway the new governor of teluk pendang conway had been standing with his back to bolitho he was dressed in a dull bottlegreen coat his shoulders sloping badly so that he seemed to be leaning forward he turned to face bolitho his eyes moving rapidly noting all that they saw bolitho said it is good to see you again sir he did not know how to continue if he had met conway in plymouth or anywhere else he would have walked past him could anyone change so much in twelve years he looked thin and very intense with two deep lines running from his hooked nose to his jaw so that the mouth appeared to be suspended between them only the eyes were familiar cool calculating conway held out his hand richard bolitho eh the handshake like his tone was dry and a postcaptain no less well well bolitho tried to relax it was like seeing someone looking through a mask a rear admiral but seniority apart he was only one rank higher than himself and no title no proud knighthood to mark his climb to success he said quietly i have been very fortunate sir mrs raymond touched conways sleeve with her fan he is too modest by far i have had good opportunity to watch the captain at his duties and listen to his past exploits conways glance darted between them did he relate them well maam i heard them from others her eyes regarded him coldly to drag selfpraise from the captain is to try and open an oyster with a feather conway picked a thread from his waistcoat i am relieved to hear it raymond said it seems i am to accompany you to the new station sir he did not hide his haste to distract conways attention from his wifes sudden anger that is so conway looked at bolitho the captain will tell you i am not one to tolerate mistakes i require everyone connected with the handover of governorship within reach he glanced at the chattering people around him not here living in spoiled unreality behind his shoulder mrs raymond looked at bolitho and pouted conway said i must go and speak to the military he bobbed his head if you will excuse me maam raymond waited just a few seconds then exploded do you have to make a scene viola in gods name conway could be important to me to us she looked at bolitho he is a pompous she sought for a word bore to her husband she added and it makes me sick the way you grovel to his kind you always seem to throw yourself after the failures raymond stared at her he is the new governor what are you suggesting she flashed a smile to someone across the room you do not know anything he is a failure you have only to look at him strangely enough raymond appeared relieved is that all i thought you had heard something he stared after conway i had better go to him sir montagu strang has instructed me to give all my experience to aid him she held her fan across her lips and whispered that should take very little time she slipped one hand through bolithos arm and now captain you can escort me if you will bolitho was still thinking of that rapid exchange between them most of all of conway and what he had become she squeezed his arm i am waiting an honour he smiled at her impatience and thank you for your defence just now he shook his head although i cannot imagine what has happened to conway her fingers dug into his arm one day some stupid officer will say that about you she tossed her head anyway it was true the pompous old bore bolitho saw the heavyjowled major watching him and then turning to murmur to a fellow soldier there will be talk maam if we walk about like this good she looked at him calmly do you care well no she nodded and my name is viola please use it in future true to his word sir montagu strang lost no time in putting his longstanding plan into operation two days after undines arrival at madras the bedford a heavy transport wearing the flag of the east india company dropped anchor nearby and began to take in stores and equipment for the new station after his first visit to the governors residence bolitho had had no time for relaxation so little was known of teluk pendang except by those who had been engaged with local trade there that it was some while before he was satisfied with his calculations mudge who knew the waters well gave his cautious approval and when bolitho had paid a visit to the bedfords captain he had been quick to praise not merely his work but also his readiness to consult an officer of the company not like a kings officer he had been greatly amused most of em would rather drive aground than enquire from the likes of us bolitho wondered what his attitude might have been had he known about the twenty extra seamen he had poached from the allpowerful eic before he had left the transport he had caught his first sight of the troops who were being sent to replace the spanish garrison they looked as if they intended to make their new station a permanent home for they were accompanied by as many wives and children varied livestock and a great mass of pots and pans which made him wonder where they could all be stowed bedfords captain was unimpressed so he guessed it was the normal way of doing things out here he was in his cabin writing his readiness report when herrick arrived to announce that a launch was approaching its only passenger was rear admiral beves conway bolitho hurried on deck half wondering why conway had stayed away from him since undines arrival and partly concerned at the lack of notice to his surprise he saw that conway was still dressed in his green coat devoid of decorations or sword he was not even wearing his hat as he stepped through the entry port and bowed curtly to bellairs guard of honour and to the quarterdeck at large taut ship bolitho the eyes flitted this way and that and bolitho tried to dispel his sudden resentment at conways attitude perhaps he had always been like this even in the gorgon when bolitho had watched his regular appearances on the quarterdeck or poop with something like awe dismiss the side party this is an informal visit conway walked to a sixpounder and ran his hand across the breech then he looked aloft where some hands were blacking down the rigging making it shine like ebony he nodded she looks well enough he turned his attention to the bedford at the booms which swayed back and forth above the boats and lighters moored around her bolitho was able to watch him less cautiously and saw the thinness of his hair which was completely grey without turning conway asked what is your estimated time of arrival at our destination given fair winds sir and in accordance with all i have discovered i hope to make a landfall in eighteen days three weeks at the most i have already been told that i am to sail ahead of the transport my idea conway turned and looked at him searchingly no sense in dragging our feet with that damned hulk then you will be coming in undine sir disappointed conway shrugged of course i shall i have made arrangements for my baggage to be sent out this afternoon bolithos picture of his cabin faded he had thought of it often since arriving at madras somewhere he could examine his mistakes and assemble his advantages puigserver was one thing conway another entirely it would be like being conways junior officer again he said i will inform my first lieutenant at once sir herrick he sounded indifferent no need bolitho stared at him that was not like conway he tried again at least we shall have a rear admirals flag at the mizzen when we reach teluk pendang sir the effect was startling conway spun round his features working with sudden anger was that slur intended does it give you some twisted pleasure to sneer if so i will damn soon break you for your insolence bolitho kept his voice calm aware of herrick watching nearby with obvious concern i am sorry sir i meant no disrespect conway took a deep breath no flag bolitho i am the governorelect of pendang bay a place neither you nor most of the world has ever heard of until now the bitterness had put a new edge to his voice to all intents i am out of naval service what respect i receive at your hands will be arranged accordingly bolitho stared at him it was suddenly all too clear conway had been putting off this moment not out of haughtiness or from any sort of envy at bolithos steady promotion since their first meeting but because he was a broken man then it will be done well sir that i can promise you he looked away i have been fortunate in the navy in many cases i have been aided by sheer chance or luck as my first lieutenant would say but i have never forgotten where i first gained the value of experience and the patience of my own captain conway fumbled with his waistcoat apparently oblivious to the sun across his neck and shoulders that was kindly said he looked at his hands and then thrust them behind his back may we go below in the cabin he moved about restlessly touching the furniture peering into corners without saying anything then he looked at one of the wooden quakers and snapped this was done for that woman eh yes sir but i will see that they remain until you are settled in your new command he had meant to say residence but the word just slipped out conway watched him his thin face expressionless then he said no have the guns replaced i need no bloody pampering i want this ship ready for anything a few missing guns might make a world of difference he did not explain but asked in the same abrasive tone that woman mrs raymond how did she stand up to three months in a fifthrate eh better than i had expected hmm he studied bolitho grimly his features in shadow watch yourself with her she is three years older than you but the gap in experience is immeasurably wider bolitho said hastily might i ask when sailing orders will arrive sir tomorrow probably but i can tell you now you will weigh the day after you receive your orders no delays maximum haste we will have company on the passage sir bolitho was certain that conways thoughts were elsewhere even though his ideas came out in perfect order brig don puigserver has chartered her for his own use partly my suggestion it is too close to the war for me to take a don as a friend i see sir you dont but no matter he walked to the stern windows and stared at the shoreline at the countless tiny craft which jostled the waterfront like busy insects i would like to stay aboard bolitho until we weigh sir bolitho looked around the cabin tiny compared with the residence ashore yes he swung away from the windows dyou object just for a second it was there again the same voice which bolitho still remembered no sir he smiled i have been waiting to broach some wine i have brought from london i london conway sighed that cursed place ive not set foot there for five years a plague on it and its selfishness perhaps it has changed since people do not change bolitho he touched his breast not here inside you of all people should know that when i learned who commanded my transport i knew you would be as you are not so merryeyed and trusting perhaps but youve not altered bolitho stayed silent watching the emotions on the other mans face each one perhaps representing a memory gorgon seems an eternity back in time the best moments were with her although i did not realise it was so ybolitho said carefully your new post will probably make ou believe otherwise sir you think that conway smiled but no humour touched his eyes it is given to me because i will succeed i must there is nothing else left when you make a slip bolitho you sometimes get one final chance to redeem yourself he pounded one hand against the other and i intend to succeed there was a tap at the door and allday stepped into the cabin who is this fellow my coxswain sir bolitho had to smile at the incredulous look on alldays face i see allday said mr herricks respects and could you come on deck to receive bedfords captain bolitho excused himself to conway and followed him from the cabin allday muttered fellow captain he was a trifle hard i thought bolitho grinned i am sure that when he knows you better he will call you by your first name allday faced him guardedly and then chuckled no doubt captain he lowered his voice a message has been sent aboard he held out an engraved card tiny in his broad palm she had written across the back eight oclock please come bolitho stared from it to alldays masklike face who gave you this a servant captain his eyes did not even flicker the lady knows she can trust me bolitho turned away to hide his expression thank you allday watched him hurry up the quarterdeck ladder and grinned it will do him good he saw the marine sentry watching him and snapped who are you gaping at he grinned again my good fellow gift from a lady one hour before the morning watch was relieved bolitho came on deck to enjoy the most peaceful time of the day with his shirt open to his waist he crossed to the weather side and studied the set of each individual sail before going aft to consult the compass madras lay twelve days astern but the wind which had begun so promisingly had lulled to a gentle breeze so that even with all sails set it was unlikely they could maintain more than four knots fowlar was scribbling on the slate beside the wheel but straightened his back as bolitho approached he touched his forehead and reported east by south sir full an bye bolitho nodded and shaded his eyes to watch the sails again the wind such as it was came from the southwest and undines yards were braced well round laying her over to the starboard tack about a mile abeam the brig rosalind had no difficulty in maintaining station on her heavier consort and bolitho found himself tempted to take a telescope and examine her more closely fowlar seemed to think that he was expected to add something to his report and said might pick up before nightfall sir mr mudge seems to think the windll freshen when once we enter the malacca strait er yes bolitho tried to compose himself fromrosalinds deck undine must make a beautiful sight under full canvas but for once this gave him little consolation he wanted to drive his ship faster to become involved with his mission ghosting along like this even if idyllic for poet or artist gave too much time for other thoughts he saw davy hurrying towards him frowning as he said i beg pardon for not seeing you come on deck sir he gestured towards the main mast i was dealing with a complaint from a marine he added swiftly nothing important you are officer of the watch mr davy you should know by now i dont interfere in your affairs merely to excite attention he smiled a fine day is it not yes sir davy followed his gaze over the nettings the sea was very blue and apart from the lowhulled brig there was not a speck of land or another ship to break the emptiness its sense of vastness davy asked casually is it true this sort of mission often leads to permanent appointments in the realm of colonial government sir bolitho nodded rear admiral conways appointment is such he watched davys tanned features gravely he was worried about something it was showing now just like the time when he had selected soames and not him for the raiding party i was thinkingdavy faltered i am of course well content with life as a kings officer it is what i want i am the first in my family to follow the sea my father was a city merchant and had no use for service life he was loath to allow me to enter the navy bolitho wished he would get on with it he said encouragingly mr herrick is like you the first sailor in his family yes davy looked suddenly desperate as soames emerged from the cabin hatch yawning and consulting his pocket watch well it is not exactly what i meant sir bolitho turned and faced him mr davy i would be obliged if you would come to the point in an hour it will be anoven again i would like to take my walk before breakfast and not wait until after dinner tonight davy bit his lip i am sorry sir he nodded firmly yes i will try to explain he lowered his eyes may i speak of your brother sir bolitho tensed my late brother i did not mean to offend davy looked up and allowed the words to come out in a flood i heard somewhere that he quit the navy bolitho waited always it seemed to catch up with him now even his second lieutenant was risking a rebuke to satisfy his own curiosity but he was wrong in davys case davy said quietly it was because of his gambling i was told he looked so strained so pleading that bolitho forgot his own bitterness and asked is that what bothers you gambling yes sir like a fool i tried to win back my losses in london with my father dead i am responsible for my mothers welfare and that of the estate he looked away in time of war i might have gained early promotion and all the prizemoney which went with it you could have just as easily been killed bolitho added gently am i to be told how much you owe twenty sir bolitho stared at him in gods name you could pawn your dresscoat for more man i davy gritted his teeth twenty thousand sir bolitho ran his fingers through his hair undine and the brig yonder would cost about that sum and i thought you had more sense perhaps i should have kept my secret sir davy was shamefaced wretched no it is better shared at least you are safe from your creditors out here he watched davy grimly but twenty thousand it is a small fortune soames clumped past and beckoned to a bosuns mate have the watch piped aft kellock he was careful to keep to the lee side of the deck davy hurried on well aware that soames was waiting to relieve him you see sir i thought that on a voyage such as ours i might gain some new standing i see however this is a mission of protection not of discovery or the capture of spanish gold he nodded to soames and added softly but i will keep it in mind he began to pace the deck while the two lieutenants conversed over the compass undine had gathered all sorts within her slender hull it was not only the lower deck which sported its fortunehunters it seemed he saw midshipman keen walking along the larboard gangway with armitage and prayed he would never be left in davys predicament or in one such as his brother hughs in family background davy and keen were similar both had wealthy parents who had gained promotion in trade rather than in the kings service davys father had died leaving his son and heir totally unprepared for the temptations which he had managed to overcome keen on the other hand had been sent to sea because of his fathers riches and influence hertick had said that keen had confided in him during a night watch in the indian ocean to make a man of me it had seemed to amuse him herrick had said but keens father must be a remarkable man bolitho thought there were not many who would risk a sons life or limb for such a goal he saw noddall scurrying aft along the gun deck with a can of boiling water from the galley conway must be up and about waiting to be shaved it was surprising how little conways presence aboard had interfered with daily life he had explained it himself informal that did not mean he was disinterested quite the reverse whenever a ship had been sighted or the hands had been called to reef or make sail he had been there watching once when becalmed for half a day the seamen had streamed a seine net in the hopes of getting some fresh fish just a few flounders and some flatheaded fish which mudge had knowingly described as foxes were the entire result of their efforts but conway could not have been more pleased if they had caught a whale it was as if he was living out every hour like a prisoner awaiting sentence it was not pleasant to watch bolitho was not quite twentyeight years old but as a postcaptain with two previous commands behind him he had learned to accept if not agree with many of the navys judgements conways experience had come out at dinner one evening in the cabin it was the second day out of madras and bolitho had told noddall to fetch some of his special wine to make it an occasion it was madeira the most expensive he had ever purchased in his life conway hardly seemed to notice had he been offered cider bolitho doubted if he would have remarked on it but he had become very drunk not slowly or by accident or even out of bravado but with the firm determination of one who has been too often alone and wishes to blur the realisation without delay it had all happened two years back in these same waters when the french admiral suffren had captured trincomalee and very nearly toppled britains power in india for good conway had started to tell his story as if bolitho had not been there as if he just wanted to make sure he could still remember it he had been in command of an inshore squadron and employed on the protection of supply ships and military convoys a sloop had brought news of a french squadron off the coast of ceylon and without ado he had set off to engage or cripple the enemy ships until help arrived to complete the victory unbeknown to conway another sloop was already searching for him sent by the commanderinchief with new orders for the defence of trincomalee conway reached the area where the french had been sighted only to find them gone fishermen informed him they had sailed towards the very position he had just left and with an anxiety which bolitho could only imagine he had put his ships about once again he managed to find and bring the french rear to a brief but unsatisfactory action before losing contact in the night when dawn united his small squadron again conway found the supply ships which he had been guarding had been captured or destroyed and when the admirals sloop contacted him she too had fresh news to cancel all previous instructions trincomalee had been taken in the silence of the cabin conways voice had risen suddenly like a dying mans cry another day and ive have brought them to grips not suffren nor any other admiral could have got us out of ceylon then bolitho looked up as the first working parties swarmed aloft for the constant round of repairs splicing and stitching it was all too plain conway could have emerged a hero instead he was seized upon as a scapegoat he must still have influence somewhere he thought a governorship no matter where it was represented reward rather than a continuance of disgrace he halted in his stride his mind suddenly very alert but suppose there was a second more devious reason another scapegoat perhaps he shook his head what would be the point of that bolitho turned as allday walked along the quarterdeck towards him breakfasts ready captain he squinted his eyes towards the brig still with us then he smiled calmly at bolithos steady gaze thats good bolitho watched him and wondered it was the same look he had given when he had brought the gig for him at madras thank you he added coldly and what is amusing you now allday shrugged hard to put a name to it captain its a sort of glow i get inside sometimes he massaged his stomach comforting bolitho strode past him towards the hatch his morning had been badly interrupted as he stepped into the cool shadows between decks he imagined viola raymond just a mile abeam in the brig her husband would be watching her mister pigsliver would be watching both of them it was still hard to know what she really thought about him or if she saw his attraction as some sort of game there had been several visitors staying at the residence soldiers company officials but she had been determined to keep him to herself it had not been anything she had actually said it had been more of an excitement a sense of recklessness a dare which he found impossible to ignore she had no longer stayed at arms length and several times had allowed her hand to linger on his even when raymond had had been close by when he had made to return to the ship she had followed him on to a shaded terrace below the inner wall and had held out a small box for you she had made light of it but he had seen the hot eagerness in her eyes the thrust of her breasts beneath her gown as he had opened the box it was a gold watch while he had turned it over in his hands she had gripped his arm and had whispered i will always remember your face that daybut she had not laughed that time do not refuse my little gift please he had taken her hand and kissed it his mind grappling with what he was doing seeing all the dangers and yet dismissing them it is as well you are sailing in another ship captain she had laughed and then had pulled his hand below her breast see how my heart beats now a week a day even and who can say what might occur bolitho walked past the sentry and into the cabin his mind still hanging on to that moment conway was spreading thick treacle on a biscuit his wispy hair ruffling in the breeze from the stern windows what time is it bolitho time sir conway eyed him wryly before taking a mouthful i observed that you had your er new watch in your hand and assumed that time was of some importance bolitho stared at him the midshipman in front of his captain again then he grinned it was a memory sir that was all conway sniffed that i can well believep it makes a fine sight thomas bolitho lowered the telescope and wiped his forehead with the back of one hand the noon sun was merciless but like most of the men around him or standing high in the shrouds he was momentarily unaware of it fifteen days out of madras and in spite of the winds perversity undine had done well bolitho had made many landfalls in his time but the sight of any shore after the hazards and doubts of navigation never failed to move him and now just visible through the glare of sea and sky he could see a smudge of green across the larboard side and felt a fresh excitement and satisfaction the narrowest part of the malacca strait to starboard hidden even to the masthead lookout was the great scimitarshaped island of sumatra poised as if to squeeze the strait shut and leave them sailing in a wilderness forever herrick said it seems a mite too narrow for comfort sir bolitho smiled at him it is wider than the english channel even here thomas the master assures me it is the safest course to take perhaps herrick shaded his eyes again so that is malacca eh it is hard to believe we have reached this far and in five days or so with gods good grace well anchor in pendang bay he paused seeing the doubt in herricks blue eyes well come on thomas let us see that smile againv yes sir i know it is a good and fast passage and i am well satisfied as you are he fidgeted with his belt buckle but i am more concerned with something else i see bolitho waited knowing what was coming he had seen the worry mounting in herricks face over the past fifteen days having to spend much of his time with the admiral bolitho had had little chance of enjoying herricks company a walk together before dusk a pipe of tobacco and a glass of wine herrick said bluntly everyone knows about it sir its not my place to speak on your behaviour but but that is exactly what you are about to do bolitho smiled gravely it is all right thomas i am not going to snap your head off herrick would not relent it is no joke sir the lady is the wife of an important government official if this sort of tale ever reached england you would be in real danger and thats the truth thank you for your concern he glanced ahead where far beyond the gently spiralling bowsprit he saw rosalind leading the way through the shallows and sandspits as she had no doubt done many times before but it is something i do not wish to discuss even with you if you are to disagree with everything i say yes sir im sorry but herrick added stubbornly i cant stand by and see you in irons because of others sir not without trying at least to help bolitho gripped his arm then we will say no more of the matter thomas agreed aye sir herrick regarded him unhappily if it is the way you want it a seaman left the galley and darted down an open hatch below the forecastle he was carrying a bucket and swab herrick said wearily the surgeon is sick again that man must be going to clean out his quarters bolitho looked at him drunk i suppose it would seem so but there is little to occupy him sir and our people have been remarkably free of illness that is just as well bolitho felt unreasonably angry what in hells name am i to do with him he has a lot on his mind sir so have many others herrick kept his voice even he saw his young brother hanged for a crime of which he was later proved innocent even if he had been guilty it would still have been a terrible thing to watch bolitho swung round from the rail how did you discover this at madras he came aboard drunk i was a mite harsh with him and he started to rave about it it is destroying him thank you for telling me even if it is somewhat late herrick did not flinch you have been rather buoi sir i did not wish to trouble you bolitho sighed i take your point but in future i would like to hear everything most ships surgeons are no more than butchers whitmarsh has been something more but as a drunken sot he is a menace to everyone aboard i am sorry for his brother i for one can appreciate his feelings he looked steadily at herrick we will have to see what we can do to put things right for him whether he likes it or not herrick nodded gravely i agree sir the one afflicted is not always the best judge of his own malady he tried not to grin if you see what i mean sir bolitho slapped his shoulder by god thomas you go too far i am not surprised your father sentyou to sea then he walked up the tilting deck to the weather side and left herrick to supervise his watch so they knew all about it did they he touched the bulge in his breeches pocket what would herrick say if he saw the inscription inside the watchguard he wondered we will wear ship directly mr herrick bolitho strode to the compass and peered over mudges untidy shoulder steer nornoreast herrick touched his hat aye aye sir he was equally formal it was five days since they had discussed viola raymond and the doctors personal problem and in that time bolitho had never felt better the ship had settled down to a regular unhurried routine and even the drills had passed off without complaint at gunnery undines company still had a lot to learn but at least they moved as a team and not a stumbling confused rabble he raised his glass and studied the new shapes and patterns which parted sea from sky mudge had assured him that pendang bay lay some five miles distant but it was difficult to accept that they had all but arrived at their destination over fifteen thousand miles another world a different life hands wear ship man the braces there shoes scraped on the planking and bolitho turned to study conways reaction as he came on deck it was early morning and for a few seconds he thought he was imagining what he saw conway was wearing his rear admirals uniform complete with laced cocked hat and sword the latter he held like a pointer as if unsure of his reception bolitho said good morning sir he saw herrick staring at them his speaking trumpet in midair conway joined him by the rail and raised his head to watch as the great yards creaked round in unison while the straining seamen hauled and panted at the braces well his tone was wary what do you think i think you look right for the occasion sir he saw the quick tightening of conways mouth the lines on either side deepening still further it was moving if pathetic to see conways gratitude for that is what it was it is a bit creased of course i was merely trying it on to see if it required alteration he added sharply if i am to be governor ill land as i intend to continue damn their eyes midshipman armitage was watching the brig as she trimmed her yards to take station off undines lee he remarked nervously thunderstorm sir but bolitho was already snatching a telescope not this time mr armitage he looked at herrick shorten sail if you please and then beat to quarters he saw them all gaping at him like total strangers that thunderstorm is of a kind i have come to respect another flag ship cleared for action sir herrick watched bolithos face anxiously bolitho moved the telescope slowly from bow to bow trying to avoid the overlapping mesh of shrouds and stays as he stared fixedly at the shore because of the glare which filtered through then morning haze it was impossible to fix any proper mark or to take an accuratebearing he replied too long mr herrick i want the time cut to twelve minutes he was speaking merely to give himself another moment to gather his thoughts the distant gunfire had stopped but there had been at least a dozen shots sharp and loud despite the range probably small pieces he swung the glass further to starboard seeing the lowlying wedge of land reaching out to lie parallel with their slow approach the eastern headland of pendang bay there was no room for further doubt something dark intruded into the lens and he saw the brig tilting to the low breeze her yards alive with tiny figures as she finished reefing a huge spanish flag had been hoisted to her peak blinding white in the glare and he found time to wonder how rosalinds master was reacting to puigservers show of national pride almost without intending to speak aloud he said i wish the don was here with us i think combined thought and action may be called for he heard conway grunt unnecessary ours is the ship of war bolitho i want no damned spaniard under my feet today herrick asked quietly what dyou make of it sir bolitho shook his head an attack on the settlement maybe but i understand the place is well defended and conway interrupted harshly all this fuss over a few bloody savages herrick was standing beside mudge and whispered i expect that is what poor captain cook said bolitho turned sharply if youve all nothing better to do than make stupid remarks he swung away and added two good leadsmen in the chains immediately begin sounding to mudge he snapped let her fall off a point the edge in his tone was having the right effect men who seconds earlier had been chatting and gossiping about what might be happening ashore were now silent and alert standing to their guns or grouped at halliards and braces for the next command the wheel creaked the sound very loud in the sudden stillness and the helmsman called noreast by north sir very well bolitho glanced at conways profile the glassy intentness in his eye from forward came the leadsmans cry no bottom sir bolitho looked at mudge but the masters heavy face was expressionless he probably thought it was a waste of time to take soundings the chart and all available information told them the water was deep until the last cable or so or maybe he thought his captain was so nervous that he was afraid to leave anything to chance another single crack echoed out from the mistshrouded coast and died away very gradually bolitho tugged out his new watch and stared at it at this speed it would take near on an hour to close the land but it could not be helped no bottom sir he said pass the word for captain bellairs ill want a full landing party tell mr davy to prepare the boats for lowering once we have anchored he will take charge of them conway said briefly good beach im told the settlement and fort are on a slope to the western side of the bay herrick strode aft and touched his hat shall i order the guns to load sir he sounded guarded not yet mr herrick bolitho trained his glass across the larboard bow settlement fort they could have been imagination the blurred green outline of the land looked totally deserted he heard the marine sergeant bellowing orders the stamp of boots as his men were divided and subdivided in readiness to disembark bellairs was watching them from the starboard gangway his face completely blank but his eyes missing nothing by the mark twenty the leadsman sounded triumphant mudge nodded gloomily about right twenty fathoms hereabouts some small birds darted across the seas face and circled above the braced yards bolitho watched them recalling the swifts flying about the grey stone house in falmouth it would be fine there today sunshine bright colours the hills dotted with sheep and cattle the town itself busy with farmers and sailors each depending on the other as it had always been he saw herrick nearby and said quietly forgive my anger ust now herrick smiled no matter sir you were right we have been caught unawares already on this venture trouble will not fade away merely because we turn our backs on it rosalinds settin er foresl again sir they turned to watch as the brig dipped to the wind and gathered way conway snarled by god the don intends to lead us inshore blast himv it is his right sir bolitho trained his glass on the other vessel seeing the busy figures above and below the great slash of her ensign with its crowned shield bright in the sunlight it is still the territory of the spanish royal company until he says otherwise conway scowled that is mere formality he stared hard at him fire a warning shot captain bolitho looked at herrick pass the word forrard one ball but mind it drops well clear of the brig the leadsman called again deep eighteen bolitho shut his ears to the squeak of gun trucks as the fore most twelvepounder was run out the gun captain was peering along the muzzle and as the light touched him bolitho saw that one hand was a metal hook turpin herrick shouted ready sir as you will then the gun crashed out and seconds later a thin waterspout rose like a feather far beyond the brigs bowsprit bolitho said well atleasttheywill knowwe are coming sir conway snapped savages ill soon get to the bottom of this little matter bolitho sighed as the brig fell off slightly her foresail already being brailed up in response to his rough signal the thought of having a poorly armed brig lying between an enemy and his own artillery was a worry he could not afford and she was aboard rosalind too he turned round sharply angry with himself for allowing his thoughts to drift right now he neededto be completely clear his mind like steel mr mudge dyou know much of this place other than you have already told me the master shrugged very few people ave seen inland sir ead unters warrin tribes there are aplenty im told but the natives are often sailors pirates from the north of borneo seadyaks they calls em many a good ship as been overrun at anchor by them devils he shook his jowls then its snip snip with their long knives an poor jack is no more at that moment a seaman beside a sixpounder pointed aloft as the masthead pendant licked out with renewed energy like a long low curtain the sea mist began to move and shred itself vanishing into the land and laying bare endless stretches of beach thick jungle and finally the overlapping hills beyond herrick lowered his telescope and exclaimed and is that the settlement sir bolitho steadied his own glass not daring to look at conways face what he had first taken to be a heap of lopped and piled trees was shaping itself into long spiked palisades supported and guarded at regular intervals by squat timbered blockhouses as the mist slipped away he saw what must be the governors residence it had to be for it was the largest building in sight again it was built entirely of timber with an upper and lower rampart and one spindly watchtower in its centre above which the spanish flag lifted occasionally in the sea breeze conway said thickly in gods name the words wererung from his throat bolitho watched the distant fort for some sign of life other than the flag the place looked crude but was well sited easy to defend there must be settlements like this all over the world he thought but what about before someone had first to wade ashore from a boat or march through swamp and jungle to plant a flag to claim the land for his own country he had heard of islands in the pacific which were regularly claimed and reclaimed by half a dozen nations sometimes out of the genuine desire to colonise but often merely because their ships paused there for no other reason than to find water and firewood by the mark ten he looked at herrick we will anchor in eight fathoms he saw allday scrambling over the gig on its chocks then boats away as fast as you can he turned his attention to the cruising wavelets which had risen to enjoy the freshening breeze it was a large but wellsheltered bay it was said that the spanish royal company had claimed it years earlier almost by accident they had intended to place their settlement further north to gain access for trade with the philippines but fever losses in ships and resources had found them here instead it was easy to understand why the spaniards had lost heart easier still to realise how much more important it would be to the british within reach of both india and the vast barelytapped resources of the china seas it could be a vital link given time and skilful handling with the french and spaniards gone from the area only the power of the dutch east indiamen offered any sort of competition he glanced quickly at conways stiff features but was he the one to begin it he wondered fighting men rarely saw much further than the strategy and tactics of the moment and one made bitter and desperate by past mistakes would be less inclined to compromise people leaving the palisade sir bolitho raised the glass again twos and threes some carrying muskets others limping down the sand towards the waters edge and a long partlyconstructed pier of rough timber and piles most of them were so darkskinned they could be natives but the uniforms were spanish well enough not one of them waved they merely stood or sat dejectedly watching the frigates careful approach herrick said under his breath god they look like scarecrows what did you expect mr herrick sir unseen and unheard the surgeon had appeared on the quarterdeck his face and neck like raw meat bolitho watched him impassively you are recovered it seems mr whitmarsh the surgeon turned his gaze on him his eyes were redrimmed with strain so that they looked too hot for their sockets he muttered vaguely we have arrived i see sir he reached out for support and finding none almost fell headlong he mumbled pattern never changes first they hand over their power of protection to us with ships and men if needed to give power to that protection when all is safe the traders will come and the companys flag will be supreme bolitho asked coldly and then what whitmarsh regarded him emptily the place will become a colony a possession or if we have cleaned it out like an empty shell we will simply he retched discard it cast it away conway seemed to hear him for the first time get off this deck you drinksodden creature his face was working with despair a need to release his anger or by heaven you will be sorry the surgeon gave an awkward bow but i am sorry believe me sorry for you sir at being given this wretched task he swayed towards bolitho for the good captain who will eventually be made to stand between justice and tyranny and more sorry perhaps he pitched forward in an untidy heap and lay completely still by the mark eight the leadsmans call brought bolitho back to reality he snapped have him taken to his quarters as some seamen seized the inert surgeon and carried him to the ladder he caught the sour odour of vomit and spilled wine the stench of a mans decay conway was still staring at the deck another second and id have had him in irons he glared at bolitho well there was something in what he said sir what is on a sober mans mind is often on a drunkards tongue herrick called close enough i think sir bolitho hurried to the quarterdeck rail glad to be free of conways mood he studied the lie of the smaller headland to larboard the great eastern one on the opposite beam thrusting out to sea and already a delicate green in the early sunlight signal our intention to rosalind and then wear ship if you please he waited until the anchor party had assembled above the cathead then he added tell davy to keep our people together once we are ashore i want no plague raging through undine dyou think there is fever here sir for just a moment there was fear in herricks eyes like most seamen he could accept blood and broadside as well as the harsh discipline which guided his daily life but the unknown the terror of plague which could render a whole ship useless turn her into a floating tomb was entirely different that we will discover directly rosalinds acknowledged sir keen seemed his usual carefree self even armitage was watching the land with something like expectancy wear shipv man the lee braces bolitho saw the helm going over and moved to conwayss side to avoid the rush of seamen across the quarterdeck as the frigate turned slowly into the wind will you wait for don puigserver sir conway looked at him a nerve jumping in his throat as the anchor plunged into the clear water in a mighty cascade of spray i suppose so he peered towards the brig which was already swinging easily to her cable i wish you to accompany me an honour sir you think so conway removed the goldlaced hat and ran his palm over his grey hair he smiled bitterly we shall see noddall came on deck with bolithos sword but quailed as aliday rasped here give me that he hurried to bolithos side and carefully buckled the scabbard into place muttering the very idea then he straightened his back and stared at the boats which were being swayed up and over the nettings a long way weve come together captain he turned to watch the brigs boats being lowered into the water its not a happy place im thinking bolitho did not hear him he watched the marines clambering out and down into the swaying boats their coats very red their boots slipping and clattering as they always did captain bellairs was studying each and every one of them especially the young corporal who carried the sheathed union flag which would soon be planted on foreign soil like many sea officers bolitho had often thought about such moments but the mental picture had always been grander and vaster endless lines of men bands playing cheering people and the anchored ships looking splendid and secure at the seas edge now he understood differently it was only a beginning small but no less impressive because of that conway said well we had best begin i see the don is already on his way the brigs boats were indeed moving inshore one bearing the spanish flag the others that of the company bolitho was thankful viola raymond was remaining aboard the rosalind conway followed him into the gig and with the armed and crowded boats fanning out on either beam they started towards the nearest beach bolitho could smell the jungle long before they were within hail of the people by the frothing surf like incense heady and overpowering he gripped his swordhilt tighter and tried to compose himself it was a moment he must always try to remember he glanced quickly at conway for some sign or reaction he looked remote and sadly stern the new governor of teluk pendang had arrived lieutenant thomas herrick walked a few paces across the quarterdeck his movements restless as he watched bellairs marines and some seamen below the nearest palisade it was ast noon with the sun blazing down on the anchored ships with savage intensity most of the unemployed hands were sheltering by the guns beneath the gangways but herrick felt unable to leave the deck even though his head was swimming his shirt plastered against his body like a wet rag tugging at her cable the undine had swung her stern towards the long pale beach and with the visibility sharp and clear it was easier to see the extent of conways new command larger than he had first imagined it had obviously been planned and constructed by a military engineer even the unfinished timber pier looked neat and strong but like the rest of the place was in a state of bad neglect as he had paced the quarterdeck or peered across the taffrail herrick had seen bolitho and some of the landing party moving along the wooden ramparts or exploring the ground between the two separate palisades which guarded the approaches to the fort and its surrounding buildings the boats lay like dead fish on the beach exactly where they had ground ashore some four hours earlier he had watched some marines hauling the swivel guns towards the fort others harried by the massive sergeant coaker had manned the ramparts or could now be seen patrolling near the pier the handful of spanish soldiers had withdrawn into the fort and of the enemy or whatever the garrison had been firing at there was not a sign he turned as a heavy step fell on the tinderdry planking and saw soames shading his eyes with one hand and munching a biscuit with the other any sign yet sir soames eyed the distant settlement without enthusiasm what a place to end your years eh herrick was worried something should have happened by now there were supposed to be some three hundred spanish soldiers and followers in the settlement and god alone knew how many local natives from what he had seen there were hardly any the same old thought crossed his mind plague perhaps or something even more terrible he replied they appear to be examining the inner defences i am not surprised the dons wish to be rid of it he shuddered from here it looks as if the damned jungle is pushing the whole lot back into the sea soames shrugged and pointed his halfeaten biscuit at the gun deck shall i dismiss the gun crews there seems to be little here to excite action no there are only five of them manned change em round and send the others below for a spell he was glad when soames walked away he needed to concentrate to decide what to do if he was suddenly required to act without bolitho at his elbow it had been different the last time a sort of wild recklessness had come over him prompted as ever by the need to dash to bolithos aid in the only way he knew but here were no yelling savages no darting canoes which a few bursts of canister could scatter silence and depressing immobility midshipman penn called in his shrill voice one of the boats is being launched sir herrick felt his heart lift as the distant figure thrust undines greenpainted gig into the shallows he saw bolithos tall figure striding down the beach pausing to say something to davy before swinging his legs over the gunwale at last soon they would know what was happening only four hours but to herrick it felt an age muster the side party stand by to receive the captain bolitho looked strained and thoughtful as he climbed up through the entry port his coat covered with sandy dust his face damp with sweat he glanced at the motionless side party but did not seem to see them he said have the surgeon and his mates sent ashore to report to mr davy when the other boats arrive i want powder and shot food and fresh fruit sent over too he peered towards the anchored brig and at another boat which was pulling quickly towards her i have sent word for rosalind to assist in every way she can he looked at herricks round face and smiled for the first time easy thomas it is not the end though it was nearly so come to my cabin when you have dealt with my orders allday has a list of things required when herrick finally joined bolitho in the stern cabin he found him stripped to the waist and drinking a large tankard of lemon juice sit down thomas herrick sat aware that although bolitho sounded controlled and level there was something else something familiar which told him his mind was busy along another tack when the war ended there was a garrison of about three hundred here it was as if he was drawing a picture just as it had been painted for him the commandant the king ofspains trusted controller was colonel don jose pastor a dedicated soldier to all accounts and one well used to building such settlements he gained some trust from the natives and by barter and other inducements as well as the usual spanish use of force he was able to create a strong defence line as well as clear much of the surrounding land there is even a road of sorts although that now is overgrown a wilderness herrick ventured fever that of course but no more than you might expect in such a place he studied herrick for several seconds his eyes very grey in the reflected light the settlement has been under almost constant attack for over a year at first they thought it was only the work of marauding tribesmen dyak pirates maybe who were becoming worried by the spread of spanish influence in their midst colonel pastor had set up a catholic mission above the settlement the monks were found terribly mutilated and headless he did not see herricks expression of horror then others died when the freshwater pools were poisoned the garrison had to fall back upon its own little stream within the walls but for it the fight would have ended long ago think of it thomas if you had been an officer here trying to hold up morale fighting an unseen enemy while day by day your strength is dwindling each dawn you would be watching the horizon praying for a ship any vessel which could bring relief only one came in the whole of that time but would not land its people for fear of the plague she merely dropped despatches and left god knows i can understand that they are like living skeletons over yonder he looked round as a boat pulled clear of the hull let us hope our surgeon will find others to help and think less of himself herrick asked quietly what will admiral conway do sir bolitho closed his eyes remembering the small gathering in the room at the top of the wooden fort hearing puigservers emotional voice as he had translated the report of the settlements one remaining officer captain vega the attacks had gone on and on and when once an armed picket had been ambushed the forts defenders had nearly been driven mad by the screams and pitiful cries as their comrades had been tortured to death within sight of the walls bolitho said to the west of us is a small cluster of islands the benua group herrick nodded unable to understand yes we passed them a day back they lie astride the strait between borneo and the islands of sumatra and java his tone hardened this selfstyled prince muljadi has his stronghold there the dutch built a fortress in one of the isles many years ago but abandoned it when disease killed most of the garrison he looked through the stern windows his eyes grave not like conways new domain thomas it is built of stone herrick attempted to shift bolitho from his mood of passive despair but a few ships and men would soon destroy this damned muljadi surely once perhaps bolitho drained the glass and stared at it this morning there was a final attempt to overthrow the defences here i expect the attacker saw undine pass through the strait yesterday and knew they must make haste now they are gone into the jungle captain vega of the garrison says they will head west to the marsh district where they will be taken by sea to muljadis stronghold he gave a great sigh of all the men at the settlement there are but fifty survivors poisoned darts musket balls for they have our weapons too and fever have wrought a terrible price from them there was even a mutiny when vegas men fought with their own native soldiers most of them too crazed with drink and despair to know what they were about herrick stared at him what of colonel pastor sir is he also killed bolitho sat down and massaged the white scar above his ribs i am coming to that part weeks back a ship did finally arrive not to bring help or to offer relief to people from their own part of the world she was the argus thomas he swung round the weariness falling away like a cloak of fortyfour guns under the hand of capitaine le chaumareys he landed himself and met with colonel don pastor he brought a message from muljadi personally he gripped the desk with both hands and required him to lower the flag to relinquish all claims on the settlement in the name of spain my god indeed apparently the colonel told of help which would soon arrive but le chaumareys laughed at him said there would be no relief no ships coming to his aid then the french do have a hand in this sir a big one his face lit up cannot you see it thomas le chaumareys was instructed to force the spanish to surrender their rights here he knew better than most that nervion or undine or both would be delayed by any means available with the settlement handed over to muljadi and a written agreement from pastor who after all is his kings representative here there would be nothing we or anyone else could do i have no doubt le chaumareys had further orders to recognise muljadis rule in the name of france and to offer him whatever he needed to control his alliance he looked towards the beach at the seamen who were unloading two of the boats but we did come thomas too late for colonel pastor for he left in the argus to parley for his men with muljadi i pity him even if i admire his courage herrick nodded slowly his eyes clouded and when he had gone the last attack began no governor few defenders dead men have little to say herrick thought of their slow approach that morning the mist on the water distorting the sounds of cannon fire no wonder the remaining ragged defenders had not been able to wave or greet them undine must have seemed like a miracle bolitho said don puigserver is our one real card he can act in the name of spain and assure conway of his countrys confidence how did he react to the news bolitho thought of the spaniards face as he had listened to vega anguish shame and then fury he had seen it all only conways attitude still remained in shadow he had said little and not even argued with raymond when he had started off on what parliament would or would not support only one thing was certain the affair had to be contained no buildup of additional force no acceptance that there had been a change in rulership here or anywhere else as raymond had explained more than once the dutch were too busy recouping their losses caused by the war to want another conflict in their midst if france thrust more naval might into the area then spain too might change her views about her untried allegiance with britain it could be war all over again only when bolitho had made to leave for his ship had the rear admiral drawn him into a corner he had said very calmly politics a need for furthering trade or colonial power all are attitudes only one thing is properly clear to me as it must be to you bolitho he had held his gaze searching for a reaction before adding every puzzle must have a key this one has two undine and argus governments may try to use more power later on but by then it will be too late for us all if undine is lost so are we be sure that le chaumareys is already well aware of it when bolitho had made to question him further he had said he is a good officer make no mistake our squadrons had cause to damn his eyes in the war france has loaned muljadi their best as i hope england has aided me in the same manner much of his thoughts bolitho had spoken aloud for herrick exclaimed but it is not war sir no frenchman will cross swords for fear of starting one bolitho watched him and was glad he was here le chaumareys will have a letter of marque he is far from a fool when he runs out those fortyfour guns it will be muljadis flag at his peak not the fleur de lys of france he stood up and moved vaguely about the cabin but behind each breech will be an experienced crew the cream of his navy while wehe half turned his face suddenly drained again but that is enough battles are not won or lost on daydreams herrick nodded and what will we do now sir bolitho tugged the shirt over his head the same stained one as before we will weigh when the tide is right if iiuljadi has vessels in the area we must close with them show him we mean to continue what we have begun he pulled herrick towards the stern windows as a bugle wailed sadly across the glittering water above the fort there was conways new flag the little group of marines beneath it glowing like tiny red insects see thomas there is no drawing back not for conway not for any of us herrick watched the little tableau doubtfully better to await the bedford surely with troops and more cannon we would stand a better chance that is what le chaumareys will be thinking he smiled his face suddenly very young at least i hope that is so herrick groped for his hat glad of something to occupy his mind and to hold back the apprehension bolithos news had brought will we leave bellairs and his marines half of them there is much to be done with corpses lying unburied the place is a dunghill the defences are stout but in need of good men to patrol them rosalind will remain also under the protection of the battery such as it is i think her master is eager to get clear of this place but conway is more than a match for him herrick moved towards the door it is not what i was expecting sir nor i but like it or not we have a duty if muljadi and his threat is to be overcome then he must be seen as a common pirate he ran his hands along the desk top argots or no herrick hurried out his thoughts tugging in several directions at once he found iviudge in the wardroom staring gloomily at a plate of salt beef the master asked are we off again mr errick herrick smiled fact soon grew from rumour in a small ship yes the argus is busy here it seems as a privateer and not openly in the name of france mudge yawned unimpressed nothin new we used to do the same for the company in india a few ready muzzles always seemed to impress a doubtin rajah if a little strength was called for herrick looked at him and sighed so the frogs will back an armed uprising and we will support the protection of trade but what of the people in between mr mudge the master pushed his plate away with disgust never asked em was all he said luck of the game bolitho studied the masthead pendant and then walked aft to the compass northwest by west it was midafternoon and despite the skys unclouded relentless glare there was sufficient wind to make it easier to endure undine had been made to lie at anchor in pendang bay almost until dusk the previous day the set of the coastal currents and the winds determination to remain from the southwest making a night passage too dangerous even to attempt but in the last moments the wind had backed considerably and with her sleek hull tilting to its pressure undine had beaten out of the bay losing the settlement and its grim memories in purple shadow but if the wind had remained fresh it was still necessary to hold the ship closehauled the yards braced round to keep each sail drawing and steer undine clear of the land should the wind veer without warning and she lay too close to that undulating pattern of green coast undine could easily find herself hard upon a lee shore and in real danger herrick asked how much longer will we continue sir bolitho did not reply immediately he was watching the tiny triangular sails of undines cutter as it tacked daintily around a small clump of rocky islets then he shifted his gaze to the maintop where midshipman keen sat with one bare leg dangling over the barricade a telescope trained on the distant boat davy had the cutter and would signal the moment he sighted anything there was no sense in taking the ship too close when good visibility remained he said we are off the southwestern cape or as near as i can calculate there are marshes and swamps aplenty accord ing to mr mudge and fowlar if captain vegas information is correct the muljadis vessels may be close by he turned his face into the wind feeling the sweat drying on his forehead and neck the benua islands are about a hundred miles to the westrd of us a goodly piece of open water if we get the chance to run these pirates down herrick watched him doubtfully but was comforted by bolithos apparent optimism what do we know of muljadi sir bolitho walked up the slanting deck to thee weather rail and tugged the sticky shirt clear of his ribs little or nothing originally he came from somewhere in north africa morocco or the barbary coast jtt is said he was taken as a slave by the dons and chained in one of their galleys he escaped and was recaptured herrick whistled quietly i imagine the dons were hard with him bolitho thought suddenly of the elderly colonel pastor and his impossible mission the dons lopped off a hand and an ear and left him marooned on some desolate beach herrick shook his head yet somehow he reached the indies and can now strike fear into his old masters bolitho regarded him impassively or whoever stands between him and his final goal whatever that may be they both stared up as keen yelled deck there cutters signalled sir mr davy points to the northrd bolitho snatched a glass of course i should have realised he trained it on the cutter and then beyond to the gently sloping cape tiny islets crumbling ridges and rocks and everywhere the unbroken backcloth of green any small vessel could work her way through there as davys cutter was now doing herrick slammed his fists together got em by god bolitho said crisply we will remain on this tack for the present hoist the recall signal for mr davy and then beat to quarters he smiled if only to ease the mounting excitement in ten minutes maybe herrick waited until keen had shinned down a backstay to rejoin his signal party and then yelled beat to quarters clear for action a solitary drummerboy did the best he could his sticks blurring in doubletime as the tattoo brought the hands tumbling from hatchways and gratings that might frighten em off sir mudge was by his helmsmen his jowl working on some meat or a quid of tobacco there was little to choose between them bolitho often thought i believe otherwise bolitho watched the barebacked seamen dashing to their guns casting off the lashings and groping for the tools of their trade a reduced detachment of marines under the command of a solitary corporal was parading across the quarterdeck while a handful more clambered aloft to the foretop and its swivel gun the cutter had already turned bowson her sails lowered and thrusting through the inshore swell under oars alone they will not have met with many frigates im thinking their leader will try to reach open sea and outreach us rather than face a blockade or the risk of our landing marines at his back he touched mudges arm impetuously hell not know how unused we are to such affairs eh mudge pouted i only ope that bugger muljadi is ere too e needs to be taught a lesson an double quick in my reckonin deck there the lookout at the masthead waited until the scamper on the gun deck stopped sail on th lee bowl by heaven so there is midshipman keen gripped a seamans arm and added excitedly schooner by the cut of her the seaman pigtailed and with ten years in the navy glanced at him and grinned by god i envy you young gennlemen your learnin sir but his sarcasm was lost in the excitement of the moment herrick held up his hand as the last gun captain faced aft towards him from the break below the quarterdeck a bosuns mate shouted all cleared aft sir herrick swung round and saw bolitho examining his new watch cleared for action sir twelve minutes exactly bolitho glanced up at the masthead but for the lookouts hail i believe you may have done it in less he let the mock formality drop well done mr herrick and pass the word to all hands he walked back down the angled deck and trained his glass across the nettings two raked masts with big dark sails like wings they appeared motionless the hull still hidden beyond one more probing spit of land it was an illusion she was edging around the last dangerous point after that she would be up and away but it would take her a good while yet he swung round where is that damned cutter mowll the masteratarms and easily the most unpopular man aboard called comin up fast sir well signal mr davy to make haste ill have to leave him astern otherwise deck there tis another sail on th lee bow herrick watched in silence until he had discovered the second pair of sails in his glass another schooner probably company ships taken by these pirates no doubt bolitho turned to watch the cutter swinging round to drive beneath the main chains with a shuddering thud curses and clattering oars all were finally quenched by davys angry voice and the more patient tones of shellabeer the boatswain who was studying the whole manoeuvre from the gangway with obvious disgust allday had been standing behind bolitho and whispered should have had young mr armitage in charge captain hed have driven right through into the spirit store cutter an all bolitho smiled and allowed allday to buckle on his sword he had not seen his coxswain since breakfast just after dawn yet the moment of danger a hint of action and he was here without fuss and hardly a word to betray his presence maybe he saw midshipman armitage with soames below the foremast checking a list of gun crews which soames had reallotted on passage from india he found a moment to wonder what armitages mother would think if she saw her adored boy now leaner and well tanned his hair too long and his shirt in need of a good wash she would probably burst into tears all over again but in one way he had not changed he was still as clumsy and as lacking in confidence as his first day aboard little penn on the other hand who was strutting importantly beside the starboard battery of twelvepounders and waiting to assist lieutenant davy had no such handicap if anything he was prone to attempt tasks which were several spans of experience beyond his twelve years davy came struggling aft ducking beneath a swinging shadow as the cutter was hoisted inboard and on to its chocks above the gun deck he was soaked in spray but very pleased with himself bolitho said that was well done by making a quick sightingreport you have given us an edge on those two vessels davy beamed some prizemoney perhaps sir bolitho hid a smile we will see herrick waited for davy to join his gun crews and then said just the two schooners nothing else in sight he rubbed his hands noisily bolitho lowered the telescope and nodded very well mr herrick you may load and run out now he glanced at the masthead pendant for the hundredth time we will make more sail directly and show these pirates what they are against both schooners are keeping well inshore sir herrick lowered his telescope and turned to watch bolithos reactions with that rig they can sail really close to the wind bolitho walked to the compass the picture of the two other vessels sharp in his mind for over half an hour they had worked slowly and methodically between a small crop of islets and were now following the coastline towards a sloping spur of headland around that there was yet another bay with more jutting spits of land but the schooners would choose their moment most carefully go about and dash for the open sea separate perhaps and so lessen undines chances of conquest they were both wellhandled vessels and through his glass he had seen an assortment of small cannon and swivels and an equally varied selection of men mudge watched him gloomily winds backed apiece sir might old bolitho turned and stared along his ship weighing the risks and the gains the green headland was reaching down towards undines starboard bow or so it appeared in fact it was still some three miles distant the two schooners black against the lively wave crests seemed to overlap into one ungainly craft their great sails etched across the land he said firmly get the tgallants on her and alter course two points to starboard herrick stared at him itll be close sir if the wind veers well be hard put to beat off the shore when bolitho did not reply he sighed and lifted his speaking trumpet man the braces from further aft the helmsmen spun their spokes the senior one squinting at the flapping canvas and at the tilting compass bowl until even mudge was satisfied notwest by north sir very well bolitho studied the headland again a trap for the two schooners or a last resting place for undine as herrick seemed to think herrick was watching the topmen waiting until the topgallant sails were freed and then brought under control like bulging steel breastplates undine was moving swiftly now for with the wind sweeping tightly across her larboard quarter and with topsails and topgallants braced to best advantage there was little doubt the range was falling away mudge asked worriedly dyou think theyll try to go about sir perhaps bolitho shivered as a curtain of spray lifted and burst across the weather rail soaking him to the skin adding to his rising excitement theyll try and weather the headland as close as they dare and use the next bay to change tack or if one or both loses his head well rake em as he goes about on this side of the headland he peered at the gun deck at the figures beside each twelvepounder one good broadside would be more than enough for any schooner the second might strike without risking a similar fate he shut it from his mind the fight was not even begun yet he pictured conway back there in his remote kingdom he would know better than puigserver or raymond what was at stake with any luck undine might settle conways security long enough for him to demonstrate what he could do a faint crack echoed across the water and a white feather of spray showed itself for just a few seconds well away from the starboard bow it brought a chorus of jeers from the waiting gun crews run up the colours mr keen bolitho saw the handful of marines in the foretop adjusting their swivel gun some more were already cradling their long muskets along the hammock nettings their faces stiff with concentration one of ems making a run for it sir bolitho caught his breath as the sternmost schooner tilted at a steep angle her great mainsail sweeping above her deck like a huge wing while she altered course hard to larboard somebody yelled by jesus shes in irons look at th bugger the schooners captain had mistimed it very badly for as his command pounded round to cross the winds eye and find searoom elsewhere the sails flapped and rippled in hopeless confusion bolitho shouted well take him first stand by the larboard battery he saw soames hurrying down his line of guns the captains crouching like athletes behind each breech trigger lines taut as they peered through the open ports for a first sight of the target bolitho straddled his legs and tried to hold his telescope on the nearest vessel she was falling awkwardly downwind her narrow deck clearly visible as her crew fought to bring her back under control undine was overhauling her so rapidly that she was already lying some two cables from the larboard bow and seemed to swell in size even as he watched he saw the strange flag at her peak black with a red emblem in its centre a prancing beast of some sort he closed the glass with a snap and saw keen flinch at the sound allday grinned two minutes captain just right he nodded towards the opposite bow where the other schooner was holding steadily on course towards the headland he seems content to let his mates go under soames was peering aft his curved hanger glittering in the bright sunlight as he raised it slowly above his head the glare was making him grimace so badly that he appeared to be grinning like a madman bolitho looked at mudge let her fall off another point he forced a smile not a moment longer than necessary i promise he pulled out his sword and held it casually across his shoulder through his crumpled shirt it felt like ice the helmsman yelled hoarsely nor norwest it is sir there was no time to perfect the set of the yards no time for anything now as with barely a stagger undine turned even further towards the shore the movement dragging the labouring schooner into the view of the eager gun captains bolitho shouted as you bear mr soames soames bellowed stand by he came loping aft pausing at each gun to peer along its muzzle satisfied he jumped aside and yelled fire bolitho tensed as the uneven broadside belched and shuddered along his ships side soames had done well to an extra puff of wind which had pushed the frigate over to leeward he had judged it perfectly taking the enemy ship on the uproll raking her savagely from end to end bolitho grasped a stay his eyes blinded with smoke as the wind funnelled it back through every port men were coughing and swearing in the thick brown fog but urged on by shouts and threats they were still managing to sponge out and reload for another broadside when needed he stared with amazement at the schooner as the smoke cleared away from the quarterdeck dismasted almost buried under a chaos of fallen spars and ripped canvas she seemed a total wreck bring her back to norwest by north mr mudge he did not see the masters face his look of relief and admiration his ears were still ringing to the thunder of cannon fire the sharper probing cracks of the quarterdeck sixpounders he hoped the less experienced men had found time to tie their scarves over their ears caught at the wrong angle it only took one shot to deafen a man often permanently run out soames was peering at his crews as gun captain after captain raised a powderblackened fist to show his weapon was loaded herrick shouted now for tother one he waved to davy at the starboard battery the gesture impulsive unnoticed by himself davy waved back his movement jerky like a puppet as they swept after the second schooner midshipman penn moved slightly to place his lieutenant between him and any possible damage herrick laughed aloud by god young penn has the right idea sir he peered up at the streaming pendant the wind is still kind and this is putting new heart into our people bolitho watched him gravely later they would talk about it but when it was happening to you to those around you it was pointless to discuss anything you never really knew the man in action pride anger insanity it was there and more even on herricks homely face his own too no doubt he said we will run him as close as we can to the headland after that it will be up to him strike or fight he moved the swordblade on his shoulder the ice was gone now it was like a heated gunbarrel mudge remarked that master is a fool e should ave gone about sooner i would ave done so crossed undines bows afore we could blast im he sighed ell not get a second chance im tninkin bolitho looked at him mudge was right of course undine was playing a dangerous game to drive so bravely towards a lee shore but the schooners had taken even more of a chance herrick was saying prize crew on one and take the other in tow eh sir we should get good recompense for two schooners even if one of em is little more than a hulk bolitho watched the schooner without answering was muljadi aboard her or in the other one dying or already dead with some of his men better so he thought than fall into puigservers hands deck there the cry was almost lost above the chorus of spray and booming canvas ship on the larboard quarter bolitho swung round imagining for a moment that the lookout had been too long in the sun for an instant he could see nothing and then as his vision cleared he saw the forecourse and topsail of another ship standing around the last headland the one they had rounded so carefully in pursuit of the schooners herrick gasped what is she he stared at bolitho the argus bolitho nodded grimly i fear so mr herrick he tried to keep his tone level when his whole being was screaming at him to act to do the impossible and how easy he had made it for them he had allowed the schooners to draw him like a fox after two rabbits argus must have been following them along the coast waiting for the trap to be sprung reading bolithos mind without even being able to see him herrick exclaimed then by god well tell mr frenchman to sheer off this is none of his affair keen called shes overhauling us sir bolitho looked past him the argus was already beating well out on their larboard quarter taking the windgage doing exactly what he had attempted to do to the schooners now undine was in the trap run aground or try and claw to windward he saw the sunlight flashing down the big frigates exposed side the small moving shadows above the creaming water as she ran out her whole broadside he thought of the man behind those guns how did he feel at this moment herrick said quietly eighteenpounders im told sir he watched his face as if hoping for a denial of arguss strength yes he drew in a long breath as a flag broke from the frenchmans peak black and red like the ones which had flown above the schooners letter of marque hired by a foreign power the flag merely to keep up a pretenceof legality keen lowered his telescope and said quickly shes almost up to the dismasted schooner sir he was managing to sound calm but his hands were shaking badly there are some men in the water i think they were thrown outboard when the masts came down bolitho took the glass and watched his mind cold as he saw the frigate ride through and over the men in the water the captain had probably not even seen them all he saw was undine he raised his voice hoping the others would not despair at its strangeness we will alter course directly he ignored the unspoken protest on mudges heavy face get the tgallants off her mr herrick the frenchman will expect us to do so if we are about to fight he looked at mudge again without so much canvas we may be able to gain a little room to give an account of ourselves mudge replied harshly itll mean crossin er bows sir even if we gets round without avin the sticks torn out of us what then the argus will overreach us and put a full broadside through our stern as she passes bolitho regarded him bleakly i am relying on his desire to retain the windgage for without it he might change places with us he saw no agreement in mudges tiny eyes or would you have me haul down our colours eh mudge flushed angrily that aint fair sir bolitho nodded neither is a battle mudge looked away ill do me best sir lay er as close to th wind as shes ever bin he tapped the compass bowl if th wind olds we should be able to steer almost due west he strode to the wheel god elp me bolitho turned and saw the topmen sliding down to the deck again felt the more sluggish motion as undine plunged ahead on topsails and forecourse a glance at the other ship told him that her captain was doing likewise he had no need to worry undine would have to stand and fight there was no room left to run away he walked slowly back and forth stepping unseeingly over the sixpounder tackles his knee brushing against a crouching seaman as he passed arguss captain would be watching his every move the advantage if there was one would last only seconds a few minutes at best he looked at the headland it seemed very close now extending far out beyond the larboard bow like a great arm waiting to snatch them whole then he strode to the quarterdeck rail and called mr soames will want a broadside as we put about you have small chance of hitting him but the sudden challenge may have an effect he let his gaze move slowly along the upturned faces you will have to reload and run out quicker than ever before the argus is a powerful ship and will endeavour to use her heavier iron to full advantage we must get to close quarters he felt the grin frozen to his lips like a clamp show him that our lads are better no matter what damn flag he wears a few raised a cheer but it was not much of a rally herrick said quietly ready when you are sir it seemed very quiet bolitho looked aloft yet again the pendant flicked out as before if the wind backed further it would be some small help if it veered it would be disaster then he looked at soames as he clumped heavily aft and disappeared below the quarterdeck to supervise the sternmost twelvepounders which would bear first once they had altered course davy was by the foremast sending some of his own gun crews across to assist the larboard battery if arguss eighteenpounders got to grips they would need plenty of replacements he thought grimly he faced herrick and smiled well thomas herrick shrugged i tell you what i think when its over and done with sir bolitho nodded it was an unnerving feeling it always was of course and yet you imagined that each time was worse than the one before in an hour in minutes he could be dead thomas herrick his friend might be fighting a battle not of his choosing or screaming out his life on the orlop deck and mudge handpicked because of his vast store of knowledge but for this commission he would have been discharged now living with his children and his grandchildren too in all probability he snapped so be it then put the helm down man the braces lively there shuddering and groaning in protest undine slewed round to the thunder of wind and wildly flapping canvas bolitho saw spray bursting through the open ports as she swayed further and further to the violent change of tack from the corner of his eye he saw the arguss topsails lifting above the hammock nettings her shape shortening as undine swung round across her bows a gun banged out and the ball whimpered some where overhead someone must have fired too soon or perhaps the french captain had already guessed what they were trying to do soames was ready and waiting and the first crash of gunfire shook the deck violently the smoke swirling up and over the nettings in a writhing pall gun by gun down the side from stern to bow the sixpounders joining in as the argus crossed each black muzzle bolitho saw her foresail jerk and throb to the onslaught holes appearing like magic as soamess gun crews fired reloaded and fired again when he peered forward bolitho saw that the headland had eased back to starboard the schooner already tiny as she scuttled around it and into the next bay mudge yelled west by north sir full an bye he was mopping his eyes with his handkerchief clinging to the mizzen mast pike rack to hold himself upright he gestured towards the gaff where the red ensign streamed almost abeam close as we can get sir bolitho winced as the sixpounders barked out again and saw the nearest one bounding inboard until caught and held by its tackle its crew was already sponging out and groping for fresh charges and another ball from the shot garland eyes white and staring through the grime voices lost in the crash and roar of cannon fire the squeal of trucks as like angry hogs the heavy guns were run out towards the enemy the argus had at last followed bolithos lead she was swinging round her yards braced almost fore and aft to hold the wind and keep undine under her lee even as he watched bolitho saw the long orange tongues flashing from her ports the bombardment unhurried and carefully aimed as gun by gun she fired through the swirling curtain of smoke and spray a ball screamed above the quarterdeck and slapped through the maintopsail before dropping far abeam others were hitting the hull above or below the waterline bolitho had no idea he heard someone screaming through the choking smoke saw men dashing hither and thither like prisoners in hell as they rammed home the new charges and threw their shining blackened bodies to the tackles again and again above the din he heard soamess deep voice rallying and cursing as he kept his men at their guns a swivel banged out from the top and he imagined the marines were firing more to ease their own fears than with much hope of hitting anything a quarterdeck gun port seemed to explode in a great burst of flame and bolitho saw men and pieces of men hurled in all directions at once as a ball tore splinters from the bulwark and transformed them into hideous darts one marine ran sobbing from the nettings his hands clawing at what remained of his face others stood or knelt by their fallen companions firing reloading firing reloading until it seemed life itself had stopped a downdraught of wind swirled the smoke away and bolitho saw the other frigates yards and punctured sails barely fifty yards abeam he saw the filtered sunlight touching pikes and cutlasses as the enemy prepared to board or to fight off their attempt to do likewise he gasped as another line of bright tongues darted through the smoke felt the planks buck under his feet the crash and clatter of a gun being overturned or smashed to fragments when he peered upwards he saw that the maintopsail was little better than a rag but every spar was still intact a wounded seaman clung to the mainyard his blood running down one leg unheeded to the deck far below another seaman managed to reach him and drag him to safety and together they crouched below the maintop caught in the severed ratlines like two broken birds herrick was yelling hes trying to cripple us sir take us as a prize bolitho nodded and stopped to drag an injured man clear of a sixpounder he had already guessed arguss intentions another ship for muljadis use or perhaps to replace argus so that she could return to france the thought seemed to drive into his heart like a knife well put the helm hard down swing the bows right into him he did not recognise his own voice tell davy to get ready to grapple he seized herricks arm we must grapple hell pound us to splinters at this rate he felt the blast of a ball past his head heard it strike the opposite bulwark and send a mass of wood splinters scything across the deck like arrows herrick was yelling to mudge and the men at the braces and through the smoke bolitho saw arguss shadowy outline loom above the forecastle the sudden movement of figures in her bows as the two ships drove together above the din of gunfire and shouting he heard the sails jerking and banging the wind lost to them the ship already falling sluggishly abeam herrick staggered in some blood and gasped no use cant grapple bolitho stared past him the enemy was already edging ahead and across undines larboard bow a few guns firing as she went holding the wind and changing course very slightly while undine floundered helplessly her remaining sails almost aback she was going to rake undine with every available gun but give bolitho time to haul down his colours before she reached his stern and finished what she had begun he felt herrick tugging his arm what now herrick pointed up through the smoke where the sunlight was making a small path through the drifting smoke the lookout sir hes reported a sail to the westrd his eyes were shining with hope the frenchmans making off bolitho looked at him dully it was true and he had heard nothing deafened by gunfire or fogged in his own despair he did not know but the argus was already spreading her mainsail and was driving downwind with gathering power towards the open strait bolitho said hands to the braces mr herrick lay her on the larboard tack again if we can signal this newcomer we may still be able to give chase he heard a small cry and when he turned he saw two seamen kneeling beside keens body the midshipman was trying to reach down to his stomach but one of the seamen was gripping his wrists while the other slit open his bloodstained breeches with a dirk and threw them aside a few inches above the groin there was something like a broken bone but bolitho knew it was far worse a wood splinter blasted from the deck and probably held tight by its own barbs he knelt down and touched it with his fingers seeing the blood pulsing across the youths thigh hearing his sobs as he tried not to scream bolitho thought of whitmarsh far away in pendang bay helping to heal the sick and wounded from the garrison one of the seamen said ell not last sir without elp ill fetch a surgeons mate allday was kneeling beside him and said no ill do it bolitho looked at him seeing the determination on his face then he turned and said easy mr keen youll be about again soon he felt the rising anger and despair pricking his eyes what had he brought them all to he touched the midshipmans bare shoulder it was smooth like a womans he had not even begun to live yet he snapped are you sure allday the coxswain eyed him calmly im as good as those other butchers davy came hurrying aft and touched his hat masthead has reported the other ship to be the bedford sir the frenchman must have thought her to be a manofwar he looked at keens wound and said hoarsely my god bolitho stood up slowly watching the midshipmans fingers opening and closing like trapped animals in the seamans strong grip very well allday take him aft to the cabin ill be down myself as soon as ive attended to things here allday looked at him dont you fret captain its the luck of the game our turn will come he nodded to the two seamen pick him up keen gave a sharp cry as they moved him to the cabin hatch and before he vanished below bolitho saw that his eyes were fixed unwinkingly on the sky above the tattered sails trying to hold on to it so that by keeping the picture in his mind he might retain his life itself bolitho bent and picked up the midshipmans dirk from the stained deck he handed it to davy and said we will make contact with the bedford there is nothing more we can do for the present but return to the settlement herrick said the old bedford he sounded bitter a bloody storeship from madras full of seasick soldiers and their womenfolk bolitho watched the helmsman bringing undine carefully back on course the skilful way they were allowing for the punctured sails loss of power if argus had known that shed have done for both of us he saw the surprise and sudden concern and added simply but not before we had rendered her equally useless he glanced aloft at the masthead pendant how many times had he done that he took out his watch and flicked open the guard remembering the whole seafight had taken less than two hours and already argus was almost lost in the offshore haze which marked the coming of evening he shaded his eyes to look for the bedford and saw her topsails on the horizon like small yellow shells then he looked around at the splintered planking the small line of corpses which had been dragged below the weather gangway there was much to do and he must not give way for an instant if his men were to keep the will to fight again if the time came he saw another corpse being carried up from the forehatch and knew he would have to deal with the reports of damage arrange for replacements and repairs and burials he heard another sharp cry through the cabin skylight and thought of keen being spreadeagled there while allday tried to extract the splinter he said i am going below mr herrick deal with reports on damage and casualties he saw him nod thank you as he hurried below iherrick said quietly no thankyou bolitho brushed past the sentry at his door and then stopped it was very quiet in the cabin and when he saw keens naked body lying on the deck he thought he was too late allday said all done captain he held up the jagged red lump in some pincers i think he did very well for a lad bolitho looked down at keens ashen face there was blood on his lips where one of the seamen had held a strap between his teeth to prevent him from biting through his tongue noddall and he other seamen were finishing tying the dressing around the wound and there was a thick smell of rum in the air bolitho said quietly thank you allday i never knew you understood such things allday shook his head did it to a sheep once poor thing fell down a cliff on to a broken sapling very much the same really bolitho walked to the stern windows and sucked in a lungful of air you must tell mr keen that when he is well again he turned and watched him gravely do you think he will fully recover allday nodded yes another inch or so and it might have been the end he forced a grin seeing the strain on bolithos face for the ladies anyway the door opened and herrick said we are within signalling distance of bedford sir i come up he paused and looked down at keen even a glance told him his breathing was easier casualties herrick dropped his eyes ten killed sir twenty wounded its a miracle we didnt lose far more the carpenter and his mates are below but it seems most of the holes are above the waterline shes a lucky ship sir bolitho looked from him to allday im the lucky one then he walked from the cabin allday shook his head and sighed releasing more rum into the smoke air my advice is to leave him be mr herrick sir herrick nodded i know but he has taken this setback badly though i know of no captain who could have done better allday dropped his voice but one captain did do better today and oursll not rest until hes met with him again im thinking keen gave a soft moan and allday snapped come on you idlers basin to his head ive poured so much grog into his guts hell spew all over the cabin when he comes to the surface again herrick smiled and walked out towards the ladder seeing the men replacing the lashings on the guns glancing at him and grinning as he passed one of them called we showed the bastards eh sir herrick paused that we did lads the captain was proud of you the seaman grinned more broadly aye sir i seed im in the thick of it walkin about like e was on plymouth oe i knew then that we was goin to be all right herrick climbed towards the sunlight and stared up at the torn sails if only you knew he thought sadly he found the other lieutenants and warrant officers already assembled on the quarterdeck giving their various reports while bolitho leaned against the mainmast trunk when he saw herrick he said there is still a good span of daylight left well put the hands to replacing canvas and runningrigging while it lasts i have ordered the galley fire to be lit and well see that our people get a good meal he gestured towards the labouring storeship which was now less than a mile away we might even poach a few extra hands from her eh herrick saw the others watching bolitho dully their bodies almost limp with exhaustion and delayed shock he guessed that this other bolitho cool confident filled with ideas again was the one the seaman on the gun crew had pictured throughout the battle the fact that he knew the real bolitho behind the shield made him feel suddenly privileged and restored in for a blow rear admiral beves conway made a dark silhouette against the windows colourful rectangle but bolitho could recognise his impatience even though his back was turned beyond him still and peaceful above their own varying shadows the anchored ships shone in the late sunlight undine lay apart from the heavy transport and the little brig rosalind and it was impossible to see the damage she had received from the french frigates eighteenpounders occasionally when there was a lull in the voices bolitho heard the echoes of thudding hammers the rasp of saws to show that only distance made undines trim appearance a lie the air in the big timbered room was cool after the open bay and although the various figures sitting around it looked as if they had barely moved since his last visit bolitho noticed that the place itself had changed considerably in so short a time more furniture some rugs and a whole array of gleaming decanters and glasses made it look lived in rather than a fortress under siege don luis puigserver sat on a brassbound chest sipping wine while james raymond tightlipped and unsmiling faced him across a littered table the brigs master captain vega of the original garrison and two redcoated soldiers from the bedford made up the rest of the gathering one of the latter a heavyfaced man introduced briefly as major frederick jardine and who commanded the soldiers brought from madras bolitho instantly recognised as the one he had seen there when he had been escorting viola raymond he had a fat belligerent face and his small piggy eyes had hardly left bolitho since he had arrived the other soldier a captain strype was his secondincommand and a complete opposite tall and stickthin with a black moustache he spoke with a lisp and had a short barking laugh he was probably rather stupid bolitho thought but was obviously much in awe of his superior conway said sharply naturally i am very distressed to learn of arguss attack captain bolitho raymond said unwarranted too conway turned lightly on his heels his hair yellow in the sunlight but not unexpected raymond not by me that is it was obvious from the beginning that the french were implicated they have to be for their own interests sake we are lucky that bedfords arrival put paid to their intention to take captain bolithos ship from him he shifted his gaze his tone incisive and he would have done so eh bolitho felt all their eyes on him i believe so sir conway bobbed his head good good bolitho i wanted the truth and believe me i know what it cost you raymond tried again to put his point of view i think sir that we should despatch the brig to madras without delay sir montagu strang may consider that further operations here might be imprudent he ignored conways stiffening shoulders later perhaps some new plan may be conceived until then we must take this affair as a warning conway rasped a warning do you imagine that for one instant i will let some damned pirate work off his wrath on me and so imperil the very task i have just undertaken he stepped closer well do you raymond paled but replied stubbornly i am here on behalf of the government sir as an adviser the french must realise that you are outmanoeuvred before you have begun if this muljadi is allowed to plunder and ravage these waters then there is no chance of using pendang bay as a new and flourishstation for trade no shipping master would risk it he turned towards the brigs captain is that not so the man nodded glumly we need more protection sir raymond sounded triumphant exactly which is what the french intend if we ask for more menofwar to patrol the area they too will even the balance by sending additional consorts for argus conway stared at him then so be it no sir it would mean war argus is protected by her letter of marque muljadi is protected by his own power and backed up by his french friends there are a thousand muljadis in the indies some who are genuine rulers and some who reign over fewer people than captain bolitho does at present we all want to extend our trade and influence to china if need be and beyond there are riches we can only dream of lands where people have never heard of king george or louis either for that matter bolitho said quietly you are advising the governor to admit defeat sir do i understand correctly raymond smiled calmly as you have done eh bolitho walked to the window and stared down at his ship it gave him time allowed the sudden blinding anger to depart in the lower enclosure he saw midshipman keen sitting with one of the ships boys rescued from the nervion he had been detailed to look after keen to assist him if only by making him rest it was still not possible to be sure he would recover from his wound was it really only the day before yesterday the smoke and noise the aftermath of hard heavy work to put their ship to rights the seaburials each corpse heavily weighted to ensure it went straight down to avoid the prowling sharks he said i take it mr raymond you have never borne arms for your country he did not wait for an answer had you ever worn the kings coat you would have known that one defeat if admitted is not the end of a battle he heard captain strype say in his thin voice by gad thats not much of an argument what bolitho turned swiftly his tone hard i was addressing mr raymond sir not some damned mercenary who because of his rank imagines himself to be a solider don puigserver brought his glass down to the table with a loud bang gentlemen i know that vega and i are no longer involved here i also believe that both senor raymond and the governor he bowed slightly to conway are both right with muljadi free to use his ruthless power and so influence other friendly rulers in the indies you can make no advances with more military strength you would only excite a hostile reaction and further french involvement he paused and gave an eloquent shrug which i doubt my own country could ignore bolitho nodded towards him grateful for his interruption another second and he knew he would have said too much and conway even had he wanted to would have been unable to help him major jardine cleared his throat despite what the gallant captain has said he did not look at bolitho i believe my force will be sufficient i have two hundred sepoys and a mule battery all experienced he had a thick voice and sweated badly despite the rooms comparative coolness puigserver regarded him gravely if nervion had been here none of this could have happened an additional ship the men and the showing of our flag to the argus would certainly have delayed if not defeated muljadis intentions conway said but she is not here only the undine jardine said thickly and she does not seem to have acquitted herself too well he turned to bolitho his small eyes like steel even as a mere soldier a mercenary i can see that neither of the schooners lies at anchor and as far as we know the argus still flies muljadis colours what sayyou captain bolitho faced him the first schooner turned turtle and sank the other took advantage of arguss presence to escape he could feel little emotion now words and taunts were inevitable it was better to get it over with clear the air indeed yes jardine leaned back in his chair his polished boots squeaking and then the bedford arrived to give you help the poor muchmaligned companys own ship was the one to drive argus away had you been there major jardine spread his plump hands but i was not sir i am a soldier i am supposed to be able to leave such matters to our navy surely conway said coldly i have heard enough i will brook no more hostility here not from you bolitho he looked at jardine nor from anyone else he thrust his hands behind him making his sloping shoulders droop even further had undine been beaten in open combat i would have removed captain bolitho from command he knows that well enough and so should the rest of you the navy is too often expected to fight greater forces than itself possesses and has been so successful in the past that victory against ridiculous odds is now taken for granted by the emptyminded men of politics and those who care more for quick profit than lasting security as it is captain bolitho will be required to sail without further delay other than completing necessary repairs for muljadis own territory in the strait he looked at bolitho calmly you will make contact with arguss captain under flag of truce and convey a message which i will give you raymond said quickly may i suggest plead with you sir that you allow don puigserver to go with captain bolitho he has the right to demand the freedom of spains last governor here colonel pastor he could explain his displeasure at such conway shouted his voice bounding back from the timbered walls i have been appointed governor raymond i dont need your apron strings nor do i need the help of the king of spain dyou understand raymonds defiance wilted under conways sudden anger he said nothing puigserver stood up and walked slowly towards the door followed gratefully by capitan vega he paused and looked back at them his eyes very dark i would have accompanied capitan bolitho with pleasure of course he smiled briefly i have a great admiration for his courage his he searched for the word his integrity but i have much to do my task is to embark the remaining spanish soldiers and their dependents on to the bedford he glanced at conway his smile fading as you remarked this morning the flag of spain no longer has authority here bolitho watched him stride out he had sensed the tension as soon as he had arrived it could not have been easy for conway fretting over lack of news waiting for supplies and troops to arrive but he was wrong to antagonise puigserver if things went badly here conway would need all the references he could get even in spain jardine remarked vaguely id better be off then settle the sepoy s in their company lines and replace the marines as sentries and pickets no thanks no admiration for what captain bellairs and his marines had achieved in so short a time bolitho glanced through the window again the encroaching brush and creeper cleared away and corpses buried the place used as a hospital had been cleaned and painted and even whitmarsh had been full of praise for their efforts conway nodded i will meet you here after sunset major bolitho waited until the two soldiers had left the room and then said i am sorry about my outburst sir but i have had my bellyful of his kind conway grunted perhaps but you will hold your tongue in future if jardine commanded only a handful of crippled beggars i would say the same i need every man i can get raymond stood up and yawned this damned heat i think ill take a nap before dinner he too walked out he did not look at bolitho conway said softly he disliked your remark about bearing arms you know he chuckled his wife has been singing the praises of seaofficers in general during your absence and you in particular he frowned i seem to be plagued with those intent on disruption is she well sir he could not face him i have not seen her since my return shes been assisting that sot of a surgeon with the sick and wounded his eyebrows mounted surprised by god bolitho youve much to learn about women he nodded sharply but youll see all in good time bolitho recalled her refusal to help tend the injured aboard undine after puigserver had been carried aboard more dead than alive and her reasons he sighed perhaps puigserver and conway were both right he had much to learn he replied i will return to the ship sir there will be a lot to arrange yes conway watched him thoughtfully and remember when you meet arguss captain keep your personal feelings to yourself he is doing his own work as best he can you would do the same if so ordered if le chaumareys is still in command and not killed by one of your guns he will be eager to meet you also he is older than you but i think you may have something in common his lines deepened as he added dryly a disrespect for your superiors if nothing else bolitho picked up his hat you could never be sure about conway where the warmth ended and the steel began conway said please come ashore tonight and dine with the rest of he waved one hand around the room the castaways bolitho recognised the dismissal and walked from the room beyond the palisades the jungle was as thick and as overpowering as ever and yet already the place felt familiar lasting he found allday lounging in the shade below the main entrance he was watching some native women who were washing clothes in a large wooden trough they were small and oliveskinned and although well covered displayed supple charm which allday apparently admired greatly he straightened his back and said all done captain he saw bolithos glance and nodded fair little wenches we will have to watch our people captain only the people allday grinned ah well now at that moment bolitho saw the surgeon emerge from the makeshift hospital wiping his hands on a rag and squinting into the slanting sunlight he saw bolitho and nodded two of the men wounded in your battle can return to work sir two more died as you know but the rest stand a good chance of survival he looked away until the next time bolitho considered his words a total of twelve had died because of argus despite the luck at there being few in comparison to the fierceness of the battle it was too many he sighed perhaps herrick had got some more volunteers from the other ships whitmarsh said your coxswain did a good job by the way the boy should have died by rights he looked at allday wasted you should make something of your life bolitho said quietly i am glad you thanked him for his efforts on mr keens behalf but i am sure he will decide his own future allday could have been stonedeaf for all the notice he paid to their comments whitmarsh said well anyway sir ive cleaned up a bit here most of them will heal although a few more will die before they reach spain disease mostly of course of course whitmarsh looked him full in the eyes rotten with it just as they have given it to these poor ignorant savages too if any one of your sailors comes to me with that damned pox ill make him wish hed never touched a woman in his life they are your sailors too mr whitmarsh bolitho regarded him searchingly despite his usual attitude where naval matters were concerned he looked a great deal better or perhaps there was little to drink here either way he was nothing like the drunken hulk who had tumbled aboard in england so there you are captain he turned and saw her watching him from the entrance she was almost covered by a white smock and wore the same straw hat she had brought from santa cruz her eyes were in shadow but there was no doubting the warmth of her smile he replied i am grateful for what you have done maam whitmarsh nodded she is the one who took charge here organised the whole hospital from top to bottom his admiration was genuine she smiled at allday and then slipped her hand through bolithos arm ill walk with you to the beach if i may it is so refreshing to have you back again bolitho could feel whitmarsh and allday watching them he said you are looking er very well her hand tightened very slightly say viola he smiled viola better when she spoke again her voice was different i saw your ship dropping anchor and was half mad with anxiety i wanted james to take me out to her by boat he refused he would then i saw you with a telescope it was like being there with you and today i have spent a little time with valentine valentine bolitho looked at her profile who is that she laughed of course you would never remember a thing like a mere name why i am speaking of your mr keen the mood changed again the poor boy he looks so ill yet can speak of no one but you she gripped his arm hard i am almost jealous bolitho looked past her to where the gig lay beached on the sand the small breakers hissing and receding around it the boats crew were engaged in noisy conversation with some seamen from the brig and it was plain they were describing what they still saw as their victory over the argus and the schooners he smiled despite his earlier bitterness and disappointment perhaps they were right to remain alive under such circumstances could well be seen as a victory she was looking at him standing slightly apart as if searching for something you smile captain at me at my boldness perhaps he reached out and took her hand not that never she tossed her head that is better captain he heard alldays shoes on the sand the sudden silence from the gig the name is richard he said gravely allday heard their combined laughter and felt suddenly worried this was a danger he could recognise well enough far better than his captain he thought he removed his hat as bolitho walked down the beach towards the gig and heard him say i will be ashore later maam she held the hat brim to shade her eyes until then captain but allday had seen the look on her face before it was hidden in shadow that too was something he could recognise he glanced quickly at the tower above the fort and took a deep breath squalls ahead he decided and not too far away bolitho looked at him well alldays face was rigid so it would appear captain three days after returning to teluk pendang his majestys frigate undine weighed anchor again and put to sea by late afternoon of that day she stood well out in the glittering expanse of the java sea with not even a cormorant for company to any casual observer who might have watched her departure there was little to betray her mauling from arguss cannon but as bolitho came on deck he was well aware of it shrouds and stays which had been cut by grape and catus shone brightly in their fresh tar deck planking hastily placed looked duller than the welltried and holystoned wf which had been in the ship since she had been built the s maker and his mates had been busier than most and even nccr as he walked slowly along the weather side bolitho saw jots tait squatting with some helpers his one eye gleaming watdr fully as with needles and palms they continued with th patching fowlar who was masters mate of the watch touched forehead and reported southwest by south sir he gestwcd abeam a bit of a swell and mr soames has gone forrard check the gun lashings bolitho glanced at the compass and then the set of each by turn he had already noticed the steep sickening motion but it was too early to gauge its importance the barornett was unsteady but that was usual in these latitudes and wl he had consulted mudge he had chosen his words carefully could be in for a storm sir you never know in these waters he nodded to fowlar and walked to the quarterdeck feeling the sun lingering on his shoulders and face it was a wind he thought but sultry and somehow depressing he saw herrick speaking with soames by the starboard twelvepounders the boatswain was there too pointing various repairs yet to be done and through the main hatch he heard the lively sounds of a jig from the ships fiddler normal everyday sights and noises he shifted wearily and begano pace up and down the weather side from one corner of his eye he saw soames climb from th gun deck make as if to approach him and then return to the opposite side of the deck bolitho was relieved soames had proved himself a tower of strength in a fight but as a conversationalist he was heavy and limited and bolitho needed to be left alone to think to examine the rights and the wrongs of what he had done with the lajd left far astern and once more abandoned to his own resources he could view everything much more clearly now as his shadow bobbed and swayed above the black sixpounders he decided there were far more wrongs than rights inevitable something which either of them could have stopped in a second merely by a word a hint even he recalled the way she had watched him across the table while the others had talked and chattered the night away capitan vega had entertained them with a song so sad it had brought tears to his eyes puigserver had spoken of his adventures in the south americas and the west indies before the war raymond had become steadily drunk after getting into a fruitless argument with major jardine on the possibilities of a lasting peace with france conway had remained terribly sober or if not bolitho thought he must be a better actor than he had imagined when then had the actual moment of decision arrived he had found himself on the upper rampart with her at his side leaning over the rough timber to look at the anchored ships in the bay they had made a fine picture tiny lights reflected on the uneasy water the pale splash of oars as a guardboat patrolled monotonously around its heavier charges without looking at him she had said i want you to stay on shore tonight will you perhaps that had been the moment he had felt reckless dangerously so ill send a message to my first lieutenant he turned to stare along the deck herrick was still talking to shellabeer and he wondered if he had guessed what had occurred he could remember the room exactly more like a cell with fewer luxuries than a lieutenants cabin in a manofwar he had lain on the bed his fingers locked behind his head listening to the strange noises beyond the walls and the rapid beats of his own heart cries from the jungle the occasional call of a picket challenging one of the sergeants of the guard wind murmuring around the square tower without response from deck or rigging which was his normal life then he had heard the sound of her footstep in the passageway a quick whisper to her maid before she opened the door and shut it quickly behind her it was becoming harder to remember in perfect sequence the continuity was confused he could recall holding her tightly against his body the warmth of her mouth on his the sudden overwhelming desperate need which threw all last caution to the winds there had been no light in the tiny room but that from the moon he had seen her only briefly her bare shoulder and thigh shining like silver before she had climbed on to the bed pulling him down and down until at last spent and gasping with the extent of their desire they had lain together as one he could not remember sleeping at all just holding her needing her tortured by the realisation it could not last once during the night and towards dawn she had whispered in his ear do not reproach yourself it is not a question of honour it is a part of life she had put her lips to his shoulder and had added softly what a lovely smell you have of the ship salt and tar she had giggled quietly i must have it too then the nervous tap on the door the quick scramble to pull on her gown as her faithful maid warned of the coming of another day but for bolitho it had been different from all other days he felt totally unlike anything he had been before alive yet restless replete but needing more he heard steps on the deck and saw herrick watching him yes mr herrick winds freshening again sir shall i call the hands to reef topsls he ran his eyes across the ship riggings straining apiece by the sound of it well give her her head a while longer until eight bells if possible when we change tack and run to the westrd no sense in tiring the hands when one operation will suffice he leaned back hands on hips as he stared at the main topgallant masthead the long pendant undulating in the wind shes a lot of power to offer us yet aye sir herrick sounded tired is anything wrong bolitho walked to the weather rail and out of earshot of soames and two seamen who were splicing halliards herrick said quietly you know already sir ive said my piece whats done is done bolitho watched him gravely then let us leave it well alone herrick sighed very well sir he looked at the helmsmen im sorry i could only get four extra hands neither bedford nor the rosalind were eager to part with any more and those i did obtain are troublemakers by the cut of them he gave a slow smile although mr shellabeer assures me they will change their ways before another dawn midshipman armitage ran up the ladder and touched his hat to herrick he stammered mr taprils respects sir and would you join him in the magazine herrick asked is that all the boy looked uncomfortable he said youd promised sir and so i did mr armitage as the midshipman hurried away herrick said i was going to arrange to have the powder casks inspected and marked again no sense in losing good powder he lowered his voice look sir are you sure you cannot see the folly of what you are doing there is no telling what damage it might do to your career bolitho swung towards him and then saw the anxious concern on herricks face he replied i am relying on your lady luck thomas he walked towards the cabin hatch adding for soamess benefit call me the moment there is a change soames watched him go and then walked aft to the compass fowlar watched him warily once back in england he too would get the chance to obtain a commission as lieutenant the captain had said as much and that was good enough but if he did make that first allimportant step up the ladder he hoped he would be happier about it than lieutenant soames appeared to be soames rasped mr fowlar your helmsmen are wandering off a point or so damn my eyes i dont expect that from you fowlar watched him move away and smiled to himself there was nothing wrong with the helm and soames knew it it was part of the game he said watch your helm mallard mallard transferred a plug of tobacco from one cheek to the other and nodded aye mr fowlar sur the watch continued before the last dog watch had run its course it was obvious the rising wind made it necessary to reef topsails bolitho gripped the hammock nettings and faced along his ships length as he watched the petty officers checking their men in readiness for going aloft while shellabeer and his own hands were already busy scrambling about the boattier with further lashings herrick shouted above the wind a second reef within the hour sir if im any judge bolitho turned aft and felt the spray as it hissed freely above the weather quarter the wind had backed rapidly and now blew lustily from the southeast making the motion both violent and uncomfortable he replied we will steer due west once we have reefed on the larboard tack she will be steadier he watched the great steeply banked swell like serried lines of angry glass hills when the wind got up further those rounded rollers would break into heavy waves bolitho heard mudge shout were in for a blow right enough sir he wasclinging to his misshapen hat his small eyes watering in the wind the barometer is poppin about like a pea on a drum davy shouted all mustered sir very well hands aloft herrick held up his hand keep them from racing each other and stop the bosuns mates from using their ropesends he glanced at bolitho one slip and a man would go overboard without a chance of recovery bolitho agreed herrick always remembered things like that he said i hope this doesnt last too long if we have to ride it out it will upset admiral conways other arrangements i have no doubt he looked up as faint shouts and curses told him of the struggle the topmen were having with the violent unruly canvas fisting and kicking pitching this way and that with the deck far below the very sight of their efforts made him feel queasy it took the best part of an hour to master the sails to herricks satisfaction and by then it was time to take in yet another reef spray and spindrift whipped across the weather side and every timber and stay seemed to be groaning in a protesting chorus bolitho shouted lay her round another point mr herrick we will steer westbysouth herrick nodded his face running with spray afterguard to the mizzen braces he shook his speaking trumpet angrily keep together damn you a marine had slipped and fallen in a scarlet heap knocking several of his comrades into confusion bolitho pointed abeam to the first glitter of white crests as the wind did its work shes steadier mr herrick he relaxed as the experienced seamen rushed aft to help the marines and less skilled hands on the mizzen braces and not a man hurt by the looks of it undine had paid off stiffly to the wind her shrouds and ratlines shining jetblack against the rising swell but with her yards comfortably braced and canvas reduced to topsails and jibs she was making the best of it davy panted on to the quarterdeck his shirt wringing and sodden all secure sir he lurched backwards tottered and then reeled against the nettings adding savagely by the lord id forgotten what a real gale felt like bolitho smiled dismiss the watch below but tell the boatswain to make regular inspections we cant afford to lose precious gear for want of a good lashing he turned to herrick come below with me despite the din of sea and strained timbers it seemed warm and inviting in the cabin bolitho watched the spray making diagonal patterns across the stern windows heard the rudder grinding and squeaking while the helmsmen held the frigate on her new course noddall pattered into the cabin his small body steeply angled as he fetched goblets for the two officers herrick wedged himself in a corner of the bench seat and regarded bolitho questioningly if we have to run before the wind would it make so much difference sir bolitho thought of his written orders conways brief but lucid instructions it might he waited until they both had goblets and said to what we can achieve thomas errick chuckled ill share that toast bolitho sat at the desk feeling the deck tilting and then sliding into yet another trough he was glad he had insisted that keen and some of the other wounded had been left at pendang bay too much of this sort of motion would burst open even the finest stitches he said admiral conway intends to let bedford put to sea as soon as we are on our way to the benua islands i think he wishes to get rid of the spanish troops and dependents as soon as possible herrick watched him bit risky isnt it sir with the damned argus still at large bolitho shook his head i think not i am certain the french or muljadi will have agents watching conways settlement they will have seen us weigh anchor argus will know we are coming well enough herrick looked glum they are as clever as that eh we must assume so i think conway is right better to get bedford away with her passengers and despatches for madras before things get any worse if theres a real storm itll put paid to everything herrick cheered up somewhat the frogs dont like bad weather bolitho smiled at herricks confidence this one may not care he has been in these waters a long time i believe he is not one of the hitandrun kind who used to dash out of brest or lorient and flee for home again at the sight of an english ship he rubbed his chin this le chaumareys interests me i would like to know more of him than his record in battle herrick nodded he appears to know a lot about you sir too much a steep roller cruised beneath the quarter holding the ship up and tilting her forward at a steeper angle before freeing her again to sidle into the next rough beyond the closed door them heard the marine sentry slip and fall his musket clattering away while he cursed and fought to regain his composure bolitho said slowly when we meet with arguss captain ve must keep our eyes well opened if he agrees to parley we may learn something if not we must be ready to fight herrick frowned id rather fight sir its the only way l know how to be at ease with a frenchman bolitho thought suddenly of that room at the admiralty the calm features of admiral winslade as he had given a brief outline of undines mission four months back a time of peace yet ships had foundered and men had been killed or crippled for life but even the lordly power of admiralty the guile and experience of politics were useless out here a solitary windswept frigate minimum resources and no guiding hand when one might be needed herrick took bolithos quiet mood as a signal he placed his goblet inside the table fiddles and rose carefully to his feet time to do my rounds sir he cocked his head to listen as water gurgled and sluiced along the quarterdeck scuppers i have the middle watch and may snatch a catnap before i face the breeze bolitho pulled out his watch and felt herrick looking at it i will turn in now i have a notion we may all be needed before long in fact it felt only minutes after his head had touched the pillow that someone was clinging to the cot and tapping his shoulder it was allday his shadow rising and falling like a black spectre as the cabin lantern swung violently from the deckhead sorry to wake you captain but its getting far worse up top he paused to allow bolithos brain to clear mr herrick told me to pass the word bolitho stumbled out of the cot instantly conscious of a new more uneven motion as he pulled on his breeches and shoes and held out his arms for a heavy tarpaulin coat he asked what time is it allday had to shout as the sea thundered against the hull and surged angrily along the upper deck morning watch is about to be called sir tell mr herrick call them now he gripped his arm and together they lurched half across the cabin like two tipsy sailors i want all hands directly im going to the chart space he found mudge already there his lumpy figure sprawled across the table while he peered at the chart blaspheming quietly as the lantern went mad above his head bolitho snapped how is it he glanced up at him his eyes red in the feeble glow bad sir well ave the canvas in shreds unless we lie to for a bit bolitho peered at the chart plenty of searoom that was the only consolation he hurried towards the quarterdeck ladder and almost fell as the ship swayed and corkscrewed in two separate motions he fought his way to the wheel where four helmsmen their bodies lashed firmly to prevent their being caught unawares by an incoming wave were fighting the spokes their eyes glowing in the flickering compass light herrick shouted ive called all hands sir and ive put extra ones on the pumps bolitho peered at the jerking compass card very well we will lie to under shortened maintopsl get davy to put the best men aloft at once he turned as a sound like gunshot echoed above the shriek of wind and sea and saw the mizzen topsail rip itself apart the fragments tearing yet again into ragged streamers pale against the low scudding clouds he could hear the dismal clank of pumps hoarse cries as men blundered to their stations dodging below the gangways as more frothing water flooded amongst them fowlar shouted the sailmaker has only just repaired that crojack sir he was grinning in spite of the confusion hell not be pleased bolitho was watching the black shapes of the topmen as they climbed cautiously up the vibrating ratlines the wind flattened them occasionally against the shrouds so that they hung motionless before starting up again for the topsail yards mudge yelled th quarter boat as carried away sir no one paid any heed and herrick spluttered in spray before saying there goes the foretopsl sir those lads are doing fine something dropped amongst the taut rigging before falling to the gun deck with a sickening thud herrick shouted man from aloft take him to the surgeon bolitho bit his lip it was unlikely he could live after such a fall fighting every yard of the way undine came round into the wind her hull awash from quarterdeck to beakhead and with men clinging to tethered guns or stanchions as each wave surged and broke across her reeling deck mudge bellowed hoarsely shell ride it out now sir bolitho nodded his mind cringing from the onslaught the very vehemence of the storm well set the spanker if the tops carries away tell the boatswain to have his hands ready therell not be time for regrets if that one goes he felt a bowline being bent around his waist and saw alldays teeth bared in a grin you look after us captain thisll take care of you bolitho nodded the breath knocked out of him then he clung to the dripping nettings peering through the painful needles of spray as he watched over his command a lucky ship perhaps he had spoken too soon tempted fate herrick gasped could be over by first light sir but when dawn did come and bolitho saw the angry coppercoloured clouds reflected upon the endless jagged wavecrests he knew it was not going to give up so willingly high above the deck torn and broken cordage floated to the wind like dead creeper and the solitary braced topsail looked so fullbellied that it could follow the fate of the other at any second he looked at herrick seeing the angry sores on his neck and hands where the blown salt had done its work the other crouching battered figures nearby were no better he thought of the other frigate probably snug in a protected anchorage and felt the anger welling up inside him get some hands aloft mr herrick theres work to be done herrick was already clawing his way along the nettings towards the rail bolitho wiped his face and mouth with his arm if they could weather this one he thought they would be ready for anything no quarter some more ot coffee sir noddall held his pot above bolithos mug without waiting for a reply bolitho sipped it slowly feeling the scalding liquid running through him a taste of rum too noddall was certainly doing his best he eased his shoulders and winced every bone and fibre seemed to ache as if hehad been in actual battle he studied the weary figures who were moving about the upper deck made curiously ghostlike and unreal by the heavy vapour which rose from sodden planking and clothing alike it had been just that he thought gravely a battle no less than if cannon had been employed for three days and nights they had fought it out their confined world made even smaller by the great roaring expanse of wavecrests their minds blunted by the ceaseless shriek of the wind like him the ship seemed to have had the breath knocked from her now under barely drawing topsails her littered decks steaming once more beneath an empty sky she was thrusting only slowly above her reflection in places paint had been pared away to display wood so bare it could have been the work of a carpenter everywhere men were at work marlin spikes and needles hammers and tackles endeavouring to restore the ship which had carried them through such a frenzy that even mudge had admitted it was one of the bitterest he had endured he came across the deck now his coat steaming gently his jowls almost hidden in white stubble accordin to me reckonin sir weve overreached the benua group by a fair piece when we checks the noon sights ill be appier he squinted upwards towards the flapping pendant which had lost almost half its length in the storm but the winds veered as i thought it might i suggest we old your new course nor noreast until we gets a better fix of our position he blew his nose loudly an id make so bold as to say ow well you andled er sir he puffed out his cheeks a couple o times i thought we was done for bolitho looked away thank you he was thinking of two men less fortunate one had gone during the second night swept away without a sound nobody had seen him go the other had slipped from the larboard cathead where he had been working feverishly to repair chafing lashings around the anchor stock a solitary wavecrest had pulled him from his perch almost casually so that for a while longer he had still imagined he would be saved willing hands had reached out for him but another wave had flung him not outwards but high in the air like a kicking doll before hurling him against the massive anchor with savage force roskilly a bosuns mate had insisted he had heard the mans ribs cave in before he had been dragged screaming into the frothing water alongside including the man who had fallen from aloft that made three dead with some seven others injured broken bones fingers torn raw by bucking sodden canvas skin inflamed by salt by wind and by lines snaking through clutching hands in pitch darkness made up most of the surgeons list herrick strode aft and said im having a new jib bent on now sir the others only fit for patching he took a mug from noddall and cradled it gratefully to his mouth heaven help the poor sailorman bolitho looked at him youd not change it herrick grimaced a few times back there i wondered if id get the choice davy who had the watch joined them by the rail what are our chances of a landfall sir he looked older less assured than he had before the action with the frigate during the storm he had behaved well so perhaps he still believed the only real menace came from a cannons mouth bolitho considered his question that will depend on fixing our position allowing for our drift and the shifting of the wind id say we might sight the islands before nightfall he smiled the effort making him more conscious of the strain he had been under herrick said dourly the damned frog will be laughing at us sitting in harbour under that bloody pirates guns bolitho looked at him thoughtfully the same idea had only left him occasionally and that when he had needed all his thoughts elsewhere to parley with the french captain was one thing to accept that he was serving under muljadis flag meant far more it would be an open admission of failure an acceptance that muljadis sovereignty did exist if conway agreed to the latter every other european power which had trading and protection rights in the indies especially the powerful dutch east india company would see it as englands move to take all the advantages for herself which was exactly what the french would like what should he do if the french captain refused to be moved by conways message patrol up and down outside the islands and draw argus into combat it would be a onesided affair le chaumareys was an old hand in these waters knew every islet and cove where he had once hidden to avoid british frigates in time of war equally he would be well advised to lie at anchor living off the land until undine was made to withdraw he felt his tiredness putting an edge to his anger if only the politicians were here to see what their ideas of world strategy actually represented in flesh and blood in wood and canvas land ho fine on th starboard bow davy rubbed his hands nearer than you thought sir mudge said quickly never he fumbled with his slate and made some rapid calculations theres a small islet some forty miles to the southrd of the benuas sir he peered round until he had discovered midshipman penns diminutive shape by the taffrail aloft with ye mr penn an fetch the big glass for company he eyed him fiercely take a look an make me a sketch just like i taught you he waited until the boy had scampered for the main shrouds and chuckled capn cook ad the right idea sir sketch an describe every damn thing you see timell come when every manowar will ave a complete set o pictures to study he watched penns progress not that somell eed em o course bolitho smiled at herrick better than i had expected well have a man in the chains and begin soundings as we pass this islet of the masters the chart describes some nineteen fathoms hereabouts but id prefer to be certain twenty minutes later penn returned to the deck his brown features sprinkled with sweat he held out his grubby pad and stood back to watch mudges reactions over his shoulder davy said looks like a whale to me mudge eyed him coldly so it does to penn he said fair work it is ow i recalls it his small eyes returned to davy exactly like a great rocky whale the merest pause sir anything there bolitho took a glass and trained it above the gun deck as yet he could see nothing but the same painful glare he wondered momentarily where the storm had gone how it could vanish after showing so much fury bless you no sir mudge beamed at davys discomfort just a fistful o rocks like the tip of some undersea ridge as no doubt it was one time but i suppose it could be used as shelter in a full gale bolitho watched some seamen hauling a new length of hemp along the larboard gangway tired and unshaven perhaps but there was something else too the way they worked together confidently he said we will alter course a point mr davy and take a look at your whale davy hurried to the rail mr penn pipe the hands to the braces herrick watched him smiling easily any reason sir bolitho shrugged more of a feeling he watched the men thronging along the decks where the steamy vapour continued to drift amongst them from forward he saw real smoke as bogle the cook got busy with the first hot meal they would have eaten since the storm had come and gone he saw the yards swinging to the pull of the braces heard the helmsman cry norcast by north sir davy hurried past to consult the binnacle and the set of the sails another pull on the weather mainbrace mr shellabeer he dabbed his streaming face now belay bolitho smiled when davy was irritated he always performed his duties better for some reason he said put another good lookout aloft if you please i want that islet watched until we are up to it he glanced at the suns blinding patterns beyond the gently pitching bowsprit i am going below to shave and to bribe noddall into finding a clean shirt later as he lay back in a chair while allday busied himself with his razor he found time to wonder what he would do if or when he met with arguss captain the hastily heated water the skilful movement of the blade against his skin was making him relax muscle by muscle and he could feel the air from the open stern windows across his bare shoulders like a soothing embrace all around the world the kings captains were going about their affairs fighting scurvy and disease carrying despatches for an admiral or some lonely outpost not marked on any schoolboys map or pondering behind a cabin bulkhead in dread of mutiny or planning some diversion to prevent one fighting maybe with some dissident ruler who had attacked the kings subjects defiled the flag butchered men and women he smiled and some would be like himself a tiny extension to a halfformed plan through the open skylight he heard the lookouts cry deck there ship at anchor close inshore he jumped to his feet seizing the clean shirt and using it to dab away the soap from his chin allday stood aside and grinned admiringly by god captain you must have more wiles than a farmyard cat how did you know there was a ship bolitho was tucking the crumpled shirt inside his breeches magic allday he hurried for the door and then forced himself to wait until midshipman penn appeared in the entrance a ship sir mr davys respects and he believes it may be a schooner thank you mr penn it was all he could do to appear calm i will come up when i have completed dressing my complimmts to the first lieutenant and please ask him to meet me on the quarterdeck he turned and saw allday hiding a smile is something amusing you why no captain allday watched him gravely but i am always ready to see my betters at their affairs bolitho smiled then i hope you learn from it he walked into the passageway and made for the ladder herrick greeted him excitedly a schooner sir the man in the foremast crosstrees is my best lookout and i had a glass sent aloft to him he stared at bolitho with open astonishment it is uncanny bolitho smiled shortly a fair guess if the truth be told but it was a bad storm and when the master suggested this small isle as a place for shelter i began athinking he took penns telescope and trained it towards the bows there was the islet now an uneven blob of greyblue the masthead would be able to see much more where is the wind davy said from the southwest sir bolitho let his mind move accordingly alter course and lay her on the larboard tack he crossed to the binnacle seeing the helmsmen watching him curiously we will steer nor norwest he waited as a bosuns mate dashed to pipe the hands to the braces again then to herrick and davy he added slowly this way we will keep the isle between us and the other vessel and hold our advantage to windrd get the courses on her but keep the tgallants furled for the present herrick understood at once aye sir the less canvas we display the less likely they are to sight us bolitho glanced at mudge who had appeared with fowlar beside the helm you put the thought in my mind i have always wondered why muljadi has good warning of our movements i think we shall soon know his methods he looked at the washedout blue sky above the tapering masts but for the storm we would have approached directly from the eastrd thanks to the weathers rough mood we have gained something for once herrick asked softly what of the admirals instructions sir then he grinned i can see from your expression that you intend to choose your own moment sir bolitho smiled one cannot bargain if one is a beggar i have learned that long since he looked up as with sails cracking and shivering to the new tack undine turned purposefully to larboard the small humped islet moving away from the weather bow as if released from an anchor nor norwest sir full an bye bolitho beckoned to davy get the courses on her now to mudge he called how long by your consideration mudge pouted two hours sir good then once the sails are drawing well we can send both watches for their meal he watched the scurrying figures clawing along the yards others standing below on deck ready to sheet home the great fore and main courses herrick nodded approvingly bit different from when they came aboard sir bolitho found he was desperately hungry i think that applies to most of us he strode to the cabin hatch knowing that the unknown vessel might be harmless or an old wreck long abandoned or one more trick to delay or deceive him noddall watched him warily its salt beef again sir that will be excellent he ignored the amazement on noddalls rodent features and ill take some claret to wash it down he leaned over the sill and stared at the frothing wake below the counter chance luck call it what you will he thought it was all they had and he intended to make good use of it by th mark seventeen the leadsmans cry rose easily above the sounds of flapping canvas as undine her courses again brailed up to the yards glided steadily towards the islet bolitho saw shellabeer touch the leadsmans shoulder and reach out to feel the tallow arming in the bottom of the heavy weight before calling rocky bottom sir bolitho nodded as mudge had described it the small islet was more like an isolated rock pile than part of the seabed prepare to anchor mr herrick he took a glass from penn and moved it slowly over the raggedoutline they were five cables offshore but it was close enough to see that the first smooth impression of a surfaced whale had changed severely the rocks were bluegrey like cornish slate and cut by wind and tide into massive steep gullies as if some giant had hacked the islet into slices apart from a few clumps of gorse or rock flowers it looked bare and unwelcoming but there were plenty of seabirds perched in little clefts or circling busily above the highest point which he estimated to be some three hundred feet above the water he heard herrick shouting his orders the creak of rigging as undine dipped and rose again in a sudden swell the water looked deep but it was an illusion he could see some narrow stony beaches at the foot of the nearest cliff and guessed that the safest anchorage was on the opposite side where the other vessel lay hidden there was surf too steep and angry as it licked and spluttered around the one visible landing place helm alee he moved his glass in time with the ship as she turned easily into the wind watching for any sign of life the merest movement to show their approach had been seen let go anchor the sound of the anchor hitting the water seemed unusually loud and he imagined he could hear it echoing back from those desolate cliffs herrick shouted lively lads secure those lines to davy he added lowering parties man the tackles bolitho said have the leadsman watch his line now and see that the anchor is holding fast if we begin to drag because of the rocky bottom we will veer more cable directly aye sir herrick hurried away his face totally absorbed in his own duties with the ship swaying and pulling lazily to her cable it was even quieter and bolitho saw some of the birds quitting their precarious perches to flyand circle above the mastheads herrick returned breathing heavily we seem safe enough sir but ive told the anchorwatch to keep alert he squinted towards the shore it looks like a graveyard we will need two boats bolitho spoke his thoughts aloud gig and cutter will suffice they will have to run smartly through that surf the beach is steep by the look of it so put a good coxn in the cutter he saw allday signalling with his fist as the gig rose jerkily from its chocks the guyropes tautening to swing it round and above the gangway he added with a smile i think my boat is in safe hands herrick looked at him anxiously areyou going sir it is not for want of glory thomas he lowered his voice watching the chosen hands as they mustered by the arms chests but i need to know what we are against if anything herrick sounded unconvinced but if the other craft is one of the pirates sir what then surely youll want to sweep round and rake the devil as he slips his cable no he shook his head firmly he will be safely anchored yonder in shallower water than id dare enter close enough to rake him once clear he could lead us a merry maypole dance and i fear we would never match his agility in these conditions his tone hardened besides which i want to take himv boats lowered alongside sir davy came aft a curved hanger dangling from his belt bolitho touched his own swordhilt and saw captain bellairs watching the boats with visible irritation at being left behind he called captain bellairs i would be obliged if i could have three of your very best sharpshooters in each boat bellairs brightened considerably and snapped at sergeant coaker well lively sarnt although they should all be excellent marksmen what herrick grinned that was thoughtful sir perhaps bolitho shifted the glass again to watch some birds landing delicately along the clifftop they would never do that if men were close by but if seamen are better at scaling cliffs there is no beating a wellaimed ball at the right moment he nodded to davy man your boats to herrick he added casually if things go wrong you will find the admirals orders in my cabin you can rely on me sir herrick was looking troubled again but im certain that bolitho touched his arm and smiled yes but just bear it in mind if you have to act upon them asyou see fit he walked slowly towards the entry port seeing the watching seamen and marines as he passed familiar now he could put a name and a value on all of them midshipman armitage was looking confused and embarrassed sir the sharpshooters will not remove their coats sir he blushed as some of the oarsmen in the boats nudged each other and chuckled bellairs snapped cant have my fellows tramping about like damn vagrants what he saw bolitho and added quickly i mean can we sir bolitho slipped out of his blue coat and tossed it to noddall who was hovering by the quarterdeck ladder it is all right he nodded to the unsmiling marines if ii can shed a little authority i am certain your men can he saw the sergeant gathering up the red coats and shakos honour apparently restored he added and it will be a rough climb with who knows what at the end of it he paused above the swaying boats trying to think of some thing he might have missed or forgotten herrick said quietly good luck sir bolitho ran his glance along the crowded gangway and up to the men in the shrouds and you thomas have the people standto watch and watch about you know what to do he saw armitage staggering between the oarsmen in the gig it was almost cruel to take him a liability but he had to begin somewhere it was a marvel he had ever got to sea at all with a mother like his if keen had been here he would have taken him he saw penn peering wistfully from the gun deck he would have gone with the boats like a shot he smiled to himself no wonder the seamen called him the tiger then he climbed down into the gig no ceremony this time as the boats shoved away from the side he was conscious of sudden tension take the lead allday he watched the rocky cliffs rising higher and higher with each pull of the oars and could feel the strong undertow as the inshore swell frothed and mounted into seething lines of breakers when he glanced astern he saw the cutters stem lifting and plunging through the flashing spray davys head and shoulders swaying above the oarsmen while he too peered at the land what was he thinking about being killed in this godforsaken place taking a step nearer that badly needed prizemoney bolitho wiped the spray from his face and concentrated on the swift approach there was more chance of being drowned than of anything in the immediate future he glanced at allday who was standing in a half crouch one fist gripping the tillerbar as he peered from bow to bow gauging the set of the angry surf the diagonal lines of breakers as they hurried noisily into the shadows below the cliffs no need to warn him any suggestion at all might have the opposite effect and bring disaster allday remarked very steep beach captain his sturdy figure swayed with the hull go in fast put her bow round at the last moment twards the surf and beach her broadsideto he glanced down at him quickly does that sound fair captain bolitho smiled very fair it would also give them time to scramble ashore and help the cutter as she followed them in he felt a sudden chill and realised that the shadows had finally reached out to cover them and he heard the slap of water the creak of oars in rowlocks echoing back from the cliffs as if there was a third and invisible boat nearby they almost planed across the last of the surf the oars desperately keeping with the stroke until allday yelled now and as he slammed the tiller hard round he added backwater to larboard floundering and tilting dangerously the gig came to the beach almost broadside the keel grinding across loose pebbles and weed in a violent protesting shudder but men were already leaping into the spray holding the gunwale guiding the gig to safety with sheer brutestrength clear the boat allday steadied bolithos arm as with armitage and the others he waded reeled and finally walked on to firm beach bolitho ran to the foot of the cliffs leaving allday to supervise the business of getting the gig safely secured he waved his arm towards the three marines spread out see if you can find a way to the top v this they understood and with barely a glance towards the onrushing cutter they loped up the first crumbling rockslide their muskets primed and held ready bolitho waited staring up at the jagged clifftop the pale blue sky above no heads peering down no sudden fusilade of musket balls he breathed moreevenly and turned to watch the cutter as it edged round and plunged wildly before driving on to the beach and amongst the waiting seamen davy staggered towards him gasping for breath but loading his pistol with remarkably steady fingers bolitho said muster the men and send your three marines after the others he looked for armitage but he was nowhere to be seen in gods name davy grinned as the midshipman came round a large boulder buttoning his breeches bolitho said harshly if you must relieve yourself at such times mr armitage i would be obliged if you would remain in sight armitage hung his head ssorry sir bolitho relented it would be safer for you and i will try and hide any embarrassment you might cause me allday crunched over the loose shingle chuckling as he too loaded a brace of pistols with fresh dry powder bless me mr armitage but i can understand how you feel p the youth stared at him unhappily you can why once i was hiding in a loft he winked at the cutters coxswain from the bloody pressgang believe it or not and all i could think of was pumping my bilges bolitho said to davy that seems to have helped his mind a little he forgot armitages troubles and said well leave four hands with the boats he saw undine swaying like a beautiful model her sterq windows flashing in the sunlight and imagined herrick watch ing their progress he could send aid to the beached boats i f trouble arrived he looked up at the cliffs again damp clammy deceptively cool that would change as soon as they reached the top and the waiting sun bolitho waited for davy to rejoin him best be moving off he examined his landing party carefully as allday waved them towards the cliffs thirty in all apart from davy anti armitage he had brought a masters mate named carwithen knowing the man would have resented being left behind after fowlars previous involvements a dark unsmiling man he was like bolitho a cornishman and hailed from the fishing village of looe he waited while they checked their weapons his chain of command ship or shore it made no difference to them carwithen said i hope theyve a drop to drink when we get tother side bolitho noticed that hardly anybody smiled at his remark carwithen was known as a hard man given to physical vio lence if challenged good at his work according to the master but little beyond it how different from fowlar bolithc thought lead your party to the left mr davy but allow the marine to set the pace he looked at armitage you keep with me he saw a marine waving from a high ledge indicating tht path up the first section of cliff it was strange how sailors always hated the actual moment of leaving the sea behind like having a line attached to your belt dragging you back bolitho eased the sword further around his hip and reached out for the nearest handhold smoothed away by timeless weather stained with dropping from a million seabirds no wonder ships avoided the place as he moved carefully up the fallen boulders he felt a small pressure against his thigh the watch she had given him ir madras he thought suddenly of that moment when she hay offered him far more and he had taken it without even smallest hesitation how soft how alive she had felt in hip arms he grimaced as his fingers slipped in a pile of fresh droppings and how quickly circumstances could change he thought grimly the passage across the small islet was to prove harder and more exhausting than anyone could have expected from the moment they topped the first cliff and the sun engulfed them in its searing glare they realised they must climb immediately into a treacherous gully before they could begin scaling the next part and so it went on until they were finally tramping across an almost circular depression which bolitho guessed was the central part of the islet it held the heat and shielded them from any seabreeze and their progress was further delayed by the clinging carpet of filth which covered the depression from side to side allday gasped will we rest up once we get to the far side captain like the others his legs and arms were caked with muck and his face masked in a fine film of dust i am as dry as a hangmans eye bolitho refrained from looking at his watch again he could tell from the suns angle that it was late afternoon it was taking too long he peered across to the other side of the unsheltered depression seeing davys straggling line of men the marine sharpshooters walking like hunters through a cloud of pale dust their muskets over their shoulders he replied yes but we must go carefully with the water ration it was like being on top of the world the curving sides of the depression hiding everything but the sun and open sky one of the long slanting shadows behind him faltered and then sprawled in the inchesdeep bird droppings and without turning he knew it was armitage he heard a seaman say hoarsely give us yer and gawd you do look a sight beggin yer pardon sir poor armitage bolitho kept his gaze fixed on the pale breeches of the marine directly ahead of him his body smoking in haze and dust there were rocks beyond the marine probably marking the end of the depression they could take a rest find brief shelter while they regained their senses he turned and sought out the seaman who had helped armitage to his feet can you raise the breath to carry a message to the scouts ahead lincoln the man bobbed his head small and wiry his face was disfigured by a terrible scar from some past battle or in a tavern brawl a surgeon had made a bad job of it and his mouth was drawn up at one side in a permanent lopsided grin aye sir the man shaded his eyes tell them to halt at those rocks he saw lincoln hurry ahead of the column his tattered trousers flapping and stirring up more choking dust it took another hour to reach those rocks and bolitho had the impression he was taking two paces backwards for every one he advanced davys party arrived amongst the tall rocks almost at the same time and while the men threw themselves down into the small patches of shade gasping and wheezing like sick animals bolitho called the lieutenant aside and said we will take a look he saw davy nod wearily his hair bleached so much that it was like corn in the sunlight they found a marine on the far side of the rocks his eyes slitted with professional interest as he stared at the gently sloping hillside which continued without a break towards the sea and there cradled inside the narrowest sweep of the islet the whales tail was the schooner she was so close inshore that for an instant longer bolitho imagined she had been driven aground in the storm then he saw the drifting smoke from a fire on the beach heard the muffled tap of hammers and guessed her crew were carrying out repairs they might even have had the schooner careened to put right some damage to her bilge or keel but at first glance she looked well enough now tiny figures moved about her deck and there were several more on the beach and scattered amongst the rocks the heaviest part of their work was apparently completed davy said theyre looking in rock pools sir after shellfish or the like bolitho asked how many dyou reckon davy frowned two dozen at a guess bolitho fell silent it was a long way down the hillside and no cover at all his own men would be seen long before they could get to grips he bit his lip wondering if the schooner intended to wait another day or longer carwithen had joined them and said hoarsely theym not ready to quit yet sir he was whispering as if the schooners crew were a few feet away theyve got their boats hauled well up the beach davy shrugged i expect they feel very safe bolitho took a small glass and trained it carefully between the rocks one false move and the sunlight would throw a reflection from the telescope which would be seen for miles a lookout there must be at least one on the shore a man so placed that he could watch over the tiny cove and see everything but the far side of the island where undine now lay at anchor he smiled grimly it was hardly surprising they had found no sentries when they had landed when he thought of their exhausting trek from the beach he stiffened seeing a small movement on a ridge almost in line with the motionless schooner he adjusted the glass very slowly a white floppy hat the darker blob of a face underneath theres a lookout on that ridge the one with the rock pools directly below it carwithen said easy from the sea no but i could take him from behind with no trouble at all he sounded brutally eager the crash of a shot made them crouch lower while from behind bolitho heard the sudden clatter of weapons as his men dived for cover something white and flapping fell from the sky and lay quite still on the beach the searching sailors from the schooner paid very little attention as one of their number walked over to it and picked it up carwithen said one of ems shot a booby they make fair eatin if youve nothin better the marine said then e must be a bloody good shot sir bolitho looked at him his own thought exactly it would make a frontal assault virtually fatal for all of them he said ill send a message back to the ship we must wait until dark to the marine he added take this glass but keep it well shielded no need to add a warning or a threat the marine had just proved he could think as well as shoot they found the others relaxed again amidst the rocks and allday said take a drink captain he held out a flask tastes like bilge water bolitho scribbled on his pad and handed it to one of the seamen take it back to the beach and give it to the petty officer there he saw the despair on his face and added gently you need not return you will have earned a rest by the time you reach undine he heard another shot muffled this time by the rocks but it was followed by a different sound a soft thud carwithen was on his feet in a second nother bird sir bolitho followed him to where they had left the marine he was staring with amazement at the big booby which had dropped almost at his feet wings outspread its breast clotted with bright blood davy said harshly now how in the name of hell did but bolitho held up his hand freezing them all to silence faintly at first and then more insistently he heard the scrape and clatter of loose stones as someone hurried up the hillside to collect the dead seabird he looked round swiftly you could not hide thirty men amongst these few rocks he saw allday signalling everyone to remain quite still saw the anxiety in armitages eyes as he stared transfixed at the last barrier where the seas edge shone against the sky and rocks like the top of a great dam the sounds were much louder and bolitho could hear the mans heavy gasps as he struggled up the last part of the hill nobody moved and he saw the marine staring at his musket which was two feet away from his fingers the slightest sound and they were done for it was then carwithen acted he was closest to the rock barrier and with barely a sound he reached out and gathered up the dead bird holding it just a few inches below the top of the nearest rock his free hand he held under his short blue coat and bolitho could see his fingers moving beneath the cloth trying to free something while all the time his eyes were fixed unblinkingly on the bird it seemed to take an eternity before anything else happened when it did it was all too fast to follow the mans dark face gaping down at them his eyes flicking from the bird to carwithen even as he groped forward to retrieve his prize the masters mate dropped the booby the movement so swift that the man was thrown off balance his hand groping at his belt and the gleaming butt of a pistol carwithen murmured not so my pretty one it was said quietly almost gently then the other hand came out of his coat a boarding axe twisting in his fingers as he brought the rearmost end with its short savage barb hard down in the mans neck with a great heave he gaffed him bodily over the rocks withdrawing the axe turning it again just as swiftly before hacking him full across the throat with its blade armitage fell against the marine whimpering and retching blood spurting over his legs as the axe jerked free hesitated and cut down again bolitho seized carwithens arm seeing the axe quivering above the bulging eyes and that great gaping wound he could feel the pentup hatred and madness in his biceps the effort to shake him away and drive the axe again and again into the choking bubbling thing at his feet easy enough damn you there was another terrible silence while they stared at each other or at the corpse which was sprawled across the dead booby carwithen whispered hoarsely that buggerll never raise hell again bolitho forced himself to examine the victim probably javanese dressed in little better than rags but the pistol was inscribed with the crest of the east india company he heard carwithen say took it off some poor sailor the bastard nobody looked at him bolitho knelt by the rocks and studied the beach with the glass carwithen had acted quickly and efficiently but he had enjoyed it relished it he watched the distant lookout in his rocky ledge the small figures still searching aimlessly amongst the pools he said quietly they saw nothing davy looked at the sobbing midshipman and asked quietlywill this change things for us sir bolitho shook his head only when this man is missed by his companions he looked at the slanting shadows from the rocks so we must bide our time and hope for darkness to come he saw carwithen wiping his boardingaxe on some cloth he had just cut from the dead mans smock his face was devoid of anything but satisfaction davy gestured to the others take this thing away and cover it with stones he swallowed hard ill not forget this day in a hurry bolitho gripped the midshipmans shoulder and pulled him away from the rocks listen mr armitage he shook him roughly seeing the youths eyes as he stared at the red smudge left by the corpse get a grip on yourself i know it was a foul thing to witness but you are not here today as a mere onlooker dyou understand he shook him again hating to see the pain and the revulsion in his eyes you are one of my officers and our people will have to look to you armitage nodded dazedly yyes sir ill try to he retched again bolitho added gently im sure you will he saw allday watching him over the midshipmans quivering shoulders the almost imperceptible shake of his head now be off with you and check that my message has been sent allday said quietly poor lad hell never get used to this sort of thing bolitho looked at him gravely did you did i allday shrugged we learned to hide what we thought captain its all a man can do perhaps he saw davy kicking dust across the drying blood then he looked at carwithens dark features as he examined the dead mans pistol although there are some who have no feelings at all and i have always found them to be less than men allday followed him back into the shade bolithos mood would soon change at a hint of action and for the present it was best to leave him to his thoughts the bristol sailmaker time to move is it sir davy watched bolitho as he craned over the rocks his shirt pale against the darkening sky i believe so tell carwithen to muster the hands he shivered as the seabreeze explored his body once the sun had dipped over the hills at his back it grew cool even cold in minutes they had been too long in the heat plagued by sun and thirst and a multitude of flies which had appeared as if by magic he watched the anchored schooners outline the soft glow of lights from poop and forepeak the fire on the beach had died to a blotch of red embers and he could see nobody near it but guessed the lookout was still in his refuge beyond the pools allday whispered all ready captain he held his cutlass clear of the rocks mr davys making sure they all know what to do bolitho nodded without answering trying to gauge the distance they must cover surprisingly it seemed greater in the growing darkness but he was reassured by the occasional snatches of voices from the vessel to show they had given no heed to their missing comrade davy slithered down beside him ive sent carwithens party away sir he looked at the sky the isolated puffs of light cloud winds steady enough yes bolitho checked his pistol and tightened his belt follow me single file like ghosts they topped the last rock barrier the sounds of loose stones and rubble seemingly very loud in the gloom but as davy had observed the wind held steady and was making a lively chop along the beach and narrow spur of headland noisy enough to drown any small sound they might be making once as they followed the curve of the hillside they all froze in their tracks as two dozing seabirds rose flapping and screaming almost from under their feet bolitho waited listening to his heart to the sharp breathing of the men at his back nothing he lifted his arm and they began to move forward and downwards again when he looked across his shoulder he saw the rough edge of the rock barrier where they had waited fretting for sunset far above his slowmoving party they were almost down to beach level now and he heard a man curse quietly as he slipped in the first of the small pools davys party were having to wade in the shallows to his right and he hoped none of them would fall headlong into one of the rock pools there now hidden by the rising tide he thought momentarily of the ship anchored on the other side of the islet the familiar sounds and smells herrick waiting anxiously for news of success or disaster if it was to be the latter he could do nothing to help this time his would be the task of contacting the enemy and making what he could of it it was easier to think of them as the enemy it never helped to picture them as men flesh and bone like himself allday touched his arm urgently boat coming inshore captain bolitho held up his hand and brought both parties to a shuffling silence the boat must have come around the schooners hidden side he could see the splash of oars the lively froth of the stem as it bounced across the first leaping surf he thought of carwithen and his handful of men who were creeping up and around the solitary lookout they should have been there by now he recalled carwithens brutal madness with the boarding axe and wondered if he had been the one to strike the luckless lookout down a voice echoed suddenly in the darkness and for an instant bolitho imagined carwithen had been delayed or that the lookout was calling an alarm but the voice came from the boat louder this time and despite the strange tongue bolitho knew the man was calling a question or a name perhaps allday said theyve come alooking for their mate captain he dropped to one knee to keep the grounding boat framed against the surf six of em bolitho said quietly stand fast lads let them come to us he heard a man clicking his jaws together tense nervous probably terrified in these unfamiliar surroundings allday said one of ems going up the cliff to the lookout bolitho drew his sword very carefully of course it would be the first place a searcher would go ask if the missing man had been seen he watched the other five strolling up the beach swinging their weapons casually chatting as they approached bolitho glanced behind him his men were barely visible as they crouched or knelt amongst fallen rocks or squatted in the sea itself he turned to study the oncoming shadows twenty yards fifteen surely one would see them soon a terrible cry tore the stillness apart hanging above the ridge long after the man had died bolitho saw the five shadows turn in confusion knew the dying scream must have been the man sent to the lookout lie yelled at em lads without a shout or a cheer they were all up and rushing after the five figures who had turned back towards the surf one of them slipped and fell headlong tried to rise but was slashed into a sobbing heap by a seamans cutlass as he dashed past the others had reached the boat but deprived of two of their strength were unable to shift it steel gleamed in the shadows and as the seamen charged amongst them the fight became confused and deadly a seaman caught his foot in the boatrope and before he could recover his balance was pinned bodily to the shingle by a long sword his killer died almost simultaneously the remaining two threw down their weapons and were instantly clubbed into unmoving heaps by the maddened sailors davy snapped tersely one of ours is dead sir he rolled the man over on to his back and dragged the cutlass from his fingers bolitho eased the sword back into its scabbard his legs felt shaky from running from nervous tension he looked at the anchored schooner no shouts no calls to arms he thought he heard the same singsong voice chanting above the seething surf remote and vaguely sad davy said hoarsely damned poor lookout sir bolitho watched his men gathering around the two boats the one which had been there all day was furthest up the shingle and would need the more men to move it he replied wouldyou have expected trouble in their place davy shrugged i suppose not carwithen came hurrying down from the ridge his helpers hard put to keep up with him he said savagely that bloody fool lincoln was too slow with his dirk he glared at the watching men around him ill see to him later bolitho said boats in the water he sought out the six marines you take the second one you know what to do one the man who had first sighted the schooner grunted we knows sir we holds the boat where we can see the poop an pin down anyone who tries to pass the lanterns there bolitho smiled captain bellairs was right about you allday whispered this way captain he felt the surf engulfing his legs and waist the boats scarred planking as allday reached down to drag him over the gunwale shove off bolitho restrained the urge to watch the frantic oars the efforts to steer the boat clear of the surf just one blast of canister would be enough to nip his flimsy plan in the bud the boat lifted and then surged heavily forward the blades taking control as the hull freed itself from the strong undertow bolitho saw the schooners tall masts rising to greet him the tracery of rigging and shrouds almost lost against the sky allday stood straddlelegged and wary the tiller bar held lightly in his fingertips easy all he craned forward as if to impress them more bowman ready astern bolitho heard the regular splash of oars as the other boat pulled hastily towards the schooners bows allday said quickly its now or never captain his teeth were bared with concentration so that some men in the forward part of the boat thought he was smiling bolitho stood up beside him and reached out to fend off the overhanging quarter as like a moving object it loomed right above the boat now there was a yell and a quick clatter as the bowman hurled his grapnelup and over the bulwark with a jerking grinding crash the boat came alongside some men falling in confusion while others climbed eagerly over their sprawled bodies and entangled oars as if using a living bridge to reach the vessels main deck figures were already dashing from the forecastle but as a man ran wildly from aft there was a muffled bang the wellaimed musket ball hurling him round like an insane dancer his agony clearly silhouetted against the poop lanterns bolitho felt rather than saw a figure coming at him from the scuppers something hissed above his head even as he ducked round and struck for his attacker with his sword the swaying figure backed and came on again and bolitho realised he was holding a huge axe swinging it from side to side as he advanced carwithen exclaimed a plague on that bastard and fired his pistol full in the mans face to bolitho he snarled thatll teach him another of the crew had climbed frantically into the foremast shrouds and was being pursued by a yelling seaman once again a musket stabbed the darkness from the other boat and with a faint cry the man fell headlong to the deck where he was promptly despatched by a waiting cutlass allday yelled most of em have gone below captain he ran to a hatchway and fired his pistol into it the fights gone out of em now im thinking bolitho peered aft at the poop lanterns call the other boat to give assistance it was suddenly very quiet on the schooners deck and as bolitho walked slowly towards the small cabin hatch just forward of the wheel he was conscious of his own footsteps and the feeling the fight was not yet over he moved warily around the outstretched corpse which had been the first to fall to a marine sharpshooter its face shining in the lantern light the lower jaw broken away as if by an axe stroke allday said stand aside captain but a seaman was already clambering over the hatch coaming his face suddenly screwing up in terrible agony as a pistol exploded beneath him a shadow darted through the pluming smoke and bolitho saw it was the scarfaced seaman called lincoln his eyes like stones as he allowed his lean body to drop straight through the hatch using his dead companion to cushion the fall his feet thudded into the corpse and as he turned he whipped a knife from between his teeth hitting out twice in the darkness the second blow bringing a scream of pain more men were swarming down after him and bolitho yelled bring a lantern drag those men clear feet pounded over the planking and he heard armitage calling anxiously from the boat alongside carwithen was already down on the cabin deck knocking a seaman aside even as he made to finish the wounded pirate with his dirk bolitho paused on the ladder searching for davy his mind still able to grapple with the realisation that allday had saved his life but for his warning he and not that poor seaman would be lying there dead mr davy hoist both boats inboard once you have secured our prisoners aye aye sir he sounded jubilant and mount a guard on them i want no fanatic opening the bilges to the sea before we can even make sail he followed allday down the ladder the seanoises suddenly muffled and lost a seaman kicked open the cabin door and darted inside with a levelled pistol nothin zur he swung round as a shadow moved beyond an upended chair belay that zur theres another rascal ere ill get im for ee then he fell back in horror by jesus zur es one of us bolitho stepped into the cabin ducking low between the deckhead beams he could appreciate the seamans shocked surprise it was a small cringing wreck of a man he was on his knees fingers interlocked as in prayer while he swayed back and forth in time to the ships motion bolitho sheathed his sword stepping between the quivering creature and his fierceeyedseaman who are you he made to move closer and the man threw himself bodily at his feet have mercy captain i done nothin sir im just an honest sailorman sir he gripped bolithos shoes and when he reached down to pull him to his feet bolitho saw with horror that every nail had been torn from his fingers allday said harshly on your feet you are speaking to a kings officerv easy bolitho held up his hand look at him he has suffered enough a seaman dropped his cutlass and lifted the man into a chair oill get im a drink capn he dragged open a cupboard and gaped as the little man screamed wildly dont touch ell flay you alive if you dare lay yet ooks on it bolitho asked who will then he seemed to realise what was happening that it was not part of another in a whole procession of living nightmares he stated at bolithos grave features tears running unheeded down his sunken cheeks mu jadi carwithen muttered what here the creature peered around bolitho his terrified eyes search ing the crowded passageway the dead seaman below the hatch there is son bolitho turned swiftly and stooped above the man brought down by lincolns knife of course he should have seen it instead of congratulating himself on being spared a horrible death the man was still alive although the seamans blade had laid open his neck and shoulder in a great gaping wound must have missed the artery by a whisker and no more he was naked to the waist but his loose trousers now blotchy with his own and the seamans blood were of the finest silk his eyes were tightly shut his chest moving in quick uneven thrusts carwithen said let me finish the bastard sir he was almost pleading bolitho ignored him the man was not aged much more than twenty and around his throat he wore a gold pendant in the form of a prancing beast like the one on muljadis flag it was just possible he snapped bind his wound i want him to live he turned to the ragged figure in the cabin my men will take care of you but first i want the figure edged nearer the door is it really over sir he was shaking violently and close to collapse its not a cruel trick allday said quietly this is captain bolitho matey of his majestys ship undine now tell us who you are the little man sank down to the deck again like a cowed dog i was sailmaker sir in the portuguese barque alvares took on in lisbon when i lost me own ship we was carryin a mixed cargo from java when we was attacked by pirates when was this bolitho spoke carefully very aware of the other mans confusion a year back sir i think he dosed his eyes with the effort we was taken to muljadis anchorage wot there was left of us muljadis men killed most of em only kept me cause i was a sailmaker i tried to escape once didnt know i was bein eld on an island ysee they caught me before id been free an hour put me to torture he was shaking more violently now all of em sat there watchin enjoyin it laughin he lurched to his feet and threw himself towards the door snatching up a cutlass as he screamed pulled out all my nails with pincers an worse the bloody bastards lincoln caught his wrist and turned the cutlass away from the unconscious figure in the passageway easy mate you could cause a mischief with that eh the mans cheerful voice seemed to steady him in some way he turned and looked at bolitho very steadily me names jonathan potter once of bristol bolitho nodded gravely well jonathan potter you can be of great service to me it will not bring back your friends but it may prevent others suffering in the same manner he glanced at allday look after him he walked from the cabin grateful for the clean air which greeted him on deck the sense of purpose as davys men prepared to get under way potter had probably been the only englishman aboard the portuguese barque for that and no other reason had his life been spared kept like a slave a downtrodden creature less than a man from what he had heard of muljadi it seemed a far more truthful reason davy crossed to his side i am about ready to weigh sir he paused sensing bolithos mood that poor devil must have suffered terribly sir he is scars and scabs from head to toe little more than bones bolitho studied his pale outline thoughtfully something kept him alive mr davy fear of death a need for revenge i know not which he grasped a stay as the deck swayed restlessly in the swell but whatever it was i intend to use it to good purpose and the schooners master sir if he is really muljadis son we have a catch indeed but either way i want him kept alive so pass the word to that effect he thought of carwithens eyes to all hands he peered abeam at the small islet where so much had happened the craggy distortions were lost in deep shadow it was a whale once again we will run to the soueast directly and gain searoom i am not yet acquainted with these waters by dawn we should be able to come about and make contact with undine he looked at the men hurrying about the schooners deck shes a fine little prize davy stared at him and then at the vessel the realisation coming to him apparently for the first time i see sir a prize he nodded happily worth a good price ill be bound bolitho walked to the opposite side i thought that might interest you mr davy he added now have the capstan manned and break out the anchor while the wind holds he thought of herrick we are no longer beggars davy shook his head not understanding then he looked at the helmsman and at the others gathering at the capstan bars and grinned broadly a prize at last perhaps the first of many noddall hovered by the cabin table and bobbed his head with satisfaction as bolitho pushed his empty plate aside more like it sir a man works the fairer on a full belly bolitho leaned back in his chair and let his eyes move slowly around the cabin it felt good to be back aboard undine and with something to show for their efforts the lantern above the table seemed much dimmer and when he glanced through the stern windows he saw that dawn had already given way to an empty sky the horizon slanting across the thick saltstained glass like a thread of gold in the captured schooner he had rejoined undine at almost the same hour as this the previous day the strain and tension of their short bitter fight lost momentarily in the cheers from the watching seamen and marines herrick had been almost beside himself with pleasure and had insisted that bolitho should go to his cabin without delay and rest the schooner had once been under the flag of the dutch east india company although it was impossible to tell how long she had been in the pirates hands but from her filthy condition and disorder between decks it seemed likely it had been a considerable while since dutch sailors had manned her he let his mind drift as he listened to bare feet padding overhead the sluice of water and the clank of a pump as the decks were washed down for another day noddall was right he had eaten a good breakfast thinly sliced fat pork fried pale brown with biscuit crumbs always his favourite helped down with strong coffee and some treacle herrick tapped on the door and entered the cabin winds holding steady from the souwest sir he looked alert and cleareyed bolitho smiled good thomas have some coffee it was always strange how herrick relaxed once there was a set plan to perform if he really guessed how hazy it was in his captains mind he gave no sign mr mudge informs me that we are logging some ten knots sir herrick took a mug from the servant and grinned hes up there beaming away as if hes just won a fortune at the tables bolitho frowned that means we should make a landfall at any time now if yesterdays wind had been more than a snails pace we could have been there now he spread his arms feeling the touch of a clean shirt against his chest and back but there was plenty to do herrick smiled mr davys well on his way to pendang bay by now bolitho replied aye hell be feeling like a postcaptain if im not mistaken when he had put davy in charge of the schooner and had sent him back to conway he had seen his face come alight as if from within he must have looked like that himself once he thought he had been put in charge of a prize when he had been a lieutenant far younger than davy the first step to real command was said to be the greatest so perhaps it would work for davy too he looked up at the open skylight as a voice pealed deck there land on the lee bow bolitho smiled feeling the chill on his spine if the argus is elsewhere i will have to think again the door opened slightly and midshipman armitage reported mr soamess respects sir masthead has sighted land on the lee bow bolitho said thank you mr armitage he saw the deep hollows around his eyes the nervous way his fingers twitched against his patched breeches unlike any of the others who had returned he was unable to hide his real feelings his fear his knowledge that he could no longer contain it my compliments to mr soames tell him we will exercise both watches at gun drill in half an hour he hesitated and added if there is anything troubling you it would be as well to confide in the first lieutenant here or myself if you feel it might help armitage shook his head nno sir i am better now he hurried away bolitho looked at his friend and asked quietly what are we to do about that one herrick shrugged you cannot carry them all sir he may get over it weve all had to go through it at one time or another now then thomas that does not sound like you at all he smiled broadly admit you are concerned for the lad herrick looked embarrassed well i was thinking of having a word with him i thought as much thomas you havent the right face for deceit another knock at the door announced the surgeon had arrived well mr whitmarsh bolitho watched him framed in the doorway the early sunlight from the cabinn hatch making a halo around his huge head is our prisoner worse whitmarsh moved through the cabin like a man in a prison ducking under each beam as if seeking a way of escape he is well enough sir but i still believe as i told you when you returned to the ship that he should have been sent back to the settlement in the schooner bolitho saw herricks jaw tighten and knew he was about to silence the surgeons aggressive outburst like the other officers herrick found it hard to cover his dislike for him whitmarsh was little help in the matter either bolitho said calmly i cannot answer for a prisoner if he is there and we are here surely he watched the beads of sweat trickling down the mans forehead and wondered if he had taken a drink this early it was a wonder it had not killed him already above his head he heard the regular stamp of boots the click of metal as the marines mustered for morning inspection he made himself say you must trust my judgement mr whitmarsh as i do yours in your own profession the surgeon turned and glared at him you are admitting that if youd sent him back to pendang bay he would have been seized and hanged herrick retorted angrily damn your eyes man the fellow is a bloody pirate whitmarsh eyes him fiercely in your opinion no doubt bolitho stood up sharply and walked to the windows you must live in reality mr whitmarsh as a common pirate he would be tried and hanged as well you know but if he is the son of muljadi he is something more than a catspaw he could be used to bargain there is more at stake here more lives in peril than i feared ill not falter because of your personal feelings whitmarsh seized the edge of the table his body hanging over it like a figurehead if youd suffered as i have bolitho turned on him his voice harsh i know about your brother and i am deeply sorry for him but how many felons and murderers have you seen hanging rotting in chains without even a thought he heard someone pause beside the open skylight and lowered his voice humanity i admire hypocrisy i totally reject he saw the fury giving way to pain on the surgeons flushed features so take care of the prisoner if he is to be hanged then so be it but if i can use his life to advantage and in doing so save it then amen to that whitmarsh moved vaguely towards the door and then said thickly and that man potter you brought from the schooner sir you have put him to work already bolitho smiled really mr whitmarsh you do not give up easily potter is with the sailmaker as his assistant he will not be worked to death and i think that keeping busy will be a quicker cure than brooding over his recent sufferings whitmarsh stalked from the cabin muttering under his breath herrick exclaimed what impertinence in your shoes id have laid about him with a belayingpin i doubt that bolitho shook the coffee pot but it was empty but i feel that ill never win his confidence let alone his trust bolitho waited for noddall to bring his dress coat and best cockedhat feeling rather ridiculous as the servant fussed and tugged at cuffs and lapels herrick said bluntly i think its a bad risk sir one ill have to take thomas he saw noddall pull a long strand of hair from one of the buttons her hair he wondered if herrick had noticed he continued we have to trust the french captain all the rest is so much supposition noddall had taken the old sword from its rack on the bulkhead but held it across his arm knowing by now it was more than his life was worth to usurp alldays ritual bolitho thought of whitmarshs anger and knew that much of it had good foundation had the prisoner been sent back in the schooner he would doubtlessly have been taken by puigserver if he was still at the settlement or held in irons until he could be sent to the nearest spanish authority then if he was lucky he would certainly be hanged if not his fate hardly bore thinking about like father like son as it was the schooners surviving crewmen a savagelooking collection of halfcastes javanese and indians would meet a swift fate before much longer how many lives had they taken he wondered how many ships plundered crews murdered or broken into husks like potter the bristol sailmaker the bargain was probably onesided he walked from the cabin still pondering the rights and wrongs of instant justice on deck it was remaining fresh the days heat yet to come and he took a few paces along the weather side while there was still time in the heavy dress coat he would be dripping unless he held to the sails curved shadows fowlar touched his forehead and said awkwardly may i thank you sir bolitho smiled you have earned it mr fowlar have no fear he had made the masters mate an actinglieutenant to fill the gap left by davy had young keen been aboard it would have been his chance another would be put in fowlars place and so it went on as in all ships herrick took fowlar aside and waited until bolitho was pacing again a word of warning never interrupt the captain when he is taking his walks he smiled at fowlars uncertainty unless in real emergency of course which does not include your promotion he touched his shirt but congratulations all the same bolitho had already forgotten them he had seen the dark smudge of land which just topped the glittering horizon and was wondering what he might find there it looked at this distance like one great spread of land but he knew it consisted of a crowded collection of islets some even smaller than the one where they had captured davys schooner the dutch had originally occupied them because of their shape and position ships anchored amidst the surrounding islets would have the advantage of using any wind to put to sea the use of several channels to avoid delay the fortress had been built to protect the place from marauders such as the one who now commanded it and challenged all authority and every flag the dutch still listed the benuas as one of their possessions but it was in name only and they were no doubt glad to be rid of it and its unhappy history he saw the sailmaker speaking with potter below the forecastle and wondered if he would ever really recover from his suffering it could not be easy for him to be drawing so near to muljadis stronghold again but of all the people aboard he was the only man apart from the prisoner who had seen what lay beyond the protective reefs and sandbars where he had endured so much he shivered slightly in spite of his heavy coat suppose he had misjudged his opponents he too might become another potter a pitiful broken thing which even his friends and his sisters in england might wish to think of as dead and viola raymond how long would she take to forget him he shook himself out of his mood and said mr soames you may beat to quarters and clear for action now he saw the ripple of excitement run through the men on the gun deck exercise the larboard battery first allday walked up the slanting deck and turned the sword over in his hands before buckling it to bolithos belt youll be taking me of course captain he spoke calmly but bolitho saw the anxiety in his eyes not this time calls shrilled along the berth deck and the marine drummer boys ran breathlessly to the quarterdeck rail pulling their sticks from their white crossbelts to begin their urgent tattoo allday said stubbornly but youll be needing me captain yes bolitho looked at him gravely i will always do that the rest of his words were lost in the rattle of drums the stampede of feet as the undines people ran to quarters once again face to face bolitho levelled his telescope across the hammock nettings and studied the overlapping islets in silence all morning and into the forenoon watch while undine had cruised steadily towards them he had noted each unusual feature and had compared his findings with what he already knew the main channel through the islets opened to the south and almost in the centre of the approach was one stark hump of rock upon which stood the old stone fortress even now with the nearest spurs of land less than two miles distant it was impossible to see where the fortress began or the craggy hilltop ended we will alter course again mr herrick he lowered the glass and dabbed his eye with his wrist steer east noreast he saw the men by the larboard twelvepounders peering through their open ports the guns already shimmering in the sunlight as if they had just been fired herrick shouted hands to the braces alter course two points to larboard mr mudge bolitho sought out the frail figure of potter amongst the unemployed hands below the forecastle and when he glanced up beckoned him aft he slipped out of his heavy coat and handed it with his hat to allday saying as calmly as he could i will go aloft myself allday said nothing he knew bolitho well enough to understand what it was costing him potter hurried on to the quarterdeck and knuckled his forehead sir dyou think you could climb to the maintop with me potter stared at him dully if you says so sir herrick called east noteast sir he looked from bolitho to the mainyard stretching athwartships and vibrating to the great press of canvas below it bolitho unbuckled his sword and gave it to allday i may need your eyes today potter feeling every man watching him he swung out on to the weather shrouds and began to climb his fingers locking so tightly around each ratline that the pain helped to steady him up and up with his gaze fixed on the futtock shrouds which leaned out and around the sturdy maintop where two marines were studying his progress with unblinking curiosity bolitho gritted his teeth and fought the urge to look down it was infuriating unfair he had first gone to sea at the age of twelve year by year he had studied and matured had replaced his childs infatuation for the navy with a genuine understanding which had amounted almost to love he had overcome seasickness and had learned to hide his loneliness and grief from his companions when his mother had died while he had been at sea so too his father was buried while bolitho had been fighting frenchman and american in and around the caribbean he had watched men suffer horribly in battle and his body bore enough scars to show the narrow margin between his own survival and death why then should he be cursed with this hatred of heights he felt his shoes scrabbling on the ratlines as he hauled himself out and around the futtock shrouds his body hanging in space and supported only by fingers and toes a marine said admiringly by god sir that was a fair climb bolitho arrived beside him his chest heaving painfully he watched the marine to see if he was disguising his sarcasm but saw it was the same sharpshooter who had discovered the anchored schooner just two days back he nodded and allowed himself a glance at the ship far below foreshortened bodies moved about the quarterdeck and when he looked forward he saw the leadsman in the chains the blur of his arm as he hurled the heavy weight deftly beyond the bows he relaxed and waited for potter to scramble up beside him for a moment longer he toyed with the idea of forcing himself up the next length of quivering shrouds to the maintopsail yard but rejected it apart from proving something to himself or showing his capability to those who might be watching from below it would serve for little potter was exhausted by the climb and if herrick needed him urgently on deck he would look even more foolish if he fell headlong from his perch he unslung the telescope from his shoulder and trained it on the channel between the islets in the time it had taken him to climb from the deck and regain his wind undine had cruised over a cable and it was possible to see the next overlapping islet behind the central hill with its forbidding fortress and steep sunbaked cliff potter said i never bin to the eastrd side sir theres a good channel there too im told he shuddered they used to bury the corpses in the sandbars at low water what there was left of em bolitho stiffened and momentarily forgot the deck far beneath him he saw the blacker silhouette of a ships masts and yards almost hidden around the curve of the inner channel a frigate potter saw his interest and added dolefully best place to anchor sir the battery on the fortress can protect two channels at once an any craft wot chooses to lay there something pale flapped and broadened against the furthest islet a small boat hoisting its sail bolitho glanced quickly at the foretopmast where herrick had run up a big white flag one way or another they would soon know there was a hollow boom and after what seemed like an age a tall waterspout shot skywards about a cable off the larboard beam he trained the glass quickly towards the fortress but the smoke had already fanned away so it was impossible to gauge the angle of the shot he shifted the glass again and saw the boat moving more quickly around a litter of broken rocks the sail braced back like the fin of a great shark he let out a long breath as he saw a white flag flapping from her masthead his request to parley was accepted the single shot from the battery was a warning bolitho slung the telescope across his shoulder you stay here potter keep an eye on everything and try to remember any item which might be of use it could well save lives one day he nodded casually to the twomarine marksmen i hope youll not be needed he slung a leg over the low barricade and tried not to lower his eyes argus intends us to do all the sweating the men grinned and nudged each other as if he had just given them access to some priceless and vital information bolitho swallowed hard and began to make the journey to the deck when he reached the point where he could see the nettings on the opposite side again he allowed himself to look at the group which awaited him by the bulwark herrick was smiling although whether from relief or amusement it was hard to tell bolitho jumped down to the deck and glanced ruefully at his fresh shirt it was dripping with sweat and bore a black streak of tar across one shoulder he said never mind the coat will hide that in a brisker tone he added a boat is coming out mr herrick heaveto if you please and prepare to anchor he glanced up at the great yards again it had not been quite so bad as he had imagined that time then he thought of the ideal conditions as compared with a screaming gale or making the same climb in pitch darkness and changed his mind bolitho allowed herrick to shout his orders before asking mudge what did you make of that shot the master regarded him dubiously old gun id say sir from where i was standin it sounded like a bronze piece bolitho nodded as i thought too it would be likely that theyd still have the original cannon he rubbed his chin thinking aloud so theyd be loath to use heated shot for fear of splitting them he grinned at mudges mournful expression not that it matters much i daresay if they fired solid rock they could scarcely fail to hit a ship trying to force the channel fowlar shouted the boat has an officer aboard sir he grinned most o the hands are the colour of coffee but hes a frog if ever i saw one bolitho took a glass and watched the oncoming boat locally built with the familiar high prow and lateen sail it was moving fast and well on a converging tack he saw the officer in question standing easily below the mast his cocked hat pulled down over his forehead to shade his eyes from the fierce glare fowlar was right there was no mistaking this one he made himself walk a few paces away from the side as with her courses brailed up and her topsails in booming confusion undine turned noisily into the wind to await her visitors bolitho gripped the rail and watched in silence as the boat surged round and under the main chains where some of undines seamen and mr shellabeer waited to secure her lines and if necessary fend off any risk of collision he said and now mr herrick we shall see he walked along the swaying gangway to the entry port and waited for the officer to scramble aboard he stood quite alone framed against the cruising ranks of small whitecaps his eyes exploring undines gun deck the watching seamen and marines above and below him seeing bolitho he removed his hat with a flourish and gave a small bow lieutenant maurin msieu at your service he bore no marks of rank and his blue coat showed plenty of evidence of patching and repairs he was tanned to the shade of old leather and his eyes were those of a man who had been at sea for most of his life tough selfassured competent it was all there on his face bolitho decided bolitho nodded and i am captain bolitho of his majestys ship undine the lieutenant gave a wry smile my capitaine as been expecting you bolitho glanced briefly at the cockade on maurins hat it bore the small red beast instead of a french insignia he asked and what is your nationality lieutenant the man shrugged i am employed in the service of prince muljadi he shrugged again naturally bolitho gave a wry smile naturally he added sharply i wish to meet your captain and without delay i have certain matters to discuss but of course msieu the lieutenant was looking at the men on deck his eyes were always moving calculating he continued capitaine le chaumareys is prepared forme to remain aboard as ostage to ensure your er good ealth bolitho hid his relief had le chaumareys been killed or replaced he might have had to alter his tactics he said calmly it will not be necessary i have every faith in your captains honour herrick exclaimed but sir you cannot mean it keep him i say your life is too valuable to risk on a frenchmans word bolitho looked at him and smiled if le chaumareys is the callous brute you describe do you imagine he would care about losing a lieutenant if it were to gain him a better bargaining point he touched his arm i have made some notes in my cabin they may help you to pass the time in my absence he touched his hat to the quarterdeck and said to maurin i am ready for a moment longer he stood in the port looking down into the boat alongside there were about a dozen men aboard naked but for a few scraps of rags but armed to the teeth and with the looks of men prepared to kill without question maurin said quietly you will be safe with me msieu he lowered himself swiftly on to the boats gunwale adding for the moment bolitho jumped the last few feet and steadied himself against a crude backstay very conscious of the acrid stench of sweat and filth which floated unheeded in the bilges you choose strange allies lieutenant maurin signalled for the boat to be cast off one hand resting casually on his pistol lie with a dog and you arise with fleas msieu it is quite common bolitho glanced at his profile another herrick perhaps then as the sail billowed and cracked to the wind and the slim hull began to gather way he forgot maurin even the anxious faces on undines quarterdeck as he considered what he was about to do bolitho clung to the backstay as the boat scudded dangerously close to a line of blacktoothed rocks and then went about to enter the main channel he noticed that the current was strong and at odds with the incoming sea and felt the hull leap and stagger as it straightened up for the final leg of the ourney when he looked astern he could see nothing of his own ship she was already hidden by a wedge of land the side of which lay deep in shadow maurin asked suddenly why dyou take such risks msieu bolitho looked at him impassively why do you maurin shrugged i obey orders but soon i will be going ome again to toulon i ave not seen my family for he smiled sadly too long bolitho glanced across the lieutenants shoulder and studied the grim fortress which was slipping past the port beam it was still difficult to see the extent of its buildings a high wall undulating with the edge of the clifftop the spaced windows were little more than black slits like mournful eyes while above on the weatherworn battlements he could see the muzzles of several large guns just visible through their individual embrasures maurin said a foul place is it not but they are not like us they live like crabs in the rocks he sounded contemptuous bolitho saw several small boats bobbing at anchor and a schooner similar to the one they had captured moored to a stone pier maurin did not try to stop him looking at everything to prevent his interest in the many figures which moved about the pier and up the sloping track to the fortress gates bolitho decided he was being brought by the main channel by careful design so that he should see the growing strength of muljadis private army and it was impressive to think that a pirate an alien to the indies could muster this force and instil such discipline was enough to impress anyone even a pompous fool like major jardine he turned as the boats crew began to shorten sail and saw the anchored frigate lying directly across the bows close to in a confined space she seemed even larger far bigger than undine even his last command would have been reckless to match her deadly broadside of eighteenpounders he remarked a fine ship maurin nodded the best we ave been together for so long we even think alike bolitho saw the activity around the entry port the gleam of sunlight on fixed bayonets where a guard awaited his arrival a very carefully staged performance he thought he noticed that boarding nets were furled along the gangways where they could be spread without delay fear of a cuttingout attack more likely he was taking no chances with his new ally it was the only promising thing bolitho had seen so far a small fishing dory drifted abeam and he saw some natives standing in it shaking their fists at him and baring their teeth like wild beasts maurin said simply they probably think you are a prisoner eh it seemed to depress him bolitho pushed him from his thoughts as the boat swung heavily towards the frigates main chains capitaine paul le chaumareys a man about whom many tales had been told battles won convoys harried and settlements destroyed his record in the war had been formidable just as conway had described but as an individual he was a mystery mostly because he had spent much of his service far away from his own beloved france he ran his eyes the full length of the ships side argus the hundredeyed messenger of hera very appropriate for a man as elusive as le chaumareys he thought sturdily built and showing the scars and blemishes of hard service she was a ship he would have been proud to command she lacked undines grace but had a heavier toughness which could not be ignored the boat had made fast to the chains and the crew stood grouped by the mast as bolitho climbed up to the gunwale nobody attempted to assist him then a young seaman jumped down from the chains and held out his hand msieu he grinned broadly a votre service bolitho seized his wrist and levered himself towards the entry port the french seaman could have been one of his own he removed his hat to the broad quarterdeck and waited while the calls shrilled a salute and a guard presented muskets not crisply like bellairs marines would have done but with a familiar jauntiness of long practice like the upper deck itself he thought not dirty but not gleaming and in perfect order either well used ready for anything ah capitaine le chaumareys stepped forward to greet him his eyes fixed on bolithos face he was quite unlike anyone he had expected older a good deal so perhaps in his middle forties and one of the largest men he had ever met taller than six feet with shoulders so broad that his bared head seemed tiny by comparison especially as he wore his hair very short like a convict i welcome you to my ship he waved his hand around the deck to my world as it has been for so long he smiled the effect lighting up his face in an instant so come below to the cabinhe nodded to maurin i will call for you when it is time bolitho followed him to the cabin hatch seeing the eyes watching from both deck and gangways the way they studied his every move as if to discover something le chaumareys said casually i hope maurin took good care of you very thank you his english is excellent yes one of the reasons i chose him for my ship he is married to an englishwoman he chuckled you of course are not married so why not a french bride for you eh he threw open the door and watched bolithos reactions the cabin was large and well furnished and like the rest of the ship vaguely untidy lived in but bolithos attention was immediately drawn to a table which was laden with food le chaumareys remarked much of it is locally obtained he jabbed a large joint with his finger like this it is very much the same as smoked ham you must eat your fill while you can eh he chuckled the sound rising from what bolitho now saw to be a large belly he replied i am here to present the other captain wagged a finger you are aboard a french ship msieu first we drink he shouted a brief command and a servant hurried from the adjoining cabin with a tall crystal jug of wine it was extremely good as cool as spring water bolitho glanced from the jug to the table genuine or was it one more trick to show they were superior even in their supplies and comforts a chair was brought for him and when he was seated le chaumareys seemed to relax he said i have heard of you bolitho you had a fine record in the war for one so junior his eyes did not flicker as he added it was difficult for you the unfortunate affair of your brother bolitho watched him calmly le chaumareys was a man he could understand like a duellist relaxed one moment making a thrust the next he said thank you for your concern the small head bobbed back and forth you should have been in these waters during the war independence an ability to work beyond the reach of some admiral eh i think it would have fitted you well bolitho felt the servant refilling his glass i have come to speak with muljadi he tightened his grip on the glass it had come out just like that as if the words had been lying in his mind for months instead of seconds le chaumareys stared at him with amazement are you insane he would have you screaming for death in a moment and i could not help you no msieu it would be a lunatic thing even to think of bolitho said then i will return to my ship but what of your admiral conway his despatches is there nothing from him for me it would be pointless now bolitho watched him warily besides which you are not here as a french captain but as a subordinate to muljadis authority le chaumareys took a deep swallow from his glass his eyes slitted against the reflected sunlight from the windows he said abruptly listen to me curb your impatience as i have had to do when i was your age eh he looked around the cabin i have my instructions i obey them as you must yours but i have served france well and i am near finished in the indies perhaps i made my services too valuable to be allowed home earlier but that is as may be i know these seas like my own face during the war i had to live off the islands for food and shelter for repairs and to glean intelligence about your patrols and convoys when i was told to continue in these same waters i resented it but i suppose i was flattered also i am still needed eh not like many who fought so bravely and are now without bread he looked at bolitho sharply and added as in your country too no doubt bolitho replied yes it is much the same le chaumareys smiled well then my impetuous friend we must not fight again we are too much the same needed one minute expendable the next bolitho said coldly many have died because of your actions but for our arrival at pendang bay all the garrison would have i been killed and you must know it a spanish frigate was des troyed to delay our arrival to allow this prince muljadi to give his piracy some sort of repute to make him an ally of france and a constant threat to peace le chaumareys eyes widened well said but i had no part in nervions destruction he held up one large fist of course i heard about it i hear many things i do not like that is why i brought the spanish commandant here to parley for his garrisons safety he was still the representative of his own king he could agree to terms which but for your intervention would have given muljadi certain rights in pendang bay he became very grave i did not know an attack would be launched the very moment i had left the bay you have my word as a french officer and i accept it bolitho tried to remain calm but could feel the blood tingling in his veins like ice water it was exactly as he had imagined a set calculated plan which had begun perhaps in europe in paris and london even madrid and which had almost worked but for his decision to take undine and the nervions few survivors to their destination and puigservers arrival in pendang bay the matter would be settled and le chaumareys probably on his way home at last his work done and done well he heard himself say i have come to take the commandant back to his own kind don luis puigserver the king of spains representative will be expecting his return he hardened his tone is colonel pastor still alive or is his death another thing you know of but did not approve le chaumareys stood up and moved heavily to the quarter window he is here a prisoner of muljadis in that ruin on the hill he will never allow you to take him dead or alive his presence can still give legality to his demands can show that england is unable to honour her word and protect the rights and citizens of spain a hard story to believe but time and distance can make truth a mockery then why would muljadi fear to see me bolitho watched him as he moved away from the window his face lined and grim id have thought he would have been eager to throw his power in my face le chaumareys walked across the cabin the deck creaking under his corpulent frame he halted by bolithos chair and looked directly into his eyes it is i who fear foryou bolitho out here in my argus i am muljadis arm his reach to him i am not merely a sea captain but a symbol a man who can spring his plans into reality but beyond these timbers i cannot answer for your security and that is the truth he hesitated his eyes still on bolithos face but i see i am wasting time you are determined no bolitho smiled gravely yes le chaumareys added i have met many englishmen in war and peace some i liked many i hated few did i respect he held out his hand you i admire he smiled sadly a fool but a brave one that i can admire he rang a bell and then gestured to the table and you eat nothing bolitho reached for his hat if what you say is true then it would be wasted eh he smiled despite his tumbling thoughts and if not i will have to content myself with salt pork in the future a tall lankhaired officer entered the cabin and le chaumareys spoke to him swiftly in french then he picked up his own hat and said my senior lieutenant bolitho i have changed my mind i am coming with you he shrugged curiosity or to prove my original beliefs i know not which but without me you are a dead man when they reached the quarterdeck bolitho saw there was a boat already alongside and that the gangways were filled with silent spectators having a good look he thought grimly a oneway journey if he had miscalculated le chaumareys held his arm listen to me i am older and i expect wiser than you i can have you taken back to your ship you will suffer no disgrace in a year all this will be forgotten leave politics to those who daily dirty their hands without remorse bolitho shook his head in my position would you he forced a smile your face tells me what i need to know le chaumareys nodded to his watching officers and then led the way to the entry port bolitho glanced quickly along the gun deck noting the fresh repairs to timbers and cordage where undine had made her own challenge and when he had felt the battle was nearly lost it was an uncanny feeling to be walking with arguss captain more like compatriots than men who had so recently tried to destroy each other if they met again after this there could be no more truces the boat pulled steadily across swirling water towards the pier below the fortress the french seamen watching bolitho the whole time curious or merely seeing the face of an enemy le chaumareys spoke only once on the short crossing do not lose your temper with muljadi one sign and he will have you seized he is without pity and what about your position here the frenchman gave a bitter smile he needs me msieu once alongside the pier bolitho gained a new understanding of the hatred he had seen earlier with the french seamen surrounding him as an escort he was made to hurry up the steep slope towards the fortress while on all sides voices rose in shouts and curses and it was obvious that without le chaumareys massive presence even the sailors would have been set upon the lower part of the fortress was little more than an empty shell its courtyard littered with rushes and rags which the defenders and muljadis growing army of followers used for bedding he looked up at the blue sky above the ramparts and saw the guns old but powerful each with balls nearby and long ropes which trailed carelessly to the courtyard and some crude baskets which presumably were used to haul fresh powder and shot when required more rough steps the sun probing across his shoulders then sudden shadows making his body feel chilled and damp le chaumareys grunted you will wait here he led bolitho into a roughly hewn room no bigger than a cable tier and strode towards an ironstudded door at one end it was guarded by some heavily armed natives who faced the french seamen as if hoping for a fight le chaumareys seemed to sail right through them like a threedecker breaking the line of battle supreme confidence or a wellpractised bluff bolitho did not know he did not have to wait long the door was dragged open and he saw a large room a chamber which seemed to span the whole breadth of the upper fortress against the dull stone and smoky walls the dais at the far end made a fine splash of colour muijadi was arranged on a pile of silk cushions eyes fixed on the door his body completely at ease he was naked to the waist and wore only white baggy trousers and red leather boots underneath he had no hair so that in the sunlight from the slitted windows his head seemed pointed and his single ear very prominent and grotesque le chaumareys was standing to one side of the dais his face stern and alert around the walls were some of the dirtiest and cruellestlooking men bolitho had ever seen in his life although the quality of their weapons marked them as leaders or lieutenants in muljadis command he walked towards the dais half expecting one of the onlookers to rush forward and cut him down but nobody moved or spoke when he was within a few feet of the cushions muijadi said flatly that is close enough he spoke good english but with a strong accent which was probably spanish he continued before i have you killed captain is there anything you wish to say bolitho wanted to lick his parched lips he heard the rustle of expectancy behind him saw le chaumareys watching him with despair on his tanned face bolitho said on behalf of his britannic majesty king george i have come to demand the release of colonel don jose pastor subject of spain and under my countrys protection muijadi sat bolt upright the stump of his severed wrist pointing like a gun demand you insolent dog le chaumareys stepped forward hastily let me explain msieu muljadi screamed you will address me highness to bolitho he added savagely call on your god for help i will make you plead for death bolitho could feel his heart pumping against his ribs the sweat pouring down his spine and gathering around his waist like icerime deliberately he reached into his pocket and pulled out his watch as he flicked open the guard he heard muljadi leap to his feet the gasp of disbelief as he threw himself from the dais to seize bolithos wrist in a grip like a manacle he screamed into bolithos face where did you get that he jerked up his wrist and the watch upon which the prancing gold beast dangled like a fob bolitho forced himself to keep his voice level to stop his gaze from falling on the similar pendant which hung on muljadis chest from a prisoner he added sharply a pirate muljadi twisted his wrist slowly his eyes like fires as he snarled you lie and you will suffer for it now le chaumareys called in gods name do not make him kill you bolitho kept his eyes on muljadis feeling his power his hatred but something more anxiety he said if you take a telescope you will be able to see my ship you will also see there is a halter at the mainyard if i do not return before dusk your son will hang there you have my word on it i took this from his neck when i captured him and his schooner some forty miles to the southrd of where we are standing muljadis eyes seemed to be bulging right out of his head you lie bolitho eased his wrist from muljadis grasp the fingers had left marks like rope burns he said quietly i will exchange him for your prisoner he looked atle chaumareys astonished face the capitaine can arrange it i am certain muijadi ran to a window and snatched a telescope from one of his men over his shoulder he said hoarsely you will stay as a hostage bolitho replied no hostages a fair bargain you have my word as a kings officer muljadi threw the telescope to the ground shattering the lens in all directions his chest was heaving violently and his shaven head was glittering with tiny jewels of sweat kings officer do you think i care for you he spat on the stones by bolithos shoes you will suffer that i promise you le chaumareys called let it be done he hesitated highness but muljadi was almost beside himself like a madman he suddenly grasped bolithos arm and propelled him to the opposite end of the chamber and thrust him against the window look down there captain he was spitting out each word like a pistol ball i will give you your colonel but it is too late to save you now bolitho stared down at the glittering water which snaked around and amongst the next cluster of islets anchored in a bend of the channel her decks alive with hurrying figures was a frigate he felt muljadis hatred turning to aa wild jubilation as he shouted mine all mine well my kings officer are you still so confident le chaumareys said harshly why did you have to do muljadi whirled round on him his eyes wild do you think i have to be told what to do that i am a child i have waited long enough the waiting is over now a door grated open and bolitho saw the spanish command ant supported on either side by an armed pirate his eyes blinking in the light as if he was almost blind bolitho strode past muljadi and his men i have come to take you home senor he saw the filth on his torn clothing the shackle marks on his thin wrists it was a brave thing you did the old man peered blearily at him his beard quivering as he said jerkily i do not understand le chaumareys said come now under his breath he added or i will not answer for your safety it was like a dream down the sloping track to the pier and into the boat and for most of the way pursued by muljadis voice which had lapsed into another language although the threat was no less evident bolitho said coldly the frigate she was english le chaumareys nodded wearily yes damaged in battle in she was beached near here and her company removed by another vessel we have been working on her for two years almost putting her to rights i was ordered to hand her to muljadi ready for use before i am allowed to return home bolitho did not look at him he was supporting the spanish commandant against his knees feeling his sobs and his misery then i hope you are proud of your work msieu and what it may mean when muljadi puts her to work the french frigates yards loomed above the boat and bolitho followed the other captain up to the entry port le chaumareys said abruptly maurin will attend to the transfer he looked searchingly at bolitho for several seconds you are still young one day you might have understood now that is past he thrust out his hand when we meet again as i fear we must it will be for the last time he turned on his heel and strode to the cabin hatch bolitho pulled out his watch and examined the gold pendant if he had been mistaken or potter had given him wrong information he stopped his train of thought there and then it did not bear even conjecture then he thought of the captured frigate but for muljadis flare of anger he would never have known of it the knowledge was little help but it was better than nothing he decided maurin said cheerfully i will take a boat away to your ship msieu they will be surprised to learn of your safety as i am bolitho smiled i was well protected thank you he glanced at the cabin hatch but was uncertain what he meant no better no worse than most bolitho walked slowly along the upper rampart at the inland side of the settlement watching the steamy haze rising from the jungle the afternoon sunlight playing on the dripping leaves and fronds nearest the palisade undine had anchored shortly before noon below an empty blue sky and yet during their slow approach towards pendang bay he had seen the land dark under the weather and had almost envied the isolated downpour he sighed smelling the thick heady scents from the jungle the drowsy aromas of rotting leaves and roots hidden in deep shadow below the trees for the last two days undine had been plagued with opposing wind and when at last it had changed in their favour there had been little more than a breath to bring life to the sails he watched some redcoated sepoys working beyond the palisade and two native women approaching the gateway with heavy bundles on their heads at a glance it seemed nothing had changed but now as he waited to confront conway for the second time within the hour he knew everything was different he continued his walk to the next corner of the crude timber rampart and saw undine riding easily to her cable the captured schooner close abeam as he looked towards the shallows where he had last seen the brig rosalind when undine had set sail for muljadis stronghold it was all he could do to stop himself from cursing aloud like the transport bedford she had gone back to madras to carry despatches and raymonds own appreciation of the situation to sir montagu strang bolitho had been shocked by conways appearance when he had reported ashore within thirty minutes of dropping anchor wildeyed more shrunken than ever he had been almost beside himself with anger and despair he had shouted you dare to stand here and tell me that you actually chose to ignore my orders that despite the importance of my instructions you made no attempt to parley with le chaumareys bolitho had stood very still his eyes on conways distorted features an empty decanter lay on the table and it was obvious he had been drinking heavily for some time i could not parley sir to do so would have been to recognise muljadi which is exactly what the french want are you telling me something i do not already know conway had gripped the table violently i ordered you to tell le chaumareys to return colonel pastor unharmed the spanish government would have raised a savage argument against england if we had allowed him to remain a prisoner and right under my nose bolitho recalled his own voice taut and flat not daring to arouse conways fury any more than it was when i found i had captured muljadis son i knew i could bargain sir there was a good chance i would succeed as it turned out we arrived in time i fear that pastor would have died in a few more days conway had screamed pastor be damned you took muljadis son and you dared to release him we could have had that bloody pirate crawling at our feet pleading for his sons life bolitho had said abruptly there was a frigate lost in these waters during the last months of the war conway had been taken off guard yes yes the imogene captain balfour he had squinted against the suns glare from a window twentyeight guns had been in battle with the french and then got caught by a gale drove aground and her people were taken off by one of my sloops what the hell does she have to do with it everything sir but for my meeting with muljadi i would never have known until we were totally unprepared the frigate the imogene is there sir in the benuas and from what i saw about ready to weigh anchor conway had lurched against the table as if bolitho had actually struck him if this is some trick some ruse to deter my she is there sir refitted and repaired and i have no doubt well trained by le chaumareys officers he could not conceal his bitterness i had hoped the brig would still be here you could have sent word demanded help there is no choice in the matter now the next part had been the worst conway walking unsteadily to the sideboard and fumbling with another decanter and muttering betrayed right from the start raymond insisted on sending the brig to madras shes a company vessel and i could hold her no longer he had all the arguments all the answers too claret had slopped over his shirt like blood as he had shouted and me nothing but a catspaw a tool for strang and his friends to use as they please he had smashed a goblet with the decanter and groped hurriedly for another adding and now you the one man i trusted tells me that muljadi is ready to attack my settlement not merely content with showing me to be incompetent raymond will now tell his damned superiors that i cannot even hold this territory under the british flag the door had opened noiselessly and puigserver had moved into the room he had glanced briefly at conway and had said to bolitho i stayed until your return my men have sailed in the bedford but i could not leave also without offering my gratitude for securing don pastors release you seem to make a habit of risking your life for others i trust that this time it will not go unrewarded his black eyes had moved to conway again eh admiral conway had stared at him vaguely i must think we all must the spaniard had settled in a chair his eyes still on conway i heard some of it through the door he had shrugged not spying you understand but your voice was somewhat forceful conway had made a new effort to control himself conference immediately he had fixed bolitho with a bleary stare you wait outside i must think now as he looked emptily at the small figures below the palisade bolitho could feel his returning anger a sense of urgency richard he swung round and saw her at the corner of the square tower she was well covered against the sun and wore the same widebrimmed hat as before he hurried to her and seized her hands viola i was wondering she shook her head later but listen she reached up and touched his cheek very gently her eyes suddenly sad it has been so long eleven days but they were years when the storm came i worried about you he tried to speak to break the pain in her voice but she hurried on i think james suspects he has been very strange lately probably my maid let slip something a good girl but easily flattered into words she studied him searchingly but no matter he will do nothing it is you i am concerned for she dropped her head and it is all my fault i wanted him to be something in this world mostly i suspect for my own gain i drove him too hard too fast wanting him to be the man he could never be she squeezed his hand but you know all this voices echoed below the parapet and bolitho thought he heard footsteps she said huskily james will have sent his own report to sir montagu he knows now that conway is not the man for this appointment and will use this knowledge to his own advantage but you my darling richard will be included in his report i know him so well you see to get at you to use his petty revenge he will also blameyou for the inability to destroy an ignorant pirate french aid or no he replied quietly it is worse than that muljadi has many men at his back when once he has overthrown this settlement the whole area will rise to support him they have little choice the pirates will become saviours the protectors the invaders it is not uncommon she turned her head quickly and he saw a pulse jumping in her throat listen to me richard do not become further involved you are valuable to your country and to all who look up to you do not i implore you continue to look up to those who are unfit even to lick your boots she cupped his face in her hands save your ship and yourself and damn their eyes i say he held her wrists very gently it is no longer so simple he thought of le chaumareys encouraging him to quit to get away and still retain his honour and i wish to god you had sailed in the brig muljadi has more strength now and when he comes he let his gaze move outward and down towards the anchored frigate how small she appeared in the harsh glare there is only undine between him and these walls she stared at him her eyes wide and suddenly understanding and you intend to fight all of them bolitho prised her hands away as a sepoy corporal rounded the tower and said captain bolitho sahib the governor will meet you please bolitho looked at her and said now we will see viola he tried to smile the battles not done yet he found conway seated behind the table his stained shirt covered by his heavy dress coat puigserver had not moved and raymond was standing with his back to a window his face hidden in black shadow major jardine and his secondincommand made up the conference conway said sharply i have told them bolitho word for word as you described it to me thank you sir bolitho looked at raymond knowing it would come from him you took a great deal upon yourself captain more i suspect than the governor intended yes sir but i was taught to use initiative especially when beyond the fleets apron strings he saw puigserver examining one shoe with sudden interest the fact is muljadi intends to attack this settlement it is all he can do now that he has lost his hostage and understands that we are informed of his additional frigate it has changed everything jardine said harshly if he comes my men can hold him off until help arrives when the brig reaches madras theyll soon send a force to finish this ruffian even when the navy is apparently incapable of so doing what bolitho waited watching raymonds hands on the window sill well mr raymond is the gallant major right he saw the hands take a firmer grip and added or did you suggest is your report to sir montagu strang that pendang bay is i your opinion no longer an asset jardine bared his teeth rubbish he hesitated and askectt well sir raymond sounded very calm i told the truth no ship will be sent other than transports to remove the company soldiers and their dependents jardine exploded but i can manage sir you should have told me first bolitho said you cannot manage major muljadi will have more than a thousand men when he comes his stronghold is crammed to capacity that i did see you may have been able t hold the walls until help was forthcoming from madras without it your only chance is a forced march through dens jungle to the eastrd to contact the dutch east india company base and find safety his tone hardened but through dense jungle and at this time of the year i doubt if many would survive even without attack from those who will want to impress muljadi with their loyalty raymond said thickly no blame can fall on my shoulders i reported what i knew i had no knowledge of this othei frigate he tried to recover his original calm any more that you did conway stood up very deliberately each movement aii effort of will but you could not wait mr raymond you used your authority to seek your own ends and despatched the brig even after i requested she be held here until undines return he walked to the opposite side of the room and stared un seeingly at the closeknit jungle so what can we do how best can we prepare ourselves for slaughter he turned with the speed of light and yelled well ms raymond will you explain for indeed it is beyond me major jardine stammered surelyit cannot be that hopeless puigserver was watching bolitho well capiaan you have been inside the lions den not us bolitho looked at conway may i suggest something sir the admiral nodded his wispy hair in disorder if there is anything left to say bolitho walked to the table and moved the heavy silver inkwells into a pattern the benuas are much as they appear on our charts sir although i suspect some of the smaller channels between the islets are silted and shallow the fortress stands high on a central islet a rockpile if you like his fingers made a sweeping gesture down the front of one inkwell the seaward face of the islet is sheer and what i first took to be reefs at its foot i now believe are fragments of cliff which have fallen away over many years of wear he heard captain strype say gloomily that rules out any hope of a scaling attempt it is hopeless conway glared at him and then snapped continue what about this cliff bolitho looked at him calmly if we attack at once sir he ignored the gasps before muljadi is ready we might nip his whole plan in the bud conway exclaimed attack when you have just finished destroying our hopes even of staying alive the main gun battery is on the seaward rampart sir bring it down and the ships at anchor will be without immediate protection conway was rubbing his chin in quick nervous movements yes i can see that but how jardine sneered an act of god maybe the schooner sir bolitho kept his gaze fixed on conways lined forehead seeing all the doubts and apprehension gathering like a storm we could use the prevailing wind sail her straight on to the fallen rocks at the foot of the cliff filled to the deck beams with powder and a goodly fuse the explosion would i believe bring down more of the cliff he hesitated feeling the sudden tension around him and the battery captain strype was staring at the inkwell as if seeing the actual explosion it might well work sir a damn fine idea jardine growled hold your tongue what sort of fool would do such a thing anyway he fell back as conway snapped be still to bolitho he added and you think this is a reasonable risk i do the schooner would be lightly manned and her crew could get clear in their boat once the final course was laid a long fuse would allow them time enough he kept his eyes steady the moment the charge explodes i will force the channel in undine and take the anchored frigates before they can recover after an explosion like that they will not be expecting a further intrusion puigserver nodded grimly fair justice too conway glared at him it is the wildest plan i have ever discussed bolitho said quietly i must argue that point sir what conway swung on him are you questioning me again i recall a certain captain sir years back when i was a stupid midshipman he took a fair chance or so when he considered it necessary conway reached out and gripped his wrist thank you for that he looked away patting his pockets as if searching for something id forgotten bolitho said the troops will have to remain here of course he thought he saw relief on jardines heavy face resentment on his aides strange he thought that the one who appeared the weaker was the stronger after all he added if this plan fails and we must face that possibility it will be up to the sepoys to evacuate the settlement as best they can but please take my word for this no parley with muljadi for to him victory means only one thing extinction for all those who have represented his enemies throughout his entire life he pointed towards the window and once through those palisades there will be no time left for regrets conway returned to the table his face very composed i agree he glanced at jardine set your men to work transferring powder to the schooner every barrel and cask from our magazine if that is what is needed he looked at bolitho and who will command the schooner have you thought of that i am not decided sir he smiled gravely yet he turned as raymond walked around the table show ng his face at last in the sunlight raymond said i acted as i thought fit conway nodded his eyes contemptuous if we survive this affair you may yet share the advantages if there are any his tone was like ice if we fail you will probably receive the knighthood you covet so dearly he paused as raymond hurried to the door posthumously of course when he faced the table again conway seemed about ten years younger now that i am decided bolitho i cannot wait bolitho nodded he could feel his muscles and bones aching as if from physical effort and could barely realise what he had done what he had committed himself and his ship to he said i will return aboard now sir i need fresh water and fruit if there is any faces flashed across his thoughts carwithen with his axe embedded in the pirates neck davys pride at being given command of the schooner fowlars genuine pleasure with his temporary promotion and herrick most of all what would he say to this pathetic desperate plan smile shake his head accept that at last his captain had made the one fatal mistake for all of them conway was saying you are a slyboots bolitho more than i ever suspected he made as if to reach for the new decanter but changed his mind if i am to lose my head then it had better be a clear one eh puigserver was touching one of the silver inkwells with a spatulate finger when will it be capitan early bolitho watched him thoughtfully puigserver too hehadbeeninthe story from thevery beginning dawn attack conway nodded and if ever you have prayed for the wind to set fair then do it from now on bolitho smiled aye sir i will bear that in mind he made to leave but halted as the admiral added gruffly whatever the outcome we will have tried done our best when he turned towards the sunlight bolitho was shocked to see the moisture in his eyes raymond was right of course im not the man for the appointment nor do i suppose it was ever intended i should retain it once the settlement had been founded he hesitated or lost but we will show them he strode to his private door and slammed it behind him puigserverwhistled the old lion awakes eh bolitho smiled sadly if you have known him as i once did senor if you had seen the people cheering themselves hoarse with the smoke of battle still thick between decks then you would have understood perhaps puigserver grinned broadly now away with you i think you have learned a great deal since we first met about many things eh bolitho walked out past a nodding servant and then startd as someone touched his sleeve it was viola raymonds nud her face screwed up with fright as she whispered this way sir just down here bolitho followed her quickly and then saw the pale figure by a door at the far end of the passageway he asked what is it we should not meet like this she stared at him her eyes blazing you are going toet killed he just told me she threw her big hat on the floor and added angrily and i dont care i dont care what happens to you then she threw herself against him her voice breakingsn sobs as she cried its a lie i do care my darling richard ill die if anything happens to you i didnt mean to say those things he held her chin in his hand easy viola he pushed the hair from her forehead it was hot and feverish i had no choice her body shook uncontrollably and she gripped his axts even tighter oblivious to her maid and the real possibility that someone might walk into the passage at any second and no chance no chance at all bolitho held her away and waited until she was calmer i must go now and i will take care he saw her returning anguish and said quickly i must not damage my new watch now must i she tried to return his smile the tears flowing freely down her face as she said i would never forgive you he turned and walked towards the stairway and then stripped again as she called his name but she did not follow him instead she held up one hand as if he was already a long eay off beyond reach he found allday waiting by the beached gig and said sharply back to the ship allday watched him curiously theyre taking powder casks to the schooner captain is that a question he glared at him but alldays face was unmoved i was just thinking mr davys not going to be happy about this bolitho clapped his arm i know and i have no excuse for taking out my temper on you allday squinted up at the timbered fort above the palisades the white figure in one of the windows under his breath he said i know just how it feels captain bolitho twisted in the sternsheets to watch the boats busying themselves alongside the schooner it had sounded so simple so neat to take two anchored frigates in a confined space was better than matching gun for gun in open waters but many would curse his name as they died nonetheless he sighed as the gig gathered speed towards the frigate puigserver had been right he had learned a great deal since their meeting at santa cruz mostly about himself all present sir herrick seated himself beside the cabin door and waited for bolitho to speak beyond the stern windows it was very dark but it was possible to see the yellow lanterns moving back and forth between the settlement and the surf as the business of loading the schooner continued without pause bolitho looked at the faces around the cabin everyone was here he let his gaze rest briefly on midshipman keen even him although the surgeon had told him he would not be responsible for his condition keen looked strained and whenever he moved it was easy to see the pain on his mouth and eyes but he had insisted on rejoining the ship mudge and soames fowlar looking slightly selfconscious at his first important conference davy whose handsome features were still showing some of the dismay remaining from bolithos news about the schooner captain bellairs debonair and blandfaced in the gently spiralling lantern light the purser as mournful as ever armitage and penn like illmatched brothers and lastly below the skylight whitmarsh the surgeon his face glowing like a great beetroot bolitho clasped his hands behind him an average wardroom he thought no better no worse than most yet he was about to ask more of them than would be expected from a veteran company you know me well enough by now to understand that i dislike speeches making or listening to them he saw herrick grin and mudges tiny eyes vanish on either side of the great nose at the beginning of this commission there were many aboard wardroom included who thought my methods too hard my ideals too high for a ship on a peacetime mission now all of us know that things have changed and our experience our training is the only thing of value we have to protect us and more to the point those who are depending on our ability he nodded to herrick open the chart as mudge leaned forward to weigh down herricks chart with books and brass dividers he took another glance at their faces anviety trust it was too early to know he continued the schooner will sail directly into the main channel using the easterly headland for cover until the last available moment once on course for the rocks at the foot of the cliff he paused to lay the dividers on the small cross the helm will be lashed and the crew will take to the boat they will be recovered later he made himself smile although his heart felt strangely heavy after we have excised the two frigates while their people are still collecting their wits penn said well show em sir he quailed under mudges withering stare and sve bolitho smiled at the scarletfaced midshipman driven on by mr penns enthusiasm will move into the channel rake both anchored ships come about and rake em again he looked at davy so tell all gun crews to look alive the first broadsides will be the telling ones bellairs drawled bit of a chance for the schooner id say sir all that gunpowder aboard one heated ball from the battery and up she goes he blinked under bolithos level stare and added no disrespect to the bold fellows aboard her of course but where would it leave us bolitho shook his head the battery is old i am almost certain that heated shot will not be available for fear of splitting the guns normally they would not need it with such an arc of fire the battery can hit any vessel once itis within the two main channels he smiled to hide the sudden doubt which bellairs had laid in his mind suppose there was heated shot already simmering in furnaces but he would have seen them surely no baskets could hoist glowing balls to that high rampart he said and we will know that most of that battery is lying in the sea where it should have been years ago we will weigh at first light tomorrow the wind seems to be in our favour and with luck it will serve our purposes there remains just one matter he paused and saw herrick watching him from across the cabin but he must not think of his friend the best and firmest one he had ever had he was his first lieutenant the most competent officer in the ship nothing more counted it must not he continued mr herrick will command the schooner herrick nodded his face expressionless aye sir ill take six good hands should be enough bolitho held his gaze the rest of the officers fading around him as he said i will leave it to you if potter wishes to join with you then take him he saw whitmarsh rising to protest and added harshly he knows the channel we need all we can get the door opened slightly and carwithen thrust his head into the lantern light beg pardon sir but the water casks ave been stowed an a message as been sent to say that the schooner is fully loaded his gaze shifted to fowlar but there was no recognition fowlars first step to promotion had already marked them apart although it was possible they had never had much in common bolitho thought very well bolitho waited for the door to close carry on gentlemen you all have your duties to attend he faltered wondering why there were never the rightwords when you needed them most we will have little time for discussion until this matter is settled or we are all dead remember this and remember it well our people will be looking to you more than they or you ever expected most of them have never been in a real sea fight and when we last met with argus many still believed we had won a battle rather than secured a retreat this time there can be no retreat for us or the enemy le chaumareys is a fine captain probably the best ever produced by france but he has one weakness he smiled gravely one which we have not yet enjoyed that of supreme confidence in his ship and himself his belief and your skill and determination will win the day for us if anything can they stood up silent and grimfaced as if only just aware of their responsibilities the finality of their position then as they moved towards the door bolitho said a moment mr herrick alone together in the gently pitching cabin bolitho said i had no choice i would have been dismayed had you selected a junior sir herrick smiled so theres an end to it bolitho held out his hand may god protect you thomas if i have misjudged this affair or the enemy outwits us then pull back at once if i signal a recall then abandon your attempt if die we must then i want you with me herrick gripped his hand tightly his blue eyes suddenly concerned enough of this talk sir it is not like you win we must and heres my hand on it bolitho followed him towards the door hating the moment conscious of the weight which he had caused to fall on his own shoulders she had seen his danger as had le chaumareys perhaps herrick also on deck in the noise and bustle of preparing for sea the contact was at last broken herrick said ill go and pick my hands sir bolitho nodded his heart aching carry on mr herrick the second lieutenant will relieve you forthwith as herrick melted into the shadows davy crossed the quarterdeck and touched his hat bolitho said i am sorry about your schooner i seem to have little choice in anything at the moment davy shrugged it does not seem to matter any more sir for once i cannot see further than the next few days nor care either bolitho seized his arm savagely and swung him round has nothing i said to you made any sense davy struggled in his fierce grip and blurted out ii am sorry sir you will be if i hear you talking like that again your responsibility is to me the ship and the people you command not to your own personal considerations when a man starts to believe there are no more tomorrows he is as good as sewn up in a hammock between two roundshot think of the tomorrows believe in them and the men who depend on your skill or lack of it will see their own survival on your face he relaxed his hold and added in a steadier tone now be off with you he began to pace along the larboard side his feet stepping automatically over ringbolts and gun tackles although his eyes saw none of them he had not been reprimanding davy but himself it was no time for doubt or recrimination but only for living the role he had adopted had earned in a dozen battles or more boat ahoyl the challenge rang out from the gangway where lanterns glintedonlevelledmusketsand bayonets from the bay itself came the reply don luis puigserver wishes to come aboard davy came hurrying aft is that in order sir bolitho smiled calm again i was expecting him i believe the stocky figure rose through the port and hurried across the deck to greet him puigserver said i had to come capitan nervions loss made me a part of this i cannot withdraw until the matter is settled he patted the ornate pistols beneath his coat and i am an excellent shot no i could order you to leave senor but puigserver tilted his head to one side but you will not in any case i have left written word to explain my deeds and my reasons if we survive the battle i will tear it to pieces if not he left the rest unsaid then i accept your offer senor with gratitude puigserver walked to the nettings and stared across at a glittering ridinglight when will the schooner set sail before dawn she will need all the time available to work into her position to best advantage again the ache the thought of herrick sailing his floating magazine into the muzzles of muljadis battery i see puigserver yawned then i think i will join your offwatch officers for a glass in the wardroom you will need your solitude tonight i am thinking some hours later bolitho was awakened by alldays hand on his shoulder he had fallen asleep in the cabin his head on his forearm across the chart where he had been working allday watched him anxiously schooners weighed captain bolitho rubbed his eyes was it almost dawn he felt suddenly chilled desperate for sleep aliday added quietly mister pigslivers gone too bolitho stared at him wondering if he had expected this had known it was what puigserver had wanted from the moment he had outlined his plan is she well clear aye captain allday stretched and yawned stood round the headland half an hour back he added slowly hell be good company for mr herrick and thats no error bolitho looked at him you knew didnt you aye captain allday watched him sadly i thought it for the best bolitho nodded i expect it is he walked to the windows as if to see the ridinglight still twinkling above the water it is a bad thing to be alone aliday glanced at the tarnished sword which hung from the bulkhead for a moment he thought about bolithos other coxswain who had died protecting his back from french marksmen at the saintes they had come a long way together since those times he thought soon now it might all end he looked at bolithos shoulders as he peered through the stern windows but you will never be alone captain not while ive a breath left close action bolitho rested his hands on the quarterdeck rail and peered searchingly along his command in the darkness the decks and gangways made a pale outline against the sea beyond the bows and only the irregular drift of spray the swirling white arrowhead from the stem gave any true hint of their progress he restrained himself from going aft again to examine his watch by the shaded compass light nothing had changed since his last inspection and he was well aware of the danger of adding to the tension around him three days since they had left the anchorage in pendang bay making good speed with favourable winds for most of the time they had stood well clear of the land even the approaches to the little whaleshaped islet in case muljadi or le chaumareys had thought fit to place another craft there to warn of any unwelcome sail the previous evening just before sunset they had sighted herricks schooner a tiny dark sliver on the copperedged horizon seemingly motionless as she idled to await undines arrival at the arranged point of rendezvous a brief dipping signal from a lantern before both vessels had lost each other again in darkness bolitho shivered feeling the cool clammy air exploring his face and throat the middle watch had only just run its course and there was still an hour or so before any lightening of the sky could be expected but overnight while all hands had worked to prepare the ship for action the clouds had gathered and thickened brushing out the stars so that undine seemed to be sailing remorselessly into a void he heard mudge moving restlessly below the hammock nettings rubbing his palms together to keep warm the sailing master seemed unusually preoccupied perhaps his rheumatism was troubling him or like bolitho he was thinking of herrick somewhere out there on undines larboard bow bolitho straightened his back and looked up at the blacker outlines of yards and rigging the ship was sailing under topsails and jibs and with only the great forecourse hiding the sea ahead of the bowsprit it was strange to feel so chilled when within hours the sun would be back to torment them to add to whatever else lay in store he asked how is the wind mr mudge mudge was glad to break the silence still souwest sir by an large he coughed noisily under most occasions id be grateful for that what are you thinking not sure sir mudge moved away from the seamen waiting by the quarterdeck sixpounders its too uneven for my tastes bolitho turned to peer forward again the big forecourse seemed to echo mudges doubts undine was steering almost due north and with the wind coming across her quarter she should have been making easygoing of it but she was not the forecourse would billow and harden making the stars and shrouds hum and vibrate holding the ship firm for several minutes then it would flap and bang in disorder before falling almost limp against the foremast for another frustrating period mudge added doubtfully you never knows in these waters not for sure bolitho looked at his untidy outline if mudge was worried with all his experience how much worse it would be for many of the others he called mr davy i am going forrard directly he saw the lieutenants shape detach itself from the rail tell mr keen to keep me company he slipped out of his tarpaulin coat and handed it to allday he had been so occupied with his own thoughts and doubts he had not fully realised how heavily these dragging hours must be affecting his company he had ordered the ship to be prepared for action as soon as he was satisfied with the final leg of their course towards the benua islands working in almost total darkness the hands had completed the task almost as quickly as in broad daylight so familiar had they become with their surroundings their home it was a simple precaution sound travelled too easily at sea and the clatter of screens being torn down the scrape and squeak of nets being spread above the gun deck and chain slings being rigged to every yard seemed loud enough to wake the dead but from then on they had nothing to do but wait to fret on what daylight might bring or take away keen came out of the darkness his shirt pale against a black sixpounder bolitho asked how is the wound much better thank you sir bolitho smiled he could almost feel the pain which was probably showing on keens face then take a stroll with me together they walked along the lee gangway ducking below the taut nets which shellabeers men had rigged to catch falling cordage or worse seeing the upturned faces of each gun crew the restless shapes of the marine sentries at hatchways or powdermonkeys huddled together while they waited to serve the silent cannon on to the forecastle where the squat carronades pointed from either bow like tethered beasts their crews shivering in the occasional dashes of spray bolitho paused one hand gripping the nettings as undine sidled unsteadily into a deep trough most of the seamen were stripped to the waist their bodies shining faintly above the d rk water alongside all ready lads he felt them crowd around him their sudden interest at his arrival of necessity the galley fire had been doused when the ship had gone to quarters a hot drink now would be worth more than a dozen extra guns he thought bitterly to keen he said pass the word to mr davy with my compliments a double tot of rum for all hands he heard the instant response around him the murmur of appreciation as it flowed aft along the gun deck if the purser complains tell him hell have me to reckon with thankee sir that was right thoughtful sir he strode to the ladder turning away in case they could see his face through the darkness or sense his mood it was too easy to raise their spirits so simple that it made him feel cheap hypocritical a double tot of rum a few pence whereas within hours they might have given their lives or their limbs bolitho paced aft beside the main hatch seeing soamess great figure towering above that of tapril the gunner he nodded to fowlar nearby and to the larboard crews of the twelvepounders all were his men his responsibility he thought suddenly of rear admiral sir john winslade all those weeks and months ago in his office at the admiralty he had needed a frigate captain he could know and trust one whose mind he could follow even though it was on the other side of the globe he thought too of the ragged soldiers below the admiralty window one blind the other begging for the both of them all the brave schemes and plans the lofty preparations for a new world yet when it was boiled down nothing was changed undine and argus were but two ships and yet their presence and their needs made them no less important than opposing fleets and if undine failed what would they say in those fine residences in whitehall and st jamess square and in the busy coffee houses where mere rumour grew into fact in minutes would they care that men had fought and died for them in the kings name someone gave a hoarse cheer in the gloom and he guessed the rum had arrived on deck he continued aft hardly aware that he had stopped short in his tracks as his bitterness had given way to anger how spacious the deck seemed without the boats lying one upon the other across their tier all were now towing astern awaiting the moment to be cast adrift mute spectators of the battle which might come which had to come it was always a bad moment he thought boats were frail things but in battle they made an additional menace with their splinters flying like savage darts despite the danger most men would wish them kept aboard a link a hope for survival if things went badly keen came back panting hard all done sir mr triphook was a trifle perturbed at the extra issue his teeth shone in the darkness wouldyou care for a glass sir bolitho disliked rum but he saw the seamen and marines watching him and exclaimed indeed i would mr keen he raised the glass to his mouth the powerful stench of rum going straight to his empty stomach to us lads he pictured herrick and puigserver aboard their floating bomb and to you thomas then he was glad he had accepted the rum and added i can noww understand what makes our jacks so fearsome it brought more laughs as he knew it would he glanced at the sky still without light or sign of a star he said ill go below he touched the midshipmans arm you remain here by the hatch call if i am needed bolitho climbed down into the darkness his feet less certain here anyone could call him when required but he must spare keen an unnecessary visit to the surgeons domain it might come soon enough he recalled the great pulsating wound alldays gentleness as he had searched out that bloody splinter another ladder he paused feeling the ship groaning around him different smellsabounded on this deck tar and oakum and that of tightly compressed humanity even though the tiny messes were now deserted and from forward the reek of the great anchor cables of bilge water and damp clothing of a living working ship a feeble lantern showed him the rest of the way to whitmarshs crude surgery the seachests lashed together where terrified wounded would be saved or driven to despair leather straps to jam between teeth dressings to contain the pain the surgeons great shadow swayed across the tilting deck bolitho watched him narrowly there was a stronger smell of brandy in the damp air to quench pain or to prepare whitmarsh for his own private hell he was not certain all well mr whitmarsh aye sir the surgeon lurched against the chests and braced his knee to the nearest one he waved one hand around his silent assistants the loblolly boys the men who would hold their victims until the work was done brutalised by their trade without ears for the screams beyond pity we are all awaiting whatyou send us sir bolitho stared at him coldly will you never learn the surgeon nodded heavily i have learned well oh yes indeed sir as i have sawed away at a mans leg or plugged carpenters oakum into his empty eyesocket with nothing to ease his torment but neat spirits i have come closer to god than most if that be true then i pray you get no closer bolitho nodded to the others and strode towards the ladder whitmarsh called after him perhaps i shall be greeting you sir bolitho did not reply the surgeon was obviously going completely mad his obsession with his brothers horrible death his drinking and the very way he earned his living were taking their toll but he had to hang on to what remained of that other man the one who had spoken of suffering with compassion of serving others less fortunate he thought again of herrick and prayed he would get his boat away when the schooner was set upon her final course to destruction strange companions he had too puigserver and the frightened sailmaker from bristol finding courage from somewhere to sail back to that place which had broken his mind and body captain sir he quickened his pace as keens voice came down the next ladder what is it but as he gripped the ladder and turned his face towards the skys faint rectangle he knew the answer slow heavy drops of rain were falling across the hatchway like small pebbles dropped from the yards as they tapped on planking or bounced across the gangways he dragged himself up the last few steps and hurried aft to the quarterdeck he was within a few feet of it when the clouds opened and the rain came down in a great roaring deafening torrent he yelled above the deluge how is the wind now mudge was cringing by the binnacle his hat awry in the fury of the downpour veerin sir far as i can tell water hissed and gurgled down decks and scuppers and the chilled gun crews pressed beneath the gangways and cowered behind the sealed ports to escape the torrential rain bolitho felt allday trying to throw the tarpaulin coat over his shoulders but pushed him away he was already soaked to the marrow hair plastered over his forehead his mind ringing to the din of rain and spray yet through it all he managed to keep contact with the ship and her affairs the deck felt steady enough despite the angry downpour and above his head he managed to make out the maintopsails shape flapping and shining wetly as the wind eased round still further he snapped hands to the braces mr davy we will be full and bye directly he heard the men groping and cursing as they lurched to obey the orders the protesting squeak of swollen cordage being hauled through blocks while yards were trimmed to hold the ship on her larboard tack he called bring her up a point men slithered around the big double wheel and he saw carwithen punch one of the helmsmen as he bowed under the sheeting rain nor by west sir full an bye she is hold her so bolitho mopped his face with his sleevethe probing downpour helped to clear his aching mind to make him accept what was happening if the wind continued to veer even if it stayed where it was herrick would be unable to place his schooner in position where he could destroy muljadis battery the disastrous change of wind made the rain feel like tears tears for all their hopes their pathetic determination which minutes ago had made even the impossible seem undaunting he lurched to mudges side and shouted how far now dyou reckon four or five mile no more sir mudge was staring at the rain with dismay this lotll pass over quick enough but then he shrugged bolitho looked away he knew well enough a rising wind was most likely once the sun appeared a wind which would do no service to herrick and keep le chaumareys in the safety of his anchorage undine would be helpless she would be made to stay offshore until the enemys double strength was prepared and ready to fight on their terms or they could turn and run for pendang bay with nothing to offer but a final warning davy shouted by god life is hard mudge glared at him lifes a bloody rearguard action mr davy from the day youre born bolitho swung round to silence both of them and then saw that the masters mates face was clearer than before he could even see carwithen scowling at the same luckless helmsman the dawn was forcing itself to be taken notice of he felt the blood racing in his head as he snapped we will attack as before pass the word to all hands davy gaped at him without destroying the battery sir it might not have worked anyway he tried to sound calm the enemy will be listening to the rain and thanking god for being at anchor he added harshly are you deaf man tell mr soames to prepare for loading once the rain is passed davy nodded jerkily and hurried to the rail captain bellairs strode to bolithos side and remarked coolly damn risky thing sir if youll pardon my sayin so bolitho felt his shoulders beginning to sag under the rain the sudden spark deserting him what wouldyou have me do bellairs turned up his collar and pouted ohid fight sir no choice in the matter what pity though all the same waste damn bloody waste bolitho nodded heavily no argument there deck there land ho bolitho walked stiffly to the lee side his shoes squeaking on the puddled deck a darker blur reaching out on either bow deceptively gentle in the feeble light a voice said rains goin he sounded surprised as if to mark its passing the dripping forecourse lifted and boomed dully to receive a fresher gust of wind it made bolitho shiver and grit his teeth tell mr soames load and prepare to run out when i pass the word he looked around for keen run up the colours if you please another voice muttered no chance mates theyll do for the lot of us bolitho heard the halliards squeaking as the ensign dashed up to the peak and broke out to the wind unseen as yet in the clinging darkness as soon as it is light enough mr keen have your party make a signal to the schooner discontinue the action mr herrick can stand off and retrieve our boats keen said aye aye sir ill see to it when he turned angrily as a voice murmured from the shadows pick up our bloody corpses mores the like keen shouted keep silence there masteratarms take that mans name bolitho said quietly easy if it helps them to curse then let it be so keen faced him his fists doubled at his sides but its not fair sir its not your doing bolitho smiled gravely thank you mr keen he recalled with sudden clarity his lieutenant in his first command the little sloop sparrow an american colonist he had endured the worst of the war serving his king but fighting his own kind at the same time what would he have replied i aint so sure bolitho could almost hear him as if he was present at this very moment he turned quickly to starboard seeing the glowing rim of sunlight as it probed above the bare horizon very soon now he discovered he was dreading the daylight that which would lay them naked under the guns as they drove into the narrow channel where he had met le chaumareys bolitho heard a step behind him and alidays voice firm unruffled better go below and get out of those wet things captain he swung towards him his voice cracking with strain do you think i have nothing else to do the coxswain regarded him stubbornly not just yet you havent he added in the same flat tone you remember the saintes captain he did not wait for an answer it was a bad time all those frogs the sea abounding with their damned ships until it was nigh on bursting i recalls it well i was right forrard on one of the carronades the lads were all quaking with fright at what was to come then i looked aft and saw you pacing the quarterdeck like you were going to church instead of to hell bolitho stared at him his mind suddenly steady i remember allday nodded slowly aye you wore your best uniform bolitho looked past him recalling another voice his coxswain who had died that day theyll want to seeyou he replied quietly very well but if im called allday gave a slow smile immediately captain mudge said hoarsely that was fool advice man the capnll make a fine target for sharpshooters in is gold lace allday eyed him angrily i know he does too he also knows we are depending on himtoday andthatmeans seeinghim mudge shook his head mad youre all mad deck there schooner fine on th weather bow keen called hoist the signal to recall her allday was standing with his arms folded his eyes on the spreading carpet of early light as it reached towards the islands mr herrick wont see it davy glared at him it will be light enough very soon now i know sir allday looked at him sadly but hell not see it not mr herrick without furniture or fittings the cabin felt strangely hostile like an empty house which mourns a lost master and awaits another bolitho stoodbythe shuttered stern windows his arms limp at his sides while noddall clucked around him and patted the heavy dress coat into position like the boat cloak it had been made by a good london tailor with some of his prizemoney through the wide gap left by the screens which had now been bolted to the deckhead he could see straight out along the gun deck the shapes and restless figures still only shadows in the frail light even here in the cabin where he had found peace in solitude or had sat with viola raymond or shared a pipe with herrick there was no escape the chintz covers had gone from the twelvepounders and had followed the furniture to a safer stowage below the waterline and by the guns on either beam the crews stood awkwardly like unfinished statuary conscious of his presence wanting to watch him as he completed dressing yet still held apart by the rigidity of their calling bolitho cocked his head to listen to the rudder as it growled and pounded in response to the helm the wind was fresher heeling the ship over and holding it so he saw the nearest gun captain checking his firing lanyard and noted how his body was angled to the deck noddall was muttering more like it sir much more like it he said it fervently as if repeating a prayer capn stewart was always most particular afore a fight bolitho wrenched his mind back from his doubts and misgivings stewart then he remembered undines last captain had he felt the same too he wondered feet stamped over the deck above and he heard someone shouting he snapped that will have to suffice he snatched up his hat and sword and then paused to pat noddalls bony shoulder he looked so small with his hands held in front of him like paws that he felt sudden compassion for him take care noddall stay down when the iron begins to fly youre no fighting man eh he was shocked to see noddall bobbing his head and tears running down his face in a small broken voice he said thankee capn he did not hide his gratitude i couldnt face another battle an id not want to let you down sir bolitho pushed past and hurried to the ladder he had always taken him for granted the little man who fussed over his table and darned his shirts content in his own small world it had never occurred to him that he was terrified each time the ship cleared for action he ran up the last steps and saw davy and keen with telescopes trained towards the bows what is the matter davy turned and then stared at him he swallowed hard his eyes still on bolithos goldlaced coat schooner has not acknowledged sir bolitho looked from him to the streaming flags now bright against the dull topsails are you sure mudge growled yer coxn seems to think she wont neither sir bolitho ignored him his eyes exploring the spread of land across the bows still lost in deep shadow with only an occasional lip of light to betray the dawn but the schooner was clear enough indirect line with undines plunging jibboom her canvas looked almost white against the cliffs and ragged hills herrick must have seen the recall he would have been anticipating it as soon as the wind veered he peered up at the masthead pendant god how the wind had gone round it must be westsouthwest he shouted hands aloft mr davy get the tgallants on her he swung round seeing them all in those brief seconds mudges doubts carwithen behind him his lips compressed into a thin line the helmsmen the barebacked gun crews keen with his signal party the calls shrilled and shadows darted up the ratlines on either beam as the topmen hurried to set more canvas davy shouted maybe mr herrick intends to go ahead with the plan sir bolitho looked at allday saw the way he was watching the schooner he said quietly it would seem so mr davy under a heavier press of sail undine thrust her shoulder into the creaming water with added urgency the spray hurling itself above the forecastle and nettings in long spectres of foam the hull shook and groaned to the pressure and when he peered aloft bolitho saw the upper yards bending forward to the wind from the peak the ensign was clearly visible like the marines tunics as they stood in swaying lines by the hammock nettings or knelt in the tops by their muskets and swivels like blood he heard himself say repeat the signal mr keen he barely recognised his own voice soames stood on the breech of a twelvepounder gripping the gangway with both hands as he stared towards the land then he looked aft at bolitho and gave a brief shrug in his mind herrick was already dead keen said huskily it will not work the windll carry the schooner clear at best shell explode in the centre of the channel penn shrilled from the gun deck i heard a trumpet bolitho wiped his eyes feeling the salt raw and smarting a trumpet some sentry on the fortress had left the protection of the wall to look seaward he would see the schooner immediately and undine within the next few minutes the sea noises seemed louder than ever with every piece of rigging and canvas banging and vibrating in chorus as the ship drove headlong towards the land and the pale arrowhead which marked the entrance to the channel a dull bang echoed across the water and a man yelled theyve opened fire sirl bolitho reached out for a telescope seeing the grim faces of the seamen by the nearest guns waiting behind closed ports hoping dreading he trained the glass with difficulty his legs well braced on the swaying slippery planking he saw the schooners masts swim past the lens the patch of scarlet which had not been there before he felt himself smiling although he wanted to weep to plead unheard words across those two miles of tossing whitehorses herrick had hoisted his own ensign to him the schooner was not merely a floating bomb she was a ship his ship or perhaps he was trying with that one simple gesture to explain to bolitho too to show he understood another bang and this time he saw the smoke from the battery before it was whisked away a feather of spray lifted well out beyond the schooner to mark where the massive ball had fallen he kept his glass on the schooner he saw the way the deck was leaning over showing the bilges above the leaping spray and knew herrick could not lash the tiller for the final and most dangerous part of the journey davy yelled that ball was over sir bolitho lowered the glass davys words reaching through his anxiety the fortress lookout must have sighted undine and not herricks little schooner and by the time muljadis men had realised what was happening herrick had tacked too close inshore for the gunners to depress their muzzles sufficiently to hit him he looked again as a double explosion shuddered across the water he saw the flashes only briefly but watched the twin waterspouts burst skyward directly in line with the schooner but on the seaward side of her captain bellairs forgot his usual calm and gripped the sergeants arm and shouted by god sarnt coaker hes goin to sail her aground himself it took a few more seconds before the truth filtered the length and breadth of the frigates decks then as the word moved gun by gun towards the bows men stood and yelled like maniacs waving their neckerchiefs or capering on the sanded decks like children from the tops and the forecastle others joined and even midshipman armitage who moments earlier had been gripping a belaying pin rack as if to stop himself from falling waved his hat in the air and yelled go on youll show them bolitho cleared his throat ask the masthead can he see the frigates he tried not to think of the schooners crammed holds the fuse perhaps already hissing quietly in the peace of the lower hull aye sir he can see the yards of the first one around the point even davy was wildeyed indifferent to the fight still to come overwhelmed by herricks sacrifice there was more cannon fire now and he could see splashes all around the schooners hull probably from the nearest anchored frigate or some smaller pieces on the spit of land which guarded the entrance bolitho found he was gritting his jaw so hard it was hurting badly the french were at last aware that something was happening but they would not have guessed the full extent of the danger there was a combined groan from the watching hands bolitho raised the glass and saw the schooners maintopmast buckle and then plunge down in a flailing mass of canvas and rigging half to himself he whispered fall back thomas in gods name come about allday said shes hit again captain badly this time bolitho dragged his mind away knowing he must not think of herrick later but in minutes those guns would be ranging on undine as she made that last desperate dash into the channel he drew his sword and held it above his head see yonder lads he only vaguely saw their faces turn towards him it was like looking through a mist mr herrick has shown us the way shes struck davy was almost beside himself hard and fast the schooner had hit lifted and then plunged firmly across the litter of broken rocks and stones exactly as they had pictured it had planned it with conways silver inkwells even without a glass it was possible to see some small boats moving from the fortresss pier towards the stranded hull which now lay totally dismasted the spray leaping over it like some old hulk occasional stabs of fire showed where marksmen were firing into the wreckage and bolitho prayed that the fuse was still alight that herrick would not be captured alive the explosion when it came was so sudden so violent in colour and magnitude that it was hard to face harder still to gauge a solid wall of orange flame exploded from the rocks and spread out on either hand like huge fiery wings engulfing the circling boats searing away men and weapons and reducing them into ashes and then the sound came when it reached the frigate it was with a steadily mounting roar which went on and on until men stood clutching their ears or staring stupefied at the miniature tidal wave which rolled past the frigates hull lifting it easily before dissipating itself astern in the last departing shadows then it died away as did the fires leaving only tiny glowing pinpricks of red and orange like slowmatches to show where gorse and brush still smouldered on the hillside once again the sea and wind the sounds of tackle and canvas returned and bolitho heard men talking almost whispering as if they had just witnessed an act of god he said harshly brail up the forecourse mr davy he walked to the rail each step like physical pain mr shellabeer cast all but the quarter boat adrift he must keep talking get them moving again clear that dreadful pyre from his own brain he saw soames watching him and shouted load and run out if you please his words were almost lost in the flap and thunder of rebellious canvas as the big forecourse was brailed up to its yard like a curtain he thought dully pulled away for the final scene so that nothing should be missed he heard the port lids squeaking in unison and then as soames barked his command the gun crews threw themselves on their tackles and with increasing haste the black muzzles rumbled towards the daylight thrusting out above the creaming water on either beam davy touched his hat all guns run out sir he looked strained thank you bolitho kept his eyes on the dark hump astride the channel no flashes from those great muzzles it had worked even if the garrison managed to manhandle some of the guns from the far side of the fortressit would be too late to fire on undine as she surged into the drifting curtain of smoke he shaded his eyes and stared towards the spit of land the dark lines which marked the masts and yards of the first anchored ship soon soon he gripped the sword until his knuckles showed white he could feel the hurt and the anger the rising madness which only revenge for herrick would control and there was the sunlight growing stronger every dragging minute he climbed into the weather shrouds heedless of the wind and leaping spray which dappled his coat like bright gems abeam he could see undines shadow reaching away across the broken water his own blurred outline like part of the fabric itself he looked down at mudge get ready to alter course once we are past that spit he waited while those at the braces took the strain each man an individual now as the sunlight found his naked back or a tattoo or some extra long pigtail to mark a seasoned sailor he jumped down to the deck tugging at his neckcloth as if it were strangling him marines stand to bellairs had drawn his elegant hanger and was watching while his men nestled their long muskets on the closely packed hammock nettings at every open port a gun captain crouched with his lanyard almost taut as he watched for the first sign of a target the spit of land reached out as if to touch the bilges as the ship swept inshore her bow wave causing a ripple amongst some jagged rocks which bolitho remembered from his other visit braces there mudge shouted put the wheel to larboard lively now like a thoroughbred undine heeled round under pressure of canvas and rudder the yards swinging together as she turned into the sunlight steer noreast by east mudge heaved his ungainly bulk to assist the helmsmen old er you buggers there were several muffled bangs and a ball cracked through the foretopsail with the sound of a whiplash but bolitho barely noticed it he was staring at the anchored frigate the scrambling activity along her yards and deck where her company prepared for sea davy echoed his dismay shes not the argus sir bolitho nodded it was the other frigate the one which had been abandoned by her crew he screwed up his eyes trying to watch every movement still attempting to accept what had happened le chaumareys had gone by chance or had he once again proved his superiority a cunning which had never been outmatched almost savagely he lifted the old blade over his head and yelled starboard battery as you bear the sword caught the glare as it cut down fire the broadside roared and flashed along undines starboard side gun by gun each captain taking his aim while soames strode past every recoiling breech yelling and peering towards the enemy bolitho watched the smoke spouting from the ports and rolling towards the other ship which seemed suspended in the fog her hull lying almost diagonally across the starboard bow here and there a gun flashed out in reply and he felt the deck planking jerk under his feet as at least one ball smashed into the side the quarterdeck gun crews were all shouting and cursing as they too joined in the battle the stocky sixpounders hurled themselves inboard on the tackles the wildeyed seamen sponging out and ramming home fresh charges within seconds overhead and splashing violently into the channel on either beam came a fusilade of smaller shot from fortress or frigate bolitho neither knew nor cared as he paced briskly athwart the deck by the quarterdeck rail he saw nothing but the other ships raked masts the patch of colour from the prancing beast of her flag the rising pall of smoke as again and again undines broadside thundered into her once he chilled as he saw some charred flotsam bobbing past the quarter a headless corpse pirouetting in undines crisp bow wave tendrils of scarlet moving around it like obscene weed herrick had known the argus had gone he must have seen the anchorage long before anyone in undine he would never have faltered bolitho felt his eyes stinging again the hatred boiling inside him as the quarterdeck guns cracked out their sharp detonations making his mind cringe even as their crews scrambled with handspikes to edge their weapons round for another salvo herrick would have accepted it as he had in the past it was what he had lived for bolitho shouted aloud heedless of mudge and davy nearby god damn them for their plans and their stupidity keen called theyve cut their cable sir bolitho ran to the nettings feeling a musket ball punch into the deck by his feet it was true muljadis frigate was yawing sluggishly in wind and current her stern swinging like a gate across undines path someone must have lost his nerve or perhaps in the confusion of the exploding schooner and undines savage attack an order had been misunderstood he yelled well go alongside her stand by the topsl halliards put the helm alee as men dashed to the braces again and topsails flapped and thundered wildly to their sudden freedom undine turned deliberately to larboard her jibboom sweeping round until it pointed to the distant pier and the litter of smouldering craft left by the explosion soames bellowed point ready he was peering redeyed along his panting gun crews his sword held out like a staff drag that man away he ran forward to help pull a wounded seaman from a twelvepounder now his sword flashed down broadside this time the whole battery exploded in a single wall of flames the long tongues darting into the smoke making it rise and twist as if it too was dying in agony someone gave a hoarse cheer there goes th bastards fore bolitho ran to the gangway marines and seamen pounding behind him high above the smoke the nimble topmen were already hurling their steel grapnels jeering at one another as they raced even here to beat their opposite numbers on the other masts another cheer as with a shuddering lurch undine drove alongside the drifting frigate her bowsprit rising above the poop while the impetus carried them closer and closer together the guns still bellowed louder now as their fury matched across a bare thirty feet of tormented water boarders away bolitho waited gripping the main shrouds gauging the moment as soames roared cease firing at em lads cut the bastards down then he was across clinging to the enemys boarding nets which had been rent in great holes by the broadsides muljadis own plans must have been ready for there seemed to be hundreds of men surging to meet the cheering cursing rush of boarders muskets and pistols while from somewhere overhead a swivel banged out the packed canister tearing across the enemys quarterdeck hurling wood splinters and bodies in all directions a bearded face loomed out of the smoke and bolitho slashed at it holding to the nets to keep from falling outboard and being crushed between the hulls the man shrieked and dropped from view a marine thrust bolitho aside screaming like a madman as he pinned a man with his bayonet before wrenching out the blade and ramming the muskets butt into a wounded pirate who was trying to crawl out of the fight allday ducked under a cutlass and caught his attacker off balance he even pushed the man away with his left fist giving himself room for a proper stroke with his own blade it sounded like an axe on wood bellairs was striding in the centre of a squad of marines snapping unheard commands his elegant hanger darting in and out like a silver tongue as he forced his way aft towards the enemys quarterdeck another wave of insane cheering and bolitho saw soames leading his own boarding party up and over the frigates main shrouds muskets barking pointblank into the press below him his sword crossing with that of a tall lankhaired officer whom bolitho remembered as le chaumareys first lieutenant soames slipped and sprawled across an upended cannon and the frenchman drew back his arm for the fatal thrust but a marine was nearby the musket ball taking away most of the lieutenants skull and hurling him from the deck like a rag doll bolitho realised that allday was shaking him by the arm trying to make him understand something he yelled the hold captain he jabbed at the wide hatchways with his cutlass the bastards have set her afire bolitho stared at it his brain and mind reeling from the screams and cheers the grate of steel the madness of close action the smoke was already thicker perhaps allday was right or maybe a burning wad from one of undines guns had found its way into the hull when soames had sent his last broadside crashing home either way both ships would be destroyed unless he acted and at once he yelled captain bellairs fall back he saw bellairs gaping at him blood dripping unheeded from a gash on his forehead then he too seemed to get a grip on his own lust of battle and shouted sound the retreat he sought out his sergeant whose massive frame had somehow avoided both steel and musket ball coaker take that fools name if he dont do as i ask coaker gripped a small marine drummer boy but he was dead his eyes glazed and unseeing as coaker wrenched the trumpet from his hands and blew it with all his might it was almost harder to discontinue the battle thanto board the other frigate back and back here and there a man falling or being hauled bodily across the gap between the hulls to avoid capture the pirates had at last seen their own danger and without the french lieutenant in command they seemed intent only on abandoning their ship as quickly as they could the first tongue of flame licked through a hatch bringing a chorus of shrieks from the abandoned wounded and within seconds the gratings and surrounding boat tier were well ablaze bolitho gripped the ratlines and took a last look as his men threw themselves on to undines gangway forward shellabeers men were already cutting the lashing which held the hulls together and with the topsails once more braced round and the helm over undine began to sidle clear the wind holding the smoke and sparks away from her own canvas and vulnerable rigging mudge panted what now sir bolitho watched the frigate slipping past a few crazed men still firing across the widening gap he shouted a final broadside mr soames but it was already too late a great sheet of flame burst upwards through the vessels gun deck setting the broken foremast and sails alight and leaping to the mainyards like part of a forest fire bolitho heard himself reply get the forecourse on her and smartly with it well not be able to beat back the way we came that ships magazine will go at any moment so we will try the eastern channel mudge said may be too shallow sir would you burn mr mudge he strode to the taffrail to watch the frigate as the blaze engulfed the poop an english ship it were better this way he thought vaguely he turned and added harshly mr davy i want a full report of damage he waited seeing the wildness draining from his eyes and the bill for all this bolitho saw the yards edging round the sails pockmarked and blackened by the fight hardening to the wind the channel seemed wide enough about a cable to starboard more on the other side he had managed worse boat in the water sir keen was standing in the shrouds with his telescope just two men in it mudge called ill old er steady sir were steerin almost noreast again but i dunno the rest of his words were lost as keen yelled sir sir he stared down at bolitho his face shining with disbelief davy snapped keep your head mr keen but keen did not seem to hear its mr herrick bolitho stared at him and then clambered up beside him the boat was a wreck and the scrawny figure who was now standing to wave a scrap of rag above his head looked like a scarecrow lying in the bottom of the boat halfcovered with water was herrick as he held the telescope bolitho could feel his hands shaking violently and saw herricks face ashen beneath a rough bandage then he saw his eyes open imagined the other man shouting the news to him his words as plain as if he could hear them himself he said pass the word to the bosun i want that boat grappled alongside he gripped the midshipmans wrist and tell him to be careful therell be no second chance allday had gone below for something now he was back his eyes everywhere until bolitho said quietly the first lieutenant is coming aboard go forrard and bid him welcome for me eh as the frigate slipped past another shelving hump of land the sun came down to greet them to warm their aching limbs to hold the shock of battle at arms length a while longer a deep explosion came from the main channel and more smoke spouted high above the nearest land to show the wind which awaited them in open water and to sound the other vessels final destruction muljadi may or may not have been aboard and the real fight was still ahead bolitho heard shouts from forward and then a cheer as some seamen clambered into the sinking boat to pluck herrick and his companion back on board but whatever was waiting beyond the green humps of land no matter how hopeless their gesture might be they would be together in the kings name alter course two points bolitho tried to pace along the littered deck but was unable to overcome his anxiety it was an hour since they had edged into the eastern channel under minimum canvas and with two leadsmen in the chains they had felt their way towards the sea an hour of answering demands and listening to reports ten killed fifteen wounded half of them seriously considering what they had done it was a small enough bill but as he watched the familiar bundles awaiting burial or heard occasional cries from the main hatch he found little comfort in it if only allday would come on deck and tell him about herrick he had already questioned the surviving seaman it had been the little man called lincoln the one with the permanent grin made by a grotesque scar bolitho had watched him reliving it as he had stammered out his description oblivious to his captain and officers crowding around him and seemingly only half aware he was actually alive it had been much as bolitho had imagined herrick had decided to destroy the battery drive his schooner aground regardless of risk and the inevitability of death at the last moment with the fuse lit and the vessel being fired on from a hillside herrick had been struck by a falling block from the mainmast the little seaman had said in a whisper then up comes mister pigsliver as cool as you please take to th boat he shouts ive an old score to settle though e didnt say wot e meant like by then there was only three ands left so me an jethro lowers mr errick into the dory but tother bloke the little sailmaker named potter e decides to stay with the don he had given a great shudder so off we goes then the schooner blows up like the gates of ell an poor jethro was lost overboard i just kept paddlin and prayin that mr errick would stir to is senses an tell me wot to do he had paused sobbing soundlessly then i looks up an there she is large as life th old undine i shakes mr errick and calls to im look alive sir the ships a comin for us an ewelle just looks at me an says an wot did you expect bolitho had said quietly thank you lincoln i shall see you do not go unrewarded the little man had added an youll not forget to mention a piece about mister pigsliver sir ii mean e may be a don sir but but then he had broken down completely now as he moved restlessly past the sixpounders where the gun captainsknelt in the sunlight checking their equipment testing the tackles their bodies stained with smoke and dried blood bolitho said to himself no i will not forget deck there he looked up his eyes smarting in the glare open water ahead sir shoes scrapedby the cabin hatch and he swung round allday where the devil have you been but it was not allday bolitho strode across the deck and held out both hands thomas he gripped herricks hands in his oblivious to the watching faces on every side it dont know what to sayl herrick smiled sadly i am the same sir you should remain below until deck there ship to the eastrdt herrick withdrew his hands and replied quietly i am the first lieutenant sir he looked slowly around the quarterdeck at the protruding splinters and the flapping edges of torn hammocks where musket balls had ripped home my place is here davy crossed the deckand touched his hat beat to quarters again sir yes davy looked at herrick and smiled it seems you had no better luck in holding on to the schooner than i he added i am relieved you are here and thats the truth herrick touched the fresh bandage on his head and winced if it had not been sworn otherwise i would have said that don puigserver struck me down himself he was that eager to finish what we had begun he fell silent as the drums rattled out their tattoo and the lolling figures by guns and braces stirred themselves into life bolitho was watching the last shoulder of land sliding away the expanse of blue water and lively wavecrests growing and spreading to reveal an endless dazzling horizon to larboard her hull and spars black against the glare lay the argus she appeared to be moving very slowly her yards well braced to hold her on a converging tack herrick muttered four miles id say about that bolitho studied the other ship unable to look away she reminded him of a wild cat the way she edged across the busy whitecapped waves stealthy purposeful lethal he imagined he could hear the squeak of trucks as her smooth sides became barbed by gun muzzles le chaumareys was taking his time waiting for bolitho to make the first move he looked away at last feeling the tension returning but heavier than before perhaps le chaumareys had planned it this way distrusting his ally muljadi guessing that bolitho might bring off a stalemate if not a victory if he chose his own method of attack the undines company had fought hard he looked searchingly at the shot holes and punctured sails heard the hammers as pryke the portly carpenter and his mates got busy on repairs in the lower hull and knew it was asking much of them to fight yet again and to win against this great blackhulled veteran of the french navy then he glanced at those nearest him he needed every bit of skill and experience they possessed not least their courage well mr mudge what of the wind now itll get up sir mudge took out his handkerchief and blew his great nose violently might back a bit he gestured up at the masthead pendant it was stiff like a spear id suggest beggin yer pardon sir that you fights under topsails only bolitho turned to herrick what do you say herrick was watching the other ship his eyes like slits get to grips sir hell pound us to pieces with those long guns otherwise the deck lifted across the first true roller and spray drifted high above the nettings lets be about it then bolitho licked his parched lips get the forecourse off her he dropped his voice and have those corpses buried directly it does no good to see where some of us will end this morning herrick watched him calmly i can think of better reasons for dying he glanced at the motionless seamen by the guns but no better place for it bolitho walked to the rail and watched the argus for several minutes le chaumareys had a good position he had probably considered it very carefully he was over there now watching him expecting him to act to try and take the windgage or to alter course and attempt to cross his stern and cripple him with one good broadside as he passed the french frigate dipped to the swell showing her copper for several seconds the wind was tight across her exposed side but le chaumareys was holding back keeping on undines larboard bow barely making headway bolitho bit his lip his eyes running in the suns fierce stare his men would find it hard to shoot well into the blinding sunlight when he looked at the gun deck again he saw that corpses were gone herrick came aft and said all done he saw bolithos intent features and asked quietly is something wrong sir i think i am starting to understand le chaumareys he could feel his heart beginning to pound again the familiar chill at his neck and spine i think he wants us to have the windgage but sir herricks blue eyes darted to the argus and back again is the sun in our eyes of greater value to him understanding spread across his round face it might well be he can stand off and use his heavy artillery to better result bolitho turned his eyes flashing well its not to be mr herrick get the tgallants on her directly he added i am sorry mr mudge but if we lose the sticks out of her to your damned wind it may be better than losing them the other way herrick was already raising his speaking trumpet hands aloft loose tganslswhen he looked at bolitho again there was little to show what he had so recently endured by god sir what we miss in weight we can show that bastard in agility today bolitho grinned at him his lips painful alter course two points to starboard well run for his bows allday folded his arms and watched bolithos shoulders and then glanced up at the flag as it rippled in the freshening wind and that is all the running youll be doing im thinking east noreast sir carwithen had one hand resting on the polished spokes as the helmsmen concentrated on the compass and the set of the sails overhead steady as she goes mudge rubbed his hands on his coat shes movin well sir bolitho lowered his telescope and nodded thoughtfully the extra power of the topgallants was laying undine firmly in line across the other ships path argus had not set any additional sail yet he winced as the sunlight lanced down from the lens le chaumareys still held the best position he could alter course to leerd and present his broadside as undine tried to pass him equally he could allow her to cross his bows and while she lost time in changing tack he could take the windgage suns glare or not and attack him from the other side herrick said hoarsely hes holding the same course he may have let her fall off a point but theres nothing in it he breathed out slowly she makes a fair sight god rot her bolitho smiled tightly argus had barely changed her bearing but that was because undine had altered course to starboard she was much closer now a bare two miles so that he could see her red and yellow figurehead the purposeful movement of figures about her sloping quarterdeck there was a sudden bang and seconds later a thin waterspout rose lazily amongst the tossing wavecrests slightly ahead of undines path and half a cable short ranging shot or merely to unnerve undines own gun crew another of le chaumareys little ruses herrick muttered fervently if i know the frogs hell try and dismast us with chainshot and langridge another prize for his bloody allyp you dont know this frenchman mr herrick bolitho recalled le chaumareys face when he had spoken of home his france which he had been denied for so long my guess is hell want a complete victory the word made him feel uneasy he could even picture undine dismasted and wallowing amongst her own dead and dying before her final plunge like the one he himself had just destroyed like nervion and so many he had watched crumble and perish the stage was set two ships with not even a seabird to watch their manoeuvres their dedicated efforts to outwit each other there sir hes setting his tgallants carwithens voice jarred him from his thoughts herrick exclaimed he intends to outreach us after all bolitho watched intently as the arguss upper yards filled with freshlyset bulging canvas he could see the instant effect it had around her raked stem as she bit into the waves and thrust forward with sudden haste from his position behind the rail it looked to bolitho as if the other ships jibboom was actually touching his own although she was still over a mile away smoke wreathed above her hull and he held his breath as the bright tongues of fire licked from her exposed ports the sea boiled and shot skywards as the heavy balls ploughed into the windruffled water or ricocheted away far abeam one ball smashed hard down alongside the shock transmitting itself to the very mastheads trying to rattle our wits herrick was grinning but bolitho saw the anxiety behind his eyes le chaumareys had not seemed the kind of man who wasted gestures on the wind he was preparing his gun crews showing them the range probably telling them right now in his resonant voice exactly what he expected of them by god the devils shortening sail again bolitho saw the topgallants vanishing along the arguss yards and leaned across the rail stand by the larboard battery perhaps he had found le chaumareys one real weakness that he needed to win and to survive bolitho knew that the two did not always walk hand in hand alter course three points to larboard he heard the rush of feet the confused shouts as his orders were relayed to the waiting seamen mudge asked is that wise sir bolitho waited as the helm went down and then turned to watch the bowsprit swinging slowly and then more quickly to larboard the other frigate suddenly enmeshed in the crisscross of rigging and shrouds hold her so he waited impatiently while herrick bellowed through histrumpet and the hands on the braces hauled feverishly to retrim the yards noreast by north sir the helmsman sounded breathless with the wind sweeping tightly across the larboard quarter undine swept straight down towards the other ship as if to cut her in halves more flashes darted from the frenchmans side and bolitho clenched his fists as metal shrieked overhead parting rigging slapping through sails and hurling spray in profusion on either beam now we shall see bolitho craned forward gripping the rail his eyes stinging painfully in the hazy glare another rippling line of flashes the sounds of the broadside rolling across the water like the thunder of mighty drums he felt the hull stagger violently and saw some of the seamen below the quarterdeck exchanging quick desperate glances argus was still holding her course and speed lying across undines path and growing in size with every agonising minute more shots and a savage jerk below his feet told bolitho undine was being hit again but arguss broadsides were more ragged now and fewer balls were falling near their target herrick said fiercely hell have to do something bolitho did not reply but stared fixedly through his telescope at the cluster of figures on arguss quarterdeck he could see le chaumareys powerful bulk his small cropped head bobbing as he shouted commands to his subordinates he would be missing his first lieutenant bolitho thought quickly as he would have missed herrick but for their unlikely reunion he called the wind mr mudge he dared not look at him backed a point sir from the pendant id say it was near souwesterly herrick shouted argus is standing away sir somebody gave an isolated cheer but bolitho snapped keep the people quiet he added quickly stand by to alter course hard to larboard ill want her as close to the wind as you can lay her mr mudge he watched barely able to move as arguss yards edged round her outline shortening as she stood off making a triangle between the two converging ships she loosed another slow broadside and bolitho heard a scream from aloft then saw a marine fall headlong on to the nets blood gushing from his mouth and splashing on the gun crew immediately below him le chaumareys had mistaken bolithos headlong charge as an act of empty bravery he had waited for the right moment before swinging clear to present his full broadside to cripple undine completely as she attempted to cross the bows bolitho held up his hand praying that those flashing guns would give him time to act larboard battery fire as you bear relieved eager to hit back the gun crews pounced on their weapons stand by davy watched as soames hurried to the leading gun fire bolitho felt the hull quiver and drew breath again as the smoke billowed away from the hull towards the enemy stand by to alter course he held herricks gaze no we are not going to embrace him just yet he felt the insane grin on his lips well cross his stern he has left the door open a heavy ball smashed through the larboard bulwark upending a twelvepounder and painting the planking and gratings in bright spreading scarlet screams and curses were drowned as soames bellowed stop your vents sponge out he glared wildly through the smoke you manners take that handspike and move yourself damn you the man in question was gaping at his legs which had been spattered with blood and fragments from the neighbouring crew bolitho dropped his hand now helm alee to the mounting wind and the sudden change of direction undine swayed over and down the gun crews firing off another uneven salvo before argus was plucked from their open ports bolitho yelled mr davy starboard battery men dashed from the stillsmoking guns and threw themselves to assist the opposite side overhead spars and blocks strained and bucked in protest and more than one seaman fell headlong as the ship came thundering up close to the wind her yards almost foreand aft the fore topgallant sail split suddenly and violently the fragments like streamers in the wind but bolitho ignored it he was watching arguss black shape sliding out and away from the starboard bow while his own ship turned steeply towards her poop shots crashed into hull and rigging alike and bolitho watched sickened as two seamen were pulped into offal and broken weapons against the opposite side davys voice was almost a scream starboard battery as you bear the order to fire was lost in the first crash from the forward guns followed instantly along the deck as the argus loomed up and over the nettings like a black cliff sponge out reload run out the crews had no trouble in running out for the ship was heeling so steeply to the wind that each gun squealed down the deck like an enraged hog on the rampage bolitho cupped his hands hold your fire he gestured to the men by the carronades on the forecastle several corpses lay near them and he guessed le chaumareys marksmen had realised his intention a musket ball clanged against a sixpounder and one of the helmsmen fell kicking and spluttering his chin shot away by the ricochet bolitho shouted above the din let her fall off a point mr mudge you know what i expect today shadows danced across the decks as pieces of broken rigging blocks a musket and other fragments bounced on the nets above and here was the argus plunging heavily to starboard trying to follow undine round but losing the chance as the english frigate swept across her stern fire a carronade banged loudly biting fragments from arguss stern and smashing her small quartergallery to fragments gun by gun the twelvepounders followed its example the balls slamming into the stern or scything through the gaping windows to create death and confusion within men were cheering despite threats and blows from their petty officers and above the great writhing wall of smoke bolitho saw the french frigates masts moving slowly away and beyond the starboard quarter but it was no time to falter now we will wear ship mr herrick lay her on the starboard tack aye sir herrick wiped his streaming face above the stains on his cheeks and mouth his bandage shone in the filtered sunlight like a turban its lively work today sir man the braces stand by to wear ship a man screamed as he was dragged from a gun bleeding badly as whitmarshs mates lifted him he struggled and kicked to free himself more terrified of what waited below than of dying on deck sails thundering and spilling wind from countless shotholes undine changed tack yet again turning her bowsprit away from the islands and towards the sun the sea looked much wilder now with short wavecrests crumbling to the wind or throwing sheets of spray above the gangways with hardly a break bolitho wiped his eyes and tried to restrain from coughing like his eyes his lungs were raw with powder smoke the stench of battle he watched the other ship as she swam above the leaping spindrift willingly or not le chaumareys had the windgage and his ship now stood off undines starboard bow a bare cables length away if undine continued to overhaul her both ships would run parallel a musket shot apart argus would get her revenge at such a murderous range he glanced quickly at mudge he too was watching the sea and the masthead pendant but was it for the same reason but to ask him now to show that he was in need of a miracle and had nothing to replace one would take the fight out of his men no less than an instant defeat he saw them at their guns panting and gasping tarred hands gripping tackles and rammers sponges and handspikes their naked bodies were streaked with sweat which cut through the powder grime like the marks of a fine lash their eyes shone through their blackened faces as if trapped the marines were reloading their muskets and bellairs was strolling with his sergeant by the taffrail at the helm another had taken the dead mans place and carwithens coarse face was working on a plug of tobacco his eyes cold without expression there were fewer men on the gun deck although bolitho had not seen many fall yet they had gone had died or been maimed without a word from him to give reason for their sacrifice he reached out to steady himself as the deck tilted more steeply when he peered over the riddled hammocks he saw the seas face forming into short steep ranks ranging towards the two ships as if to push them away he yelled mr davy are yon ready davy nodded dully every gun loaded with chainshot sir good bolitho looked at herrick i hope to god that the master knows his weather in a sharper tone he added get the forecourse on her with the great foresail set and drawing undine began to overhaul the other ship at a remarkable pace bolitho flinched as more balls crashed alongside from arguss sternchasers one of them hurling the quarterboat into spinning pieces a last challenge that was what it had to look like gun to gun no quarter until undine was a sinking wreck he said we will alter course when i give the word he waited aching in ever muscle his mind jumping to each gunshot from the frenchmans poop undines jibboom seemed to be prodding her larboard quarter like a lance a few stabs of fire above her shattered stern showed where marksmen had taken fresh positions and bolitho saw two of his marines drop like red fruit from the foretop their cries lost to the mounting wind mudge said worriedly we may lose our sticks when we comes round sir bolitho ignored him ready lads he watched the sea rising and breaking against arguss opposite quarter the mounting pressure against her yards now he gripped the rail as the helm went over and the bows started to pull towards theenemy he saw argus trimming her yards the hull tilting steeply as she followed undines turn sunlight flashed on her quarterdeck and then her side exploded in a line of great flashes the air rent apart with the savagery of her broadside bolitho almost fell as the massive weight of iron crashed into the hull or screamed and tore through the rigging overhead he was choked by swirling smoke his mind reeling from the combined noises of screams and yells of musket fire from all angles somehow he dragged himself up the angled deck and peered towards the argus smoke was drifting from her last broadside so fast that undine seemed to be moving abeam to meet her the illusion told him mudge had been right and as he watched arguss sails bellying out towards him he also saw her gunports awash as the wind thrust her over thank god for the wind fire he had to repeat the order to make himself heard fire undines disengaged gunports were also awash and her runout battery was pointing almost towards the sky as each captain jerked his lanyard even above the roar of cannon fire and the wail of the wind bolitho heard the chainshot whimpering through the air and ripping into arguss fully exposed topsails and braced yards he heard too the immediate clatter of severed rigging the louder explosions of bursting stays and shrouds as foremast and maintopmast swayed together like great trees before booming and splintering into the smoke bolitho waved his sword above his head hold her steady mr mudge shell be alongside directly he ran to the gangway and then stopped dead as the wind sucked the smoke downwind and away from the two drifting hulls dead and wounded lay everywhere and as the marines ran to their places for boarding bolitho saw shellabeer mangled beneath a gun and pryke the carpenter pinned across a hatch coaming by a broken length of gangway his blood linking with all the rest around him and fowlar could that thing really be him but there was no more time to regret or to think argus was here alongside and as soames led his men across the bows bolitho shook his sword and yelled hoarsely over you go lads the french seamen were struggling to free themselves from the great tangle of spars and rigging the broken cordage lying in heaps like giant serpents but the steel was ready enough bolitho crossed swords with a petty officer and then slipped in some blood the breath driven from his body as the frenchman pitched headlong across him he felt the man jerk and kick saw the awful agony in his eyes as carwithen pulled him away a boarding axe locked into his collar bone on every hand men were fighting and yelling the pikes and bayonets waving above the more desperate work of sword and cutlass davy was heading for the quarterdeck ladder shouting to the men at his back when a rally of french seamen left him momentarily isolated and alone bolitho watched his contorted face above the thrusting shoulders saw his mouth shaping unheard screams as they cut him down their weapons not still even after he had dropped from sight midshipman armitage stood shaking on the gangway his skin like chalk as he shouted follow me then he too was dead pushed aside and trodden underfoot as the two opposing groups surged together again bolitho saw it all as he fought his way aft towards the main quarterdeck ladder saw it and recorded it in his mind but without sequence like a nightmare as if he were a mere onlooker he reached the ladder and saw the french lieutenant facing him the one named maurin who had an english wife the rest seemed to fade into a swirling embattled fog as the two swords reached out and circled each other bolitho said harshly strike maurin you have done enough l the frenchman shook his head it is not possible msieu then he lunged forward taking bolithos sword on the hilt and deftly turning it towards the sea bolitho let himself fall back to the next step seeing the desperation on maurins face knowing without understanding why that this man alone stood between victory and senseless slaughter le chaumareys is deadl bolitho tested the next step with his left foot am i not right he had to shout at the top of his voice as more of undines men burst yelling on to the gun deck and attacked the french crew from behind they must have climbed through the shattered stern bolitho realised dully again it was more of a reaction than anything he added coldly so for gods sake strike maurin hesitated the uncertainty plain on his face and then made up his mind he sidestepped and raised his hilt almost level with his eyes before lunging towards bolithos chest bolitho watched him with something like despair maurin had been too long in the one ship had forgotten the need for change it was easy too sickeningly easy bolitho took his weight on his foot parried the blade as it darted towards him and struck the lieutenants weight was more than enough and bolitho almost had the sword wrenched from his grip as maurin fell gasping to the deck below a pigtailed seaman raised his boarding pike but bolitho shouted touch him and ill kill you myself he saw herrick walking between the french seamen who were throwing their weapons on to the bloodied deck the fight over their strength going at the sight of maurins last gesture he thrust the sword into its scabbard and walked heavily up the last few steps he knew allday was behind him and herrick took his place at his side as together they stood in silence looking at le chaumareys body where it lay beside the abandoned wheel he looked strangely peaceful and amidst so much carnage and horror almost unmarked there was a dark stain below his shoulder and a small trickle of blood from a corner of his mouth probably one of bellairs sharpshooters bolitho thought vaguely bolitho said quietly well we did meet captain just as you said we would lieutenant soames knelt to unfasten le chaumareys sword but bolitho said leave it his was a bad cause but he fought with honour he turned away suddenly sick of the watching dead their pathetic stillness and cover him with his flag his proper flag he was no pirate he saw davys body being carried to the gangway and added a moment longer and he would have seen argus taken enough prizemoney even for his debts perhaps as they climbed across the trapped water between the drifting hulls bolitho turned startled as some of the seamen gathered to cheer him he looked at herrick but he shrugged and gave a sad smile i know how you feel sir but they are glad to be alive it is their way of thanking you bolitho touched his arm survival i suppose it is a fair cause for battle he forced a smile and for winning herrick picked up his hat and handed it to him ill set the people to work sir the pumps sound too busy for my liking bolitho nodded and walked slowly towards the stern his shoes catching at splinters and broken cordage by the taffrail he paused and looked wearily along his command at the broken planking and stained decks the figures which were picking their way amidst the debris more like survivors than victors then he leaned back and loosened his neckcloth and shook open his best dress coat which was torn and slashed in a dozen places above his head the flag was flapping more easily the sudden squall having passed on as quickly as it had arrived to save them from arguss great guns but for it he looked round suddenly anxious but saw mudge in his place near the helm cutting at a piece of cheese with a small knife which he had fished from one of his pockets he looked very old in the dusty sunlight little penn was squatting on a gun truck having his wrist bandaged and dabbing at his nose which had started to bleed when a charge had exploded prematurely nearby bolitho watched them with something like love mudge and penn age and innocence there was keen speaking with soames and looking very strained but a man now feet crunched on the debris and he saw noddall approaching him cautiously a jug of wine clasped against his chest i am afraid i cant yet find the glasses sir he kept his eyes fixed on bolithos face and had probably had them shut as he had groped past some of the horror below bolitho held the jug to his lips and said but this is some of my best wine noddall dabbed his eyes and smiled nervously aye sir all of it the rest was destroyed by the battle bolitho let the wine fill his mouth savouring it needing it they had come a long way since that shop in st jamess street he thought and in a few weeks they would be ready again the missing faces would still be remembered but without the pain which even now was getting stronger terror would emerge as bravado and courage be recalled as duty he smiled bitterly remembering the words from so long ago in the kings name he heard penn say in his squeaky voice i was a bit frightened mr mudge an awkward pause just a bit old mudge looked across the deck and held bolithos gaze frightened boy gawd ell never make a capn will e sir bolitho smiled sharing the moment with mudge alone for he knew better than most that the truth of battle was not for children then he looked along his command again at the gleaming shoulder of the proud figurehead below the bowsprit undine was the real victor he thought and he was suddenly grateful to have her to himself epilogue lieutenant thomas herrick stepped into the stern cabin and tucked his hat beneath his arm you sent for me sir bolitho was standing by the open windows his hands on a sill watching the weed on the seabed and tiny bright fish darting around the motionless rudder it was afternoon and along the shoreline of pendang bay the trees and green fronds waved and shone in a dozen hues to a steady breeze good sailing weather he thought absently but not for undiae not just yet he turned and gestured to a chair sit down thomas he saw herricks gaze resting on the opened despatches which had been brought aboard that day a brig from madras orders and news another indiaman will be arriving shortly thomas this despatch is from the admiral commanding the inshore squadron he is sending fresh hands to replace some of those we lost in battle how easily said lost in battle he glanced slowly around the cabin knowing that herrick was watching him sharing his memories there was little to show of the mauling the ship had suffered under le chaumareys guns fresh paint covered the repaired timbers and the smell of tar and woodshavings lingered throughout the hull a month and two days since they had gone alongside argus but despite the backbreaking work and the rewards of seeing the ship looking her old self again the pictures of the fight hung in bolithos mind as if it were yesterday and how they had worked perhaps like himself the rest of the company had needed it if only to hold the memories at bay a little longer small moments stood out when you least expected them midshipman penn crouching down as a gun recoiled inboard wreathed in smoke while its crew dashed forward again with sponge and rammer a man had been hurled to the deck in a wave of flying splinters had lain there staring unwinkingly at jthe sky penn had reached out to touch him and had tried to ump away as the man had reached out to seize his wrist he must have died at that very instant bolitho did not remember seeing the incident at the time but it had lurked in wait within his mind and armitage leading his squad of boarders after davy had fallen under those plunging blades the clumsy awkward midshipman blind with terror yet gathering his few reserves of strength only to find they were not enough and after the battle the smells and the sounds not least the surgeon fightingdrunk and being dragged bodily to his sickbay by three of his men when the wild cheering had given way to the realisation of victory they had faced up to their own immediate situation wounded to be tended the dead to be buried and the work begun without delay looking back it was surprising they had reached pendang bay at all bolitho thought fore and main lower yards badly sprung the mainmast itself so splintered and pitted that it was only quick work on stays and rigging which kept it upright the tasks had seemed unending more than a dozen holes below the waterline had kept the hands working at the pumps through every watch as with the battered argus in tow they had crawled painfully towards the land and safety the captured frigate had already sailed under juryrig for a yard in india where she would be quickly refitted and included in the companys own private fleet herrick asked any further instructions sir bolitho reached for a bottle of wine it is confirmed that pendang bay will be exchanged for another station now held by the dutch east india company he looked up seeing the astonishment in herricks eyes now that we have established the settlement the dutch are more than willing to make the exchange apparently he recalled with sudden clarity rear admiral conways face when the first despatch had been opened brought from madras by raymond himself he had said hoarsely so it was all for nothing raymond had looked away no sir the other settlement in the north is far more suitable to our requirements sir montagu strang has explained you will see that your part in all this is highly thought of later when raymond had left the room conway had said highly thought of but a new governor will be appointed bolitho had replied i am sorry sir it is a bitter victory bitter surprisingly he had laughed this sort of work is more for shopkeepers than sailors bolitho remember that well he pushed a goblet across the table and realised that herrick was still awaiting an answer once our replacements have been signed on we will maintain a local patrol until ordered otherwise he smiled gravely i am temporarily the senior officer in these waters not too surprising since undine is the only kings ship herrick grinned and well earned sir when i realised how you had put yourself inside the french captains mind i bolitho looked away if the wind had dropped thomas you might think differently lady luck sir the grin was broader there was a tap at the door and penn stepped into the cabin mr davys respects sir the indiaman has just weighed he said you wished to be told sir thank you bolitho waited for the door to close his heart suddenly heavy even penn had not helped keen now stood above as acting lieutenant and soames had replaced davy the same story one dies another profits herrick said quietly the indiamans sailing for madras sir our wounded will get better treatment there bolitho picked up his hat well see her off the sun across the quarterdeck was harsh enough but in the steady offshore wind felt less severe as with herrick he stood by the nettings to watch the deephulled indiaman spreading her topsails her paintwork and company flag very bright against the land bolitho looked along undines deck and saw the hands pausing in their work to watch the big ship as she tilted to the pressure her hull shining while she continued to tack clear of the anchorage thinking of home perhaps where the indiaman would eventually make her landfall or of old friends lying bandaged within her fat hull and of the others who were not here to see anything at all bolitho beckoned to penn your glass if you please only once had he been able to see viola raymond alone since undines return because of raymond or because she understood better than he that it was pointless to add to the pain of parting bolitho was still not certain a fine ship sir herrick too had a glass to think my old father wished me to go to sea in an indiaman things would have been very different i suppose bolitho tensedseeing the pale green gown on the ornate poop that same wide hat she had brought from santa cruz he could hear her words to him as if she had just spoken across the broad expanse of lively whitehorses in the bay if you come to london please visit me my husband has gained his promotion what he wanted what i thought i wanted too she had squeezed his hand i hope you got what you wanted from me a gun boomed dully from the settlement and another from the indiamans forecastle flags dipped in mutual respect bolitho felt the ache returning she was right there must be no pain only understanding peace as after a great gale of wind something which they had seized if only for a moment he thought of raymond going to a better appointment while conway returned to obscurity it was impossible to fathom while he was much as before except for that one moment or was he by trying to mould him as she would have wished her husband perhaps she had indeed changed him penn called signal sir from wessex to undine he was straining his eye to a telescope to watch the flags breaking from the indiamans yards as she laboriously spelled out her message good luck go with you acknowledge bolitho kept his eye on the pale green figure she was waving her hat slowly back and forth her autumn hair blowing unrestricted to the wind half to himself he said and with you my love some of the seamen were cheering and waving as the other vessel spread more canvas and heeled ponderously on a new tack bolitho handed the telescope to a ships boy and said well mr herrick herrick watched him and then nodded aye sir a glass of wine i think we deserve it bolitho held on to the mood keeping his eyes away from the indiaman as she stood purposefully towards the headland at least we have earned it allday watched them pass seeing bolithos hand touch his sidepocket where he carried his watch just a brief gesture but it told aliday a great deal he walked to the nettings and stared after the departing indiaman sail away my lady you have left your mark and for the better but a closer embrace he sighed neither of them would have weathered it keen joined him by the bulwark she makes a goodly sight eh allday allday looked at him aye sir you dont know the half of it but a bit too good for a poor sailorman sir keen walked away and began to pace the quarterdeck as he had watched bolitho do a hundred times or more he knew allday was laughing at him but did not care he had been tested and he had won through that was more than he had dared to hope and it was more than enough he paused by the skylight hearing bolithos laugh and herricks quiet rejoinder and he had shared all of it with them when he looked again for the indiaman she had slipped past the headland and gone from view he started to pace the deck once more actinglieutenant valentine keen of his majestys frigate undine was content span idepigraph to the contessa with love danger and death dance to the wild music of the gale and when it is night they dance with a fiercer abandon as if to allay the fears that beset the sailor men who feel their touch but see them not george h grant the admirals choice an admiralty messenger opened the door of a small anteroom and said politely if you would be so good as to wait sir he stood aside to allow captain richard bolitho to pass and added sir john knows you are here bolitho waited until the door had closed and then walked to a bright fire which was crackling below a tall mantel he was thankful that the messenger had brought him to this small room and not to one of the larger ones as he had hurried into the admiralty from the bitter march wind which was sweeping down whitehall he had been dreading a confrontation in one of those crowded waitingrooms crammed with unemployed officers who watched the comings and goings of more fortunate visitors with something like hatred bolitho had known the feeling too even though he had told himself often enough that he was better off than most for he had come back to england a year ago to find the country at peace and the gowns and villages already filling with unwanted soldiers and seamen with his home in falmouth an established estate and all the hardearned prize money he had brought with him he knew he should have been grateful he moved away from the fire and stared down at the broad roadway below the window it had been raining for most of the morning but now the sky had completely cleared so that the many puddles and ruts glittered in the harsh light like patches of pale blue silk only the steaming nostrils of countless horses which passed this way and that the hurrying figures bowed into the wind made a lie of the momentary colour he sighed it was march only just over a year since his return home from the west indies yet it seemed like a century whenever possible he had quit falmouth to make the long journey to london to this seat of admiralty to try and discover why his letters had gone unanswered why his pleas for a ship any ship had been ignored and always the waiting rooms had seemed to get more and more crowded the familiar voices and tales of ships and campaigns had become forced less confident as day by day they were turned away ships were laid up by the score and every seaport had its full quota of a wars flotsam cripples and men made deaf and blind by cannon fire others half mad from what they had seen and endured with the signing of peace the previous year such sights had become too common to mention too despairing even for hope he stiffened as two figures turned a corner below the window even without the facings on their tattered red coats he knew they had been soldiers a carriage was standing by the roadside the horses nodding their heads together as they explored the contents of their feeding bags the coachman was chatting to a smartly dressed servant from a nearby house and neither took a scrap of notice of the two tattered veterans one of them pushed his companion against a stone balustrade and then walked towards the coach bolitho realised that the man left clinging to the stonework was blind his head turned towards the roadway as if trying to hear where his friend had gone it needed no words the soldier faced the coachman and his companion and held out his hand it was neither arrogant nor servile and strangely moving the coachman hesitated and then fumbled inside his heavy coat at that moment another figure ran lightly down some steps and wrenched open the coach door he was well attired against the cold and the buckles on his shoes held the watery sunlight like diamonds he stared at the soldier and then snapped angrily at his coachman the servant ran to the horses heads and within seconds the coach was clattering away into the busy press of carriages and carts the soldier stood staring after it and then gave a weary shrug he returned to his companion and with linked arms they moved slowly around the next corner bolitho struggled with the window catch but it was stuck fast his mind reeling with anger and shame at what he had just seen a voice asked may i help sir it was the messenger again bolitho replied i was going to throw some coins to two crippled soldiers he broke off seeing the mild astonishment in the messengers eyes the man said bless you sir youd get used to such sights in london not me i was going to tell you sir that sir john will see you now bolitho followed him into the passageway again conscious of the sudden dryness in his throat he remembered so clearly his last visit here a month ago almost to the day and that time he had been summoned by letter and not left fretting and fuming in a waitingroom it had seemed like a dream an incredible stroke of good fortune it still did despite all the difficulties which had been crammed into so short a time he was to assume command immediately of his britannic majestys ship undine of thirtytwo guns then lying in the dockyard at portsmouth completing a refit as he had hurried from the admiralty on that occasion he had felt the excitement on his face like guilt aware of the other watching eyes the envy and resentment the task of taking command of gathering the dockyards resources to his aid to prepare undine for sea had cost him dearly with the navy being cut down to a quarter of its wartime strength he had been surprised to discover that it was harder to obtain spare cordage and spars rather than the reverse a weary shipwright had confided in him that dockyard officials were more intent on making a profit with private dealers than they were on aiding one small frigate he had bribed threatened and driven almost every man in the yard until he had obtained more or less what he needed it seemed they saw his departure as the only way of returning to their own affairs he had walked around his new command in her dock with mixed feelings above all the excitement and the challenge she represented gone were the pangs he had felt in falmouth whenever he had seen a manofwar weathering the headland below the castle but also he had discovered something more his last command had been phalarope a frigate very similar to undine if slightly longer by a few feet to bolitho she had been everything perhaps because they had come through so much together in the west indies at the battle of the saintes he had felt his precious phalarope battered almost to a hulk beneath him there would never could never be another like her but as he had walked up and down the stone wall of the dock he had sensed a new elation halfway through the hurried overhaul he had received an unheralded visit from rear admiral sir john winslade the man who had greeted him at the admiralty he had given little away but after a cursory inspection of the ship and bolithos preparations he had said i can tell you now im sending you to india thats all i can reveal for the moment he had run his eye over the few riggers working on yards and shrouds and had added dryly i only hope for your sake youll be ready on time there was a lot in what winslade had hinted officers on halfpay were easy to obtain to crew a kings ship without the urgency of a war or the pressgang was something else entirely had undine been sailing in betterknown waters things might have been different and had bolitho been a man other than himself he might have been tempted to keep her destination a secret until he had signed on sufficient hands and it was too late for them to escape he had had the usual floweryworded handbills distributed around the port and nearby villages he had sent recruiting parties as far inland as guildford on the portsmouth road but with small success and now as he followed the messenger towards some high gilded doors he knew undine was still fifty short of her complement in one thing bolitho had been more fortunate undines previous captain had kept a shrewd eye on his ships professional men bolitho had taken charge to discover that undine still carried the hard core of senior men the warrant officers a first class sailmaker and one of the most economical carpenters he had ever watched at work his predecessor had quit the navy for good to seek a career in parliament or as he had put it ive had a bellyful of fighting with iron from now on my young friend ill do it with slander rear admiral sir john winslade was standing with his back to a fire his coattails parted to allow the maximum warmth to reach him few people knew much about him he had distinguished himself vaguely in some singleship action off brest and had then been neatly placed inside the admiralty there was nothing about his pale austere features to distinguish him in any way in fact he was so ordinary that his goldlaced coat seemed to be wearing him rather than the other way round bolitho was twentyseven and a half years old but had already held two commands and knew enough about senior officers not to take them at face value winslade let his coattails drop and waited for bolitho to reach him he held out his hand and said you are punctual it is just as well we have much to discuss he moved to a small lacquered table some claret i think he smiled for the first time it was like the sunlight in whitehall frail and easily removed he pulled up a chair for bolitho your health captain he added i suppose you know why i asked for you to be given this command bolitho cleared his throat i assumed sir that as captain stewart was entering politics that you required another for winslade gave a wry smile please bolitho modesty at the expense of sincerity is just so much tophamper i trust you will bear that in mind he sipped at his claret and continued in the same dry voice for this particular commission i have to be sure of undines captain you will be on the other side of the globe i have to know what you are thinking so that i can act on such despatches as i might receive in due course bolitho tried to relax thank you he smiled awkwardly i mean for your trust sir quite so winslade reached for the decanter i know your background your record especially in the recent war with france and her allies your behaviour when you were on the american station reads favourably a full scale war and a bloody rebellion inamerica must have been a good schoolroom for so young a commander but that war is done with it is up to us he smiled slightly some of us to ensure that we are never forced into such a helpless stalemate again bolitho exclaimed we did not lose the war sir we did not win it either that is more to the point bolitho thought suddenly of the last battle the screams and yells on every side the crash of gunfire and falling spars so many had died that day so many familiar faces just swept away others had been left like the two ragged soldiers to fend as best they could he said quietly we did our best sir the admiral was watching him thoughtfully i agree you may not have won a war but you did win a respite of sorts a time to draw breath and face facts you think the peace will not last sir an enemy is always an enemy bolitho only the vanquished know peace of mind oh yes we will fight again be sure of it he put down his glass and added sharply now about your ship are you prepared bolitho met his gaze i am still short of hands but the ship is as ready as she will ever be sir i had her warped out of the dockyard two days ago and she is now anchored at spithead awaiting final provisioning how short two words but they left no room for manoeuvre fifty sir but my lieutenants are still trying to gather more the admiral did not blink i see well its up to you in the meantime i will obtain a warrant for you to take some volunteers from the prison hulks in portsmouth harbour bolitho said its a sad thing that we must rely on convicts they are men that is all you require at the moment as it is you will probably be doing some of the wretches a favour most of em were to be transported to the penal colonies in america now with america gone we will have to look elsewhere for new settlements there is some talk of botany bay in new holland but it may be rumour of course he stood up and walked to a window i knew your father i was saddened to hear of his death while you were in the west indies i believe he did not wait for a reply this mission would have been well cut for him something to get his teeth into selfdependence decisions to be made on the spot which could make or break the man in command everything a young frigate captain dreams of right yes sir he pictured his father as he had last seen him the very day he had sailed for the indies in phalarope a tired broken man made bitter by his other sons betrayal hugh bolitho had been the apple of his eye four years older than richard he had been a born gambler and had ended in killing a brother officer in a duel worse he had fled to america to join the revolutionary forces and later to command a privateer against the british it had been that knowledge which had really killed bolithos father no matter what the doctor had said he tightened his grip on his glass much of his prize money had gone into buying back land which his father had sold to pay hughs debts but nothing could buy back his honour it was fortunate that hugh had died if they had ever met again bolitho imagined he might kill him for what he had done more claret winslade seemed absorbed with his own thoughts im sending you to madras there you will report to well it will be in your final orders no sense in idle gossip he added just in case you cannot get your ship manned eh ill get them sir if i have to go to cornwall i hope that will not be necessary winslade changed tack again during the american campaign you probably noticed that there was little cooperation between military and civilian government the forces on the ground fought the battles and confided in neither that must not happen again the task i am giving you would be better handled by a squadron with an admirals flag for good measure but it would invite attention and that parliament will not tolerate in this uneasy peace he asked suddenly where are you staying in london the george at southwark i will give you an address a friends residence in st jamess square he smiled at bolithos grave features come dont look so gloomy it is time you made your way in affairs and put the line of battle behind you your mission may bring you to eyes other than those of jaded flag officers get to know people it can do nothing but good i will send a courier with instructions for your first lieutenant he darted him a quick glance herrick i gather from your last ship yes sir it sounded like of course there had never been any doubt whom he would ask for if he got another ship well then mr herrick it is he can take charge of local matters ill need you in london for four days he hardened his tone as bolitho looked about to protest at least the admiral regarded bolitho for several seconds craving to get back to his ship uncertain of himself in these overwhelming surroundings it was all there and more besides as bolitho had entered the room it had been like seeing his father all those long years ago tall slim with that black hair tied at the nape of his neck the loose lock which hung above his right eye told another story once as he had raised his glass it had fallen aside to display a livid scar which ran high into the hairline winslade was glad about his choice there was intelligence on bolithos grave features and compassion too which even his service in seven years of war had not displaced he could have picked from a hundred captains but he had wanted one who needed a ship and the sea and not merely the security such things represented he also required a man who could think and act accordingly not one who would rest content on the weight of his broadsides bolithos record had shown plainly enough that he was rarely content to use written orders as a substitute for initiative several admirals had growled as much when winslade had put his name forward for command but he had got his way for winslade had the weight of parliament behind him which was another rarity he sighed and picked up a small bell from the table you go and arrange to move to the address i will give you i have much to do so you may as well enjoy yourself while you can he shook the bell and a servant entered with bolithos cocked hat and sword winslade watched as the man buckled the sword deftly around his waist same old blade eh he touched it with his fingers it was very smooth and worn and a good deal lighter than more modern swords bolitho smiled aye sir my father gave it to me after i know forget about your brother bolitho he touched the hilt again your family have brought too much honour for many generations to be brought down by one man he thrust out his hand take care i daresay there are quite a few tongues wagging about your visit here today bolitho followed the servant into the corridor his mind moving restlessly from one aspect of his visit to another madras another continent and that sounded like a mere beginning to whatever it was he was supposed to do every mile sailed would have its separate challenge he smiled quietly and reward he paused in the doorway and stared at the bustling people and carriages open sea instead of noise and dirt a ship a living vital being instead of dull pretentious buildings a hand touched his arm and he turned to see a young man in a shabby blue coat studying him anxiously what is it the man said quickly im chatterton captain i was once second lieutenant in the warrior seventyfour he hesitated watching bolithos grave face i heard you were commissioning sir i was wondering im sorry mr chatterton i have a full wardroom yes sir i had guessed as much he swallowed i could sign as masters mate perhaps bolitho shook his head it is only seamen i lack im afraid he saw the disappointment clouding the mans face the old warrior had been in the thick of it she was rarely absent from any battle and men had spoken her name with pride now her second lieutenant was waiting like a beggar he said quietly if i can help he thrust his hand into his pocket tide you over awhile thank you no sir he forced a grin not yet anyway he pulled up his coat collar as he walked away he called good luck captain bolitho watched him until he was out of sight it might have been herrick he thought any of us his majestys frigate undine tugged resentfully at her cable as a stiffening southeasterly wind ripped the solent into a mass of vicious whitecaps lieutenant thomas herrick turned up the collar of his heavy watchcoat and took another stroll across the quarterdeck his eyess slitted against a mixture of rain and spray which made the taut rigging shine in the poor light like black glass despite the weather there was still plenty of activity on deck and alongside in the pitching store boats and water lighters here and there on the gangways and right forward in the eyes of the ship the red coats of watchful marines made a pleasant change from the mixtures of dull grey elsewhere the marines were supposed to ensure that the traffic in provisions and lastmoment equipment was one way and none was escaping through an open port as barter for cheap drink or other favours with friends ashore herrick grinned and stamped his feet on the wet planking they had done a lot of work in the month since he had joined the ship others might curse the weather the uncertainties offered by a long voyage the prospect of hardship from sea and wind but not he the past year had been far more of a burden for him and he was glad no thankful to be back aboard a kings ship he had entered the navy when he was still a few weeks short of twelve years old and these last long months following the signing of peace with france and the recognition of american independence had been his first experience of being away from the one life he understood and trusted unlike many of his contemporaries herrick had nothing but his own resources to sustain him he came of a poor family his father being a clerk in their home town of rochester in kent when lie had gone there after paying off the phalarope and saying his farewell to bolitho he had discovered things to be even worse than he had expected his fathers health had deteriorated and he seemed to be coughing his life away day in day out herricks only sister was a cripple and incapable of doing much but help her mother about the house so his homecoming was seen in rather different ways from his own sense of rejection a friend of his fathers employer had gained him an appointment as mate in a small brig which earned a living carrying general cargo up and down the east coast and occasionally across the channel to holland the owner was a miserly man who kept the brig so shorthanded that there were barely enough men to work ship let along handle cargo load lighters and keep the vessel in good repair when he had received bolithos letter accompanied by his commission from the admiralty charging him to report on board undine he had been almost too stunned to realise his good fortune he had not seen bolitho since that one last visit to his home in falmouth and perhaps deep inside he had believed that their friendship which had strengthened in storm and under bloody broadsides would be no match for peace their worlds were after all too far apart bolithos great stone house had seemed like a palace to herrick his background his ancestry of seafaring officers put him in a different sphere entirely herrick was the first in his family to go to sea and that was the least of their differences but bolitho had not changed when they had met on this same quarterdeck a month ago he had known it with that first glance it was still there the quiet sadness which could give way to something like boyish excitement in the twinkling of an eye above all bolitho too was pleased to be back keen to test himself and his new ship whenever a chance offered itself a midshipman scuttled over the deck and touched his hat cutters returning sir he was small pinched with cold he had been aboard just three weeks thank you mr penn thatll be some new hands i hope he eyed the boy unsympathetically now smarten yourself the captain may be returning today he continued his pacing bolitho had been in london for five days it would be good to hear his news to get the order to sail from this bitter solent he watched the cutter lifting and plunging across the whitecaps the oars moving sluggishly despite the efforts of the boats coxswain he saw the cocked hat of john soames the third lieutenant in the sternsheets and wondered if he had had any luck with recruits in the phalarope herrick had begun his commission as third lieutenant rising to bolithos secondincommand as those above him died in combat he wondered briefly if soames was already thinking of his own prospects in the months ahead he was a giant of a man and in his thirtieth year three years older than herrick he had got his commission as lieutenant very late in life and by a roundabout route mostly as far as herrick could gather in the merchant service and later as masters mate in a kings ship tough selftaught he was hard to know a suspicious man quite different from villiers davy the second lieutenant as his name suggested he was of good family with the money and proud looks to back up his quicksilver wit herrick was not sure of him either but told himself that any dislike he might harbour was because davy reminded him of an arrogant midshipman they had carried in phalarope feet thumped on deck and he turned to see triphook the purser crouching through the drizzle a bulky ledger under his coat the purser grimaced evil day mr herrick he gestured to the boats alongside god damn those thieves theyd rob a blind man so they would herrick chuckled not like you pursers eh triphook eyed him severely he was stooped and very thin with large yellow teeth like a mournful horse i hope that was not seriously meant sir herrick craned over the dripping nettings to watch the cutter hooking on to the chains god their oarsmanship was bad bolitho would expect far better and before too long he snapped easy mr triphook but i was merely reminding you i recall we had a purser in my last ship a man called evans he lined his pockets at the peoples expense gave them foul food when they had much to trouble them in other directions triphook watched him doubtfully what happened captain bolitho made him pay for fresh meat from his own purse cask for cask with each that was rotten he grinned so be warned my friend hell have no cause to fault me mr herrick he walked away his voice lacking conviction as he added you can be certain of that lieutenant soames came aft touching his hat and scowling at the deck as he reported five hands sir ive been on the road all day im fair hoarse from calling the tune of those handbills herrick nodded he could sympathise he had done it often enough himself five hands they still needed thirty even then it would not allow for death and injury to be expected on any long voyage soames asked thickly any more news none just that we are to sail for madras but i think it will be soon now soames said good riddance to the land i say streets full of drunken men prime hands we could well do with he hesitated with your permission i might take a boat away tonight and catch a few as they reel from their damn ale houses eh they turned as a shriek of laughter echoed up from the gun deck and a woman her breasts bare to the rain ran from beneath the larboard gangway she was pursued by two seamen both obviously the worse for drink who left little to the imagination as to their intentions herrick barked tell that slut to get below or ill have her thrown over the side he saw the astonished midshipman watching the spectacle with wideeyed wonder and added harshly mr penn jump to it i say soames showed a rare grin offend your feelings mr herrick herrick shrugged i know it is supposed to be the proper thing to allow our people women and drink in harbour he thought of his sister anchored in that damned chair what he would give to see her running free like that portsmouth trollop but it never fails to sicken me soames sighed half the bastards would desert otherwise signed on or not the romance of madras soon wears off when the rum goes short herrick said what you asked earlier i cannot agree it would be a bad beginning men taken in such a way would harbour plenty of grievances one rotten apple can sour a full barrel soames eyes him calmly it seems to me that this ship is almost full of bad apples the volunteers are probably on the run from debt or the hangman himself some are aboard just to see what they can lay their fingers on when we are many miles from proper authority herrick replied captain bolitho will have sufficient authority mr soames i forgot you were in the same ship there was a mutiny it sounded like an accusation not of his making he turned on him angrily be so good as to have the new men fed and issued with slop clothing he waited watching the resentment in the big mans eyes he added another of our captains requirements i suggest you acquaint yourself with his demands life will be easier for you soames strode away and herrick relaxed he must not let him get into his skin so easily but any criticism or even hint of it always affected him to herrick bolitho represented all the things he would like to be the fact he also knew some of his secret faults as well made him doubly sure of his loyalty he shook his head it was stronger even than that he peered over the nettings towards the shore seeing the walls of the harbour battery glinting like lead in the rain beyond portsmouth point the land was almost hidden in murk it would be good to get away his pay would mount up and go towards helping out at home with his share of prize money which he gained under bolitho in the west indies he had been able to buy several small luxuries to make their lot easier until his next return and when might that be two years it was better never to contemplate such matters he saw a ships boy duck into the rain to turn the hourglass beside the deserted wheel and waited for him to chime the hour on the bell time to send the working part of the watch below he grimaced the wardroom might be little better soames under a cloud of inner thought davy probing his guard with some new smart jest or other giles bellairs the captain of marines well on the way to intoxication by this time knowing his hefty sergeant could deal with the affairs of his small detachment triphook probably brooding over the issue of clothing to the new men typical of the purser he could face the prospect of a great sea voyage with each league measured in salt pork and beef ironhard biscuit juice to prevent scurvy beer and spirits to supplement fresh water which would soon be alive in its casks and all the thousand other items under his control with equanimity but one small issue of clothing while they still wore what they had come aboard in was too much for his sense of values he would learn he grinned into the cold wind they all would once bolitho brought the ship alive more shouts from alongside and penn the midshipman called anxiously beg pardon sir but i fear the surgeon is in difficulties herrick frowned the surgeons name was charles whitmarsh a man of culture but one with something troubling him most ships surgeons in herricks experience had been butchers nobody else would go to sea and face the horrors of mangled men screaming and dying after a savage battle with the enemy in peacetime he had expected it might be different whitmarsh was a drunkard as herrick peered down at the jolly boat as it bobbed and curtsied at the chains he saw a boatswains mate and two seamen struggling to fit the surgeon into a bowline to assist his passage up the side he was a big man almost as large as soames and in the grey light his features shone with all the brightness of a marines coat herrick snapped have a cargo net lowered mr penn it is not dignified but neither is this by god whitmarsh landed eventually on the gun deck his hair awry his face set in a great beaming smile one of his assistants and two marines lifted him bodily and took him aft below the quarterdeck he would sleep in his small sickbay for a few hours and then begin again penn asked nervously is he unwell sir herrick looked at the youth gravely a thought tipsy lad but well enough to remove a limb or two i daresay he relented and touched his shoulder go below your relief will be up soon he watched him hurry away and grinned it was hard to recall that he had been like penn unsure frightened with each hour presenting some new sight and sound to break his boys illusions a marine yelled guardboat shovin off from the sallyport sir herrick nodded very well that would mean orders for the undine he let his gaze move forward between the tall spiralling masts with their taut maze of shrouds and rigging the neatly furled canvas and to the bowsprit below which undines beautiful fullbreasted figurehead of a waternymph stared impassively to every horizon it also meant that bolitho would be returning today and for thomas herrick that was more than enough free of the land captain richard bolitho stood in the shelter of the stone wall beside the sallyport and peered through the chilling drizzle it was afternoon but with the sky so overcast by low cloud it could have been much later he was tired and stiff from the long coach ride and the journey had been made especially irritating by his two jovial companions businessmen from the city of london they had become more loudvoiced after each stop for change of horses and refreshment at the many inns down the portsmouth road they were off to france in a packet ship to contact new agencies there and so with luck expand their trade to bolitho it was still hard to accept just a year back the channel had been the only barrier between this country and their common enemy the moat the last ditch as some newssheet had described it now it seemed as if it was all forgotten by such men as his travelling companions it had become merely an irritating delay which made their journey just so much longer he shrugged his shoulders deeper inside his boatcloak suddenly impatient for the last moments to pass so that he could get back to the ship the cloak was new from a good london tailor rear admiral winslades friend had taken him there and managed to do so without making bolitho feel the complete ignoramus he smiled to himself despite his other uncertainties he would never get used to london too large too busy where nobody had time to draw breath and noisy no wonder the rich houses around st jamess square had sent servants out every few hours to spread fresh straw on the roadway the grinding roar of carriage wheels was enough to wake the dead it had been a beautiful house his hosts charming if slightly amused by his questions even now he was still unsure of their strange ways it was not just enough to live in that fine fashionable residence with its splendid spiral staircase and huge chandeliers to be right you had to live on the best side of the square the east side winslades friends lived there bolitho smiled again they would bolitho had met several very influential people and his hosts had given two dinner parties with that in mind he knew well enough from past experience that without their help it would have been impossible aboard ship a captain was next only to god in london society he hardly registered at ail but that was behind him now he was back his orders would be waiting and only the actual time of weighing anchor was left to conjecture he peered round the wall once more feeling the wind on his face like a whip the signal tower had informed undine of his arrival and very soon now a boat would arrive at the wooden pier below the wall he wondered how his coxswain allday was managing his first ship as captains coxswain but bolitho understood him well enough to know there was little to fear on his behalf it would be good to see him too something familiar a face to hold on to he glanced up the narrow street to where some servants from the george inn where the coach had finally come to rest were guarding his pile of luggage he thought of the personal purchases he had made maybe london had got some hold on him after all when bolitho had got his first command of the sloop sparrow during the american revolution he had had little time to acquaint himself with luxuries but in london with the remains of his prize money he had made up for it new shirts and some comfortable shoes this great boatcloak which the tailor had assured him would keep out even the heaviest downpour it had been partly winslades doing he was certain of that his host had casually mentioned that bolithos mission in undine required not merely a competent captain but one who would look the part no matter what sort of government official he might meet there was he had added gently a matter of wine together they had gone to a lowbeamed shop in st jamess street it was not a bit what bolitho might have imagined it had the sign of a coffee mill outside its door and the owners names pickering and clarke painted in gold leaf above it was a friendly place even intimate it could almost have been falmouth it was to be hoped the wine had already arrived aboard undine otherwise it was likely he would have to sail without it and leave a large hole in his purse as well it would be a strange and exciting sensation to sit in his cabin hundreds of miles from england and sample some of that beautiful madeira it would bring back all those pictures of london again the buildings the clever talk the way women looked at you once or twice he had felt uneasy about that it had reminded him bitterly of new york during the war the boldness in their faces the confident arrogance which had seemed like second nature to them an idler called yer boats acomin capn he touched his hat ill give ee a and he hurried away to call the inn servants his mind dwelling on what he might expect from a frigates captain bolitho stepped out into the wind his hat jammed well down over his forehead it was the undines launch her largest boat the oars rising and falling like gulls wings as she headed straight for the pier it must be a hard pull he thought otherwise allday would have brought the gig he found he was trembling and it was all he could do to prevent a grin from splitting his face in two the dark green launch the oarsmen in their checked shirts and white trousers it was all there like a homecoming the oars rose in the air and stood like twin lines of swaying white bones while the bowman made fast to the jetty and aided a smart midshipman to step ashore the latter removed his hat with a flourish and said at your service sir it was midshipman valentine keen a very elegant young man who was being appointed to the undine more to get him away from england than to further his naval advancement bolitho suspected he was the senior midshipman and if he survived the round voyage would probably return as a lieutenant at any rate as a man my boxes are yonder mr keen he saw allday standing motionless in the sternsheets his blue coat and white trousers flapping in the wind his tanned features barely able to remain impassive theirs was a strange relationship allday had come aboard bolithos last ship as a pressed man yet when the ship had paid off at the end of the war allday had stayed with him at falmouth servant guardian trusted friend now as his coxswain he would be ever nearby sometimes an only contact with that other remote world beyond the cabin bulkhead allday had been a seaman all his life but for a period when he had been a shepherd in cornwall where bolithos pressgang had found him an odd beginning bolitho thought of his previous coxswain mark stockdale a battered exprizefighter who could hardly speak because of his maimed vocal cords he had died protecting bolithos back at the saintes poor stockdale bolitho had not even seen him fall allday clambered ashore everythings ready captain a good meal in the cabin he snarled at one of the seamen grab that chest you oaf or ill have your liver the seaman nodded and grinned bolitho was satisfied alldays strange charm seemed to be working already he could curse and fight like a madman if required but bolitho had seen him caring for wounded men and knew his other side it was no wonder that the girls in farms and villages around falmouth would miss him better though for allday bolitho decided there had been rumours enough lately about his conquests
