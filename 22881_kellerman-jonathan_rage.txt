jonathan kellerman rage book in the alex delaware series to my mother sylvia kellerman special thanks to larry malmberg pi and detective miguel porras chapter on a slow chilly saturday in december shortly after the lakers overcame a sixteenpoint halftime deficit and beat new jersey i got a call from a murderer i hadnt watched basketball since college had returned to it because i was working at developing my leisure skills the woman in my life was visiting her grandmother in connecticut the woman who used to be in my life was living in seattle with her new guy temporarily she claimed as if i had a right to care and my caseload had just abated three court cases in two months two childcustody disputes one relatively benign the other nightmarish and an injury consult on a fifteenyearold girl whod lost a hand in a car crash now all the papers were filed and i was ready for a week or two of nothing id downed a couple of beers during the game and was nearly dozing on my living room sofa the distinctive squawk of the business phone roused me generally i let my service pick up why i answered i still cant say dr delaware i didnt recognize his voice eight years had passed speaking whos this rand now i remembered the same slurred voice deepened to a mans baritone by now hed be a man some kind of man where are you calling from rand im out out of the cya i uh yeah i finished as if it had

westwood village i think lemme see i heard a clang as the phone dropped phone on a cord traffic in the background a pay booth he was off the line for over a minute it says westwood theres this big uh

you hungry i ate breakfast its dinnertime i guess see you in twenty okay thanks you sure theres nothing you want to tell me before you see me like what anything at all more traffic noise time stretched rand im not a bad person chapter what happened to kristal malley was no whodunit the day after christmas the twoyearold accompanied her mother to the buyrite plaza in panorama city the promise of megasale deep discounts had stuffed the shabby fading mall with bargainhunters teenagers on winter break loitered near the happy taste food court and congregated among the cd racks of flip disc music the blacklit box of din that was the galaxy video emporium pulsed with hormones and hostility the air reeked of caramel corn and mustard and body odor frigid air blew through the poorly fitting doors of the recently closed indoor iceskating rink kristal malley an active moody toddler of twentyfive months managed to elude her mothers attention and pull free of her grasp lara malley claimed the lapse had been a matter of seconds shed turned her head to finger a blouse in the sale bin felt her daughters hand slip from hers turned to grab her found her gone elbowing her way through the throng of other shoppers shed searched for kristal calling out her name screaming it mall security arrived two sixtyyearold men with no professional police experience their requests for lara malley to calm down so they could get the facts straight made her scream louder and she hit one of them on the shoulder the guards restrained her and phoned the police valley uniforms responded fourteen minutes later and a storebystore search of the mall commenced every store was scrutinized all bathrooms and storage areas were inspected a troop of eagle scouts was summoned to help k units unleashed their dogs the canines picked up the little girls scent in the store where her mother had lost her then overwhelmed by thousands of other smells the dogs nosed their way toward the malls eastern exit and floundered the search lasted six hours uniforms talked to each departing shopper no one had seen kristal night fell buyrite closed two valley detectives stayed behind and reviewed the malls security videotapes all four machines utilized by the security company were antiquated and poorly maintained and the blackandwhite films were hazy and dark blank for minutes at a time the detectives concentrated on the time period immediately following kristal malleys reported disappearance even that wasnt simple the machines digital readouts were off by three to five hours finally the right frames were located and there it was long shot of a tiny figure dangling between two males kristal malley had been wearing sweatpants and so did the figure tiny legs kicked three figures exiting the mall at the east end nothing more no cameras scanned the parking lot the tape was replayed as the ds scanned for details the larger abductor wore a lightcolored tshirt jeans and light shoes probably sneakers short dark hair from what the detectives could tell he seemed heavily built no facial features the camera posted high in a corner picked up frontal views of incoming shoppers but only the backs of those departing the second male was shorter and thinner than his companion with longer hair that appeared blond he wore a darkcolored tee jeans sneakers sue kramer said they look like kids to me i agree said fernie reyes they continued viewing the tape for an instant kristal malley had twisted in her captors grasp and the camera caught seconds of her face too distant and poorly focused to register anything but a tiny pale disk the lead detective a dii named sue kramer had said look at that body language shes struggling and no ones noticing said her partner fernando reyes pointing to the stream of shoppers pouring in and out of the mall people flowed around the little girl as if she were a piece of flotsam in a marina everyone probably figured they were horsing around said kramer dear god lara malley had already viewed the tape through tears and hyperventilated breathing and she didnt recognize the two abductors how can i she whimpered even if i knew them theyre so far away kramer and reyes played it for her again and again six more times with each viewing she shook her head more slowly by the time a uniform entered the security room and announced the fathers here the poor woman was nearly catatonic figuring the video arcade attracted kids to the mall the detectives brought in galaxys owner and the two clerks whod been on duty brothers named lance and preston kukach acned highschool dropout geeks barely out of their teens it took only a second for the owner to say the tape stinks but thats troy he was a fiftyyearold caltechtrained engineer named al nussbaum whod made more money during three years of renting out video machines than a decade at the jet propulsion labs that day hed taken his own kids horseback riding had come in to check the receipts which ones troy said sue kramer nussbaum pointed to the smaller kid in the dark tshirt he comes in all the time always wears that shirt its a harley shirt see the logo here his finger tapped the back of the tee to kramer and reyes the alleged winged logo was a faint gray smudge whats troy s last name said kramer dont know but hes a regular nussbaum turned to lance and preston the brothers nodded fernie reyes said what kind of kid is he guys asshole said lance caught him trying to steal scrip once said preston he leaned over the counter right when i was there and grabbed a roll when i took it away he tried to whale on me but i kicked his butt and you let him come back said nussbaum the clerk flushed weve got a policy nussbaum told the detectives you steal youre out top of that he hit you preston kukach stared at the floor whos the other one said sue kramer pointing to the larger boy preston kept his head down if you know spit it out al nussbaum demanded dont know his name hes here once in a while never plays what does he do said sue kramer hangs out with who troy always troy yeah troy plays and this one hangs yeah al nussbaum said now that you know who they are why arent you going after them pronto finding that kid reyes turned to the clerks what does hanging consist of he stands around while troy plays said lance he ever try to steal head shakes from the kukach brothers ever see either of them with little kids nope said lance never said preston what else can you tell us about them said reyes shrugs anything guys this is serious spit it out said al nussbaum lance said i dunno but maybe they live close by why do you say that said sue kramer because i seen em leaving and walking out to the parking lot and keep going onto the street no one picked em up in a car yknow leaving at which exit the one that goes out to the parking lot al nussbaum said three exits go out to the parking lot lance the one near the garbage said lance fernie reyes glanced at his partner and left no body in the dumpsters out back near the eastern exit five more hours of neighborhood canvass finally idd the two boys both of them lived in a lowincome housing project set like a scar across the scrubby park that paralleled the rear of the mall two hundred shoddily built federally financed onebedroom units distributed among a quartet of threestory buildings ringed by chainlink fencing in which dozens of holes had been cut a scruffy prisonlike place well known by uniforms who patrolled the area city they called it after the penal code for disturbing the peace the manager of building watched the video for a second and pointed to the smaller boy troy turner you guys been out here before on him last week matter of fact really said sue kramer yeah he smacked his mother with a dinner plate busted up the side of her face the manager massaged his own unshaved cheek before that he was scaring some of the little kids scaring them how grabbing and shoving waving a knife you guys shoulda locked him up so whatd he do whos the bigger one said reyes randolph duchay kind of a retard but he doesnt cause problems he done something its probably causea troy how old are they said fernie reyes lemme see said the manager troy s twelve i think maybe the other ones thirteen chapter the detectives found the boys in the park there they were sitting in the dark on some swings smoking the lighted ends of their cigarettes orange fireflies sue kramer could smell the beer from yards away as she and reyes approached rand duchay tossed his can of bud onto the grass but the smaller one troy turner didnt even try to hide it taking a deep swig as she came facetoface with him staring right back at her with the coldest fuckyou eyes shed seen in a long time ignore the eyes and he was a surprisingly small fraillooking kid with pipestem arms and a pale triangular face under a mop of untrimmed dirtyblond hair hed shaved his head clean at the sides which made the topgrowth look even bigger the manager had said he was twelve he couldve passed for younger randolph duchay was goodsized and broadshouldered with wavy short brown hair and a puffy thicklipped face plagued by wetlooking zits his arms had already started to pop veins and show some definition him sue wouldve placed at fifteen or sixteen big and scared sues flashlight picked up his fear right away the sweat on his brow and nose a bead of moisture rolled off his pimply chin repeated eyeblinks she moved right in on him pointed a finger in his face wheres kristal malley randolph duchay shook his head started to cry where is she she demanded the kids shoulders rose and fell he slammed his eyes shut and began rocking she hauled him to his feet fernie was doing the same to troy turner asking the same question turner tolerated being frisked with passivity his face was as blank as a sidewalk sue put pressure on duchays arm the kids biceps were rock hard if he resisted hed be a challenge her gun was on her hip holstered out of reach where the hell is she randy rand said troy turner he aint no randy wheres kristal rand no response she squeezed harder dug her nails in duchay squawked and pointed to the left past the swings and across the play area to a pair of cinderblock public lavatories shes in the bathroom said fernie reyes rand duchay shook his head where is she sue growled tell me now duchay pointed in the same direction but he was looking somewhere else to the right of the lavs south side of the cinder block where a corner of dark metal stuck out park dumpsters oh lord she cuffed duchay and put him in the back of the crown victoria ran over to look by the time she got back troy was cuffed too sitting next to his bud still unruffled fernie waited outside the car when he saw her he raised an inquisitive eyebrow sue shook her head he called the coroner the boys had made no attempt to conceal kristals body lay atop five days worth of park refuse fully clothed but with one shoe off the white sock underneath was grimy at the toe the childs neck was broken like that of a castoff doll delicate neck like that sue figured hoped she had died instantaneously several days later the coroner verified her guess several broken cervical vertebrae a ruptured windpipe concomitant cranial bleeding the body also bore two dozen bruises and internal injuries that could have proved fatal no evidence of sexual assault does it really matter said the pathologist whod done the post a usually tough guy named banerjee when he reported to sue and fernie he looked defeated and old placed in a holding cell at the station randnotrandy duchay hunched immobile and silent he had stopped crying and his eyes were glassy and trancelike his cell stank sue had smelled that feral reek plenty of times fear guilt hormones whatever troy turners cell smelled faintly of beer the cans the detectives had found indicated each boy had downed three buds with troy s body weight not an insignificant amount but there was nothing spacey about him dryeyed calm he spent the ride to the station glancing out the window of the unmarked as it passed through dark valley streets as if this were a field trip when sue asked him if there was anything he wanted to say he gave a strange little grunting noise a grumpy old mans sound annoyed like theyd messed up his plans whats that troy his eyes became slits sue had two kids including a twelveyearold son turner freaked her out she forced herself to outstare him and he finally looked away and gave another grunt something on your mind troy yeah what can i have a smoke both boys as it turned out were thirteen and troy was the older one a month from fourteen neither had known kristal malley as the papers reported it the pair had run out of change as they left the video arcade they spied the little girl wandering around the mall looking lost deciding it would be cool to fool around they gave kristal some stale candy from rand s gritty jeans pocket and she accompanied them willingly despite evidence to the contrary implications of sexual assault laced the local coverage the story was picked up by the national press and the wire services tilting toward the lurid feeding sensation to their international clients that brought the usual swarm of talking heads public intellectuals and other misery pimps sounding off oped editors found themselves in a buyers market the obvious root cause of such an outrage was poverty rampant societal breakdown media violence junk food and poor nutrition the erosion of family values godlessness the failure of organized religion to meet the needs of the underclass the absence of moral training in school truancy insufficient government funding for social programs too much government control over the lives of the citizenry one genius a pundit funded by the ford foundation attempted to connect the crime to the postchristmas sale season pernicious materialism had led to frustration had led to murder acquisitional rage he called it the same thing happens all the time in the favelas of brazil shop till you drop it on someone milo had remarked at the time what an asshole we hadnt discussed the case much and id done most of the talking he has solved hundreds of homicides but this one bothered him the media noise lasted awhile over at the hall of justice the legal process kicked in stealthy and gray the boys were placed in the high power ward at the county jail with both of them too young to qualify for a hearing to determine if they could be tried as adults most experts felt the disposition would end up in juvenile court citing the brutality of the crime the district attorneys office made a special request to kick the case up to superior court troy turner and randolph duchays court appointed pds filed papers in strong opposition a couple more days of editorial columns were devoted to that matter then another lull as briefs were written and a hearing judge was appointed juvey judge thomas a laskin iii a former da with experience prosecuting gang members had a rep as a hard case courtroom whispers said it was going to get interesting i got the call three weeks after the murder dr alex delaware tom laskin weve never met but judge bonnaccio said youre the man for the job peter bonnaccio had been presiding judge of superior court family division for a couple of years and id testified before him i hadnt liked him much at first thinking him hasty and superficial when making custody decisions id been wrong he talked fast cracked jokes was sometimes inappropriate but plenty of thought went into his decisions and he was right more often than not i said what job is that judge tom im the lucky guy who got handed the kristal malley murder and i need the defendants evaluated psychologically the main issue obviously is was there enough mature forethought and mental capacity prior to and during the commission of the crime to qualify the defendants for full adult psychological capacity the das broken new ground but from what ive seen the sixteenyear minimum for a isnt inviolate issue two and this is as much personal as official id like to know what makes them tick i have three kids of my own and this one makes no sense to me its a tough one i agreed unfortunately i cant help you pardon im not the man for the job why not psychological tests can reveal how someones functioning intellectually and emotionally in the present but they say nothing about past state of mind on top of that they were developed to measure things like learning disabilities and giftedness not homicidal behavior in terms of what made these boys tick my trainings even less helpful were good at creating rules about human behavior but lousy at understanding exceptions were talking bizarre behavior here said laskin isnt that your bailiwick ive got opinions but theyre just that my personal point of view all i want to know is were they thinking like kids or like grownups theres nothing scientifically definitive i could say about that if other shrinks tell you different theyre lying he laughed pete bonnaccio said you could get like this which is exactly why i called you everything i do on this one is going to be put under the microscope the last thing i need is one of the usual expert whores turning it into a circus i didnt take petes word that you were unbiased i talked to some other judges and a few cops even people who think youre a compulsive painintheass admit youre not doctrinaire what i need here is an open mind but not so open your brain falls out are you openminded i said what do you mean you really havent made up your mind i heard him breathing rapidly then slower as if forcing himself calm no i havent made up my mind doctor i just had a look at the autopsy photos went by the jail and looked at the defendants too in jail duds with their hair cut they look like they got kidnapped themselves it just doesnt make sense i know but cut the crap doctor ive got solid citizens clamoring for vengeance and the aclu and their buddies wanting to make political hay bottom line ill evaluate the data and make up my own mind but i need to be sure ive got the best information if its not you evaluating those boys itll be someone else probably one of the whores you want to opt out of your civic duty fine next time something bad happens tell yourself you did your best impressive guilt trip hey he said laughing whatever works so how about it talk to them test them do whatever the hell you want and report directly to me let me think about it dont think too long okay decided yet i need to be clear i said i could end up with no recommendation on adult versus juvey ill deal with that if and when it happens id need unlimited access i said and no time pressure yes to the first no to the second im due to rule within thirty days i can extend it to fortyfive maybe sixty but if i dont act in a timely manner it leaves me open to all sorts of appeal static you in okay i said whats your fee i told him stiff he said but not out of line send your bill directly to me you might even get paid within a reasonable amount of time comforting thats all the comfort youre going to get on this one chapter social services had evaluated the boys families before settling them in the housing project it took a subpoena but i got the records troy turner jr lived with his mother a twentyeightyearold alcoholic and cocaine addict named jane hannabee shed been in and out of rehab for most of her adult life and had spent two years as a teenager at the state mental hospital in camarillo her diagnoses ranged from mood disorder depressed type to personality disorder narcissisticborderline type to schizoaffective disorder meaning no one really understood her during her attempts at treatment troy had been sent to her parents in san diego troy s grandfather a retired army sergeant found the boys wild ways intolerable hed been dead for seven years his wife for six a habitual felon and addict named troy wayne turner was the boys alleged father jane hannabee claimed that at age fifteen shed shared a rock and a onenight stand with the thirtynineyearold in a san fernando motel turner had recently turned to bank robbery to support his habit and after his tryst with hannabee was caught fleeing from a bank of america in covina sentenced to ten years at san quentin he succumbed three years later to liver disease never meeting or acknowledging his son shortly after her boys arrest jane hannabee had left city for parts unknown rand duchays parents were longdistance truckers whod perished on the grapevine in a thirtyvehicle winter pileup six months old at the time of the crash rand had been riding in the truck swaddled in a storage compartment behind the front seat he had survived without obvious injury lived all his life with his grandparents elmer and margaret sieff uneducated people whod failed at farming and a number of small businesses elmer died when rand was four and margaret afflicted with diabetes and circulatory problems moved to the project when her money ran out the way the social workers saw it shed done her best as far as i could tell neither boy had spent much time in school and no one had noticed i put in my request to visit the prisoners and the adas assigned to the case requested a prior meeting so did the boys deputy public defenders i didnt need priming by either side and refused when all the lawyers protested i had judge laskin run interference a day later i was authorized to enter the jail id been to the county jail before was used to the grayness the wait the gates the forms the squinty scrutiny by reflexively suspicious deputy sheriffs as i stood in the sally port i knew the high power ward too had visited a patient there years ago another kid whod teetered over the edge as i walked down the corridor with a deputy escort moans and giggles sprayed from distant cells and the air filled with the battling stenches of excreta and disinfectant the world might change but this place didnt psych evaluations had been ordered alphabetically randolph duchay first he was curled up on a cot in his cell facing front but sleeping i motioned to the deputy to hold back and took a few seconds to observe big for his age but in the cold unadorned custard yellow space he looked insignificant the furnishings were a sink a chair a lidless toilet a shelf for personal items that was bare weeks behind bars had left him sallow with sooty halfmoons under his eyes and chapped lips and a slack face ravaged by furious acne his hair had been clipped short even from a distance i could see the scourge of pimples stretching up into his scalp i motioned that i was ready and the deputy unlocked the cell as the door clicked behind me the boy looked up dull brown eyes barely took the time to focus before closing the deputy said i pass through every quarter hour you need me sooner holler i thanked him put my briefcase down sat in the chair when he left i said hello rand im dr delaware hlo hoarse phlegmy voice barely above a whisper he coughed blinked several times remained prone got a cold i said head shake how are they treating you no response then he half sat remaining slumped so low that his trunk nearly paralleled the cot big torso disproportionately short legs his ears were lowset flaring on top folded over in an odd way stubby fingers webbed neck a mouth that never fully closed his front teeth were small and ragged the overall picture soft signs suggestions of abnormality that didnt qualify for any formal syndrome im a psychologist rand know what that is kinda doctor right know what kind hnnh psychologists dont give shots or examine your body he flinched like any other inmate hed been subjected to the full course of physical scrutiny i said i deal with how youre feeling emotionally his eyes floated upward i touched my forehead whats in your mind like a shrink you know about shrinks crazy nuts shrinks are for crazy nuts hnnh who told you that rand gram your grandmother hnnh what else did she say about shrinks if i didnt do right shed send me to a shrink hnnh what does do right mean bein good how long ago did your grandmother tell you that he thought about that seemed to be really working at figuring it out gave up and stared at his knees was it after you were in jail or before before was your grandmother angry at you when she said it kinda what made her angry his grainy skin reddened stuff stuff i said no answer has gram been to see you here i guess you guess yeah how often does she come sometimes she have anything else to say silence nothing i said she brang me to eat whats she bring you oreos he said shes mad whys that because i ruined it ruined what everything howd you do that his eyes fluttered the lids dropped my sin your sin killing that baby he lay back down flung an arm over his eyes you feel bad about that i said no answer killing the baby i prompted he rolled away from me faced the wall how do you feel about what happened to the baby rand several seconds passed rand he laughed who laughed troy troy laughed hnnh when when he hit her troy laughed when he hit kristal silence did troy do anything else to kristal he was inert for nearly a minute then rolled back toward me his eyelids lifted halfway licked his lips this is tough to talk about i said small nod what else did troy do to the baby sitting up with the stiff labored movements of an old man he encircled his own neck with his hands and pantomimed choking more than mime his eyes widened his face turned scarlet his tongue thrust forward i said troy choked the baby his knuckles whitened as he squeezed harder thats enough rand he began to rock as his fingers dug into his flesh i got up pried his hands loose strong kid it took some doing he gasped made a retching sound flopped back down i stood by his side until his breathing slowed he drew his knees up toward his chest pressure marks splotched his neck i made a note to request suicide watch dont do that again rand sorry you feel bad about what happened to the baby no response you watched troy choke and hit the baby and thinking about it makes you feel really bad someones radio spat a hiphop number footsteps from afar sounded but no one approached i said you feel bad about watching troy he mumbled whats that rand his lips moved soundlessly what rand the deputy whod escorted me strolled by scanned the cell and moved on fifteen minutes hadnt passed the staff was taking special care rand he said i hit her too for the next week i saw him every day for two hourly sessions once in the morning once in the afternoon instead of opening up he regressed refusing to divulge anything more about the murder much of my time was devoted to formal testing the clinical interview was a challenge some days he remained resolutely mute the most i could hope for were passive monosyllabic answers to yesno questions when i brought up the abduction he seemed confused about why hed participated more stunned than horrified part of that was denial but i suspected his low intellect was also a factor when you comb through the histories of seriously violent kids you often find head injuries i wondered about the crash that had killed his parents but had spared him obvious damage his wechsler intelligence scores were no shock full score iq of with severe deficits in verbal reasoning language formation factual knowledge and mathematical logic tom laskin wanted to know if hed been functioning as an adult when he killed kristal malley even if rand was thirtyfive years old that mightve been a relevant question the tat and the rorschach were pretty much useless he was too depressed and intellectually impoverished to produce meaningful responses to the cards his peabody iq score was no higher than the more verbally influenced wechsler his drawaperson was a tiny limbless stick figure with two strands of hair and no mouth my request to freedraw elicited a blank stare when i suggested he draw himself and troy he resisted by feigning sleep just draw anything then he lay there breathing through his mouth his acne had grown even worse suggesting a dermatologic consult would have elicited smirks from the jail staff rand hnnh draw something cant why not his mouth twisted as if his teeth hurt cant sit up and do it anyway my hard tone made him blink he stared at me but couldnt hold it past a few seconds pitiful attention span maybe part of that was sensory deprivation due to being locked up but my guess was hed always had trouble concentrating i handed him the pencil and the paper and the drawing board he sat there for a while finally put the board in his lap gripped the pencil the point froze on the paper draw i said his hand began circling lazily floating above the paper finally making contact as he created flabby barely visible concentric ellipses the page began to fill darker ellipses his eyes shut as he scrawled for two weeks hed done that a lot blinding himself to his hellish reality today his pencil hand moved faster the ellipses grew more angular flatter darker sharpening to jagged spearlike shapes he kept going tongue tip snaking between his lips the paper became a storm of black his free hand fisted and gathered the hem of his jail shirt as his drawing hand moved faster the pencil dug in and the page puckered ripped he slashed downward circled faster digging in harder as the paper shredded the pencil went through to the drawing board hit the glossy fiberboard surface and slid out from his hand landing on the floor of the cell he moved quickly retrieved it exhaled held the yellow nub in a grubby moist palm sorry the paper was confetti the pencils graphite tip had broken off leaving behind splintered wood sharp little spikes i took the pencil put it in my pocket after my final visit walking to the subterranean parking lot i heard someone call my name and turned to see a heavy woman in a flowered dress leaning on an aluminum cane the dirtymilk sky matched her complexion id awakened to sunny blue beverly glen firmament but cheer had eluded the grimy corner of east la dominated by the jail she took a few steps toward me and the cane clunked on pavement youre the psychologist right im rand s gram i walked to her held out my hand margaret sieff she said in a smokers voice her free arm remained at her side the dress was a scratchylooking cotton print relenting at the seams camellias and lilies and delphiniums and greenery sprawled across an aqua background her hair was white short curly thinning so severely that patches of pink scalp shone through blue eyes took me in small sharp searching eyes nothing like her grandsons you been here all week but i never heard from you you don figger to talk to me i plan to when im finished evaluating rand evaluatin the word seemed to distress her what you figger you can do for him ive been asked by judge laskin to i know all that she said youre supposed to say was he a kid or an aldult aint that cristo clear what im askin is what can you do for him whats crystal clear mrs sieff the boys dumb screwy she pinged her waxy forehead with an index finger dint talk till he was four still dont talk so good youre saying rand s im saying randolph aint never gonna be no aldult which was as good a diagnosis as the jargon in my notes behind her rising above both of us the concrete grid of the jail was the worlds largest window shade you coming or going maam my appointments not for a coupla hours with the buses from the valley its hard to figger so i get here early cause if im late those bastards don lemme in at all how about a cup of coffee you payin i am then fine chapter jails spread a very specific commercial rash a trickledown of cheap lawyers bailbond outfits translation services fastfood joints i knew of a hamburger stand nearby but the walk through the parking lot was too much for margaret sieffs stiff legs she waited by the entrance as i pulled up in my car when i got out to open her door she said fancydancy caddy must be nice being rich my seville s a with a rebuilt engine at that time it was well into its third vinyl roof and a second paint job was already losing the battle with corrosive air i took her cane and braced her elbow as she struggled to get in when she finally settled she said how much they payin you to evaluate i said thats not your concern maam that made her smile i drove to the burger joint set her up at an outdoor table went inside and waited in line behind a motorcycle cop whod outgrown his tailored shirt an ada who looked fifteen and a pair of scruffy mustachioed guys with faded gang tattoos those two paid with coins and it took awhile for the kid behind the counter to do the math when i finally reached the front i ordered two cardboardflavored coffees when i returned to margaret sieff she said im hungry i went back in and got her a cheeseburger she snatched the food from me ate ravenously made token attempts at daintiness quick dabs of paper napkin on mottled chin before returning to her spirited attack that hit the spot she said scraping ketchup onto a finger and licking it off i tell you sometimes i could eat five a those what do you want to tell me about rand other than him being a dummy mustve been hard raising him everythings hard she said raising his mama was hard your daughter had problems tricia was a dummy just like him so was that fool she went and married it was his fault they got killed all those speeding tickets and his drinking so they give him a truck she laughed idjits thats who they give a truck to i said tricia had trouble in school her glare said she was starting to doubt my intelligence thats what i said aint it what kind of trouble she sighed when she even bothered to go to school she hated reading hated rithmetic hated everything we were in arizona back then and mostly she snuck away and ran around the desert with bad influences where in arizona instead of answering she said it was hot as hell my husbands big idea he was gonna grow cactuses because he heard you could make big money growing cactuses and selling em to tourists be easy margie no water just keep em in pots till theyre big enough yeah and make sure the dog dont eat em and die from spikes in the guts then you have to set up a stand on the highway and breathe all that heat and dust and hope some touristll bother to stop she gave her empty cup another glance i sat at that stand day after day watching people speed right by me people going somewhere she pouted guess what even cactus need water she held out her cup i got her a refill so tricia grew up in arizona i said and nevada and oklahoma and before that we lived in waco texas and before that southern indiana so what this aint about where we lived its about randolph and the bad thing he did she pressed forward against the table bosom settling on greasespotted blue plastic okay i said lets talk about that her lips folded inward tugging her nose downward her blue eyes had darkened to granite pebbles i told him dont be hanging with that little monster now all our lives is turned to shit troy turner mister i dont even want to hear that name sinful monster i knew hed get randolph in trouble she finished the refill squeezed the cup and folded it over placed her hand over the misshapen wad her mouth trembled didnt think it would be trouble like this what scared you about troy me i werent scareda that little shit i was worried for randolph cause hes stupid does whatever you tell him is troy stupid hes evil you wanna do somethin useful sir tell the judge that without bad influence randolph never woulda never coulda done anything like this and thats all im gonna say about it cause randolph s lawyer said you werent necessarily on our side im on no ones side mrs sieff the judge appointed me so that i could the judge is against us we were some rich nigger it would be different she snapped and from where im sittin what youre doins a waste of time and money cause randolph dont have a chance hes gonna get sent somewhere could be an aldult jail or could be someplace with little monsters she shrugged her eyes were wet and she

she struggled upright stood bracing herself with her cane take me back okay i get over there too late those bastards gonna love lockin me out chapter idrove margaret sieff back to the jail went home and picked up messages rand duchays pd a man named lauritz montez had left two he didnt bother with small talk youre finished with my client so can we finally talk feel free to state any relevant facts mr montez only one fact doctor but its the crucial one randys obviously impaired no way you couldnt have found that whats the extent of it no one called the kid randy i said itll all be in my report spare me said montez this isnt the stuff of forensic debate i said you know how it goes judge laskin sees everything first yeah yeah so whatd you think of that grandmother you bought her lunch see that as conflict of interest im pretty busy mr montez easy just kidding so what do you think of her seriously at the risk of repeating myself come on doctor you cant be harboring any serious doubt about competence you might want to know that im having my own expert conduct a full psychometric battery herbert davidson endowed professor from stanford acknowledged authority in the field read his textbook in grad school i said be a shame if your results run far afield from his be a damn shame i said so when do i get your report when judge laskin sends it to you sure he said following orders god forbid anyone should think independently troy turner was housed as far from rand as possible in a corner cell past a dark twist of corridor the deputy who walked me over said youre gonna love this one he was an ironpumper named sherrill with a shaved head and a massive strawcolored mustache usually he projected the confidence of a strong man today he looked distracted tough kid i said he slowed his pace i got kids four of my own plus a stepkid on top of that i spent three years working juvey crime so i understand kids unlike some of the other guys i know punks can start off as victims but this one he shook his head he do something in here i said naw its just the way he is he stopped behind us were empty cells doc if anything im telling you gets out were never going to have any trust between us this is off the record i mean it he said im talking to you because word is youre straight and youre doing your best for judge laskin and we all respect judge laskin cause he knows the way the real world is i waited he looked over his shoulder stopped again silence all around only on high power could a jail be this quiet up a few feet was an occupied cell and i could see the inmate checking us out wellgroomed grayhaired middleaged copy of time magazine in one hand sherrill drew me farther up the hall muttering that ones russian mafia cut your throat as easy as smile at you when we were alone he said i dont talk much to prisoners lifes too short why fill your life with garbage but this one being a kid i tried to be friendly turner reacts by shining me on completely making like im invisible one time id been offshift and when i got back he looked like hed lost some weight i brought him some breakfast threw in some extra toast because he seemed pitiful he snatched up a piece gobbled like a hyena i asked him if he understood why he was in here this time he doesnt shine me on he comes right out and says causa what i did but not with any feeling he couldve been ordering fries and a coke then he takes another piece of toast from the breakfast tray and looks me in the eye and starts chewing real slowly real sloppy pieces are falling out of his mouth and then he starts dribbling and drooling rolling his eyes acting like an idiot like its a big joke i stand there and he keeps it up and then he spits it all out on the floor and says what like im annoying him and i say you didnt answer my question dude whyre you in here and he says i fucked that baby up is why then he grinds the toast into the floor with his foot and says this shit sucks dude gimme some real food remorseful i said doc god help me for saying it if you repeat this ill totally deny it but some sperm deserve to be drowned before they get a chance to swim chapter small boy stick arms heartshaped face expectant brown eyes widened as i entered his cell the pinched wounded features of a dickensian orphan i introduced myself he said pleased to meet you it rolled out easy like a rehearsed line but if there was sarcasm i wasnt catching it i sat down and he said that chairs not real comfortable not much choice around here i said you kin sit on the bed and i kin sit there thanks troy but im fine okay he straightened his posture rested a hand on each knee i took out my notepad looked at his hands narrow white longfingered hands grimy around the cuticles but the nails had been clipped neatly delicate hands it wouldnt take much strength to strangle a baby but still troy im a psychologist to talk to me about my feelings someone told you that miz weider sydney weider was his primary pd shed been more persistent than lauritz montez about meeting me before i began my evaluation had gotten aggressive when i refused laskin had termed her a pit bull mark my word shes already making notes for the appellate attorneys what did ms weider tell you about me youre gonna ask questions and i should cooperate he smiled as if demonstrating i said is there anything you want to talk about i guess he said whats that i should talk about her her the baby everyone calls her a baby i said but she was more like a toddler right the term was new to him i guess kristal was two years old troy she walked and talked a little i didnt hear her talk ever see her before no way i said whyd you decide to take her she followed us where out out of the mall yeah the camera had caught kristal dangling kicking her legs the police had assumed it was a struggle but both defense briefs suggested that all three kids had been horsing around as if that mattered i said whyd kristal follow you shrug can you think of any reason at all troy probably she thought we were cool why would she think that cause she was little and were big big is cool yup okay i said kristal followed you and then what happened we went to the park and smoked and had some beer all of you yup whered you get the beer his eyes half closed suddenly wary we had it you had it with you at the mall from before whered you keep it at the park where at the park hesitation behind a tree hidden yup so you drank and smoked all three of you yup kristal drank and smoked she tried to she wasnt no good at it kristal had trouble drinking and smoking i said it made her cough so whatd you do kept trying to make kristal smoke to help her howd that go not so good what happened she coughed some more anything else she threw up where on my shirt now the eyes were slits you didnt like that i said it smelled shit smelled bad kind of gross yup whatd you do about that about what being barfed on pushed her away whered you push kristal he placed his hands on his chest where did she land i said on the floor the floor of the park the grass she land hard it was grass soft yup did you push her pretty hard no answer troy i didnt do nothing serious he said she sat on her butt and started crying real loud rand gave her some beer why shrug i guess to keep her quiet rands idea yup the coroners report had found traces of budweiser in kristals tiny stomach her lungs too the child had aspirated beer i said it was rands idea to give kristal beer i said that why do you think rand had that idea hes stupid rand is yup you hang out with him a lot he hangs out with me flint had come into his voice he realized it smiled most of the time hes okay what happens when hes not okay he does stupid things like that that giving the baby beer howd kristal like the beer not too good she throw up some more she made puffy noises his cheeks inflated and he exhaled noisily stuff started coming out of her nose then she started yelling yelling loud kind of pretty annoying his eyes were hyphens it wasnt cool whatd you do about that nothing kristal threw up on you and yelled loud and annoyed you but you didnt do anything at all didnt have to he said a tiny smirk skipped across his lips lasted for less than a second before his features settled into childish innocence if id been writing notes i wouldve missed the whole thing why didnt you have to do anything troy rand did rand solved the problem yup how shook her and hit her and put his hand on her neck rand put his hand on kristals neck he choked her show me how rand choked kristal he hesitated i said you were there troy like this he said grazing his own neck with a limp hand pressing ineffectually with the back of the hand then releasing thats how he said then what happened the baby blooped over he tilted to one side in demonstration lowered himself in slow motion to the cot sat up again like that kristal fell over after rand choked her yup howd you feel when you saw that bad he said too quickly very bad sir whyd you feel bad troy she wasnt moving fluttering eyelashes i shoulda stopped it you shouldve stopped rand from choking kristal yup his lips curled upward and i watched for the return of the smirk but something happened to his eyes that softened the expression the resigned worldweary smile of one whod seen it all but had managed to maintain his dignity im very sorry he said it was up to me im the smart one he was fullscale iq score of which put him in the top twentyfive percent given an abstract reasoning subtest in the ninetieth percentile and spotty school attendance that weakened his knowledge base i figured it for an underestimate worlds apart intellectually from rand duchay i shoulda stopped it maybe sydney weiders coaching had fallen short or shed told him the facts and hed blocked them out or hed simply chosen to lie figuring me for a gullible jerk id read the coroners report traces of kristal malleys skin had been found under troys fingernails not rands for the rest of our sessions he cooperated fully blithely lying every step of the way when i asked about his mother he told me she was trying to be an actress and that she visited him all the time the logbooks said shed been there once deputy sherrill told me jane hannabee had been obviously stoned the visit had lasted ten minutes and shed left looking angry once you see her doc maybe you understand something about the kid but not all of it right other punks have crackhead skanks for mothers and they do bad stuff but not this bad according to troy his father had died in the army shooting terrorists when i asked him what a terrorist was he said its like a criminal but usually theyre niggers and they blow stuff up i revisited the murder several times and his position remained the same kristal had gone with him and rand voluntarily rand had committed all the violence troy felt bad about not intervening on the sixth session he substituted guilty for bad you feel guilty real guilty sir about what not stopping it sir its gonna delay my life delay it how i was gonna be rich soon now its gonna be later why cause theyre gonna lock me up somewhere in jail shrug how long do you think theyll lock you up you could tell them the truth sir and maybe it wouldnt have to be so long he cocked his head almost girlishly his smile had a feminine cast to it too he had a dozen smiles first time id seen this variant you think that if i tell them the truth your sentence could be shorter the judge likes you someone tell you that nope when most people lie they give off a tell a shift in posture subtle changes in eye movement tone of voice this kid could fabricate so coolly i was willing to bet hed fool the polygraph troy do you ever get scared of what anything he thought i get scared of doing bad things whys that i dont want to be bad are you ever bad sometimes like everyone everyones bad sometimes no ones perfect he said except god are you religious drew and cherish say i am sir whore drew and cherish ministers they visit you yup sir do you find that helpful yessir very helpful how do drew and cherish help you tell me im gonna be okay tell me everyone makes mistakes so i said you think sometimes youre bad like how not going to school not reading books he stood took a volume from the bottom shelf black cardboard covers holy bible in green script drew and cherish give you that yessir and i read it what are you reading about a seconds pause day two of creation yessir god made heaven what does heaven mean to you a good place whats good about it youre rich and you get cool stuff what kind of cool stuff whatever you want who goes to heaven good people people who dont do really bad things no ones perfect he said and his voice tightened thats for sure i said im going to heaven he said after youre delayed yessir you talked before about getting rich howre you planning to do that i said rebirth of the smirk this time it endured and his eyes drilled into mine and his delicate little hands became bony little fists cause im smart he said can i go to sleep now cause im tired sir the rest of the sessions were unproductive as he wavered between claims of fatigue and feeling sick my attempts to elicit specific symptoms were fruitless a physical by a jail doctor had produced nothing the last time i saw him he was reading the bible and ignored me as i sat down interesting i said yup what are you up to he put the book facedown on the cot and stared past me troy im feeling sick where all over dr bronsky checked you out and said youre fine im sick this may be the last time i come to see you i said anything you want to tell me what are you gonna tell the judge ill just report what we talked about he smiled youre happy about that youre a good person sir you like to help people i got up and picked up the bible small gray smudges marked his place genesis chapter four cain and abel quite a story i said yessir what do you think of it of what cain killing his brother getting cursed he deserved it cain did yessir whys that he did sin the sin of murder exactly he said taking the bible from me and closing it softly like rand hes going to hell chapter imet with both public defenders in a conference room at the jail lauritz montez was there when i arrived a slightly built man thirty or so with dark hair pulled back into a ponytail an extravagant waxed mustache overpowered a fuzzy chinbeard he wore a vintage gray tweed threepiece suit and a skinny blue bow tie that was more like a shoelace sydney weider breezed in a few seconds later she was older early forties thin and tall with efficient blond hair and wide pale eyes her tailored black suit and crocodile bag and big pearl earrings were beyond a pds salary maybe the rock on her finger explained that maybe that was a sexist assumption and shed cleaned up in the stock market she sat down and twisted the ring so the diamond faced inward put on a pair of tiny little goldplated reading glasses and said well here we are her words came out crowded together big hurry to express herself both of them had wanted individual meetings i told them wed start out together and see how it went it didnt need to go further they worked on me individually but their goals were identical emphasizing the youth and criminal inexperience of their clients pointing out the wretchedness of each boys upbringing letting me know that anything other than a juvenile trial would be cruel and inhuman by the end of the hour they were working as a team from talking to troy i sensed weider would be laying everything on rand but it wasnt my place to bring that up as she warmed up she talked even faster seemed to dominate montez ending up with a long dissertation on the evils of video games and public housing she snapped her filofax shut removed her glasses and crossexamined me with her eyes whats your report going to say machinegun burst i havent written it yet you must have come to some conclusions ill be reporting to judge laskin hell send you copies so its going to be like that she said per judge laskin thats the way it has to be she collected her papers and fiddled with her ring think about this dr delaware psychologys a mushy soft science and psychologists can be made to look pretty vulnerable on the stand im sure they can more than vulnerable she said downright ludicrous im sure some of them deserve it she sat up straighter tried to stare me down looked disgusted when she failed doctor you cant seriously be considering these kids for an adult trial it wont be up to me judge laskin is relying on your expertise so for all practical purposes it will be up to you doctor from what ive seen judge laskin is a pretty independent guy montez said all were aiming for is basic justice doctor lets give these kids a chance at rehabilitation weider said doctor well be bringing in our own experts i said mr montez has already hired professor davidson from stanford weider turned and eyed her colleague he twirled a mustache and nodded it took awhile to get his fees authorized but hes on board weider shot him a cold smile how funny lauritz i called davidson last week his secretary told me he had a prior commitment if you want him for your kid maybe we can work something out said montez no need said weider breezily ive got lamaria from cal i said do either of you have a theory as to why your clients murdered kristal malley they swiveled toward me weider said doctor exactly what are you asking what you think your clients motive was isnt motivation your thing doctor id imagine it would be yours too she stood shook her head stared down at me you really think im going to lay my strategy out right here im not interested in strategy i said just insight doctor i dont have any insight which is precisely my point visàvis your report a fresh perspective is required i hope youre prepared to deliver that montezs eyes followed weider as she walked to the door see you in court doctor montez left a second later he avoided looking at me i sat there for a while wondering what i was going to do as i entered the jail parking lot sydney weider called out my name she was standing next to an iceblue bmw convertible tapping the croc bag against a long lean thigh to her left stood two women and a man weider waved as if we were old buddies i walked over when i reached her she smiled as if wed just shared a pleasant afternoon she drew one of the women close doctor this is troys mom jane jane hannabee was several inches shorter than the attorney and she seemed to shrink further under weiders grasp my files put her at twentyeight her sallow face was scored with papercut wrinkles her longsleeved knit top was bisected by a wide red stripe and looked brand new so did her baggy jeans and her white sneakers a snake tattoo coiled up past the sweaters crewneck its triangular head terminated just behind her left ear fangs bared some sort of adder she had a thin body thin lips thin nose lank brown hair that hung past her shoulders three holes punched in each ear but no earrings a tiny black dot on her right nostril said that region had once been pierced a cavedin mouth foretold missing teeth her eyes were blue and redrimmed crusted makeup failed to mask a bruise on her left cheek the police report said troy had hit her from time to time she looked older than weider i said pleased to meet you jane hannabee bit her lip and looked down at the oilspotted floor of the parking garage and slipped me cold dry fingers sydney weider said doctor im sure youd like to talk to ms hannabee absolutely lets set it up how about now taking control i smiled at her and she smiled back you do have time for troys mother doctor of course i said weider turned to the other two people thanks for bringing her anytime said the man he was in his late twenties solidly built with thick wavy dark hair that reminded me of an overripe artichoke broad pleasant face meaty shoulders a wrestlers flaring neck he wore a corduroy suit the color of peanut butter black boots a navy blue shirt with long collar points and a baby blue tie his whitegold wedding band was speckled with tiny blue stones and matched the one on the hand of the woman next to him she was around his age slightly heavy and extremely pretty with long teased hair bleached nearly white and swept back at the sides a white linen dress flared under a soft pink cardigan a thin silver chain and crucifix circled her neck her skin was bronze and flawless the man stepped forward and blocked her face from view drew daney sir thick fingers but a gentle grip sydney weider said doctor these are some supporters of troy that made it sound as if the kid were running for office maybe the analogy wasnt that far off this was going to be a campaign drew daney said this is my wife cherish the blond woman said i cant see anything honey drew daney retreated and cherish daneys smile came into view troys supporters i said spiritual advisers said cherish daney ministers not yet said drew were theology students at fulton seminary doctor thanks so much for being there for troy he needs all the support he can get i said are you ministering to rand duchay as well we will if were asked wherever were needed sydney weider said lets get going and gripped jane hannabee harder hannabee winced and started to shake maternal anguish or some sort of dope jones i told myself that was wrongheaded thinking give her a chance cherish daney said wed better get going to see troy her husband looked at his sports watch oh boy wed better cherish moved toward jane hannabee as if to embrace the woman but changed her mind and gave a small wave and said god bless you jane be well hannabee hung her head drew daney said good to meet you doctor good luck the two of them walked off toward the jails electric gate keeping up a brisk pace arm in arm sydney weider watched them for a few seconds expressionless then she turned to me getting another interview room in the jail is going to be a hassle how about i let you guys talk in my car jane hannabee sat behind the wheel of weiders bmw and looked as if shed been abducted by aliens i took the passenger seat sydney weider was a few yards away pacing and smoking and talking on her cell phone is there anything you want to tell me ms hannabee she didnt answer maam staring at the instrument panel she said dont let them kill troy flat voice slight twang a plea but no passion them i said she scratched her arm through her sleeve rolled up the fabric and worked on bare flaccid skin more tattoos embroidered her forearm crude and dark and gothic weider had probably bought her the fresh clothes dressed her up with an eye toward camouflage in prison she said when they send him up hes gonna have a bad name its gonna be cool to hurt him what kind of bad name baby killer she said even though he didnt do it the niggers and the mexicans will say its cool to get him troy didnt kill kristal i said but his reputation will put him in danger in prison she didnt answer i said who did kill kristal troys my baby she held her mouth open as if needing more breath behind the desiccated lips were three teeth brown and attenuated i realized she was smiling i did the best i could she said you kin believe that or not i nodded you don believe me she said im sure raising a son alone was hard i got rid of the others the others i got knocked up four times abortions three the last one hurt me you kept troy i felt like i deserved it deserved having a child yeah she said thats a womans right to have a child you dont believe that you wanted troy i said you did your best raising him you dont believe that youre gonna send him off to prison im going to write a report about troys psychological status whats going on in his head and give it to the judge so anything you can tell me about troy could help you sayin hes crazy no i said i dont think hes one bit crazy the directness of the answer startled her hes not she insisted as if we remained in dispute hes real smart he always was smart hes very bright i said yeah she said i want him to go to college she turned and shot me another smile closemouthed subtle its arc matched the coil of snake on her neck and the effect was unnerving i figured he kin be a doctor or something else to get rich troy had talked about getting rich unperturbed as if the charges against him were an inconvenience along the road to affluence his mothers delusions made my eyes hurt she placed her hands on the bmws steering wheel pressed down on the inactive gas pedal muttered this is somethin the car she eyed weider through the windshield you think shes gonna help troy she seems to be a good lawyer you don ever answer a question do you lets talk about troy i said you want him to go to college he aint goin there now youre sending him to prison ms hannabee i cant send him anywhere the judge hates him why do you say that she reached over and touched my arm stroked it i know men theyre all hate and jumping jumping on women she said working her way up toward my shoulder touching my cheek i removed her hand she gave me a knowing smile if theres something a man needs i know it i shifted backward touched the door panel is there anything you want to tell me about troy i know men she repeated i caught her gaze and held it she touched the bruise on her cheek her lips quivered whered you get that i said you think im ugly no but i would like to know i used to be hot she said my tits were like water balloons i used to dance she pressed her palms to her chest ms hannabee you dont have to call me that miz im no miz jane she wheeled grabbed my arm again clawfingers bit through the wool of my sleeve no seductiveness this time desperation as cold fear brightened her eyes and i caught a glimpse of the girl shed once been please she said troy didnt kill no baby the retard did it everyone knows it everyone hes the big one troys little troys my little man it werent his fault he hooked up with the retard rands the guilty one i said her grip on my arm tightened further zactly did troy tell you that rand killed the baby yeah i glanced down at her fingers she coughed and sniffed and removed them hell get better she said who will troy you give him a chance and hell get better and go to college you think hes sick she stared at me everyones sick being alives being sick we got to be forgiving like jesus i said nothing she said you understand about forgiving its a wonderful quality i said being able to forgive i forgive everyone everyone who hurts you yeah why not who cares what happened before same with troy what he did is over and he didnt even do it the retard did she turned in the seat bumped her hip against the steering wheel and flinched you gonna help him ill do my best to be truthful you should she said leaning closer her scent was a strange mixture of old laundry and toosweet perfume you could look like him like who jesus she smiled ran a tongue over her lips yeah definitely put a beard on you a little more hair and yeah sure you could be a real cute jesus chapter tom laskins clerk called me a couple of days later to check on my report i told her i needed another week picking the time arbitrarily not sure why i was asking for an extension i spent ten more days on the case interviewing the social workers and the eligibility officers who covered city visiting the project and chatting with neighbors anyone who claimed to have something to offer each time margaret sieff was out jane hannabee had moved and no one knew where i visited the boys school no one not the principal or the guidance counselor or the teachers had more than a vague remembrance of troy or rand the last time either boy had been graded was a year ago c minuses and a couple of ds for rand which was social promotion my testing had shown him to be illiterate with math skills at the secondgrade level bs and cs and ds for troy hed been judged bright but disruptive to the project workers the young killers were names on forms the residents all agreed that prior to his arrest rand duchay had been viewed as a harmless oaf everyone i spoke to was certain hed been turned bad by troy turner no divided opinions on troy either he was seen as cunning nasty mean evil scary despite his small size several residents claimed hed threatened their children but the details were vague one woman young and black and nervous stepped forward as i was leaving the project and said that boy done nasty things to my daughter how olds your daughter gonna be six next month what happened she shook her head and hurried away and i didnt go after her i asked to reinterview the boys but was blocked from doing so by montez and weider theyre adamant tom laskin informed me went so far as to file motions to keep you away whats the problem i said my feeling is its mostly weider shes a manic shark she does talk fast everythings conflict with her even when it doesnt need to be said laskin she says youve had more than enough time with her client doesnt want his head messed up before she brings her own experts in montez is a loafer takes the path of least resistance i could probably push it alex but if im reversed id prefer it not be for something picayune do you really need more time why would i mess up their clients heads dont take it personally he said its lawyer crap their basic premise is that youre biased for the prosecution i havent spoken a word to the da its gamesmanship theyre setting the stage so if you do say something they dont like theyve precharacterized it as impeachable okay i said dont worry ill protect you when you get up on the stand so when can i expect your compiled psychological wisdom on my desk soon soon is better than the alternative i sat down to write my report starting with the easy part the crime scene the background information the test results but even that was a struggle and i hadnt gotten far when lauritz montez called me hows it going doctor i said have you changed your mind about my talking to rand maybe he said my client cooperated fully the first time didnt he youll make a point of stressing that right ill do my best to be unbiased look said montez the motion was weiders idea you know what shes like actually i dont whatever he said you do remember rand cooperating fully i do good his voice was tight hes pretty depressed that doesnt surprise me poor kid he said i didnt answer the reason im calling dr delaware is that weider just put in for a bifurcated hearing do you understand what that means she wants to split troys defense from rands she wants to screw me screw rand i thought we were all on the same page but shes pulling a fast one shifting to blaming it all on my client so her little sociopath can get easy treatment i thought you should be alerted thanks im serious he said the truth is obvious what truth is that a basically good really stupid kid got caught up with a cold cruel murderer i know youve been back to city i know everyone told you that i said what can i do for you mr lauritz i respect your expertise and want to maintain open communication no offense about the motion to deny you access okay if you really want to talk to rand fine hes remorseful consumed with remorse i didnt answer so he said are you going to be seeing him again ill give you a call i didnt he never followed up three days into writing the report i phoned tom laskin this isnt working very well what isnt i told you at the outset that i might not be able to come up with meaningful recommendations and thats whats happened if you want to reduce my fee fine whats the problem i cant produce clear data to help you with your choice my personal preference would be juvey certification because theyre kids and lacked adult capacity but im not sure id sleep well if i was responsible for that decision why not the act was horrendous and i doubt making them cya wards for a few years will rehab them are they still dangerous he said would they do something that bad again on his own rand duchay probably wouldnt but if he hooked up with someone dominant and violent its possible any remorse on his part he seems to have some i said was he thinking like an adult at the time of the murder no would that change in five years or even ten probably not given his intellectual level which is i quoted the test results laskin whistled what about turner smarter a lot smarter hes got the ability to calculate and plan sydney weiders going to claim rand duchay initiated the crime and her client was an innocent bystander the forensics say thats not true but rand did admit striking kristal and his size could work against him if you didnt know better im still on the remorse issue said laskin turner have any he talks about sin claims to be reading the bible has a couple of theology students offering moral support but i doubt theres any serious insight there he denies he ever touched kristal despite the fact that kristals skin was found under his fingernails weider sent me an impassioned request for bifurcation looks like just another toddi defense the other dude did it going to grant the split i said not unless i have to how smart is turner considerably above average i gave him those numbers too he said no diminished capacity there adult comprehension intellectually he can reason things out but hes thirteen which is an interesting age theres some evidence that adolescent brains undergo changes at fourteen to fifteen that lead to fuller reasoning capacity even with that you know what teens are like rationality takes years to settle in sometimes it never sets in he said so youre leaning toward juvey but you dont want to put it in writing because of the enormity of the crime i dont think its a psychological issue i said what is it then a judicial question what placement would approximate justice to the greatest extent meaning its my problem i didnt answer he said i know teens are stupid the problem is if we gave teen criminals special treatment a lot of really vicious thugs would be getting off easy and nothing in my experience matches the viciousness of this crime they worked that poor baby over really bad i know but youve seen turner he looks twelve im trying to picture him at quentin or a place like that and its not a pretty thought small and smart but he murdered a twoyearold alex why the hell would a smart kid do something like that thats another question i cant answer i said iq and moral development are separate issues like walker percy said you can get straight as but still flunk life whos he a novelist and a psychiatrist interesting combo he said so youre telling me ive got a dumb kid and a bright little sociopath and they just happened to murder a twoyearold any other antisocial history for either of them not for rand everyone who knows troy describes him as cunning and some people at the project called him cruel hes got a history of threatening younger kids hes also suspected of killing stray dogs and cats but i couldnt find any facts to back that up so maybe the rumor mills working overtime because of the murder one woman implied hed molested her daughter but refused to talk to me about it given his upbringing i wouldnt be shocked if hes been abused himself i gave him a capsule of both boys histories including rand duchays head injury during infancy if youre looking for mitigating factors youve got plenty prisoners of biology and sociology and just plain bad luck neither of these two had much in the way of nurturing tom which doesnt excuse what they did to that poor little girl not in the least have you picked up any possible motive he said because no ones put anything forward including the cops from what i can tell the abduction was impulsive the two of them were headed to the park to smoke and drink when they saw kristal wandering around they thought it would be fun to watch kristal smoke and drink she got sick started to fuss threw up and things got out of control theres no indication they were stalking her bad luck for that little girl he said okay so its your basic senseless crime i was hoping for something a little more psychologically illuminating but no beef you were upfront about no promises forget the bs about cutting your fee when the government wants to give you money take it theres nothing at all you can give me about disposition what will happen if you certify them as adults initially theyll get long sentences and go off to quentin or a place like it if i juvey them theyre off to the california youth authority which nowadays isnt all that different from grownup prison except the inmates are shorter the longest they could be cya wards would be till age twentyfive meaning theyd be released at the peak of criminal drive you bet he said in bigboy lockup theyd be vulnerable to the black guerrilla army and nuestra familia probably run for cover to the aryan brotherhood so wed be creating a couple of little nazis but most of the cya facilities are gangridden too whyd you say theyd have long sentences initially because if i adultcertify theres a good chance some higher court will lower their sentences and have them switched to lowersecurity facilities meaning they could end up with less time than a cya placement ive got the victims family to think about like you said the best we can hope for is approximating justice and lord knows well never get closure whatever the hell that means but theres got to be something that does the least harm i havent seen the family in the media theyve kept a low profile but the fathers called the da a few times demanding justice no one can give him what he really wants his kid back and two other kids have ruined their own lives its a rotten situation for all concerned beyond rotten alex theyre so damned young what the hell turned them so bad wish i could tell you i said the precursors are all there bad environment maybe bad biology but most kids exposed to the same things dont murder toddlers no they dont he said okay send me whatever you feel comfortable putting down on paper ill start your reimbursement voucher churning through the system chapter in the end resolution came the way it usually does once cases fade from public scrutiny the product of backroom negotiation and the search for the least of all evils five months after their arrests in what the papers termed a surprise move both boys pled guilty and were sentenced to the california youth authority until they were twentyfive or until it could be proven theyd been successfully rehabilitated no trial no media hoopla no need for me to appear as an expert witness and my check from the court arrived in a timely fashion i talked to no one but milo about it pretended i was sleeping well troy turner was sent to the na chaderjian camp in stockton and rand duchay ended up at the herman g stark youth correctional facility in chino the cya promised to provide counseling for both boys and special education for rand the day the deal was announced kristal malleys parents were caught by a tv crew exiting the courtroom and asked for their opinion of the deal lara malley a small wan brunette was sobbing her husband barnett a tall rawboned man around thirty glared and said no comment the camera closed in on his face because angers more fun for the camera than despair he had thin sandy hair long sideburns sharp features and prominent bones dryeyed the unmoving eyes of a sniper in your opinion sir the reporter pressed do the ages of the defendants make this an appropriate solution for closure barnett malleys jaw flexed and he jerked his hand upward and the soundman picked up scuffling noises the reporter retreated malley didnt move the camera zoomed on his fist frozen midair lara malley whimpered barnett stared into the camera for another second grasped his wife by the arm propelled her out of range tom laskin called me six weeks later it was just after noon and id finished a session with an eightyearold boy whod burned his face playing with swimming pool chemicals his parents had sued and a quack environmental medicine specialist had testified that the child would get cancer when he grew up the boy had overheard and become traumatized and it was my job to deprogram him hi tom could we meet alex about what id rather talk in person ill come to your office sure when ill be finished in an hour where are you located he arrived at my house wearing a camel jacket brown slacks a white shirt and a red tie the tie was limp and pulled down from an open collar wed talked over the phone but had never met id seen his picture in newspaper accounts of the malley case midfifties gray hair trimmed in an executive cut square face steelrimmed eyeglasses a prosecutors wary eyes and had formed the image of a big imposing man he turned out to be short fivesix or seven heavier and softer and older than pictured the hair white the jowls giving way to gravity his jacket was wellcut but tired his shoes needed a polish and the bags under his eyes were bluish pretty place he said sitting on the edge of the living room chair that i offered must be nice working out of your house it has its advantages something to drink he considered the offer why not beer if youve got it i went to the kitchen and fetched a couple of grolsches when i returned his posture hadnt relaxed his hands were clenched and he looked like someone forced to seek therapy i popped the caps on the beers and handed him a bottle he took it but didnt drink troy turners dead he said oh no it happened two weeks ago cya never thought to call me i found out from social services because they were looking for his mother he was found hanging from a punching bag stand in a supply room off the gym he was supposed to be putting equipment away that was the job they gave him hed been judged too dangerous to work in the kitchen or in the vegetable garden with tools suicide thats what they thought till they saw blood pooled on the floor and swung him around and found his throat cut ive always been too good at conjuring mental pictures the brutality of the scene small pale body dangling in a dark heartless place would visit my dreams do they know who did it i said theyre figuring it for a gang thing said laskin hed been there what a month tried right away to hook up with the dirty white boys an aryanb farm club he was still in the initiation stage and part of the deal was jumping a latino boy he pulled that off ten days ago surprised one of the smaller vatos locos in the shower hit him upside the head with a heavy hairbrush and kicked the kid when he was down the boy suffered a concussion and bruised ribs and ended up being transferred to another facility troys punishment was solitary confinement for a week hed been back in his bunkroom for three days the day before he died they put him back on gym closet duty so everyone knew where hed be at a specific time laskin nodded the blood was still wet and the weapon was left at the scene homemade shank fashioned from a toothbrush and a piece of butter knife honed to a razorsharp edge whoever did it took time to wipe up his footprints who found the body a counselor he finished his beer and put the bottle down want another yes but no he uncrossed his legs held out a hand as if asking for something i thought i was being compassionate by sending him to chaderjian downright solomonic i thought so too you agreed with the decision given the choices i said i thought it was the best decision you never said anything you never asked the malleys werent happy with the decision mister called to tell me what did he prefer the death penalty his smile was queasy looks like he got it i said would sending troy to adult prison have made him safer he picked up the empty bottle and rolled it between his palms probably not but it still stinks has his mother been located finally the county just authorized her for methadone and they found her at an outpatient clinic waiting in line for her dose the warden at chaderjian said she visited troy once the whole month and that was for ten minutes he shook his head little bastard never had a chance neither did kristal malley he stared at me that rolled off your tongue pretty easily you that tough im not tough at all i worked the cancer wards at western peds for years and stopped trying to figure things out youre a nihilist im an optimist who keeps my goals narrow im usually pretty good at coping with all the crap i see he said but something about this one maybe its time to retire you did your best thanks for saying so i dont know why im bothering you its no bother neither of us talked for a while then he steered the conversation to his two kids in college looked at his watch thanked me again and left a few weeks later i read about a retirement party thrown for him at the biltmore downtown child murder trial judge was his new title and i guessed that would stick nice party from the sound of it judges and das and pds and court workers lauding him for twentyfive years good service he planned to spend the next few years sailing and playing golf troy turners murder stayed with me and i wondered how rand duchay was faring i phoned the cya camp in chino wrestled with the bureaucracy for a while before reaching a boredsounding head counselor named dipodesta so he said when i told him about the killing it might put duchay at risk ill make a note of that i asked to talk to rand personal phone calls are limited to blood relatives and people on the approved list how do i get on the list apply how do i do that fill out forms could you please send them to me he took my name and address but the application never arrived i considered pursuing it rationalized not doing so i lacked the time and the desire for longterm commitment so what use could i be to rand for the next few weeks i scanned the papers for bad news about him when nothing appeared i convinced myself he was where he should be counseled and tutored and taken care of for the next twelve years now he was out in eight wanted to talk to me i supposed i was ready to listen chapter ileft the house and set out for westwood the restaurant was called newark pizza a sign underneath the tricolor boot promised authentic new jersey pasta and sicilian delicacies too lights on behind pinkandwhitechecked drapes the faint outlines of patrons no one waiting outside i walked in got a headful of garlic and overripe cheese bad murals covered the sidewalls walleyed grape pickers bringing in the chianti crop under a bilious sun five round tables rested on a red linoleum floor covered in the same checked gingham as the curtains the rear wall was a takeout counter backed by a brick pizza oven that gave off yeasty fumes two hispanic men in stained white aprons worked the dinner crowd which was three parties the cooks had aztec faces and took their work seriously the customers were a japanese couple sharing a petite pepperoni pie a young bespectacled couple trying to control a pair of wildeyed tomatosauced preschoolers and three black guys in their twenties wearing fila sweats and enjoying salad and lasagna one of the countermen said help you im waiting for someone young guy around twenty he shrugged and flipped a limp white disk of dough sprinkled it with flour repeated the move i said has anyone like that been around sprinkle flip no amigo i left and waited out in front the restaurant was on a quiet block sandwiched between a photocopy service and a onestory office building both dark for the weekend the sky was black and two blocks up traffic on pico was anemic las never really been a nightlife city and this part of westwood hibernated when the mall wasnt bustling the mall eight years after he had brutalized kristal malley rand wanted to talk about the crime two blocks from a mall im a good person if it was absolution he was after i wasnt a priest maybe the distinction between therapy and confession was petty maybe he knew the difference maybe he just wanted to talk like the judge whod sent him away i wondered how tom laskin was doing wondered about all of them i stood there careful to stay in the reflected glare of the boot sign watching for the man randolph duchay had become hed been a big kid so he was probably a large man unless eight years of institutional food and god knew what other indignities had stunted his growth i thought of the way hed struggled to make out the word pizza the word was two feet of tricolor neon five minutes passed ten fifteen i took a stroll up the block watching my back for no reason except that a murderer might be looking for me what did he want returning to newark pizza i cracked the door in case id missed him i hadnt this time the black guys checked me out and the cook id talked to got an unpleasant look on his face i went back outside positioned myself ten feet up from the restaurant waited five minutes more nothing i drove home my message machine was blank i wondered if i should call milo and ask him to check the specifics of rand duchays release solicit a detectives guess as to what rand had wanted and why he hadnt shown a quarter century of homicide work had implanted a doomsday chip in milos brain and i had a pretty good idea of how hed respond once a scumbag always a scumbag alex why mess with it i made myself a tuna sandwich and drank some decaf set the house alarm and settled on my office couch with two months worth of psych journals somewhere out in the darkness a coyote ululated a warbling shrieking a cappella solo part scavengers protest part predators triumph the glens teeming with the creatures they dine on the haute garbage that fills westside trash cans and some are as sleek and fearless as house pets i used to have a little french bulldog and worried about letting him out in the yard alone now he was living in seattle and life was simpler i cleared my throat the sound echoed the house was full of echoes the howlsonata repeated itself enlarged to a duet then grew to a coyote chorus a pack of them exulting in the kill foodchain violence that made sense and i found the noise comforting i read until two am fell asleep on the couch managed to drag myself to bed at three by seven i was up awake without being rested the last thing i wanted to do was run i dressed for it anyway was heading for the door when allison called from greenwich good morning handsome morning gorgeous im glad i caught you she sounded a little down lonely or maybe that was me hows life with grandma you know gra she laughed you dont know her do you this morning despite the fact that its freezing she insisted we take a walk around the grounds and look for unique leaves ninetyone and shes forging through snow like a trapper she studied botany at smith claims she wouldve gotten a phd if she hadnt been swept into matrimony at twenty find anything i said after clawing through a fourfoot snowbank i managed to produce one brown shriveled thing she found interesting my fingers were numb and that was with gloves on gram of course eschews handcoverings except at lunches in the city greatest generation how large is the property twelve acres with lots of trees and rare plants she put in over the years sounds nice its getting a little rundown she said and the house is way too big for her still clearing your consults theyre clear good for you before she left id asked if she wanted me to join her for part of the trip if it was up to me alex you could stay the whole time but grams possessive its a ritual with her special time with each of the grandkids at thirtynine allison was the youngest grandkid am i keeping you from anything not a thing i said wondering if that were true consults work out okay as good as can be expected so what else is up baby i deliberated telling her about duchays call nothing exciting what time does your flight arrive thats one of the reasons im calling gram asked me to extend my visit for another two weeks its hard to tell her no shes ninetyone i said the rooms smell like camphor and i feel a hundred and twenty im getting serious cabin fever alex she turns in for bed at eight you could make snow angels i miss you she said miss you too i was thinking maybe we can do something about it gram has a friend coming from st louis tomorrow so shell be occupied for three days the hotels in new york are running a postnew years special big discounts and free upgrades when do you want me there i said really she said really thats great youre sure hey i said i need special time too oh boy she said you dont know what youve just done for my spirits is there any way you could make it by tomorrow i could take the train and be at the hotel by the time you arrived which hotel when i traveled with my parents we always stayed at the st regis the locations perfect fiftyfifth off fifth and theyve got butler service on every floor nice touch if the butlers not intrusive he wont be if we bunk in and never call him which bunk do i get i said upper or lower i was thinking more in terms of sharezies ill bring a flashlight and well play pup tent alex its incredibly flexible of you to do this not in the least i said im acting out of pure selfinterest that she said is the best part i booked a nine am flight out of lax scrounged at the back of my closet for the gray tweed overcoat i never wore found a similarly neglected pair of gloves and scarf packed a carryon and went for a run beverly glen was seventy degrees and clear lets hear it for winter weathers a trivial reason for living somewhere unless youre honest i set out hoping for endorphinlaced serenity my brain had other ideas and i wondered about rand my body stayed tight and heavy as i huffed and kicked up dust and my brain pulled a split screen looking out for passing cars on one side as time flashed back on the other when i returned home i called milos house no answer then i tried the westside substation and asked for lieutenant sturgis it took awhile for milo to come on the line and i was still breathing hard didnt know you cared he said ha whats up im meeting allison in new york tomorrow he murdered a few bars of leaving on a jet plane where you staying st regis nice the last time the department sent me to new yawk was for that post security seminar and they vouchered me at a shitty dive in the thirties while youre there get me a knicks shirt at the nba store no prob i was kidding alex the knicks optimisms good for the soul i said so is logic am i correct in assuming that you called for some reason other than to boast about the superiority of your accommodations over mine you brought that up if you were really the sensitive guy you claim to be you wouldve lied i said the st regis has butler service im weeping into my case stack which currently is low per an interdepartmental memo we are now experiencing an official drop in crime congratulations not my doing probably karmic crystals or chanting or the moon in scorpiosquatting or the great baal of randomness whats on your mind i told him that one he said you didnt like working it it wasnt fun duchay give any hint what he wanted he sounded troubled he should be troubled eight years at the cya for murdering a baby any professional guesses about why he didnt show changed his mind couldnt get it together who knows hes a lowlife alex he was the stupid one right right so toss in a lousy attention span or whatever label you guys are putting on it nowadays in addition to his being a lowlife thrillkiller whos been thoroughly criminalized after being locked up with gangbangers for eight years how old is he now twentyone lowlife at the height of his criminal hormone overload he said i wouldnt take any bets on his experiencing any serious personality enhancement id also not take his calls from now on hes probably more dangerous than he was eight years ago why get involved looks like im not i said though i didnt pick up any threat or hostility over the phone more like hes troubled yeah yeah he calls you from westwood which isnt that far from your place semiilliterate but he managed to find your number hed have no reason to resent me silence the plan was to meet him away from my place i said thats a start im not minimizing what he did milo he himself admitted hitting kristal but i always felt troy turner was the primary force behind the murder and rand got caught up in the situation put him in another situation and hell get caught up again i suppose hey he said you called me not another shrink meaning you were looking for hard truth not empathy and understanding i dont know what i was looking for you craved sage detective advice and uncle milos instinctual protective stance now that the former has been dispensed ill do my best to provide the latter while youre gallivanting up fifth avenue with a lovely lady on your arm thats okay heres the plan he said though it falls well outside of my job description i will drive by your house at least once a day twice if i can swing it pick up your paper and your mail be on the lookout for shady characters lurking around the premises gallivanting i said you do know how to gallivant put one foot in front of the other and just blow at one pm he called back when were you planning to leave for new york tomorrow morning why a body showed up last night in bel air dumped in some bushes near the north onramp white male young sixtwo two hundred shot in the head no wallet or id but wadded down in the little front pocket of his jeans was a piece of paper greasy and frayed like it had been pawed a lot the writing however was still legible and guess what it was your phone number chapter imet milo in his office on the second floor of the westside sub station its a windowless cell formerly a utility closet set away from the collaborative buzz of the big detectives room theres barely room for a twodrawer desk a file cabinet a pair of folding chairs and a senile computer the stations a nosmoking zone but sometimes milo puffs panatelas and the walls have yellowed and the air smells like a dozen old men hes sixthree and when he pays attention to his diet twosixty hunched at the undersized desk hes a cartoon its a setup unbefitting a lieutenant but hes not the typical lieutenant and he claims its fine with him maybe he means it maybe having a second office helps an indian restaurant a few blocks away where the owners treat him like royalty the leap from detective iii to brass had resulted from leverage hed never sought ugly secrets unearthed about the former police chief the deal was that hed get a lieutenants salary avoid the executive obligations that normally went with the job and be allowed to work cases as long as he functioned solo and stayed out of everyones hair that chief was gone and the new one seemed intent on shaking things up but so far milos situation had escaped scrutiny if the current regime was as resultsoriented as it claimed maybe his solve rate would afford him some grace or maybe not a gay cop was no longer the official impossibility it had been when hed joined the force but hed broken ground during colder times and would never fit in his door was open and he was reading a preliminary investigation report his black hair needed a trim cowlicks reigning the white sideburns he called his skunk stripes bushing and trailing a half inch below his earlobes a sprucegreen sport coat hung from the back of his chair and puddled onto the floor his shortsleeved white shirt looked defeated his skinny yellow tie couldve passed for a mustard stain gray cords and tan desert boots topped off the ensemble the unshielded ceiling bulb was vaguely pink and graced his acnepitted cheeks with a phony sunburn he hooked a thumb at the spare chair and i unfolded it and sat he handed me the prelim and some crime scene photos the report was the usual detached affair recorded on the scene by detective i s j binchy sean was a former bass player in a ska band turned bornagain christian a compliant kid who milo sometimes enlisted for grunt work nice kid decent speller the only new thing i learned was that a freeway cleanup crew had found the body at fourfourteen am the first photo was a frontal of the corpse lying on its back face up as the coroners photographer clickclicked from above nightbleached face hard to make out details a closeup shot showed the gaping mouth and halfclosed eyes id seen so many times before hollowness behind the irises the right cheek was slightly convex but it wasnt the distortion youd see with a smallcaliber bullet dancing around in the head a pair of lateral views revealed a dark starshaped entry wound surrounded by a black halo of powder just in front of the left ear and a ragged exit much larger and slightly higher on the right temple that showcased bone and redmeat muscle and the oatmeal of brain matter i said throughandthrough shot coroner thinks contact shot or just short of contact full metal jacket no larger than a thirtyeight no supplementary load his voice was remote keeping his distance from this victim the next photo was a closeup what about these cheek abrasions he was found lying on his face maybe he got dragged a bit during the dump no defense wounds or tissue under his nails or any other signs of struggle no major blood at the scene so he was shot somewhere else hes big i said so if there was no struggle he was probably taken by surprise id ask if you recognize him but we just got word from afis the prints confirm its duchay i reviewed the pictures tried to look past damage and death rand duchays boyhood facial structure had been transformed by puberty into something longer and harder his hair was darker than i remembered but that couldve been the lighting in life hed been a slow kid with slack features death hadnt changed that but death has a way of blunting everyone around the edges would i have recognized him if wed passed on the street i said any fix on when it happened you know how tod is mostly guesswork best guess is sometime between nine pm and one am nine was well after id gotten home from duchays noshow maybe he had changed his mind about the meeting or had his mind changed i said did you just happen to find out or did you go looking for him milo stretched his long legs as far as the room allowed after you called i decided to do a little research on duchay found out hed been released three days ago four years early good behavior flaring nostrils said what he thought about that i learned who hed been released to which took some doing called got no answer decided a thrillkiller ambling around the westside didnt appeal to my sense of order i left sean a message to check prowler reports and attempted burglaries for the last three days then i took a drive up westwood and hit some side streets he worked his tongue inside his cheek i was thinking id finish up at your place youd fix me a sandwich id wish you bon voyage then sean calls back hes at the coroner a case came in last night that looked like a whodunit and the crime scene guys missed something but the crypt attendant found it when she undressed the body little scrap of paper in the victims pocket sean was pretty sure he recognized your number but wanted to confirm seans got a good memory i said seans coming along youre working the case with him hes working it with me as we left sean binchy stepped out of the detectives room and hailed us hes redheaded and freckled in his late twenties as tall as milo many pounds lighter sean favors fourbutton suits bright blue shirts somber ties and doc martens old tattoos are hidden by long sleeves short neat hair replaces the dreads of his music days hi dr delaware he said cheerfully looks like youre involved in this one milo said sean dr delawares scheduled to fly to new york tomorrow morning i dont see any reason that should change sure no prob uh loot i finally got through to the folks duchay was staying with and they had no idea hed gone into the city to meet with dr delaware he told them he was going looking for a job where construction site said binchy theres an apartment development going up not far from where they live and duchay went to speak with the supervisor on saturday guess the sites open verify that sean you bet what time did he leave for this alleged meeting said milo five pm guy takes a short walk at five doesnt come home all night and theyre not concerned they were concerned said binchy at seven pm they called van nuys division to report him missing but since he was an adult and not enough time had passed it wasnt filed as an official mp a convicted murderer wandering around didnt bother anyone i dont know if they mentioned that to van nuys find out if they did sean yes sir i said who was he living with some people who take in troubled kids said binchy duchay was an adult said milo then its troubled people loot theyre ministers or something the daneys i said you know them they were involved with rands case years ago back when he killed that little girl said binchy no rancor in his voice every time id seen him his demeanor had been exactly the same pleasant unruffled uncluttered with selfdoubt maybe still waters did run deep or god on your side was the ultimate soul balm involved how said milo spiritual advisers i said they were seminary students binchy said everyone could use some of that didnt seem to help duchay said milo not in this world binchy smiled briefly i said both of them were murdered both of who doc rand and troy turner didnt know about turner said milo when did that happen a month after he was in custody so were talking eight years in between what happened to him i described troys ambush of a vato loco the gangvengeance theory the way hed been hung in the utility closet dont know if it was ever solved a month in and hes thinking hes a tough guy he said no impulse control yeah sounds like your basic prison hit were he and duchay in the same facility no lucky for duchay if hed been seen as turners buddy he wouldve been next duchay didnt get away clean in prison coroner said there were old knife scars on his body milo said but he was alive until last night big and tough enough to defend himself or he learned to avoid trouble i said he got early release for good behavior that means he didnt rape or shank anyone in front of a guard silence binchy said ill follow up on what exactly van nuys was told loot enjoy your trip to new york doctor after he left milo jammed some papers into his attaché case and the two of us descended the stairs to the back of the station we walked a couple of blocks to where id parked the seville he said guys like turner and duchay attract bad stuff its ironic isnt it i said what rand makes it through eight years of the cya gets out and three days later hes dead your feeling this huh you arent i pick and choose when i bleed i opened the car door he said whats really getting to you alex he was a stupid impressionable kid who lost his parents in infancy probably suffered brain damage as a baby got raised by a grandmother who resented him was ignored by the school system he also killed a twoyearold at that point my sympathies shift i can understand that i said he placed a hand on my shoulder dont let it eat at you go have fun in la manzana grande maybe i shouldnt go why the hell not what if im relevant to the case youre not goodbye i drove home thinking about rand duchays last moments perhaps a temple shot meant hed been looking straight ahead hadnt seen it coming maybe hed experienced no final fireburst of terror and pain i pictured him lying facedown in some cold dark place beyond knowing or caring eightyearold tv images flew into my head barnett and lara malley exiting the courtroom she sobbing he tightlipped smoldering so rigid with anger hed come close to striking a cameraman demanding the death penalty now both murderers of his daughter were gone would he find comfort in that had he played a role in it no that was trite and illogical revenge was a dish best eaten cold but eight years between deaths was arctic milo was right damaged boys like turner and duchay did attract violence in a sense what had happened was the predictable termination of two wasted lives three i checked my overnight bag packed the toothbrush id forgotten and put the house in relative order logging onto a weather site i learned id be arriving tomorrow in the midst of a snowstorm low fifteen high twentynine i pictured white skies and sidewalks the flicker of manhattan lights in our window as allison and i holed up in a nice warm suite with butler service why had rand called me the phone rang allison said thank god i caught you alex you wont believe this strain in her voice my first thought was something had happened to her grandmother whats up grams friend the one who was coming from st louis suffered a stroke this morning we just got the call grams taking it hard alex im so sorry but i cant leave her of course not shell be fine i know she will she always is is your ticket refundable ive already called the hotel and canceled im really sorry dont worry about it i said sounding calm no act i was relieved that i wouldnt be going what did that say about me despite the situation im going to try to get out of the twoweek extension alex one week tops then ill call my cousin wesley and ask him to do a shift hes a chem prof at barnard on sabbatical in boston so his hours are flexible its only fair right right she paused for a breath youre not too upset id love to see you but things happen they do its freezing anyway fifteen to twentynine in new york you looked it up she said you were all prepared to go boo hoo boo hoo hoo i said the suite had a fireplace dammit when you come back well light mine in seventydegree weather ill buy some ice and sprinkle it around she laughed thats some picture ill get back as soon as i can one week tops uh oh theres gram calling me again what now she wants more tea sorry alex talk to you tomorrow sounds good are you all right sure why you sound a little distracted just disappointed i lied everything will work out nothing like optimism she said with all you see how do you manage that allison had been widowed in her twenties her basic disposition was a good deal sunnier than mine but i was a better faker its a good way to live i said oh yeah chapter monday night i reached milo at his house it was just after ten and his voice was thick with scotch and fatigue its one am in new york dude im still on pacific standard what happened allisons grandmother needed her i filled him in sorry about that whats on your mind just checking in i said on duchay turns out weekends at the construction site are for cleanup but the supervisor said hed never met duchay so either the story was bogus or duchay was confused other than that zippo to report my working theory was that duchay hooked up with some cya bad guy buddy in order to do something bad they got into conflict and the buddy did him what makes you think he was planning anything because eight years in lockup is a phd in bad the reason i figured a buddy was because duchays pattern was criminal collaboration one crimes a pattern when its a crime like his and you need to consider this alex the plan may have involved you as in target some theory i said step back and try to be objective he said a convicted thrill murderer phones you out of the blue says he wants to talk about his crime but wont give details if it was really some confessionabsolution deal why wait eight years he couldve written you a letter and why you he had spiritual advisers dogooders whod love to grant him absolution the whole thing smells alex he lured you out why would he want to hurt me because you were part of the system that sent him away for eight years and his knife wounds say it wasnt a vacation nine sticks alex and three had gone deep there were scars on his liver and one of his kidneys margaret sieff the woman rand had called gram had been clear about my allegiance randolphs laywer said you werent necessarily on our side maybe shed transmitted that to rand or lauritz montez had hed seen me as a prosecution tool had gone along with sydney weiders petition to keep me away from the boys milo said does your silence indicate im making sense anythings possible i said but he didnt sound hostile over the phone i know just troubled back when i evaluated him there was no hostility milo he was meek cooperative unlike troy he never tried to manipulate me he had eight years to stew alex and dont forget he cooperated and still got sent to hell you know what cyas like no more status offenders and mischief makers this year there were six murders in the system liver scars i said even with that most people would think duchay got off easy for what he did but try telling that to the guy who went through it im thinking one very bitter twentyoneyearold excon maybe he had plans to pay lots of people back and you were first on the list why do you have doubts about him hooking up with a prison buddy what do you mean you said it was your working theory lord im being parsed he said no i havent abandoned the basic premise i just havent come up with any buddies duchay met in lockup yet cya guy i spoke to said he had no gang affiliations was socially isolated any disciplinary problems on his record quiet compliant good behavior i said yada yada so whats next talk to people who knew him try to get a fix on his movements that day i had sean hit every store on westwood for three blocks north of pico to see if anyone spotted duchay lurking around nada same for the westside pavilion so if he went in there he didnt make an impression tomorrow morning i visit reverend and mrs andrew daney reverend and reverend i said they were both studying to be ministers whatever i talked to her cherish theres a name for you she sounded pretty broken up all those good intentions blown to bits whyd you take the case on big guy why not you dont care much for the victim who i like or dont like has nothing to do with it he said and i am deeply hurt by your intimations to the contrary yada freaking yada i said seriously you can pick and choose why this one i picked it to make sure youre not in continuing danger i appreciate that but a simple thanks will suffice thanks youre welcome try to enjoy the sunshine until dr gwynn returns what time are you seeing the daneys tomorrow not your problem he said sleep in should i drive alex these people were advocates for the boys that could make you not their favorite person my report wasnt a factor in the decision to certify them as juveniles which i should point out is exactly what their lawyers were asking for theres no logical reason for me to be targeted strangling and beating a twoyearold wasnt logical what time i said the appointments for eleven ill drive i picked him up at the station at tenthirty and took the sepulveda pass out to the valley he said nothing as we crossed sunset and passed the spot where rand duchays body had been found i said wonder how he got from the valley into the city seans checking the buses probably a waste of time like so much of what we do the galton street address where drew and cherish daney advised spiritually was in a bluecollar van nuys neighborhood a few blocks from the the sky was the color of newspaper pulp freeway noise was a constant rebuke the property was fenced with redwood tongueandgroove but the gate was open and we entered a boxy paleblue bungalow sat at the front of the eighthacre lot at the rear were two smaller outbuildings one a converted garage painted a matching blue the other set slightly back an unpainted cement block cube the free space was mostly pavement broken by a few beds of draftfriendly plants edged with lava rock cherish daney sat in a lawn chair to the left of the main house reading in full sun when she saw us she shut the book and stood i got close enough to read the title lifes lessons coping with grief a piece of tissue paper extended from between the pages her hair was still whiteblond and long but the teasedup bulk and sidewings of eight years ago had been traded for bangs and simplicity she had on a white sleeveless top over blue slacks and gray shoes the same silver chain and crucifix shed worn that day at the jail most people put on weight as they get older but she had reduced to a hard dry leanness still a young woman midthirties was my guess but fats a good wrinkle filler and her face had collected some tributaries the same sunbronzed complexion the same pretty features noticeable curve to her back as if her spine had bowed under some terrible weight she smiled without opening her mouth redrimmed eyes if she recognized me she didnt say so when milo gave her his card she glanced at it and nodded thanks for seeing us reverend sure she said a screen door slammed and the three of us turned toward the sound a girl fifteen or sixteen had come out of the main house and stood on the front steps holding what looked to be a school workbook cherish daney said what do you need valerie the girls return stare seemed resentful val help with my math of course bring it over the girl hesitated before walking over her wavy black hair trailed past her waist plump build her face was dusky round her gait stiff and selfconscious when she got to cherish daney she alternated between looking at us and pretending not to these men are police officers val theyre here about rand oh were all very sad about rand arent we val uhhuh cherish said okay show me what the problem is valerie opened the book sixthgrade arithmetic these ones im doing them right but im not getting the right answers cherish touched the girls arm lets take a look i know im doing them right valeries fingers flexed she rocked on her feet glanced at milo and me val said cherish lets focus touching valeries cheek she guided the girls eyes toward the book val shook off the contact but stared at the page we stood there as cherish attempted to unravel the mysteries of fractions speaking slowly enunciating clearly skirting the line between patience and patronizing not losing her patience during valeries lapses of concentration which were frequent the girl tapped her feet drummed her hands on various body parts wriggled craned her neck sighed a lot her eye contact was hummingbirdflighty and she kept glancing over at us shooting her gaze to the sky then down on the ground the book the house a squirrel that scampered up the redwood fence id gone to school for too long to resist diagnosis cherish daney stayed on track finally got the girl to focus on a single problem until she achieved success there you go great val lets do another one no im okay i get it now i think one mores a good idea emphatic head shake youre sure val without answering valerie ran back toward the house dropped the workbook and cried out in frustration bent and retrieved it flung the screen door open and disappeared sorry for the interruption said cherish shes a terrific kid but she needs a lot of structure add i said its that obvious huh now she stared at me with wide blue eyes i know who you are the psychologist who saw rand alex delaware i held out my hand she took it readily we met at the jail yes we did reverend i guess she said our paths cross at sad junctures occupational hazard i said both our occupations i suppose actually im not a minister just a teacher i smiled just a teacher it comes in handy she said for homeschooling we homeschool the kids milo said foster kids thats right how long do they stay with you i said no set time val was supposed to be with us for sixty days while her mother was evaluated for detox then her mother odd and died and all of vals relatives live in arizona she barely knows them her mom ran away from home top of that they werent interested in taking her so shes been with us nearly a year how many fosters do you care for it varies my husbands shopping over at value club we buy in bulk what was the arrangement with rand duchay said milo the arrangement with the state cherish daney shook her head that wasnt a formal situation lieutenant we knew rand was being released and had nowhere to go so we took him in the county had no problem with his being here said milo with kids it never came up she stiffened youre not going to cause problems for us are you it wouldnt be fair to the kids no maam it was just a question that came to mind there was never any danger she said rand was a good person same claim hed made neither milo nor i answered cherish daney said i dont expect you to believe this but eight years transformed him to a good person lieutenant he wasnt going to be with us long term anyway just until he found a job and a place to stay my husband had made inquiries with some nonprofits figuring maybe rand could work at a thrift shop or do some landscaping work then rand took the initiative and came up with the idea of construction thats where he went saturday any idea how he ended up in bel air she shook her head hed have no reason to be there the only thing i can think of is he got lost and someone picked him up rand could be very trusting he never phoned you he didnt have a phone she said hed called me from a pay booth milo said how close is the construction site up a few blocks on vanowen not very far in terms of getting lost lieutenant rand spent his entire adolescence in prison when he got out he was extremely disoriented his world was a buzz of confusion william james i said pardon pioneer of psychology he called childhood a blooming buzzing confusion i probably learned that said cherish i took psychology in seminary milo said so you kept in regular contact with rand while he was in custody we did she said right after troy died we initiated contact why then initially we were more involved with troy because we knew him before the trouble the trouble being kristal malleys murder said milo cherish daney looked away her stoop became more pronounced howd you know troy before mrs daney when my husband and i were students part of our community service seminar involved identifying needs in the community our apartment wasnt that far from city so we knew its reputation our faculty adviser thought it would be a good place to find kids with needs we talked to social services and they identified several prospects troy was one of them rand wasnt i said rand never got his name on any lists troublemaker lists said milo she nodded we met with troy a couple of times tried to get him involved with church or sports or a hobby but we never really connected then after he mustve mentioned us to his lawyer because she contacted us and said it would be a great time to start counseling him spiritually bible in a cell smooth talk about sin why didnt you connect initially said milo you know how it is kids dont always take to talking she looked to me for confirmation before i could offer any milo said being arrested help troys communication skills she sighed you think were naive its not that we were unaware of the enormity of what troy had done but we recognized that hed also been victimized you met his mother doctor where is she i said dead she said snapping off the word after troys body was ready for burial the chino coroners office contacted us they couldnt find jane and we were the only other people on his visitor list we contacted ms weider but she no longer worked for the public defender troys body sat at the morgue until our dean agreed to donate a plot in san bernadino where some of the faculty members are buried we conducted a service she touched her crucifix suddenly tears streamed down her face she made no effort to dry them that day my husband and myself and dr wascomb our dean a beautiful sunny day and we watched cemetery workers lower that pathetic little coffin into the ground a month later detective kramer called us jane had been found under a freeway ramp one of those homeless encampments wrapped up in a sleeping bag and plastic tarp which is the way she always slept so the other homeless people didnt think anything of it until she still hadnt budged by noon shed been stabbed sometime during the night whoever killed her wrapped her back up she shuddered pulled out the tissue paper bookmark and wiped her face milo said how long was that after troys death six weeks two months whats the difference my point is these were lost boys and now rand any idea whod want to hurt rand she shook her head what was his mood like disoriented as i told you reeling from freedom not happy at all about getting out to be honest not really did he have any plans other than getting a job we were taking things slowly helping him settle in could we see his room sure she said such as it is we followed her through a compact tidy living room a dim galley kitchen and eating area then a low narrow corridor one bedroom the master with barely enough room for the furniture that filled it a single bathroom served the entire house at the end of the hall was a windowless space eightfoot square cherish daney said this is it cheap paneling covered the walls capped off pipes sprouted from the vinyl floor milo said this used to be a laundry room service porch we moved the washer and dryer outside a framed bible scene nordic solomon and two valkyrian women claiming motherhood of the same fat blond infant hung over a foldable cot a white plastic lamp sat on a raw wood nightstand milo opened the drawers wellthumbed bible on top nothing in the bottom a dented footlocker served as a closet inside were two white tshirts two blue work shirts a pair of blue jeans cherish daney said we never even got a chance to buy him clothes we walked back to the front of the house she peered through a window heres my husband id better go help him chapter drew daney came through the gateway gripping two large bags of groceries in each arm an even larger mesh sack filled with oranges dangled from his right thumb cherish took the fruit and reached for one of the bags daney held on im okay cher dark eyes sighted us over the groceries he stopped and placed the load on the ground dr delaware you remember its an unusual name he said coming forward his wrestlers frame had taken on fifteen or so pounds most of them soft and his thick wavy hair was graying at the temples he wore a beard now a stubbly silver thing neatly trimmed around the edges his white polo shirt was spotless and pressed so were his blue jeans same color scheme as his wife also he said i read your report to the judge so your name stuck in my mind cherish looked at him and went inside the house howd you come to read it i said sydney weider wanted my opinion as troys counselor i told her i thought it was a careful document you didnt want to go out on a limb and say something unscientific but you clearly werent willing to give the boys a pass a pass on murder said milo at the time we were hoping for a miracle we the boys families sydney my wife myself it just seemed that putting the boys away forever wouldnt solve anything forever turned out to be eight years reverend said milo detective whats your name please sturgis detective sturgis in the life of a child eight years is eternity daney ran a hand through his hair in troys case a month was eternity and now rand unbelievable any idea who mightve wanted to hurt rand sir daneys lips puffed his toe scuffed one of the grocery bags and he lowered his voice i dont want my wife hearing this but there probably is something you should know probably daney eyed the front door of his house could we find a place to talk later sooners better than later sir okay sure i see your point ive got a youth council meeting in sylmar at two i could leave a little early and meet you in say ten minutes sounds good said milo where how about at the dipsy donut on vanowen a few blocks west well be there reverend both of you he said dr delawares consulting on the case ah said daney makes sense told you said milo as we drove away youre still the opposing team and you im the sleuth assigned the honor of clearing duchays murder want me to wait in the car while you two bond right wonder what the rev wants to keep from his wife sounds like something that would scare her scary he said is always interesting the doughnut stand was a flimsy white booth on a cracked blacktop lot topped by a sixfoot partially eaten doughnut with humanoid features brown plaster chipped in several spots tried to resemble chocolate wildeyed merriment said the deepfried creature loved being devoured three grubbylooking aluminum tableandbench sets were scattered on the asphalt the signage had lost a couple of letters di sy don t milo said and here i was thinking she did the place was full of customers we went inside and breathed fat and sugar and waited in line as three harried kids bagged and served oversized fritters to a salivating throng milo bought a dozen assorted finished a jelly and a chocolate in the time it took to get back to the car hey he said its part of the job description and chewings aerobic enjoy you say that but youve got this disapproving thing going on i took a hubcapsized apple danish out of the box and got to work on it satisfied creative people are never satisfied we sat in the seville where he polished off a jellyfilled i said wonder what rand did between sixthirty and nine me too forgot coffee want some no thanks he returned to the doughnut shack just as the reverend drew daney drove up in an older white jeep i got out of the car and milo came back with two coffees he offered daney the doughnut box daney had added a blue blazer to his ensemble had his hands in his pockets any crèmes the three of us sat at one of the outdoor tables daney found a raspberry crème bit into it exhaled with satisfaction guilty pleasures huh you got it reverend im not ordained so you can just call me drew didnt finish seminary chose not to said daney same for cherish we both got involved in youth work and decided that was our calling i dont regret it a pulpit is usually more about internal politics than good works youth work said milo as in foster care foster care homeschooling coaching counseling i work with several nonprofits the meeting in sylmar he looked at his watch better cut to the chase this is probably nothing but i feel its my duty to tell you he finished his doughnut wiped crumbs from his lap six months ago rand was transferred to camarillo awaiting discharge thursday night my wife and i drove up and brought him home he looked as if hed landed on another planet disoriented i said using his wifes term more than that stunned think about it doctor eight years of extreme structure his entire adolescence spent behind bars and now hes released to a strange new world we fed him dinner showed him his room and he went straight to bed all we had was a converted service porch but i tell you that boy looked grateful to be in a small space again the next morning i was up at sixthirty as usual went to check on him his bed was empty made up neat as a pin i found him outside sitting on the front steps he looked worse than the previous night dark circles under his eyes really jumpy i asked him what was wrong and he just stared at our front gate which was wide open i told him everything would be okay he needed to give himself time that only made him more agitated he started shaking his head really fast then he covered his face with his hands daney demonstrated it was as if he was hiding from something playing ostrich i pried his fingers loose and asked him what was wrong he didnt answer and i told him it was important for him to let his feelings out finally he told me someone was watching him that caught me offguard but i tried not to show it i asked him who he said he didnt know but hed heard sounds at night someone moving around outside his window the propertys small and neither my wife nor i had heard anything i asked him what time he said during the night he didnt have a watch then he said he heard it again early morning right after sunrise got up and found the gate open and saw a truck driving away fast we always close the gate but its just a pulllatch and sometimes if its not shut tight the wind blows it open so i didnt consider that any big deal what kind of truck said milo he said a dark pickup i didnt push him because i didnt want to make a big deal out of it it just didnt seem that important milo said you doubted his credibility its not a matter of credibility said daney dr delaware you tested rand have you told the detective how severely learning disabled he was i nodded now combine that with the challenge of reentry i said had you known him to fantasize about things that didnt exist like a hallucination said daney no thats not what happened friday it was more exaggerating normal events i figured hed heard a bird or a squirrel now youre not sure said milo in view of what happened said daney id be foolish not to wonder anything happen between friday and saturday night he didnt say anything more about being watched or the dark truck and i didnt bring it up said daney he took a walk and came back and said hed been by a construction site and was going to go back in the afternoon to talk to the boss what time was the first walk said milo we eat early maybe eight eightthirty am what kind of job was he looking for anything i guess he had no real skills cya rehabilitation i said daneys husky shoulders bunched dont get me started milo said sir your wife says rand left at five pm to meet the supervisor but the site closes down by noon i guess rand was misinformed detective or someone misled him why would they do that people like rand tend to be misled he consulted his watch again and stood sorry i need to get going one more question said milo im going to be contacting rands family any idea where to start dont bother to start said daney theres no one his grandmother died several years ago complications of heart disease i was the one who informed rand howd he react just what youd imagine he was extremely upset he glanced at his jeep i dont know if any of this was useful but i thought i should tell you milo said i appreciate it sir you didnt want your wife to know because no sense upsetting her even if it was relevant it would have nothing to do with her is there anything else that might help me sir said milo daney jammed his hand in his pocket looked at the jeep again ran a hand across the steel needles of his beard this is ticklish i really dont know if i should be bringing it up bring what up sir rand was found far from home so i was thinking maybe that truck what if someone did take him for a ride he tried to tug at an eighthinch beard hair finally managed to pincer one between his fingernails pulled stretched his cheek a dark pickup said milo that ring any bells thats the thing said daney it does but im really not comfortable i know this is a murder investigation but if you could be discreet about what quoting me as the source said daney he bit his lip theres a whole lot of history here something to do with eight years ago daney pulled at his cheek again created a lopsided frown ill be as discreet as possible sir said milo i know you will daney turned as a truck loaded with bags of fertilizer drove onto the lot dark blue a stickon sign said hernandez landscaping two mustachioed guys in dusty jeans and baseball caps got out and entered the doughnut stand daney said see what i mean pickups are all over im sure its no big deal give it a shot anyway mr daney for rands sake daney sighed okay another sigh barnett malley kristal malleys father drives a dark pickup or at least he used to eight years ago said milo no no more recently two years ago thats when i ran into him at a true value hardware store not far from here i was buying parts to fix a garbage disposal and he was loading up on tools i noticed him right away but he didnt see me i tried to avoid him but we encountered each other at the register i let him go ahead of me watched him leave and get into his truck a black pickup you two talk said milo i wanted to said daney wanted to tell him i could never really understand his pain but that id prayed for his daughter wanted to let him know that just because id reached out to troy and rand didnt mean i didnt understand his tragedy but he gave me a look that said dont go there he hugged himself hostile i said more than that doctor how much more said milo his eyes said daney pure hatred we watched the white jeep drive off milo said barnett malley it has now officially gotten messy so how would an ambush fit the time frame and the call to you an hour and a half after he left the daneys rand couldve lied to the daneys about going to the construction site why would he do that because he had a meeting before the one with me and didnt want them to know about it with barnett malley why would he do that i told you he sounded troubled if guilt was weighing him down and he was trying to prove he was a good person who better to ask for forgiveness than malley daney said he was freaked out by being watched but the next morning he looked better maybe hed somehow made contact with malley decided to take positive action state law requires notification of victims families when a felons released so malley wouldve known rand was out what if malley kept an eye on rand confronted him facetoface during rands first trip to the site at eight am they agreed to meet later and rand invented the appointment with the construction supervisor as cover not an ambush he said he gets in malleys truck voluntarily then it goes bad rand was impressionable not very smart eager for absolution if malley came across friendly forgiving rand wouldve been eager to buy it okay lets think this through rand hooks up with malley around five pm malley drives him into the city drops him off at the mall and rand calls you to set up another meeting why alex first time using the victims first name some kind of transition had taken place i said dont know unless rand and malley had made peace and rand decided to keep the process going he rubbed his face vigorously as if washing without water not much of a peace if malley shot him what malley dropped him off then picked him up again maybe malley had more to talk about the two of them rode around together schmoozing about the bad old days malley decided to off him rather than let him eat pizza with you even if we can explain all that the big question remains if this is all about payback why would malley wait eight years maybe he was willing to wait for both boys to get out but a cya gangbanger beat him to troy so he bides his time on rand he drank coffee according to daney malley was still heated up two years ago malley wanted the death penalty i said some wounds never heal theory theory theory so now what i intrude on a couple who lost their kid in the worst possible way because hubby gave daney a dirty look two years ago and he drives a black pickup it could be touchy i said it could require some serious psychological sensitivity i took a bite of danish a few minutes ago it had tasted great now it was deepfried dust do i have to spell it out alex id rather you do it and ill watch youre not worried my presence will disrupt the defense saw you as proprosecution so maybe the malleys will remember you fondly for the same reason no reason for them to remember me at all i said never met them really there was no reason to funny how defensive that sounded well he said now theres a reason chapter milo phoned dmv for current licenses and registrations on barnett and lara malley nothing for her barnett melton malley had a soledad canyon address out in antelope valley the birth date fits he said one vehicle a tenyearold ford pickup black at the time of registration soledads forty fifty miles from van nuys i said after what they went through i can see them wanting to get out of the city rural area like that lara would need to drive so why isnt she licensed theyre not living together and she moved out of state a tragedy like that can drive people apart i can think of a giant wedge he said kristal was snatched from under her nose maybe hubby blamed her or i said she blamed herself as we returned to the city sean binchy called in van nuys division had no record of any call from the daneys about rands disappearance no big surprise said milo he wasnt officially missing so it wasnt filed whats the current status of your felonious friend theory have i abandoned it completely because barnett malley owns a black truck like daney said plenty of pickups in the valley but malley had good reason to hate rand id be an idiot to ignore him when were you planning on visiting him i was thinking tomorrow he said late enough to avoid the morning rush but early enough not to get tied up coming back first im gonna try to find out where he works if i get lucky and its somewhere closer ill call you he scribbled in his notepad returned it to his pocket or even luckier some mitigating factor will emerge like an ironclad alibi for malley you dont want it to be him i said hey he said how about lunch im thinking tandoori lamb we stopped at the station first where he cleared his messages and ran barnett malley through ncic and the other criminal databases and came up empty same for lara malley i stayed on my feet expecting wed soon leave for café moghul but he just sat there eyes closed passing the phone from one hand to the other until he called the hall of records downtown and asked for a clerk who owed him a favor it took awhile to get through but once he connected the conversation was brief when he hung up he looked weary lara malleys deceased seven years ago suicide by firearm women are shooting themselves more nowadays but back then it was a little unusual right pills were the ladies choice not always if the ladies were serious i said mommy cashes in a year after kristals murder enough time to see life wasnt getting any better the malleys ever get any therapy alex dont know he began punching his computer keyboard as if it was a sparring partner logged onto the state firearms registration file squinted and stared and copied something down and drew his lips back in a strange hollow smile that made me glad i wasnt his enemy mr barnett melton malley has amassed quite an arsenal thirteen shotguns rifles and handguns including a couple of thirtyeights maybe he lives alone in a secluded area hed have more reason than most to be vigilant who says he lives alone same answer i said if he started a new family hed want to protect it angry bitter guy he said loses his entire family to violence moves out to the boonies with a stash of firepower heavy enough to outfit a militia maybe hes in a militia one of those survivalist yahoos am i overreaching if i use the term high risk if he intended to murder someone why would he register his weapons who says he registered all of them he fumbled in a desk drawer pulled out a woodentipped cigar rolled it between his palms the way rand was shot he said contact wound left side of the head the killer at approximately the same height taken by surprise like you suggested that conjure up an image the killer was sitting to his left i said close to him as in the drivers seat of a vehicle he pointed the cigar at me thats the channel that switched on in my head in terms of premeditation maybe malley didnt think it out maybe he started out wanting to talk to rand to confront the guy whod ruined his life we both know victims families sometimes crave that i said malley had eight years for that but perhaps rands release triggered old memories malley picks him up drops him off drives around and finds out hes still got unfinished business with rand they drive up somewhere in the hills and something goes wrong rand wasnt articulate he said the wrong thing to malley and triggered bigtime rage im a good person he said i can see that coming out wrong he bolted up tried to pace the tiny office took a single attenuated step reached my chair and sat back down i was an obstruction my thoughts drifted to new york on a crisp snowy day gallivanting i said if malley came armed on the other hand there mightve been premeditation he was meeting up with his daughters murderer like you said hed have good reason to be careful a good lawyer could make a pretty good case for selfdefense he tossed the cigar onto the desk listen to this were psychoanalyzing the poor bastard and neither of us has ever met him for all we know hes a pacifist zen buddhist vegan transcendental meditator living out in the woods in the name of serenity with thirteen guns there is that minor sticking point he said man id love to have the techies go over that black truck of his love to have grounds for it alex how about we scotch lunch for some reason my appetites waning i said sure he turned away and i left when i was ten feet up the hall i heard him call out eventually well do the tandoori bit ill have my people call your people he phoned that evening at sevenforty i said what happened to your people on strike did more background on malley eight years ago he ran his own poolcleaning service then it stopped a year later after lara shot herself maybe he dropped out whatever the reason given no workplace i figure to set out at ten tomorrow morning the grinning fool who reads the weather on tv says warm airs coming in from hawaii closest im gonna get to a tropical vacation sound good want me to pick you up at home no youre doing the psychology bit but im the wheelman he said its time to be somewhat official he arrived at tenfifteen looking as official as he was ever going to be baggy brown suit white shirt puttycolored tie the desert boots i had on my courtroom outfit blue pinstriped threebutton blue shirt yellow tie whether barnett malley was a vengeancesworn gun freak or a quietly grieving victim wardrobe wasnt going to make a difference milo grabbed a stale bagel from my kitchen and chewed at it as he drove down to sunset then turned right toward the north this time he slowed and pointed out the spot where rand duchays body had been found shrubby patch on the east side of the rise that paralleled the onramp no tall trees just ice plant and juniper and weeds no serious intent to conceal the route from the dump spot to soledad canyon would take you right past here milo spoke the obvious do your thing dump him go home the trip was fiftyeight minutes of easy driving under blue skies the weatherman had been righteous eighty degrees no smog the air blessed by one of those faintly fruity tropical breezes that blows in all too rarely we passed through the northern edge of bel air lush green hills studded with optimistically perched houses then the stunningly white cubes that make up the getty museum its an architectural masterpiece funded by a venal billionaires trust housing thirdrate art pure la might makes right and packaging is all traffic stayed light all the way through the valley the freeway fringe shifted to the massive sunkist packaging plant smaller factories bigbox stores auto dealerships not far east was the daney house where rand had slept for three nights of alleged freedom by the time we transitioned to the it was mostly us and eighteenwheelers who had veered off onto the truck route three minutes later we were on cal speeding northeast toward antelope valley the mountains got majestic lush green giving way to wrinkled brown felt the scenery off the highway was scrap yards gravel pits the occasional deluxe townhome tract and little else wise people say expansion to the northeast is the future of la and some day the notion of open space will be shattered meanwhile the hawks and ravens do their thing overhead and the earth lies flat and still fifteen degrees cooler we closed the windows and wind whistled through the seal ten miles later milo exited at soledad canyon and hooked a left away from the boomtown development of santa clarita and toward peace and quiet the road climbed and curved and curled and hooked isolated stands of spruce and the occasional windbreak eucalyptus hugged the west side of the highway but the big players were california oaks glorying in their dryearth beds graygreen crowns shimmering in the wind copses of the majestic trees ran clear to the next ridge of mountain theyre tough ancient creatures that delight in selfdenial when you spoil them with too much water they die as the foliage thinned the road demanded more respect hairpin curves wrapping around acute edges of sere mountains spillover from rock slides pasting milos eyes to the road the winds whistle grew to an insistent howl the big birds swooped lower flew more assertively nothing to hamper them but the occasional power pole no sign of any other cars for miles then a woman chattering happily on a cell phone came barreling around a blind curve in a minivan and nearly sideswiped us brilliant said milo when his breathing had settled soledad means loneliness right youd have to like your alone time to move out here a thousand feet higher a few ranches appeared small scrubby desultory plots set into gullies notched off the highway and bounded by metal flex fencing a cow here a horse there a weathered sign to nowhere advertised weekend pony rides no stock to back it up read me the address alex i did he said were getting close ten miles later we came upon several private picnic grounds set off the west side of soledad canyon road cozy bye smiths oasis stop lulus welcome ranch the numbers that matched barnett malleys address were burned into a blue roadside sign that announced mountain view sojourn recreation and picknicks i said maybe hes not that antisocial after all milo pulled off onto the hardpack driveway we bumped along an oaklined dirt path until we came to a shaky wooden bridge that crossed a narrow arroyo the blue welcome sign on the other side was bottomed by a whitewashed plank that listed a magna carta of regulations no smoking no drinking no motorcycles no offroad vehicles no loud music pets by individual approval only children must be supervised the pool is for use of registered guests only milo said take that thoreau and kept driving the entry drive ended a hundred yards later at an open paved square to the left were more oaks an old thick grove and directly in front of us were three small whiteframe buildings to the right sat another paved area larger and sectioned by white lines half a dozen troutdecaled winnebagos were hooked up to utility lines the backdrop was sheer golden mountainside we parked and got out a shedsized generator behind the rv lot hummed and snicked recreation and picnicking seemed to mean a place to park access to a bank of chemical toilets and a few redwood tables an inground pool drained for the winter was a giant white gunite bowl behind the swimming area a pipefenced horse corral was empty and sunbleached a few people none below sixty sat in folding chairs near their trailers reading knitting eating must be a stopover i said to where said milo i had no answer for that and we continued walking toward the whiteframe buildings prewar bungalows all three were roofed with green tar paper and had stout casement windows and tiny front porches the largest structure was set well back from the campgrounds a thirtyyearold dodge charger red with chrome wheels occupied the adjoining gravel driveway staked signs shaped like pointing hands identified the other two buildings as office and refreshments the sunlight made it hard to discern any internal illumination we tried the office first locked door curtains across the windows no response to milos knock as we headed over to refreshments its door creaked open and a tall thin woman in a brown print dress stepped out onto the porch and positioned her hands on her hips can i help you milo put on his welcome smile as we approached her it didnt change the wary expression on her face neither did his badge and his business card la police she had a smokers voice sinewy freckled arms a scored suncured face that mightve been beautiful a few decades ago wideset pinklashed amber eyes examined both of us her nose was strong and straight her lips chapped but suggestive of onceuponatime fullness permed auburn hair framed her in a way that concealed some of the wattle in her neck white frizz near her hairline said she was due for a touchup clean jawline for a woman of her age sixtyfive minimum was my guess katharine hepburns country cousin she tried to return milos card he said its yours to keep maam and she folded it small enough to conceal in her hand the brown dress was a floral jersey and it caught on the sharp bones of her shoulders and pelvis the upper edge of her sunspotted sternum was visible in the vneckline her chest was flat i used to live in la she said back when i didnt know any better same question lieutenant sturgis what can i do for you does barnett malley live here the amber eyes blinked he okay far as i know maam same question barnett works here and i give him a place to stay works as my helper doing what needs to be done handyman said milo the woman frowned as if hed never get it he fixes things but its more than that sometimes i feel like driving into santa clarita and seeing a movie though god knows why theyre all awful barnett looks after the place for me and he does an excellent job whyre you asking about him he live on the premises right there she pointed to the oak grove in the trees said milo we talking tarzan she conceded a halfsmile no hes got a cabin you cant see it from here but hes not there now who said you asked if he was okay i meant was he okay copwise not was he okay because he was somewhere out there she glanced toward the highway her eyes said leaving the homestead was highly overrated has barnett ever been in cop trouble mrs bunny she said bunny macintyre the answer is no milo said so you used to live in la were making small talk now yeah i lived in hollywood had an apartment on cahuenga cause i needed to be close to the burbank studios she flipped her hair used to do stunts for the movies did a couple body doubles for miss kate hepburn she was way older than me but she had a great body so they could use me ms macintyre back to business ay barnetts never been in any kind of trouble but when la cops drive all the way here and ask questions its not because they want a nice cold drink from my coke machine which incidentally is working just fine ive got nachos and chips and some imported bison jerky she eyed milos waistline bisons good for you has the saturated fat of skinless chicken he said wheres it imported from montana she turned and walked back inside we followed her into a single dim room with wide plank floors and a hoop rug and the head of a large stuffed buck mounted on the rear wall the animals antlers were asymmetrical a gray tongue tip poked from a corner of its mouth and one glass eye was missing thats bullwinkle said bunny macintyre idiot used to sneak in and eat my garden i used to sell fresh produce to the tourists now all people want is junk food i never shot him because he was stupid you had to take pity one day he just dropped dead of old age on top of my swiss chard so i took him to a taxidermist over in palmdale she walked over to an old red cocacola machine flanked by revolving racks of fried stuff in plastic bags a cash register squatted on an old oak table beside it was the jerky roughcut nearly black stacked in plastic canisters on the counter ready for that diet coke she asked milo sure what about you quiet guy the same i said how much buffalo jerky its a buck a stick maybe later maam you notice what its like out there damn oil painting those deadbeats park all day and eat their own junk darn portable freezers i could use the business ill take a stick said milo three sticks minimum said bunny macintyre three for three bucks and with the diet cokes thatll be six and a half without waiting for an answer she pressed buttons on the machine and released two cans wrapped the jerky in paper towels that she bound with rubber bands and slipped it into a plastic bag theres no grease to speak of milo paid her how long has barnett worked for you four years whered he work before that gilbert grasss ranch used to be up a ways on soledad gilbert had a stroke and retired his animals barnetts a good boy i cant see what business youd have with him and i dont pay attention to his comings and goings how do we get to his cabin walk back behind my house the one with no sign and youll see the cut in the trees i built the cabin so id have some privacy it was supposed to be my painting studio but i never got around to painting i used it for storage until barnett fixed it up nice for himself chapter the path through the trees was a sixfootwide swath overhung by branches the black ford pickup was parked in front of the cabin the tiny building was raw cedar with a plank door one square window in front as simple as a childs drawing of a house propane gas tanks stood to the left along with a clothesline and a smaller generator the trucks windows were rolled up and milo got close and peered through the glass he keeps it neat he used a corner of his jacket and tried the handle locked you wouldnt think hed be worried about theft out here we walked up to the cabin green oilskin drapes blocked the window a square of concrete served as a front patio a hemp mat said welcome milo knocked the plank was solid and barely sounded but within seconds the door opened barnett malley looked out at us he was taller than hed appeared on tv an inch above milos sixthree still lean and rawboned he wore his yellowgray hair long and loose fuzzy muttonchops trailed below his jaw before rightangling toward a lipless mouth sun exposure had coarsened and splotched his complexion he wore a gray work shirt sleeves rolled to the elbows thick wrists veined forearms yellowed nails clipped straight dusty jeans buckskin cowboy boots a silverandturquoise necklace ringed the spot just below a prominent adams apple a peace symbol dangled from the central turquoise more aging hippie than militiaman his eyes were silver blue and still milo showed him id malley barely glanced at it mr malley i dont mean to intrude but there are some questions id like to ask you malley didnt answer sir silence milo said are you aware that rand duchay was murdered saturday night malley clicked his teeth together backed into his cabin closed the door milo knocked called malleys name no response we walked to the south side of the house no windows at the rear a single horizontal pane was set high into the northern wall milo stretched upward and rapped the glass bird calls forest rustles then music honkytonk piano a tune id always liked floyd cramers last date solo piano a recording id never heard momentary hesitation then the tune repeated a flubbed note followed by fluidity not a recording live malley played the song through then began again improvising a basic but decently phrased solo the rendition repeated ended milo took advantage of the silence and knocked on malleys window again malley resumed playing same tune different improv milo turned on his heel lips moving i couldnt make out what he said and knew better than to ask on our way out of the campgrounds we spotted bunny macintyre over by the rvs talking to one of the elderly couples her hand went out and some bills were passed she saw us turned away charming rural folk said milo as we got back in the unmarked is that the theme from deliverance i hear wafting through the piney woods shouldve brought my guitar a duet with barnett the pianner man was that the reaction of an innocent guy alex i was hoping i could eliminate him but just the opposite wonder why he keeps that welcome mat in front i said maybe some people are welcome he turned the ignition key let the car idle the bloodhound part of me is itching to sniff but the selfstyled protector of victims thinks its gonna be a shame if malley turns out to be a murderer guys life was blown to bits i dont read the bible but on some level i get the whole eyeforaneye thing i get it too i said even though eye for an eye was never meant to be taken literally sez who if you read the original biblical text the context is pretty clear its tort law monetary compensation for damages did you come up with that on your own a rabbi told me guess hed know he drove out of the campgrounds turned onto the highway switched on the police band crime was down but the dispatchers recitation of felonies was constant the possibilities he said are dismal thursday morning he called at elevenfifteen time for tandoori id just gotten off the phone with allison wed managed to sneak in some personal talk before her grandmothers call for tea and comfort drew her away the plan was for her to return in two or three days depending i said whats up lets talk about it over food he said itll be a test of your appetite café moghul is on santa monica boulevard a couple of blocks west of butler walking distance from the station the storefront ambience is dressed up by carved offwhite moldings and arches designed to mimic ivory polychrome tapestry murals of indian country scenes posters of bollywood movies the soundtrack alternates sitar drones with ultrahigh soprano renditions of punjab pop the woman who runs the place welcomed me with her usual smile we always greet each other like old friends ive never learned her name todays sari was peacock blue silk embroidered with gold swirls her eyeglasses were off she had huge chocolate eyes that id never noticed before contacts she said im trying something new good for you so far so good hes over there pointing to a rear table as if i needed directions the layout was four tables on each side divided by a center aisle a group of twentysomethings was gathered around two tables pushed together dipping nan bread into bowls of chutney and chili paste and toasting some sort of success with lal toofan beer other than them just milo he was hunched over a gigantic salad bowl sifting through lettuce and retrieving chunks of what looked to be fish a cutglass pitcher of iced clove tea sat at his elbow when he saw me he filled a glass and pushed it toward me the special he said plinking the rim of the salad bowl with his fork salmon and paneer and these little dry rice noodles over green stuff with lemonoil dressing pretty healthy huh im getting worried about you get real worried he said this is wild pacific salmon the intrepid types that leap upstream when theyre horny apparently farmed fish are bland lazy wimps and theyre also full of toxic crap the politicians of the fish world i said he speared a piece of fish i ordered you the same i drank tea whats going to test my digestive juices lara malleys suicide got hold of the final report from van nuys turns out the ds who worked it were the same ones who busted turner and rand sue kramer and a male partner i said something with an r fernie reyes im impressed i read their report on kristal more times than i wanted to fernie moved to scottsdale does security for a hotel chain sue retired and joined a pi agency over in san bernardino ive got a call in to her here comes your grub the bluesaried woman set a bowl down gently and swished off my salad was half the size of milo s which was still more than ample good huh he said i hadnt lifted my fork he watched until i did studied me as i ate delicious i said technically true but tension had blocked the circuit from my taste buds to my brain and i mightve been chewing a napkin whats off about the suicide cause of death was a single gunshot to the left temple a thirtyeight she was lefthanded so the coroner felt that supported a selfinflicted wound throughandthrough wound yup the bullet lodged in the passenger door the gun was a smith and wesson doubleaction perfected revolver registered to barnett he kept it loaded in his nightstand his story was lara musta taken it when he was at work drove to a quiet spot in the sepulveda recreational area and boom did she leave a note if she did its not in the coroners summary was the gun returned to malley no reason it wouldnt be he said he was the legal owner and no foul play was indicated he began shoveling fish and cubes of paneer cheese into his mouth maybe my ambivalence about malley was misguided his life went to hell but looks like he coped by getting rid of everyone he blamed for kristals death starting with lara because she hadnt kept her eye on the kid then the cya system took care of turner that left rand as the last messy detail why would he wait a full year after kristals death to kill lara i said i was being imprecise she died seven years and seven months ago just one month after troy and rand got sent away whats the obvious assumption maternal grief exactly great cover he pushed food around his plate malleys a weird one alex the way he started pounding on that piano i mean the smart thing to do the cops come calling is fake being cooperative he does that maybe i drop it unlikely i thought last date what the song he played youre saying he was being symbolic rand had a last date with life i shrugged he said guy keeps his truck locked even though he lives out in the boonies and the damn things sitting right in front of his cabin because he knows its hard to get rid of every speck of forensic evidence maybe hes an oldfashioned eyeforaneye guy doesnt give a shit about original biblical context other than the similarity to rand was there anything iffy about laras suicide nothing in sues report was she a good detective yeah so was fernie normally id assume theyd be damn thorough but in this case maybe they saw barnett as a victim and didnt think it through he frowned bunny macintyre likes him but she didnt vouch for his whereabouts sunday he poured himself tea but didnt drink it i need to get hold of the entire file on lara before i talk to sue thatll be fun reopening a case another d thinks is longclosed maybe ill use the helpless approach heres what im faced with sue i could use some help he grabbed his fork again held it poised over the bowl so hows your appetite fine proud of you he downed two bengal premiums called for the check and was slapping cash on the table when his cell chirped beethovens fifth sturgis oh hey yeah good to hear from you thanks would that be okay yeah sure let me write it down tucking the phone under one ear he scribbled on a napkin thanks see you in twenty rising to his feet he motioned me toward the exit some of the twentysomethings stopped laughing and looked at him as he loped out of the restaurant big scarylooking man all that merriment he didnt fit in that was sue kramer he said out on the sidewalk shes right here in the city working a suicide as it turns out and happy to chat about lara so much for reading the file its la i said improvise chapter the address was in beverly hills rexford drive south side of the city between wilshire and olympic where apartment buildings predominated thats her said milo pointing to a trim darkhaired woman walking a champagnecolored toy poodle up the west side of the block he pulled up to the curb and sue kramer smiled and waved and gathered the dog in her arms youre not allergic are you milo just to paperwork kramer got in the back of the unmarked as milo drove away she sniffed the air that good old dirtycuffs smell been awhile whatre you driving now ms private enterprise a jag a lexus and a range rover kramer was in her fifties with a tight leggy figure emphasized by black chalkstripe pipestem pants and a tailored gray jacket over a white silk shell her hair was inkblack cut short and spiked no jewelry black kate spade purse hooh hah said milo kramer said the lexus i earned myself my new husbands a financial guy he bought me the rover for a surprise nice new husband maybe the third times the charm the dog panted chill fritzi these are good guys i think shes smelling scumbag back here milo said my last passenger was deputy chief morales got stuck driving him to a meeting at parker there you go milo crossed rexford at olympic turned left on whitworth howre things sue things are great pipe down fritz san bernardino treating you well i could do without the smog but dwayne and i have a great weekend place in arrowhead how about you peachy what brings you to bh in the words of willie sutton thats where the money is said kramer seriously its a sad one divorce case korean couple the usual hassles over money and custody the husband decided to kill himself made sure the wife found him gun knife he ran a bath got in cut his wrists that was after calling the ex and telling her she could have the car and the kids and all the spousal payment shed demanded all he wanted was for her to come by so they could talk like mature adults she walked in saw bloody water running all over the apartment coroner says suicide but his divorce lawyer hired us to make sure iffy said milo not at all but you know attorneys this one wants to rack up a few more billable hours before he closes the file which is fine with bob my boss we dont make moral judgments we just do the job the apartment where it happened is back there im supposed to watch it for a few days see if anyone interesting goes in or out so far nothing im going out of my mind you did me a favor by calling she leaned forward to get a better look at me hi im sue alex delaware i reached back and we shook hands milo told her who i was i know that name said kramer you evaluated turner and duchay right right talk about sad milo said duchays dead sue thats why were here kramer stroked the poodle really tell me about it when he finished she said so youre thinking if malleys a vengeancecrazed killer maybe he did the same to lara im sure you were right on but you know how it is when stuff comes up no need to stroke me milo if the situation was reversed id do the same thing she sat back the dogs breathing had slowed kramer whispered something in its ear fernie and i did a good job on lara coroner confirmed it was suicide there was no reason to think it wasnt lara was what you psychologists call profoundly depressed doctor since kristals death shed lost weight was taking medication slept all day refused to socialize you got this from barnett thats right i found him a rather taciturn fellow yeah he did have the old clint eastwood thing going on said kramer but fernie and i had bonded with him because we caught the two little monsters what was his reaction to laras death sad wiped out guilty he said he shouldve taken her depression more seriously but theyd been having their problems and hed been focusing on his work what kind of problems marital stuff said kramer i didnt push this was a guy whod lost everything so he was feeling guilty for not paying attention to her suicide does that right doctor leaves all that guilt residue like the case im working on right now the wife hated the husbands guts did everything in her power to squeeze him dry during the divorce but seeing him bleeding out in that bathtub freaked her out and now shes remembering all sorts of wonderful things about him and blaming herself milo said did barnett express any guilt about lara using his gun no said kramer nothing like that i also talked to laras mother and she said basically the same she and barnett get along i said i got the feeling they didnt but she never came out and said anything bad about him said kramer what i got from her was that lara had really struggled after kristals death and she felt powerless to do anything about it poor woman her name was nina nina balquin she was devastated how could she not be lara was on medication i said she get that from a family doctor lara refused to see a therapist so nina gave her some of her pills mom was depressed too over kristal said kramer maybe there was more i got the sense this was a family that had dealt with a lot over the years like what said milo it was just a feeling im sure youve seen that doctor some families seem to live under a cloud but maybe my opinion was colored because i was seeing them at their worst twice i said talk about the pits im getting profoundly depressed just thinking about it said kramer she laughed softly and stroked the poodle fritzis my therapist she loves stakeouts walks in a straight line and doesnt talk said milo the perfect partner and doesnt need privacy to pee milo chuckled anything else that would be helpful sue thats it guys those cases made me so damn sad i couldnt wait to close both of them so maybe i overlooked something on lara i dont know but there really was nothing to indicate barnett had anything to do with it she sighed milo said i wouldnta done different sue you really think he couldve killed her you know him better than i do i knew him as a grieving father an angry grieving father isnt anger how men deal with everything neither of us answered sue kramer said if barnett blamed lara for being negligent he never said so to me can i see him waiting for duchay to get out and pulling a revenge thing i guess i know he was happy when the turner kid got shanked in jail he said that said milo yup i called to tell him about it figured it might hit the papers and he shouldnt find out that way he listened and said nothing there was this long silence i said barnett and he said i heard you i said you all right and he said thanks for calling good riddance to bad garbage then he hung up i have to say it creeped me out a little because turner was thirteen years old and the way he died was gross still it wasnt my kid he murdered the more i thought about barnetts pain the more i figured he was entitled barnett ever talk about rand said milo only before the sentencing he said he wanted them to get what they deserved which i suppose they did in the end milo stopped at a light at doheny sue kramer said i remember turners death making the paper but i didnt see anything about duchay was it in there nope said milo something like that youd think there would be coverage that would require a reporter actually ferreting something out said milo true said kramer those guys feed off press releases a beat unlike us huh milo we just keep running after trouble sticking our fingers in holes as the world floods milo grunted assent kramer said id better be getting back guys just my luck to be gone when something exciting happens and fritzis due for a bathroom break he circled back to rexford drop me off in the alley out back milo i left a little piece of tape at the bottom of the apartment door want to make sure no one broke it supersleuth said milo cant wait to close this one when im finished dwaynes taking me to fiji aloha you should get some sunshine yourself milo i dont tan right heres fine big guy milo rolled to a stop behind a whitebox apartment complex backed by parking slots stepping out kramer set the poodle down leaned into his window touched his shoulder the brassogracy treating you okay they leave me alone he said thats a brand of okay thats a brand of nirvana what do you think he asked me as we exited the alley and drove west on gregory drive she did a competent job didnt dig very deep what about that comment the family living under a cloud sounds like reality he grunted lets find laras other surviving relative see what her reality is chapter nina balquin was listed on bluebell avenue in north hollywood not far from the site of her daughters suicide or the buyrite mall or the park where her granddaughter had been taken to be murdered a short drive also to the daneys house in van nuys but for barnett malleys escape to rural solitude the case had tossed a narrow net milo got the number spoke briefly finished with thanks maam will do off we go he said shes surprised that i want to talk to her about barnett not upset just the opposite shes lonely as hell you picked that up in a thirtysecond conversation i didnt pick up anything he said she came right out with it im a lonely woman lieutenant any company would be welcome the house was a cantaloupe orange onestory ranch on a bright hot street the lawn was green pebbles a garden hose coiled loosely near the front steps maybe for watering the elephants ears that covered half the front wall this sisal doormat read djb over a heraldic crest the bell chimed doremi the woman who opened the door was petite of indeterminate middle age with narrow blue eyes and a glossy tension around the cheekbones that trumpeted the virtues of surgical steel she wore a fitted orange crepe blouse over black leggings and red chinatown slippers embroidered with dragons her brown hair was snipped boyshort with feathery sideburns that curled forward her right hand gripped a remote control a cigarette in her left dribbled smoke that trailed downward and dissolved before it reached her knee she tucked the remote under her arm lieutenant that didnt take long im nina her mouth smiled but the surrounding glassy skin didnt cooperate and the expression was robbed of emotional content the house had no entry foyer and we stepped directly into a paneled room topped by a slanted beamed ceiling all the wood was pickled oak yellowed by decades the carpet was rust plush flecked with blue the furniture beige tightly upholstered and newish as if it had been plucked intact from a showroom a paneled wet bar housed glasses and bottles and a flatscreen tv sat on the brown tile counter the set was on courtroom dispute the sound muted people mouthing aggression a bald scowling judge wielding a gavel in a way that couldnt escape freudian theory nina balquin said love that stuff its nice to see idiots get what theyve got coming aiming her remote she switched off drinks gentlemen no thanks it got kind of warm outside were fine maam well im having she walked to the bar and poured herself something clear from a chrome pitcher make yourselves comfortable milo and i sat on one of the beige sofas the fabric was coarse and pebbly and i felt the bumps against the backs of my legs nina balquin spent a long time adding ice to her drink i noticed a tremor in her hands milo was taking in the room and i did the same a few family photos hung lopsided on a rear wall too distant to make out sliding glass doors exposed a small rectangular swimming pool clumps of leaves and grit floated on greenish water rims of concrete decking too narrow for seating comprised the rest of the backyard walk out get wet come back in nina balquin settled perpendicular to us and sipped her drink i know its a mess i dont swim never used barnett for the pool maybe i shouldve he couldve been good for one thing she drank some more milo said youre not fond of barnett cant stand his guts because of how he treated lara and me why are you asking about him how he treated lara before kristals murder or after at the mention of her granddaughter balquin flinched you ask i answer fine but just tell me one thing is the bastard in some kind of trouble its possible balquin nodded the answer is he was rotten to lara before and after she met him at a rodeo can you believe that she went to good schools her father was a dentist the plan was she was supposed to go to the u but her grades went to hell in high school still there was plan two valley college so what does she do after graduating gets a job at a dude ranch in ojai and meets cowboy buckaroo and the next thing i know shes calling to inform me theyre married she gulped her drink swished liquid in her mouth swallowed stuck out her tongue lara was eighteen he was twentyfour she watches him rope horses or doggies or whatever they rope and suddenly the two of them are at some tacky little drivethrough chapel in vegas her father couldve killed them she smiled uneasily to use an expression milo said cant blame him for being upset ralph was furious who wouldnt be but he never said a thing to lara kept it all inside a year later he was diagnosed with stomach cancer and four months after that he was gone she glanced back at the dirty pool excuse me not gone dead at the time he was diagnosed we were in escrow on another house encino south of the boulevard gorgeous huge thank god ralph had decent life insurance does lara have siblings i said still trying to make out the photos my oldest mark is a cpa up in los gatos used to be comptroller for a dotcom hes doing fantastic as an independent consultant sandy the baby is in grad school at the university of minnesota sociology its kind of endless for her school she already has one masters but she never gave me a lick of trouble she took an ice cube in her mouth sloshed it crushed it lara was the wild one its only now im able to get in touch with how pissedoff i am at her for marrying barnett for that for everything for killing herself her hand began to shake and she placed her rattling glass on an end table my therapist told me suicides the ultimate aggressive act lara didnt need to do that she really didnt she could have talked to someone i told her to talk to someone get some therapy said milo im a big fan of therapy she picked up the glass therapy and tanqueray and tonic and prozac i said so lara was the rebellious one even when she was little youd tell her black shed say white in high school she got in with a bad crowd thats what messed up her grades of the three she was the smartest all she had to do was a little work instead she marries him vegas for gods sake it was like a bad movie he was have you ever seen his teeth during the few seconds malley had faced us he had never opened his mouth milo said not in good shape trailer trash teeth said nina balquin you can imagine what ralph thought of that illustrating the contrast she flashed a full set of porcelain jackets he was lowlife didnt have a family no family at all every time i asked him about where he grew up who his parents were he changed the subject i mean here was this new person in our lives doesnt it seem reasonable to ask forget it strong and silent except he wasnt strong enough to make a decent living she drained her glass steadied one hand with the other were an educated sophisticated family i have a degree in design and my husband was one of the best endodontists in the valley so who walks in the beverly hillbilly lara met him at a dude ranch said milo laras earthshattering summer job balquin grimaced here she never made up her bed but there she could clean rooms for minimum wage she claimed she wanted to earn her own money so she could buy a more expensive car than ralph wanted to get for her claimed she quit after two weeks to run off to vegas with him never got any kind of car until we bought her a used taurus she was just rebelling by going to ojai like every other time you said barnett was working some kind of traveling rodeo for all i know he put stars in my daughters eyes with rope tricks im allergic to horses out of the blue shes married informing me she wants lots of babies not just babies lots of babies i said whos going to pay for all those babies and she had a ready answer cowboy buckaroo was putting away his chaps and spurs whatever and getting himself a real job balquin snorted like i was supposed to stand and applaud what was this great career working for a poolcleaning service i said they were married a while before they had kristal seven years said balquin which was fine with me i figured maybe lara was finally thinking straight doing some financial planning she got herself a job not a great one supermarket cashier at vons and cowboy bought himself some chlorine and went out on his own you see them much hardly at all then one day lara dropped in nervous sheepish i knew she wanted something what she wanted was money for fertility treatment turns out theyd been trying for years she said shed gotten pregnant a few times but miscarried then nothing her doctor was thinking some sort of incompatibility i knew for her to show up shed have to want something i said why was there so little contact because thats what they wanted we invited them to every family affair but they never showed up at the time i assumed that was his doing but now im not sure because my therapist says i need to confront the possibility of laras complicity in a destructive dyad as part of the process the process said milo the healing process said balquin getting my act together i have a chemical imbalance that affects my moods but i also need to take personal responsibility for how i react to stressful situations my new therapist gets what loss is all about and she brought me to the point where i can take the gloves off when it comes to lara thats why your call was so perfect after you called i told my therapist wed be talking she thought it was karma milo nodded crossed his legs did you give lara the money for treatment the two of them had no health insurance im not sure if fertilitys even covered by insurance i felt sorry for her knew it was tough for her to come with her hand out i told her id ask her father and she thanked me actually hugged me balquins eyes fluttered she got up and refilled her glass i can get you guys something soft were really okay maam so your husband agreed to pay for the fertility treatments ten thousand dollars worth first he said no way then of course he gave in ralph was a big softie lara cashed the check and that was the last i heard about it then back to the same old routine not returning my calls my therapist says i have to confront the possibility that she used me what do you mean its possible they never paid the doctor why would you suspect that maam balquins hand whitened around her glass i carried lara for nine months and sometimes i miss her so much i cant stand to think about it but i need to be objective for my own mental health i always suspected those two spent the money on something else because soon after we gave it to them they moved to a bigger place and there was still no baby lara said barnett needed space for his piano i thought what a waste all he played was countrywestern songs and not very well kristal didnt arrive until years later when lara was twentysix that must have been something i said kristal she blinked some more a cutie a beauty from the little i saw of her here i was a grandma and i never got to see my grandchild lara had choices but i know he had a role in it he isolated her why i dont know she said that man never once uttered a pleasant boohoo to any of us despite our feelings about the marriage we tried to be nice when they got back from vegas we threw them a little party over at the sportsmans lodge the invitation said business attire he came in dirty jeans and one of those cowboy shirts with the snaps on it his hair was all long and unkempt my ralph was a real dapper guy you can imagine lara used to love dressing up but not anymore she wore jeans just as filthy as his and a cheaplooking little halter tank top she shook her head it was embarrassing but that was lara always keeping things lively maam said milo would it be too painful to talk about the suicide nina balquins eyes floated upward if i said yes would you drop it of course well it is painful but i dont want you to drop it because it wasnt my fault no matter what anyone says lara made choices her whole life then she ended her life with a horrible stupid rotten choice who says its your fault i said no one she said and everyone implicitly lose a child to an accident or an illness everyone feels sorry for you lose a child to suicide and people look at you as if you were the most horrible parent in the world how did barnett react to the suicide i wouldnt know we never spoke about it her eyes clenched and opened he had lara cremated never had the decency to have a service no funeral no memorial he cheated me the bastard cant you tell me what hes suspected of is it something to do with drugs milo said barnett used drugs both of them smoked pot maybe thats why lara couldnt get pregnant isnt that supposed to do something to your ovaries or whatever how do you know about their drug usage i know the signs detective lara was a pothead when she was in high school i never saw any evidence shed stopped the bad crowd she fell in with i said bunch of spoiled kids she said driving around in their parents bmws booming that music and pretending they were ghetto neither of my other two went for that nonsense you figure lara continued using after she was married i know she did the few times i visited their apartment the few times they let me in everything was a mess and you could smell it in the air milo said did they ever use anything stronger than marijuana wouldnt surprise me balquin eyed him so this is about drugs is barnett pushing have you known him to sell drugs no but im being logical dont users become pushers to pay for their habit and all those guns he keeps lara wasnt raised with that we never had so much as a bb gun in our home all of a sudden theyve got rifles pistols horrible stuff he kept them out in the open in a wooden case the way sophisticated people display books if youre not doing something shady why do you need all those guns ever ask him i mentioned it to lara she told me to mind my own business i looked for bookshelves in her front room nothing but pickled oak paneling and the photos on the back wall she said lara used one of his guns to shoot herself i hope hes happy her hands tightened into fists if he is a pusher i hope you catch him and put him away forever because the last thing my daughter needed was another bad influence she scraped an incisor with a fingernail raised her glass to her lips and drank slowly but steadily finished off the refill without taking a breath milo said is there anything else youd like to tell us maam i shouldnt say this but oh what the hell shes gone and so is kristal and i need to concentrate on rebuilding my own life she tightened her face again held the tension so long that even the refashioned muscles of her cheeks and chin gave way i always wondered if drugs had something to do with lara losing sight of kristal she insisted it was only for a second the store was crowded and she turned her head and she was gone but doesnt dope slow your reflexes milo uncrossed his legs he took his pad out but didnt write nina balquin said its a terrible thing to say about your own child but how else can you explain it i raised three kids and as a toddler mark was a hellion all over the place you couldnt get him to sit still but i never lost him how do you just lose a child her voice had risen to a near scream she plopped back heavily massaged her left temple damn cluster headache the last thing id want to do is blame my daughter but objectively maybe thats why lara felt guilty enough to do what she oh spit it out nina maybe thats why she killed herself both her hands began shaking violently she sat on them shut her eyes a highpitched keen made its way from behind closed lips milo said we know this is hard maam we appreciate your being so frank nina balquin opened her eyes her expression was vacant insight she said can be a bitch as milo thanked her i walked to the back of the room and looked at the photos a couple in their thirties with two kids under ten the accountant son and his family a woman who resembled lara malley wearing a cap and gown heavier face than laras red hair curling from under the mortarboard sister sandy no image of lara but below her sibs hung a cheaply framed threebyfive snapshot of kristal infant photo less than a year old from the way she needed support to sit up wearing a pink cowgirl dress and matching hat bucking broncos and cacti in the background a tiny moon above the plains airbrushed slick probably one of those kiddiephoto outlets the kind you find in every mall smiling baby girl chubby rosycheeked big brown eyes engaged the camera moisture on her chin teething drool nina balquin said i got that when i dropped in on them and brought kristal a christmas present they had a stack i had to ask for that one we left her standing in her doorway new drink in her hand milo drove away muttering sometimes my crazy family doesnt seem so bad i said mom hates barnetts guts but she never considered that he mightve murdered lara he said that womans so fragile i kept waiting to pick up shards wonder how shell cope if we find out barnetts a much badder guy than she imagined he chose surface streets over the freeway took van nuys boulevard north and connected to beverly glen as we curved through the canyon he said just like malleys neighborhood huh except for gazilliondollar houses tennis courts foreign cars a lot more greenery and no trailer parks perfect match i said anything balquin say illuminate malley psychologically if shes credible he isolated lara from her family was closemouthed about his origins used dope we know the part about gunhoarding is true toss in the way he reacted to us and theres potential for ugly dont guys who isolate their wives also abuse them its a risk factor i said if malleys basic approach to life was us against the world kristals murder wouldve buttressed that the worlds a rotten dangerous place so stay armed and vigilant and strike back what interests me is ninas suspicion that lara was negligent due to drugs thats a tough place to get to when its your own kid no matter how much therapy you have theres barnetts reason for blaming lara even though hes also a doper lara was the mom i said mothers always get blamed after troy and rand were sent away lara and barnett started examining their own lives heres a couple who had trouble conceiving finally they produce a child only to have her ripped away in the worst manner possible talk about stress on a relationship maybe tension escalated to unbearable the wrong things got said a history of isolation and drugs and abuse wouldve added more heat maybe lara stopped putting up with the abuse got too assertive with the cowboy he aimed a finger gun at the windshield kapow kapow indeed chapter for most of the ride back to the city milo waded through lapd bureaucracy in order to get hold of the complete file on lara malleys suicide i let my mind run ended up in some interesting places he pulled up in front of my house thanks onward somewhere are you in the mood for more speculation what nina balquist suspects malley was involved in the dope trade if thats true hed be likely to know unpleasant people the kind whod be able to get something done behind bars he twisted and faced me the hit on troy turner whered that come from free association turner was written up as a gang thing he assaulted a vato loco and maybe it even happened that way i said why wouldnt it be righteous alex why would a thirteenyearold kid hang in a supply closet for an hour bleeding before anyone noticed because cyas a mess okay i said he shoved the seat back violently and stretched his legs malley puts a hit on turner a month into turners sentence but waits eight years to take care of rand that is problematic i said sure is i can offer an explanation but it would be broad conjecture as opposed to wild speculation malley craved immediate vengeance for his daughters death he saw troy turner as the primary killer so troy paid quickly after that satisfaction malleys rage subsided its possible he hadnt even decided that rand deserved the ultimate penalty but the two of them got together and something went wrong malley does own wife quickly but cuts rand eight years of slack if he blamed lara for kristals death that was a whole different level of rage you only kill the one you love i dont know alex its a big jump laras own mothers still angry at her there was a picture of kristal in her house but none of lara put yourself in barnetts place all those years of infertility and she blows it big time i guess he said thered also be a practical reason not to hit rand immediately after troy both boys dying so close together would set off suspicions about revenge lara was different there was no reason to assume her death was anything other than suicide sue didnt suspect and she was a smart cop maybe if malley did kill lara and managed to fool the coroner and the cops that implies cunning and planning which is consistent with an ability to delay gratification so is malleys lifestyle ascetic perhaps he mulled rands fate for years decided to check out the quality of rands atonement you flunk you die he said thirtyeight revolver cowboy gun still eight years is a helluva long time to wait maybe the eight years were broken up by periodic contact an extended testing period for rand malley visited rand in prison spent face time with the punk who killed his kid face time or letters or phone calls i said youve seen it victims and offenders making contact after the disposition the initiative couldve come from rand he wanted to unload his guilt and made the first move you see malley responding to that were not talking mr touchyfeely eight years changes people and just because he hoards guns doesnt mean hes not hurting that sounds like a defense brief the police band burped his hand shot out and switched it off guess id be a putz not to check out rands visitors list which given the fact that cyas a big mess isnt gonna be simple as long as im churning paper ill also try to learn what i can about turners death and lets not forget the joy of excavating barnett malleys personal history always happy to brighten your day hey he said its more than i had before you started free associating five messages on my machine four junkers and allison sounding cheerful im free seven am flight tomorrow on jetblue i should arrive in long beach by tenthirty i reached her cell got the good news dropped a whole lot of guilt on cousin wesley she said my phd put to practical use he gets in from boston tonight im packed and ready to go how did grandma take it there were a few genteel sniffs but shes saying the right things seven am flight in new york means a drive in the dark from connecticut got a car picking me up at threethirty she said does that tell you how motivated i am the day after i arrive ive got patients but if you have time tomorrow we could have some fun fun is good i said ill pick you up i booked a car in long beach too unbook it ooh she said tough guy at nine pm my service called id downed a sandwich and a beer was ready to kick back with some journals its a clarice daney doctor said the operator cherish daney pardon i know a cherish daney oh could be this is lorettas handwriting yeah that could be it doctor you want me to hold her number or give it to you she said it was no emergency ill take it she clicked me in oh said cherish daney sorry i was just going to leave a message they didnt need to interrupt your evening no problem whats up i was actually trying to reach lieutenant sturgis but they told me hes out of town so i thought of calling you i hope thats okay out of town its fine whats on your mind ms daney after you left i realized i didnt get a chance to talk much about rand my husband spoke to you but theres something i thought i should add please okay she said this is probably nothing but i thought you should know that rand was really upset the entire weekend more than upset highly agitated your husband said he was afraid did drew say why i remembered daneys protectiveness decided she was an adult and that i cared more about her reaction he said rand thought someone had prowled near his window at night in the morning rand spotted a dark truck driving away from your house and for some reason that worried him the dark truck she said drew told me all that but im referring to something different something heavy on rands mind right before he was released it actually started a few weeks before i wanted to open rand up but felt i should take it slow because of all hed been through open him up i said im not a psychologist but i do have a certificate in spiritual counseling the nonverbal signs were all there doctor lack of concentration drop in appetite insomnia general restlessness i put it down to prerelease jitters but now i wonder and it began well before we got rand home so i dont think it had anything to do with being stalked by a truck can you tell me more about it i said as i said hed been jumpy for a while but when we picked him up in camarillo he looked awful pale shaky really not himself during the drive home we stopped off to get some gas and my husband went to the mens room and rand and i had a few minutes alone by that time he was barely able to sit still i asked him what the matter was but he didnt answer i decided to be a little persistent and finally he said there was something he wanted to talk about i asked what and he hemmed and hawed and finally he said it was about what had happened to kristal then he started to cry which made him real embarrassed he started gulping back his tears and forcing himself to smile before i had a chance to probe drew was back with the drinks and the snacks and i could tell rand didnt want me to say anything i planned to follow up over the weekend but somehow the timing was never right i so wish i had doctor something about what happened to kristal i said any idea what my assumption was he needed to unload because hed never really dealt with what had happened during our visits he had expressed some remorse but maybe now that he could see freedom on the horizon he was getting to a place where he could take a higher level of responsibility such as integrating his atonements into his consciousness perhaps by making proactive gestures im not sure i follow i know she said this must sound like gobbledygook to you and im not sure i understand it myself i guess i cant help but think there was something rand wanted to say that he hadnt said before whatever it was im kicking myself for not prying it out of him sounds like you did more for him than anyone else did thats kind doctor but the truth is with all the other fosters there are so many demands on my attention i should have reacted more affirmatively are you saying rands guilt had something to do with his murder i dont know what im saying to be honest im feeling pretty foolish right now for bothering you no bother i said what had rand told you before at first he claimed he didnt remember a thing maybe that was even true you know repression even if it wasnt the psychodynamic would be the same right doctor the enormity of his transgression was just too much for his soul to bear so he closed up and marshaled his defenses am i making sense sure i said i mean it was all that boy could do just to get through each day they claim its a juvenile facility but its not that at all there were old scars on rands body i said oh i know her voice broke i heard about each assault but was never allowed to visit him when he was in the infirmary when we got home he changed into fresh clothes and i took the old ones to wash when he slipped off his tshirt i had a quick look at his back i shouldnt have been shocked but it was hideous tell me about the assaults the worst was when he was jumped by some gang members and stabbed several times for no reason at all rand wasnt a fighter just the opposite but did that stop them how seriously was he hurt he ended up in the infirmary for over a month another time he was surprised from behind and hit on the head while taking a shower im sure there were other incidents he didnt talk about he was a big strong boy so he recovered physically after the stabbing i complained to the warden but i might as well have spit into the wind the guards beat the inmates too do you know what they call themselves counselors theyre hardly that those types of experiences could make someone jumpy i said of course they could she said but rand had adjusted it wasnt until his release approached that the symptoms began he was an amazing person doctor i dont know if i couldve coped with eight years of that place and not gone crazy if only i couldve guided him better one thing about working with people you constantly get reminded that only god is perfect did you visit troy as well twice there wasnt much time was there did troy ever express any guilt silence troy never got the chance to grow spiritually doctor that child didnt have a chance in the world anyway thats what i wanted to tell you whether its relevant i dont know ill pass it along to detective sturgis thanks one more thing dr delaware whats that your report on the boys i never got a chance to tell you at the time but i thought you did a very fine job rick silverman answered at milos house im out the door alex big guy flew to sacramento a couple of hours ago wheres hes staying somewhere in stockton near some youth prison got to run car crash multiple traumas im offcall but the hospital needs extra docs go nice talking to you he said if you speak to him before i do tell him ill handle maui vacation plans allegedly chapter fun a womans body curled next to yours inhaling her skin her hair cupping your hand over the swell of hip tracing the xylophone of ribs the knob of shoulder i propped myself up and watched allison sleep absorbed the rhythm of her breathing and followed the slow fade of the flush that had spread across her chest i got out of bed slipped on shorts and a tshirt and made my escape by the time she wandered into the kitchen wearing my ratty yellow robe id made coffee and checked my service for messages and thought a lot about cherish daneys call rand wanting to talk about kristal same thing hed told me no that wasnt quite right he had mumbled and id raised the topic and hed agreed opening him up allison mumbled something that mightve been hi her gait was unsteady and her black hair was loose and unruly in that nice way really thick hair can pull off she blinked a few times struggled to keep her eyes open made it over to the sink ran the tap and wet her face cinching the robes belt tight she patted herself dry with a paper towel shook her head like a puppy gaping yawn her hand reached her mouth belatedly scuse me when i took her in my arms she fell against me so heavily i wondered if shed dropped back to sleep in heels shes no giant barefoot she barely reaches my shoulder i kissed the top of her head she patted my back a curiously platonic gesture i steered her to a chair filled a mug with coffee put some ginger cookies on a plate shed bought them weeks ago theyd never been opened i keep telling myself to learn some serious cooking skills but when im alone its whatevers easy to fix she stared at the cookies as if they were some exotic curiosity i placed one at her lips and she nibbled chewed with effort swallowed with a gulp i got some coffee in her and she smiled up at me woozily what time is it two pm oh whered you go just here couldnt sleep i had a catnap i passed out like a wino she said i dont even know what time zone im in her eyes swung to the mug more thanks please half an hour later she was showered madeup hair combed flat down her back wearing a white linen shirt black slacks demiboots with heels too thin to support a chihuahua she hadnt eaten since tea with grandma the previous afternoon and wondered aloud about protein the choice was mutual and easy a steak house in santa monica that we frequented when we needed quiet dryaged beef good bar also the place wed first met the air outside was a brutal seventyfive and we took her black jaguar xjs because its a convertible i drove and she kept her eyes closed during the trip rested a hand on my thigh glorious day i wondered about the weather in stockton id been there once years ago on a courtordered evaluation its a nice aggie town east of sacramento in the heart of the san joaquin valley with a river port that far inland all those flat fields it had to be hotter by now milo would be sweating probably cursing thinking about maui the case that had drawn me to stockton was for family court a recently divorced croatian taxi driver had absconded with his three children only to be picked up three months later outside delano trying to rob a convenience store while using the kids as lookouts sentenced to ten years he settled himself in jail and demanded joint custody and regular prison visits the fact that the mother was a meth addict who started riding with outlaw bikers gave his claim enough substance to nudge the legal machinery id done my best to protect the kids a stupid judge had wreaked havoc with that allisons hand left my knee and pressed against my cheek whatre you thinking about robin had always hated hearing about the ugly stuff allison loves it she carries a little gun in her purse but my impulse is always to shield her alex yes it wasnt a trick question dear we were a block from the restaurant i started talking brief interruption as we ordered a tbone for two and a bottle of french red she said it sounds as if mr and mrs daney dont communicate that great why do you say that mister keeps a secret from missus and tells you about rands fear of being stalked the dark truck all of which seems well founded rand was murdered but missus minimizes that and points you in another direction she really didnt point me anywhere i said mostly recited a bunch of psychobabble her guilt about not opening him up she actually used those words i nodded is she some kind of therapist shes got some sort of certificate in spiritual counseling in the future everyone will be doing therapy so therell be no time for anyone to get therapy maybe i should retrain in veterinary medicine youd consider that after meeting spike you love spike like a brother admit it do the names cain and abel ring a bell she laughed poured more wine grew thoughtful it sounds as if rand was this womans project and she figured she could heal him now that hes dead shes tormenting herself that he was harboring a deep dark secret that shouldve been brought to light which may be true he implied the same thing to you the big question is was his secret relevant to his murder doesnt sound as if ms daney has anything of substance to say about that shes basically preoccupied with her own guilt so whyd she try to reach milo to feel shes done her civic duty she played with my fingers on the other hand rand called you for a reason and a few hours later he was dead the food came allison said you have no idea what rand wanted to talk about he ended by saying he was a good person i figured he was after some kind of absolution makes sense were not that dissimilar from priests what puzzles me i said is why hed reached out to me my role in the case was pretty minimal maybe not to him alex or maybe he simply wanted to square things with everyone related to the case which would certainly include kristals father who happens to drive a black truck full circle to barnett i said what do you know about this guy laras mother is certain he and lara were dopers suspects barnett mightve sold dope she also says barnett isolated lara which got me thinking about abuse he lives out in the boonies stockpiles guns sounds like a charmer laras mom also wondered out loud if lara couldve been high when she lost kristal lost her she said that sounds like misplacing your keys we finished dessert and coffee took a long time metabolizing allison fought for the check finally won a flush sparked her cheeks its good to have you back i said even if you wont let me pay good to be back something bothers me alex i can see lara getting high being an issue for her husband but why would rand care or even know about that i had no answer for that she played with my sleeve am i being a bore sorry youve piqued my curiosity anything but go on this was supposedly a random crime right the boys never knew kristal before they abducted her they said they just happened to spot her wandering around by herself why it seems odd she said a little girl in a mall all those shoppers youd think she wouldnt get very far before someone intervened postchristmas sales i said everyone was out for a bargain maybe no one noticed because there wasnt an obvious struggle to a casual observer it couldve looked like a couple of teenagers babysitting a younger sib i suppose she said whats bothering you kristal was two right a month shy thats a peak period for separation anxiety why wouldnt there be a struggle some kids are more trusting than others i said and some neglected and abused kids show no stranger anxiety at all was there any indication of child abuse the autopsy didnt reveal any old breaks or scars and the body was wellnourished i suppose that if ninas claims about drugs and isolation are true there could have been some level of neglect how close did the malleys live to the mall about half a mile so lara probably shopped there often she did how far were they from the housing project around the same distance youre thinking the boys knew kristal even though they claimed they didnt they hung out at the arcade wouldve had opportunity to see her perhaps theyd noticed laras attention span lapsing before had even talked to kristal when she took her eyes off her that wouldve made it easier for them to take her premeditation i said the boys plotted the whole thing beforehand and they lied about that because it wouldve made them look worse you think that was what plagued rand or just the opposite alex rand told you he was a good person he was trying to minimize his guilt and what better way to do that than to pin the bulk of the blame on others troy for one but also lara because rand had seen her let kristal wander off before its certainly nothing lara would ever admit but it couldve plagued her contributed to her depression and her suicide all of which barrett had put behind him until rand brought it up talk about pushing buttons my digestion had come to a halt and steak sat in my gut rand wasnt bright i suppose he couldve read the signals wrong been that clumsy you have a fertile mind im just thinking out loud sweetheart like you do what a fun couple we are i said we really are alex anyone can talk about stupid stuff chapter unseasonably warm said milo unlike the reception i got at chaderjian his broad back rounded as he stuck his head inside the fridge hed been back from stockton for an hour had driven straight to my house announced that the airlines were out to starve him a loaf of bread and a jar of peanut butter were already out on the counter hed drunk half a carton of milk without bothering to use a glass youre running low on provisions he said voice muffled by enamel the lack of jelly jam preserves or reasonable facsimile is inexcusable want some potato chips and a cupcake in your school lunch junior hnh he foraged straightened massaged his sacroiliac with one palm this will have to do his big hand concealed whatever he carried to the counter he set it down next to the bread carton of peach yogurt something else allison had brought over had to be weeks ago it could be bad i said so am i flipping the lid he sniffed frowned spooned gobs of glossy beige stuff into the sink flushed with a spurt of tap water that spotted his tie another sniff jam at the bottoms still good a spoonful of orange goop landed on a slice of bread peanut butter got slathered on another slice and he slapped the two halves together folding the sandwich double he ate standing up bon appétit no french dont have the patience today mon ami no cooperation from cya i asked youd think he said that wardens and all those other prison types would be simpatico with cops seeing as were both committed to the public safety he wiped his lips but youd be wrong our jobs putting bad guys away theyre chronically overcrowded get buckets of shit tossed in their faces and all sorts of other indignities so their goal is moving miscreants out they made me feel like a germ alex no counseling i said what thats what they call cya guards counselors he laughed there was a squirrelly feel to the place alex lots of silence no mistaking the tension later reading the local paper i found out theres all sorts of rumbling about an investigation of the whole cya system by the legislature too many dead wards top of that their recordkeepings even worse than the departments but all was not lost got any more yogurt mi fridge es su fridge now its spanish go get a gig at the un talk about miscreants he created a second concoction using honey as the sugar source consumed it at a more measured pace four gulps sitting down say what you want but sometimes gluttony pays off he said i hadnt had a thing to eat since the night before the dive i was staying at didnt have room service and by the time i got outside i was feeling pretty mean first place i spotted was a bar and grill two blocks from the prison bartender got the kitchen to microwave a plate of spareribs and we started talking turns out he used to work as a prison cook left seven years ago a year after troys murder ten months to be exact he remembered troys murder clearly was there when they took the body out couple of counselors carried it right through the kitchen out to a loading dock didnt even bother to wrap it just put the kid on a board and used belts to keep him from sliding off into the soup bartender said turner didnt look much bigger than a plucked turkey was about the same color he strode to the fridge pulled out a beer popped the top sat back down i said bartender had a good eye for detail it helped that there was no love lost between him and the prison he claims they fired him for no good cause his other clear memory is that there was a prime suspect for the murder not a vato loco an independent freelance knifeboy named nestor almedeira the vls and the other gangs used him and guys like him when they wanted to keep a low profile and guess what said prince got out a few months ago and his last known address is right here in la the westlake district almedeira ever work for nongang clients as in barnett malley who knows as far as i can tell malley never visited ditto for rand all troy got was three personals one from his mother and two from drew and cherish daney no phone logs were kept what put nestor almedeira in chaderjian i said he knifed two other kids to death in macarthur park when he was fifteen served six years for manslaughter and got out two dead kids is manslaughter it is when theyre packing blades themselves and their sheets are as bad as the guy who did them nestors pd claimed selfdefense and got it pled down and nestor promptly went freelance in prison i said so what else is new bartender said nestor was a very bad boy short fuse everyone thought he was nuts i guess that squares with the way troy got done nestor have a drug connection heroin if malley was selling they couldve known each other he ambled back to the fridge retrieved the milk carton finished it i said heading over to westlake soon i was thinking now nestor got himself a job at a food stand on alvarado aint that a pretty thought bloody hands stuffing your chimichangas an labound tourist plugging westlake into one of those computermap services could get confused theres westlake village on the far western edge of the valley a wideopen bedroom community of meticulous industrial parks highend shopping centers tileroofed vanilla houses perched prettily on oakstudded hills and multiacre horse ranches people with money and scant interest in urban pleasures move to westlake village to get away from crime and congestion and smog and people not like them all of which abounds in the westlake district set just west of downtown and named after the manmade water feature created from the swamp that was once macarthur park westlake has the population density of a thirdworld capital alvarados the main drag and its crammed with bars dance halls checkcashing outlets discount stores and fastfood joints a few of the oncegrand apartment buildings erected in the twenties remain sprinkled among the hideous postwar instaboxes that pushed out history and architecture and destroyed westlakes identity as a highrent destination some of the structures had been sectioned and resectioned into dormstyle rooming houses official residency statistics didnt begin to explain things for a couple of decades after its birth the park was a pretty place to go on sunday then it became as safe as afghanistan overrun with dopers and dealers strongarm specialists and pedophiles and wildeyed people who talked to god wilshire boulevard bisects the green space and a tunnel connects the halves walking through the gray graffitied conduit used to be lifethreatening now murals have covered the gang braggadocio and the mostly poor hispanics who populate the district picnic near the waters edge after church on sunday and hope for the best milo had taken sixth street from its inception at san vicente he made a left and traveled south onto alvarado the thoroughfare was crowded as it always is intersections teeming with pedestrians some purposeful some aimless better to be outdoors sucking in grimy air than sitting alone in the single fetid room you share with eight strangers the unmarked crawled along with the traffic spanish on the signs cutrate merchandise hawked on the sidewalk plastic bags of fruit and bunches of carnations dyed in unnatural tones were displayed by small cinnamonskinned men whod bargained with death to get over the border behind us was the park milo said is it melting in the rain not much rain in awhile i said melting in the smog then well look at that he cocked his head toward the passenger window i turned and saw nothing out of the ordinary what a heroin deal just went down in front of that photography studio lowlifes not even bothering to hide it okay here we are he pulled up in the red zone a line of people curled at the takeout window of taqueria grande the building was blue stucco chipped white at the corners an expansion wouldve made it the size of a singlecar garage milo said id like to see taqueria pequeña adjusted his harness holster slipped on his jacket and got out we waited in line the smell of pork and corn and onions blew through the window and out to the curb the prices were good the portions benevolent customers paid with soiled dollar bills and coinage and counted their change carefully two people worked the stand a young man at the deep fryers and a short round middleaged woman handling the public the fry cook was twenty or so thin and sharpchinned he wore a blue bandanna on his head what was visible of his hair was clipped to the skin and tattoos explored his arms all around him grease arced and spattered no screen guards and i could see airborne specks land on his arms and face it had to hurt he worked steadily remained expressionless the customer in front of us collected his tamales and rice and agua de tamarindo and we stepped up the round woman had her hair pinned up the makeup shed put on that morning was doing battle with sweat her pencil poised without looking up que milo said maam and showed her his id her smile was slow to settle in yes sir im looking for nestor almedeira the smile closed up instantaneously like a sea anemone reacting to being prodded she shook her head milo eyed the man in the bandanna thats not him the woman shifted to one side and peered around milos bulk several customers had queued up behind us but now they were drifting away carlos could we see carloss id please he got no drivers license ill see whatever he has maam she pivoted and shouted something in spanish bandanna tensed up drew his hand away from the fryer and eyed the back door milo said tell him if hes not nestor therell be no problem of any sort the woman shouted louder and the young man froze she covered the four feet between them with three choppy steps talked and gesticulated and held out her hand the young man drew a yellow scrap of paper out of his pocket the woman took it and handed it to milo western union receipt verifying that carlos miguel bermudez had wired ninetyfive dollars and fiftythree cents to a moneytransfer office in mascota mexico the date of the transaction was yesterday milo said thats all hes got he not nestor said the woman nestor got fired no no the womans eyes got heavy around the lids nestor got dead when said milo few weeks ago said the woman i think you think nestor dint show up much when he was alive howd you find out hes dead he sister tell me i give him the job because i like her nice girl howd nestor die she dont say how long did nestor work here officially she frowned maybe a month bad attendance huh bad attitude another glance behind us no customers you no want to eat milo returned the yellow scrap to her and she slipped it into her apron carlos the cook was still standing around looking nervous no thanks said milo he smiled past her carlos bit his lip whats nestors sisters name maam anita where does she live she work at the dentista up three blocks know the dentists name chinese she said black building you wanna drink milo ordered a lemon soda and when she tried to comp him he left a five on the counter and made her smile by the time we got back in the unmarked the lunch line had resumed chapter drs chang kim mendoza and quinones practiced in a onestory building veneered with shiny black ceramic tile white graffiti stuck to the bottom of the facade like foodfight pasta the sign above the door said easy credit painless dentistry medical accepted inside was a waiting room full of suffering people milo marched past them and tapped the reception window when it opened he asked for anita almedeira the asian receptionist lowered her glasses the only anita we have is anita moss then id like to speak with her shes busy but ill go see the waiting room smelled of wintergreen and stale laundry and rug cleaner the magazines in the wall rack were in spanish and korean a pale woman in her late twenties came to the reception desk she had long straight black hair a round face and smooth sedate features her pink nylon uniform skirt showed off a full firm figure her nametag said a moss registered dental hygienist lovely white teeth when she smiled the job had its perks im anita may i help you milo flashed the badge are you nestor almedeiras sister maam anita mosss mouth closed when she spoke next it was at a near whisper youve found them who maam the people who killed nestor milo said sorry no this is about something else anita mosss face tightened about something nestor did its possible maam she looked out at the waiting room im kind of busy this wont take long ms moss she opened the door and walked through approached an old man in work clothes with a collapsed jawline and an eye on the racing form mr ramirez ill be with you in one minute okay the man nodded and returned to the odds lets go said anita moss sweeping across the room by the time milo and i reached the exit she was out of the building she tapped her foot on the sidewalk and fooled with her hair milo offered to seat her in the unmarked thats all i need she said someone seeing me in a police car and here i thought we were camouflaged said milo anita moss started to smile changed her mind lets go around the corner you drive a bit and ill catch up with you and sit in the car the unmarked had taken on heat and milo rolled down the windows we were parked on a side street of cheap apartments anita moss sitting stiffly in the back a few women with children strolled by a couple of stray dogs wove from scent to scent milo said i know this is hard maam dont worry about me said moss ask what you need to when was your brother murdered four weeks ago i got a call from a detective and thats all ive heard about it i thought you were following up where did it happen lafayette park late at night the detective said nestor was buying heroin and someone shot him and took his money do you remember the name of the detective who called you krug she said detective krug he never gave me his first name i got the feeling he wasnt going to put too much time into it whys that just the way he sounded i figured it was because of the type of person nestor was she straightened her back stared at the rearview mirror nestor was an addict said milo since he was thirteen said moss not always heroin but always some kind of habit what else besides heroin when he was little he huffed paint and glue then marijuana pills pcp you name it hes the baby in the family and im the oldest we werent close i grew up here but i dont live here anymore in westlake she nodded i went to cal state la and met my husband hes a fourthyear dental student at the u we live in westwood dr parks one of jims professors im supporting us until jim gets out nestor got out of the youth authority three months ago said milo where did he live first with my mother and then i dont know said anita moss like i said we werent close not just nestor and me nestor and the whole family my other two brothers are good guys no one understood why nestor did the things he did difficult kid i said from day one didnt sleep never sat still always destroying things mean to our dog she wiped her eyes i shouldnt be talking about him like this he was my brother but he tortured my mother not literally but he made her life miserable two months ago she had a stroke and shes still pretty sick sorry to hear about that she frowned i cant help thinking nestor living with her contributed to it she had a history of high blood pressure we were all telling nestor to go easy on her dont stress her out you couldnt tell him anything mom wasnt naive she knew what nestor was up to and it really upset her drugs and everything that goes with that lifestyle out all night sleeping all day one week hed be working at a car wash then hed get fired hed just disappear without a word then hed show up at moms with way too much money my mother was a religious person she had a real problem with money you couldnt explain she plucked at her badge one time he threatened my husband when did that happen i said maybe a week after he got out he showed up at our place late at night and demanded we let him crash there jim offered him money but wouldnt let him come in nestor got mad and grabbed jims shirt really got in jims face he told him hed be sorry then he spit on jim and left you call the police i wanted to but jim didnt he thought nestor would calm down jims a really even person nothing fazes him did nestor calm down he didnt bother us again and a week later he showed up at the office and begged me to forgive him he claimed he was clean this time he was going to go straight he needed a real job i know a woman who runs a food stand down the block and i asked her if shed give him a chance she agreed but he screwed that up how bad attitude poor attendance now i dont even go there for lunch being nestors sister was a challenge i said she exhaled and pulled at an eyelash why are you asking me all this now milo said do you have any idea where nestor was living right before he died and who he was hanging around with not a clue said moss soon after he got out he bought some nice clothes i figured hed sold some dope a few weeks later he was back living with mom and the fancy clothes were gone were looking into something nestor might have done when he was locked up maybe he talked about it silence maam oh said anita moss that she sat back against the seat cushion ran her hand over her eyes i tried to do something about it about what maam youre talking about the little white kid right the kid who killed that baby girl troy turner said milo anita mosss shoulders tightened a fisted right hand drummed the seat now youre here what do you mean maam right after nestor told me about it i tried to tell the authorities but no one listened which authorities first at chaderjian i phoned them and asked to speak to whoever was in charge of solving crimes that take place in the prison i spoke to some therapist counselor i dont know he listened to me and said hed get back but he never did so i called the cops ramparts station because nestor lived here they said it was chaderjians jurisdiction her eyes blazed milo said im sorry maam i called because nestor was scary he was living with mom i didnt want him doing anything crazy her eyes were wet it was hard to tell on him he was my brother but i had to think of mom no one cared then and now nestors dead and youre here seems like a waste of time what exactly did nestor tell you that he was a hit man at chaderjian that he got paid to hurt or kill people and that hed killed a bunch of kids in the prison when did he tell you this not long after he got out a couple of days after it was my brother antonios birthday and we were at my moms trying to have a family dinner my brothers and their families jim and me mom wasnt feeling well she really didnt look good but she made a beautiful dinner nestor showed up late with expensive tequila and a dozen cuban cigars he insisted all the guys go outside and smoke jim doesnt touch tobacco so he refused but my brothers went out on the balcony soon after my oldest brother willy came in and said nestor was running his mouth about all kinds of crazy things violent things and he didnt want mom to hear i should quiet nestor down she frowned you handled nestor better than anyone i said i was the only one willing to confront him and he never got hostile with me maybe because im a girl and i was nice to him even when he was a wild little kid so you went to talk to nestor he was smoking this gigantic cigar making all this stinky smoke i told him to blow it the other way then i said stop talking trash he said im not talking trash anita im talking real then he gave this bizarre smile and he said its kind of a christian thing i said what do you mean and he said hanging dudes up and letting them bleed is making em like jesus right thats what i did anita i didnt have no nails but i tied up a dude and cut him and made him bleed it made me sick i told him to shut up he was grossing me out and if he couldnt behave himself he should leave he kept going on about what hed done like it was really important for him to talk about it he stayed on the christ thing saying he was like judas got twenty pieces of silver to do the job then he said but he was no jesus he was the devil in a little white kids body so i did a good thing i said what are you talking about and he said the dude he hung up was some little white kid who killed another little white kid then he pulled something out of his pocket and showed it to me it was an id card from chaderjian just like nestors but with another kids picture on it troy turner that was the name on the badge i said you could get that anywhere nestor went nuts said i did it i did it hung the dude up and made him bleed look him up on your computer smart girl theres gotta be something there a tremor ran down the center of anita mosss throat hed made me sick to my stomach mom had cooked this beautiful dinner all her beautiful food and i felt like it was all coming up i yanked the cigar out of nestors mouth and ground it out with my foot then i told him to shut up i meant it and went back inside nestor left and didnt return which was fine with everyone that night trying to sleep i couldnt stop thinking about that kids picture on the badge he looked so young even with nestors always bragging and lying he freaked me out cause of the details what details said milo he insisted on telling me how he did it how hed followed that little boy for days hunted the dude like a rabbit he learned troy turners routine finally cornered him in a supply room off the gym her face crumpled talking about it now makes me sick nestor said he hit him in the face to subdue him then he she gulped again that night after jim fell asleep i got out of bed and went on the computer and plugged in troy turners name found a short article in the times and a longer one from a paper near chaderjian what they both said matched everything nestor told me maybe nestor didnt do it maybe he just heard about it and got that badge somehow i said knowing nestor you believe he couldve done it he was proud of it nestor said hed been paid to kill other boys said milo did he mention any other names she shook her head troy turner was the only one he wanted to talk about like that had been a real big accomplishment for him because troy was notorious i said she nodded he said that dude thought he was a stone killer but i killed his ass did he say how much hed been paid anita moss shook her head lowered her eyes i came to hate nestor but talking about him like this did nestor ever talk about who paid him maam she kept her head down spoke softly all he said was that it was a white guy and the reason was turner had killed a baby did he give you any details about this white guy said milo no just that i told the exact same thing to that counselor when he didnt call back i phoned the police no one cared her lips folded inward she shook her head back and forth that boy she said that picture he looked so young chapter milo and i sat in a rear booth of a coffee shop on vermont just north of wilshire drinking cokes waiting for ramparts detective philip krug krug had been in his car when we reached him and he welcomed the opportunity for lunchtime company the locale was his choice a big bright halfempty place with pucecolored vinyl booths cloudy windows and the outward profile of a toy rocket ship he was twenty minutes late and i used the time to raise the issues allison had brought up milo said the premeditation things interesting but i dont see where it takes us rand wanting to feel less guilty by blaming lara could be important if he tried it on malley what do you think about nestors bragging sounds authentic he knew all the details i said i was thinking about the white guy hiring him revenge hit it fits he looked at his timex i said troy bragged too when i interviewed him in jail said he had plans to be rich youre thinking he had hitman fantasies too i dont see him planning for the ivy league maybe he saw kristal as career practice goddamn little savages what do you do with them phil krug was a compact man in his forties with thin red hair and a copperwire mustache so thick it extended farther than his crushed nose he wore a gray suit with a navy shirt and a pale blue tie the waitress knew him and said the usual before he had a chance to sit down krug nodded at her and unbuttoned his suit jacket nice to meet you guys tell elise what youre having we ordered burgers the waitress said phil orders his with blue cheese krug said thats the usual milo said sure nonconformity seemed impolitic i said ditto in between bites of cheeseslathered ground chuck on an undistinguished bun krug discussed the little hed learned about nestor almedeiras murder unknown assailant no leads granules of heroin on the dirt near the body a single headshot close proximity throughandthrough temple wound coroners guess was a no bullet recovered and no casing so the killer had picked up or used a revolver i sideglanced at milo expressionless lafayette park he said krug wiped cheese from his mustache let me tell you about lafayette park coupla months ago i got called for jury duty civil case they hear them over at the courthouse on commonwealth which is right near the park i knew id be disqualified but i had to show up and wait and do all that good citizen stuff lunch break comes and the clerk reads off this prepared statement telling all the jurors where to eat then she goes into this speech about never going into lafayette park even during the day were talking a courthouse yards away swarming with law enforcement and theyre saying dont step foot inside that bad i said it sure was for our boy nestor said krug so whats the connection to west la milo told him about rand duchay and troy turners murders but left out lara malleys suicide and the similarities between the shootings i remember that one snatched little baby said krug depressing glad it wasnt mine so maybe nestor was the hit boy on turner huh he claimed he was to his sister she never mentioned that to me she told cya right after nestor bragged about it got no interest phoned ramparts same deal she probably talked to some clerk said krug we dont always get the sharpest knives in the drawer they do that the idiots brag how many you solve that way plenty right plenty said milo so what are you thinking someone went on a revenge kick and hit the other baby killer with all those years in between whats it been ten eight said milo long time said krug its a problem phil but therere no other leads ive been figuring nestor as your basic dope thing patrol officers idd him as a bottomfeeder with a bad disposition he was working lafayette and macarthur and the streets bottomfeeder user krug pantomimed a bellpull bingo his arms and legs were full of tracks and there was dope in his blood you know what its like when they get to that point theyre just selling to stay healthy milo nodded how much heroin was in him krug said dont remember the numbers but it was enough to get him high the way i figure being numbed out made him easier to kill they found a knife on him but it never got out of his pocket the killer feeds him then does him said milo or nestor fed himself and ran into bad luck if i was out to get a guy like nestor thats how id do it and a guy like nestor would have enemies bad disposition the worst said krug but we never picked up any specific street talk on who he pissed off where was he living said milo dump on shatto pay by the week you could go there but youd find nothing nestors total belongings fit into one box and there was nothing interesting maybe the coroner still has it but you know the storage problems at the crypt my guess is it got tossed nestors sister said he showed her turners id it wasnt in his stuff what was clothes needles spoons crappy clothing anyone at his crib have anything to say youre kidding right said krug were talking transients and a clerk who does the blinddumbdeaf bit krug took a bite of his burger excellent huh one thing the french are good for is cheese anyway whatever bragging nestor mightve done in the past his crowing days were over he reached in his pocket and brought out a postmortem shot of a hollowcheeked visage matted hair sallow complexion deathglazed eyes bottomed by gray pouches patchy facial hair came across as a gray skin rash like his sister nestor almedeira had a round face bad living had wiped out any other resemblance to her i motioned for the picture and took a closer look nestor had been the baby of the family but he looked ten years older than anita his head had been tilted by the morgue photographer to give a view of the entrance wound left temple blackandruby hole sharpened by stellate skin shredding and framed by a pointillist ring of powder milo said was he sitting when he was shot right on the park bench said krug your kiddie killer was sitting too maybe in a car anything happening on the case phil youre about it said krug finishing his burger and wiping his lips be sure to let me know if you learn anything be nice to close this one even if no one else gives a shit no family agitation said milo you met the sister she thinks nestor was scum family wasnt making any moves to claim the body coroner had to keep bugging them finally one of the brothers paid for the mortuary to pick it up krug waved and the waitress brought the check and placed it in the center of the table he took some time cleaning his mustache pulled a steel toothpick from his shirt pocket and worked it around his gum line so he smiled milo picked up the check krug said you made my day and sauntered out when the waitress came by for payment milo said well have coffee she glanced disapprovingly at the completed bill ill have to retotal milo handed her a wad of bills keep it she flipped through the money and winked on the house as she returned to the counter he said if malley was the white man who paid nestor to hit troy turner nestor was an obstacle that had to be cleared up on the other hand nestor had a big mouth and for all those years at cya he never gave malley up because he wanted to get out i said but once he was free and stoned his inhibitions dropped he bragged to anita so theres a good chance he talked to other people the problem is they were probably people who didnt care other junkies and losers he said to them hed be just another fool shooting off his mouth anita did care and tried to report it and everyone shined her on milo pulled on his upper lip another proud moment for the department nestors crime scene sounds a lot like rands and laras okay that makes malley suspectoftheweek theres another unnatural death we should think about jane hannabee was killed a few months after troy when i interviewed her she predicted troys death said his notoriety would make him a desirable target from what anita said thats exactly how nestor saw him you think hannabee figured out who paid to kill troy or she was eliminated out of revenge because she spawned troy i said you destroy my family i destroy you man thats cold so is shooting your own wife six months after shes lost her only child and faking it as suicide his forehead creased hannabee wasnt shot neither was troy i said because troy was behind bars and with all of cyas problems they keep firearms out shooting someone in a homeless encampment in the middle of the night would be possible but extremely reckless hannabees murder was so stealthy it wasnt discovered for hours she was pulled out of her sleeping bag cut slid back in rewrapped in plastic youre saying signature doesnt matter to malley hes not governed by a structured compulsion because his goal isnt sexual satisfaction his goal is housecleaning whatever gets the job done alex if malleys really done all these people hes still a serial killer guess rands grandmothers the lucky one dying of disease the coffee arrived the waitress set milos mug down with exquisite caution leaned over and flashed a triangle of freckled chest tight wrinkles tugged at her cleavage she lingered for a second before straightening anything else she said with a song in her voice nope were fine elise youre very kind she said so they tell me we headed back to west la taking sixth again milo slowed to glance at lafayette park trees lawns benches a few men sitting a couple of others walking the courthouse on commonwealth loomed whod have thought so much threat resided in empty green space he said anyone approaching the campgrounds where malley lives from either direction on soledad would be spotted easily theres nowhere to hide on the road so forget surveillance not that surveillance would tell me anything doesnt sound as if malleys gonna go pubcrawling and blab to lowlife friends he rubbed his face and made an abrupt lane shift that evoked frenzied honks yeah yeah he muttered the honkers toyota whipped in front of us on the rear bumper was a war is not the answer sticker milo growled it got rid of slavery in america and nazis in germany i said if malleys still active in the drug trade he might leave the campsite periodically unless i can watch him how the hell do i find that out maybe his boss is more aware of his comings and goings than she let on bunny the stuntwoman think theres more than a work relationship there i sensed something personal going on maybe she made a point about not keeping tabs on malley which was an answer to a question you didnt ask the lady protesting too much he said if she is barnetts loveinterest questioning her further is only going to alert him im gonna call the coroner about nestors belongings check out his dump on shatto despite what krug said anita was right about krug he doesnt give a shit i also know a ramparts uniform who might be able to turn me on to some street junkies maybe ill get lucky and find out nestor blabbed to someone else better check into jane hannabees death too bigtime fun huh can you handle more complication what doesnt kill me makes me stronger if malleys anger extends to everyone he perceives as having been on the boys side and killing rand rekindled his rage the daneys could be in jeopardy if malley was outside rands window that night he couldve been spying on them as well he thought about that yeah they should probably be warned but its tricky what if they go over to malleys place and try to talk things out being all spiritual and positive about basic human goodness and all that if were right about what happened to rand heartfelt discussion with cowboy barnett is not a prescription for longevity warn them not to have contact with him i said think i can compete with god good point i said cherish especially might try to talk things out she fancies herself a therapist god bless the godpushers you like feelgood religion alex inherent blessedness of the human spirit eternal forgiveness the certainty of an afterlife where all is bright and airy everyone needs comfort he laughed angrily give me that oldtime religion bro and i aint talking rousing hymns and babbling in tongues my childhood was nuns who smacked my hands raw and priests stoked by guilt and hellfire and blood sacrifice blood sacrifice sells movies i said sells entire civilizations optimisms for wimps hey its great if you can swallow it he said blind faith after dropping me back at my place milo leaned out the passenger window has my resolute negativity brought you down because theres something you can do for me while im up to my neck in nestorania sure how about you warn the daneys be psychologically sensitive and hold back if you sense theyre gonna do something stupid and as long as were putting out warnings what about the boys lawyers talk about getting on malleys wrong side remember their names sydney weider for troy lauritz montez for rand that just rolled off your tongue the case stayed with you until rand called i thought id forgotten about it so much for optimism pal anyway feel free to schmooze with them too i hate talking to lawyers chapter monday i called the daneys home no one answered so i turned to sydney weider and lauritz montez weider was no longer at the public defenders and i found no home or office listing for her lauritz montez was still a pd but hed moved uptown to the beverly hills office he answered his own extension just the way hed done years ago this time my name evoked silence when i asked him if hed heard about rand he said oh youre the psychologist no what about him he was murdered shit he said when nine days ago his voice went flat as lawyers wariness took over you didnt call just to inform me id like to talk to you could we meet what about it would be better in person i said i see when were you thinking sooners better than later okay what is it now fourthirty ive got paperwork but i need to eat know where the bagel bin is on little santa monica ill find it bet you will five sharp the place was new age deli glass cases of smoked fish and meat and all the right salads but the stainlesssteelvinyl ambience was autopsy room maybe that was honest lots of creatures had died to feed the earlydinner throng i arrived on time but lauritz montez was already at the counter ordering i hung back and let him finish his hair was now completely gray but remained long and ponytailed the same waxed mustache fanned across his bony face the chin fuzz was gone he wore a wrinkled cream linen suit a pink buttondown shirt and a bottlegreen bow tie twotone olive suede and brown leather wingtips graced narrow feet the left shoe tapped the floor rapidly he paid got an order slip turned nodded you look pretty much the same he said motioning me toward the single open table so do you thanks for lying we sat and he began arranging the salt and pepper shakers and the sugar bowl into a tight little triangle i did some checking and found out rands a west la homicide case but no one will tell me anything you must be wired right into the cops im consulting on the case whos the detective milo sturgis dont know him he studied me still a prosecution groupie huh how long was rand out of custody before he got killed three days jesus howd it happen he was shot in the head and dumped near the north in bel air sounds like an execution it does any physical evidence he said youd have to ask detective sturgis such discretion what do you want from me a kid in a paper hat and an apron brought his order sliced pumpernickel bagel baked salmon sides of coleslaw and baked beans styrofoam cup of tea i said there are no real suspects but there is a hypothesis and speaking of discretion yeah yeah sure so you work full time for the other side the other side the righteous bunch that sits on the other side of the courtroom are you a resident prosecution expert or just a freelance i do occasional consultations have freud will travel he lined up his utensils perfectly parallel to his plate removed a sugar packet from the bowl and squared a folded corner before slipping it back in whats the hypothesis i said theyre looking at kristal malleys father he said that guy always thought he hated my guts you really think hed be that nuts cant say isnt it your job to say when people are nuts dont know malley well enough to diagnose i said never met him during my evaluation and havent spoken to him since how about you he stroked his mustache only time i ever saw him in person was at the sentencing but you feel he hated your guts i dont feel i know that day in court i was up at the bench doing my thing returned to the defense table and caught him glaring at me i ignored it but kept getting that itchy feeling at the back of my neck i waited until the da starting blabbing before i turned around figuring malleys attention would be shifted his eyes were still on me let me tell you if they were guns i wouldnt be here he owns real guns i said so do i said lauritz he flicked his bow tie surprised should i be im a bleeding heart subversive his mustache lifting was the sole indication hed smiled but as long as the law says i can own bangbangs i will selfdefense my dad was military and the one thing we did together was blast away defenseless animals he massaged his left eyebrow i was actually good enough to qualify for my college team have you been threatened because of your work i said nothing explicit but its an edgy job so i stay on the edge he removed another packet smoothed its edges passed it from hand to hand law begets order he said and a shitload of disorder i stopped fooling myself a long time ago im part of the system so i triplelock my doors at night did malley ever do more than glare at you no but it was a heavyduty glare serious rage i didnt blame the guy his kid was dead the systems set up to be usthem and i was them he didnt scare me and im not scared now why should i be all this times passed and he never made a move on me do the cops seriously think he killed rand its just a i know hypothesis he wiped salt grains from the top of the shaker i suppose you know troy turner was murdered too i nodded think theres a connection he said troy was killed a month into his sentence i said and this is eight years later yeah if i was malley and wanted to do the revenge bit id have finished the job quickly its something i thought about when i heard about turners death i got concerned for rand called his warden and asked for a special watch the jerk said hed look into it definitely bullshitting me when you called were you thinking about barnett malley maybe he said but even in general terms i was thinking rand would make a good trophy for some testosteronelaced sociopath out to make his rep he looked down at his food but didnt touch it anyway i appreciate the warning but if i got freaked out about every victims family member going after me id be a basket case he held his hands out palms up steady see no anxiety just compulsively organized table items i said youre in beverly hills now must be a different level of offenders bh is more than just celebrity shoplifters we handle a lot of west hollywoods felony cases so no im not sleeping at the wheel didnt mean to imply you were he took a long time assembling a salmon and cream cheese sandwich picked out capers one by one and imbedded them around the outer edge of the bagels whitened bottom half inspecting his handiwork he closed the sandwich but didnt eat i said how much contact did you have with rand after he went away i called him a couple of times said montez then i moved on why he phoned me the day he died said he wanted to talk about kristal but wouldnt give details over the phone we made an appointment and i showed up but he didnt a few hours later he was found dead any idea what couldve been on his mind he played with the sandwich on his plate nudging it with his thumb until it sat dead center when he looked up his jaw was taut this isnt really about warning me is it its about pumping me for information its both i said right were not in an adversarial position mr montez im a lawyer he said in my world everythings adversarial fine but now were on the same side which is getting some justice for rand by locking his killer up wouldnt that be a good start i said in your world he said not in yours you want to know something he said if the cops do find whoever shot rand and the pds office gets the case id be happy to take it even if the shooter turns out to be barnett malley if malley accepted me id do my best to keep his ass out of prison pretty detached i said survival skills go beyond guns said montez when you represented rand did you sense he was holding back about anything he was holding back about everything wouldnt communicate with me basically he played mute no matter how many times i told him i was on his side it couldve been frustrating but the script had already been written i never got a chance to bring in my own shrink because of the plea deal sure i wouldve liked to know what was going on in that kids head which i didnt get from your report that was a masterpiece of omission all you said was that he was stupid he wasnt bright i said but there was plenty going on in his head i thought he felt remorse and i said so i doubt your expert wouldve come up with any profound abstractions just a dumb kid bad seed i said nothing yeah i sensed remorse too he said unlike his compadre now that one was a piece of work evil little bugger if rand hadnt gotten involved with him his life couldve turned out a whole lot different troy was the main killer i said but rand admitted hitting kristal rand was a dumb passive follower who hooked up with a cold little sociopath in a trial i wouldve emphasized the follower angle but like i said nothing wouldve mattered the script exactly who wrote it the system he said you dont murder a cute little white kid and walk away his hand brushed over his butter knife adjusted the angle of the handle weider claimed she wanted to mount a team defense i was so green i bought it that tells you something about the system doesnt it one year out of law school and rand got me as his oneman army he waved a finger justice for all whyd she change her mind because all she wanted to do was pump me for information once we got to court she was going to pull a switcheroo and dump all over my client her prelim motions emphasized rands size and strength she had all this expert research data showing low iq sociopaths were more likely to turn violent if it had gone to trial turner wouldve been morphed into some frail little dupe whod been physically intimidated by rand anyway we were spared all that the case went down easy not for the malleys i said he showed me his palm i cant think in those terms and if barnett malley doesnt understand that im ready for him nice seeing you again doctor i stood and asked if he knew where i could find sydney weider going to warn her too and pump her for info montez pulled out a pair of sunglasses held the lenses up and used them as mirrors one end of his bow tie had drooped lower than its counterpart he frowned and righted it you can probably find her he said on the tennis court or the golf course or sipping a cosmopolitan on the country club terrace which country club i was speaking metaphorically i have no idea if she belongs to any club but it wouldnt surprise me sydney was rich then so shes probably richer now rich girl playing at the law i said good insight you must be a psychologist the first time you met sydney shed be sure to let you know where she was coming from swinging the gucci purse letting drop all the relevant data in machinegun monologue like you were a student and she was teaching introductory sydney she talked about her money about her daddy the film honcho her husband the film honcho all the industry parties she was compelled to attend the sons at harvardwestlake the house in brentwood the weekend place in malibu the beemer and the porsche on alternate days he mimed a fingerdownthe throat gag when did she leave the pds office i said not long after the malley case closed as a matter of fact how soon after maybe a month i dont know think it had anything to do with the case maybe indirectly her name got into the paper and soon after she got a fat private practice offer from stavros menas mouthpiece of the high and mighty i said youve got that right what menas does is more pr than criminal defense which makes him the perfect la guy he alternates between a bentley and an aston martin does she still work for him shes got no office listing thats cause she never worked for him he said the way i heard it she changed her mind and retired to a life of leisure why he glanced down at his food couldnt tell you burnout sydney didnt feel deeply enough to burn out she probably just got bored with all her money there was no reason for her put up with all the shit when i first heard she quit i figured she was going to try to get a movie deal out of the case but it didnt happen you figured because her husbands a film exec because shes like that manipulative out for herself shed fly to aspen for the weekend on a private jet be at work monday in a chanel suit and try to sound convincing about fighting for justice for some dude from compton by lunchtime shed be dropping names about who sat next to her at the palm he laughed id like to think shes not real happy but she probably is did you hear any specific rumors about a movie deal i said i do know that she wrangled to get the case how by kissing up to the boss the way it works at the pd is whoevers top of the list gets the next client unless the boss handpicks someone for a specific case i know for a fact that sydney wasnt next up on troy turner because the guy who was told me hed been bumped he wasnt bitching he had no stomach for highprofile bullshit the way he phrased it was the bitch did me a favor was she qualified montez clicked his teeth together id like to say no but yeah she was smart enough by that time she had three four years under her belt and her winloss record was as good as anyones three or four years out of school i said i remember her as older she was older after she passed the bar she got married did the mommy bit waited until the kids were older he wiped his mouth and folded his napkin when you see her give my regards i will i was kidding i phoned milos desk from the car he was out and i asked for detective binchy sean said hey dr delaware could you get me an unlisted address i dont know doc its kind of against regulations milo asked me to talk to this person so in a sense im a police surrogate a surrogate okay i guess youre not going to shoot anyone are you not unless they piss me off silence he said ha okay hold on lauritz montezs rant about sydney weiders lifestyle had cited houses in brentwood and malibu but maybe that had been metaphorical too or shed defied his richgetricher expectations and downsized her listed residence was a smallish singlestory ranch house on la cumbre del mar on the western edge of pacific palisades sunny street cooled by pacific currents sevenfigure ocean view but by no means palatial splintering redwood siding striped the white stucco front halfdead sago palms and droopy ferns backed a flat lawn spiked with crabgrass a shaggy old blueleafed eucalyptus created gray litter on the grass the driveway was occupied by a dented gray nissan pathfinder filthy with gull shit as i walked to the door i could smell the pacific hear the slow breathing of rustling tide no one answered my knock or two bell pushes a young woman across the street opened her door and observed me when i faced her she went back inside i waited awhile longer took out a business card wrote a note on the back asking sydney weider to call me and dropped it in the mail slot as i returned to my car she came walking up the block she had on green sweats and white sneakers and dark glasses walked with a stiff gait that threw her hip out at an odd angle her hair was chopped short and shed let it go white she was still thin but her body looked soft and loosejointed and ungainly i stepped out to the breezeway in front of her house she saw me and stopped short i waved she didnt react i stepped toward her and smiled she thrust her arms in front of her torso in a sad useless defensive move like someone whod seen too many martial arts movies ms weider what do you want her lawyers voice was gone tightened by fearladen shrillness alex delaware i worked on the malley who are you i repeated my name she stepped closer her lips fluttered and her chin quaked go away could we just talk for a minute rand duchays been murdered im working with the police on the case and if you could spare a minute about what ratatat who mightve killed rand he was shot last how would i know she yelled ms weider i said i dont want to alarm you but it might involve your personal safety she clawed the air with one hand the other was balled tight flat against her flank what are you talking about what the hell are you talking about its possible go away go the fuck away shaking her head frantically as if ridding it of noise ms weider her mouth gaped no sound for a second then she was screaming a gull harmonized the same neighbor from across the street stepped out sydney weider screamed louder i left chapter the haunted look in sydney weiders eyes stayed with me during the drive back home i went to my office and played search engine poker thirty hits came up for sydney weider but only one was related to her work on people v turner and duchay a paragraph in the western legal journal dated a month prior to the final hearing speculating about the ramifications for juvenile justice weider had been quoted predicting thered be plenty of groundbreaking consequences no words of wisdom from lauritz montez either hed declined to comment or no one had asked his opinion the remaining citations preceded weiders assignment to the pd by years an obituary for weiders father listed him as gunnar weider a producer of lowbudget horror flicks and later episodic tv sydney was listed as his only survivor and as the wife of martin boestling a caa film agent the times used to run a social page before political correctness took over i logged onto the archives and found notice twentyeight years ago of the weiderboestling nuptials the beverly hills hotel sydney had been twentythree her groom two years older big wedding lots of faces in attendance i plugged in boestlings name a few years after marrying sydney he had left caa for icm then william morris after that he took a business affairs post at miramax where hed stayed until a year before the malley murder when he resigned to start mbp ltd his own production company according to the press release in variety the new firms emphasis would be on quality moderately budgeted feature films the only mbp credits i could find were three madefortv cheapies including a remake of a sitcom that had been stale in its first incarnation lauritz montez had talked about a script had there been a real one and had boestling gone out on his own to peddle it to my mind the malley case had nothing to offer cinematically no happy ending no redemption no character development but what did i know maybe it wouldve worked as a quickie cable stinker i searched some more as far as i could tell no one martin boestling included had done the project the other hits were mentions of sydney and martin at fundraisers for the predictable causes santa monica mountains conservation league save the bay the womens wellness place citizens initiative for gun control the greater la zoo association the single photo i found showed the couple at a womens wellness benefit weider looked the way i remembered her from eight years ago sleek blond haute coutured martin boestling was dark stocky pitched forward like an attack dog shed always been a fast talker but now her cool deliberative demeanor had given way to manic speech patterns and ragged fear from private jets and a porschebeemer combo to a birdsplotched nissan did only one car in the driveway mean boestling was away at work or was weider living alone i phoned binchy now he was out but milo was in i recounted the talk with montez the welcome id received from weider her house her car sounds like an unhappy woman he said jumpy woman and i made her jumpier scared the hell out of her maybe she doesnt want to be reminded of her former life getting poorer can do that to you not that im weeping shes still living in the palisades i said can you find out if she and boestling split up why her getting poorer and i got the feeling she lived alone so her reaction was bizarre hold on he went off the line came back several minutes later yeah theyre divorced filed seven years ago and closed three years after that thats as much as i can get without driving downtown three years of drawnout legal battle couldnt be fun and maybe she didnt get what she wanted now heres my showandtell went over to nestor almedeiras dump on shatto all the roaches you can stomp like krug said no one remembers nestor ever existing after some prodding the clerk thought maybe nestor sometimes hung out with another junkie named spanky but he had no idea what spankys real name was male white twentyfive to fortyfive tall dark hair and mustache possibly possibly the hair coulda been dark blond or maybe reddish or reddish brown the mustache coulda been a beard clerks about fivetwo so im figuring anyone would look tall to him at eight am his breath reeked of booze so dont buy stock on his advice nestors belongings are nowhere to be found i asked around about krug and hes got a rep as a lazy guy id bet he never bothered to go through nestors treasures gave the other junkies in the place time to do the vulture bit on nestors dope kit whatever else they figured they could use or sell the rest probably got tossed including troy turners prison id i said no street value in that or maybe nestor carried it on him and the killer took it as a souvenir if the motive was hushing nestor thats a real good bet wouldnt it be nice if i could get a warrant for cowboy barnetts cabin and the damn things sitting in a drawer next item jane hannabee central cant seem to find her murder book one of the ds who worked the case is dead and the other moved to portland oregon im waiting for his callback i did manage to locate the coroners report on hannabee theyre supposed to be faxing it any minute last but not least i backgroundchecked the old stunt gal bunny macintyre shes an upright citizen has owned the campsite for twentyfour years anyway thats my life suggestions with no dramatic leads id follow up on sydney weider back to her why such a big deal you had to be there i said the way she went from wary to panicked also she angled for the case eight years ago and montez voiced a halfjoking suspicion that she and boestling wanted to make a movie about it i know none of that ties together but she twanged my antenna you wanna talk to the ex its fine with me what about the daneys howd they react to being warned they werent in okay he said lets do this you give the daneys another try and ah heres the coroners fax on hannabee falling through the slot looks like lots of paper let me check it out if anything interesting comes up ill call you i made two more attempts at the daney residence the phone kept ringing no machine considering all the foster kids they cared for that seemed odd at a quarter to six i called allison at her office one more patient then im free she said want to do something different like what how about bowling didnt know you bowled i dont she said thats why its different we drove out to culver city champion lanes the place was dark and blacklit throbbing with dance music and crowded with skinny young hairgelled types who looked like reality show rejects lots of drinking and laughing and assgrabbing twelvepound balls guttering a few clackering hits every lane taken studio night said the poucheyed middleaged attendant metro pictures has a deal with us they toss the slaves a perk once a month we make out good on booze he eyed the cocktail lounge on the alleys north end who are the slaves said allison messengers gofers assistant directors assistants to assistant directors he smirked the industry how long does it last i said another hour want to wait i asked allison sure she said lets play that machine where you try to fish out cool prizes i spent five bucks moving a flimsy robotic claw around a pile of twentycent toys trying in vain to snag a treasure finally a tiny pink fleece trolllike thing with a dyspeptic smile managed to get an arm caught in a pincer allison said how cute dropped it in her purse and touched her lips to mine then we entered the lounge and took a booth at the back redfelt walls moldy carpeting so thin i could feel rough cement underneath this far from the lanes the technopop was reduced to a cardiac throb allison ordered a tuna sandwich and a gin and tonic and i had a beer she said what mischief have you been up to i caught her up the eightyear lag stayed in my mind she said how about this the fact that rand was being released set something off in malley does he use amphetamines or coke dont know if he does that could prime his rage further hed know about rand s release right at least thirty days before i said so life stress made him do it we see it all the time with substance abuse patients people fighting impulses and bad habits and doing fine then something hits them and they backslide murder as a bad habit sometimes it boiled down to that chapter monday night i slept at allisons she had six tuesday patients and i left just before eight during the drive home i tried the daneys house again still no answer family vacation with the foster kids homeschooling meant their schedule was flexible so maybe or had they encountered something nonrecreational i drove through brentwood and into bel air turned off sunset onto beverly glen passing the road that leads up to my house i continued north into the valley galton street was peaceful a guy watering his lawn a couple of kids chasing each other birds flittering the noise from the freeway was a chronic distant throatclearing i came to a stop half a block up from the daney property the redwood gate was shut and the fence blocked out everything but a peak of roofline i recalled how crowded the lot had been by three buildings no room for parking any vehicles would have to be out on the street drew daneys white jeep wasnt in sight i had no idea what cherish drove i nudged the seville forward searched for a black truck or anything else that seemed wrong a dark pickup was parked two houses up black no dark blue longer than barnett malleys truck with an extra seat twentyinch tires and chrome rims plenty of trucks in the valley i came to a stop ten feet from the gate was about to turn off the engine when a small beige car pulled away from the curb across the street and raced past with as much pep as four cold cylinders would allow toyota corolla lots of dents and pocks a few bondo patches on the doors i caught a splitsecond glimpse of the driver longhaired blond woman both hands gripping the wheel cherish daneys eyes were fierce she drove to the corner came to a rolling stop turned right sped off a bit of a head start but four cylinders wouldnt be much challenge morning traffic was thin and i picked her up easily hurrying west on vanowen using a slowmoving camper as a shield i kept my eye on the little cars sagging bumper as it approached the ventura freeway east she chugged up the onramp lost momentum climbing and slowed i pulled ahead of the camper drove to the bottom of the ramp and waited until she made it over the hump if a cop saw me id have some explaining to do but no cops in sight very few people in sight the corolla finally disappeared from view and i shot forward cherish daney merged nervously into the slow lane swerved a bit as she switched to the center one hand to her ear talking on a cell phone she needed a half mile to build up to seventyfive miles per maintained that speed on the route through north hollywood past burbank and into glendale where she exited at brand boulevard maybe this was nothing more than a shopping trip at the galleria and id feel foolish no the mall wasnt open this early the look id seen on her face said she wasnt thinking about bargains i stayed two vehicles behind the corolla on brand and drove south past the galleria one mile two two and a quarter suddenly without signaling cherish daney yanked the corollas wheel and bumped up into the parking lot of a gravelroofed coffee shop called pattys place a banner on the window promised breakfast special best huevos rancheros in town below that dip into our neverempty coffeepot our hotcakes are flappelicious despite all that culinary temptation glendale appeared skeptical only three other vehicles sat in the wide sunny lot two compacts a black pickup cherish pulled up alongside the truck before she got out barnett malley was at her side he had on the same outfit id seen at his cabin plus a widebrimmed leather hat yellow gray hair streamed over his collar his thumbs were hooked in his belt and his long legs bowed cowboy buckaroo cherish daney was all city girl fitted yellow top black pants highheeled black sandals her white blond hair loose in the car was now pinned in a chignon the two of them moved toward one another seemed about to touch stopped just short of contact without exchanging a word they walked toward the restaurant in perfect step when malley held the door open for cherish she glided past him without hesitation used to it they stayed in there just short of an hour and when they left he held her elbow my diagonal watchspot afforded a clear view of pattys place but i was too far away to make out facial expressions barnett malley held cherishs car door open waited until she got behind the wheel before entering the black pickup she drove away continued south on brand and he followed soon after i was third in the convoy hanging a block behind they drove to a best western near chevy chase boulevard through the motels glass facade two levels of rooms were visible above a bright aqua pool barnett malley went in and cherish daney waited in her car seven minutes passed before she got out of the corolla glanced around tamped her hair the seville was one of many cars in the motel lot and this time i was close enough to pick up nuance tight face she licked her lips repeatedly glancing at her watch she patted her hair again tugged at her blouse ran a finger across her lower lip inspecting the digit she rubbed it against a trouser leg then she locked her car took a deep breath threw back her shoulders and marched grimly toward the motels entrance thinking about sins of the flesh or had the concept lost its punch she reemerged alone fortyfive minutes later still tense slightly hunched the way shed been the first time id met her arms clamped close to her body racewalking to the corolla she backed out sped away i let her go and waited malley appeared after nine minutes his hat was in his hand his walk was loose and easy and he smoked a long thin cigar i followed him onto the west a mile or so later he switched to the north when he got on cal twenty miles later i lowered my speed and put a couple of eighteenwheelers between us he was pushing eightyfive and the next twentythree miles were consumed like fast food when he got off at the crown valley exit i kept going took the next exit got back on the freeway and headed back toward la like milo had said this was his turf nowhere to hide i was home by one pm my cell calls to milo s house had been answered by his machine he wasnt at his desk allison would be working for another couple of hours the plan was wed get together at five maybe see a movie i fed the fish tried to relax got on the phone again milo said hey malley does leave his house i said all he needs is a bit of motivation i told him what id seen he said this changes everything chapter at two pm milo strode through the front door that id left open grabbing an orange juice carton he said i need fresh air we went down to the pond i was trying to be welladjusted he said as in sniff the petunias rick was off so we went walking in franklin canyon then grabbed some brunch at urth café all the beautiful folks and me for contrast he touched his gut whole grain waffles kind of takes the fun out of overeating he tipped the juice carton to his lips i said sorry to spoil your leisure what leisure rick got called to stitch up a kid who fell out of a tree and the whole time i was thinking about the case and faking mellow he tossed food pellets at the water muttered come to uncle milo the koi swarmed and splashed nice to be appreciated he gulped until the juice was gone kneeled and picked a few leaves out of the mondo grass that rims the pond rocks ground them to dust between his fingers before sitting down malley and cherish doing the nasty good old reliable human frailty it fits what allison said about the daneys not communicating well with cherishs skepticism about the black truck she was downplaying barnett as a suspect diverting attention from her boyfriend he said how do you think the two of them got together had to be something related to kristal they were on opposite sides of the aisle love is strange i said what they passed each other in the hallway and clicked from everything weve heard malley despised anyone on the defense team apparently anyone but cherish he scratched his nose think its been going on for eight years its not brand new i said they were comfortable with each other good old cherish woman of the cloth meanwhile the cowboys cherishing her in some sleazy motel it was actually a pretty nice place i said aaa certification swimming pool yeah yeah and water beds that bounce to the rhythm of misbegotten passion what is it with these religious types alex therere plenty of decent religious folk doing good works some people are attracted to religion because theyre struggling with forbidden impulses and others see it as a way to make a buck how much does the county pay to take care of foster kids it used to be five six hundred a month per ward not a way to get rich he said five hundred times eight kids is four thousand a month i said which wouldnt be chump change to a divinity school dropout especially if it was supplemented by other income daneys other jobs whatd he call them nonprofits he runs around to churches while wifey does some motelschooling plus they might be getting supplementary fees im not versed in the welfare regs but there could be a homeschooling allowance or extra money to take care of kids with add so they could be raking in decent dough he rolled his jaw okay cherish and malley are a love connection what does that say about the murders if anything the only thing i can think of is that troy had three visits before he was killed one from his mother two from the daneys theoretically cherish couldve made contact with nestor almedeira he put down the bag of fish food loosened a shirt button slipped his hand under the fabric rubbed his chest you okay i said he turned toward me reverend blondie acting as malleys emissary to arrange the hit she poses as a thirteenyearolds spiritual support and sets him up to be cut like a hog jesus that would make her a fourplus monster its a hypothetical its just as logical to assume barnett knew nestor from the drug trade and cherish is just a plain old adulteress another chest rub i said itch selfadministered cardiac massage if cherish and malley didnt hook up during the six months it took for the boys to be sentenced when would they have the opportunity they used to live pretty close to each other what a chance meeting at kmart one look at cherish and barnett goes from enraged dad to lover boy i shrugged okay lets put that aside and think about the next body lara that could still be what we theorized malley blamed her for kristal their marriage was falling apart but toss in a new girlfriend and you beef up the motivation wonder if there was any life insurance out on lara if there was malley didnt use it to finance the good life he jotted in his pad picked up the bag and tossed more pellets to the fish i said the new girlfriend wouldnt have to be cherish barnetts a ladies man he looked pretty jaunty exiting the motel and you felt there was chemistry between him and bunny macintyre cherish on the other hand seemed pretty tense the cowboys a player he said sure why not macintyres crack about not keeping tabs on his comings and goings was gratuitous bullshit you saw the layout there he drives his truck through the trees and shes not gonna notice next db hannabee though im still not convinced shes part of it cherish making it with barnett spin that in any new way the daneys were providing support to jane during the trial cherish might have known where jane slept at night the fixer again okay for arguments sake cherish is a charter member of the very bad girls club what does that say about the case the citys actually paying me to work on it points to another setup i said if cherish is dirty drew was telling the truth about rand hearing noises under the window seeing the black truck barnett malley went after rand because rand knew something about kristals murder that threatened him something rand told cherish because he trusted her she goes and rats him out to her boyfriend what would rand know eight years later that threatened barnett the obvious answer is barnett had something to do with his daughters death the boys beat and choked kristal no one debates it why would barnett have had anything to do with that dont know the two of us sat staring at the fish that id put in the pond because i thought it would help me relax once in a while it does milo said even if there is something to that why eight years later what are we talking about one of those recovered memories or a young man making sense of something that had confused him for years rand could have come to it long before his release but who would he tell the prison staff was unresponsive they never even followed through on teaching him to read his only confidante was cherish but his trust was misplaced once he was out he thought of someone else he said a guy with a phd whod been fair and warmhearted and objective he looked at me the meeting he never made maybe that was the point of killing him we walked back up to the house popped a couple of beers and sat at the kitchen table milo finished his bottle and put it aside hows this for ugly alex what if cherish and malley didnt meet at the trial they were getting it on before kristals murder she wanted to marry him needed to get rid of the competition as in his existing family so she found herself a little killer for hire and started with the offspring cherish paid troy to murder kristal she knew troy from before shes into psychology went looking for a coldeyed little psychopath and found one troy told you he was gonna get rich cherish strung him along by promising to get him out early with some pot of gold at the end of the goddamn rainbow instead she got him bumped six months later phase two lara goes down lara was shot with barnetts gun i said so either barnett did her himself or cherish being his girl had ample opportunity to pick the thirtyeight out of the collection my bets on them both being dirty remember how pissed nina balquist was about barnett cremating lara instead of holding a funeral why be in such a rush unless you had something to hide and if barnett abducted rand hed have to know what was going on the only problem is i said its eight years later and cherish and barnett arent married why would they go through all that for the sake of an illicit affair hey he said relationships are tough the passion cooled whatever not enough to stop the motel trysts okay they discovered that hotbedding it is more fun than going domestic or cherish doesnt want to give up all that county money and the income from drews moonlighting divorce usually hurts the woman right look at weider cherish keeps the house the kids the holyroller persona and has her fun on the side could be i said it sure fits with allisons guess about premeditation troy was paid and brought rand along as backup rand wasnt in on it from the beginning but somehow he figured it out he rubbed his face hard still its a tough one pinning kristal on barnett heres a guy waited years to be a father he went so far as to borrow money for fertility treatment nina balquin suspects the money was never used for treatment barnett and lara mustve done something alex they had a kid if cherish is little miss hitler i can see her trying to eliminate the other chimps baby but barnett doing his own kid for her i heard the question but my brain was somewhere else his mention of nina balquin had flashed me back to her house the rear wall i said oh my what kristals baby photo her eyes big and brown barnetts blueeyed and so was lara i remember seeing her in court she had huge grayblue eyes that she was constantly wiping because she was always tearing up two browneyed parents can produce a lighteyed child but the opposites only remotely possible through spontaneous mutation kristal wasnt the cowboys kid it wasnt until six years after they borrowed the money that lara got pregnant lara got herself a different kind of fertility treatment his smile was vicious both of them fooling around but lara left evidence and barnett couldnt handle it barnett dominated and isolated lara i said another reason for her to go looking for love elsewhere any husband would be enraged by his wife having another mans baby but someone like barnett asocial bad temper gun freak wouldve been especially prone to a violent reaction he punished lara twice first by eliminating the fruit of her infidelity and when that didnt put out the fire in his belly he got rid of her and if he needed encouragement cherish was there to egg him on pillow talk he said ive got a solution honey yeah makes sense doesnt it it makes stomachcrawling sense so how did rand figure it out he said he mustve recalled something from the time of the murder i said spotting cherish with troy shortly before the abduction or seeing cherish and barnett together for all we know one of them went to the mall that day to make sure everything went down smoothly or barnetts involvement was more direct lara said she only turned her head for a minute before kristal disappeared what if someone kristal knew and trusted lured her away come to daddy he said then daddy hands her over to troy and rand jesus and rand came to all this spontaneously after years of sitting behind bars rand knew he was behind bars because hed been part of something terrible isolation and maturation got him ruminating he began to assess his share of the guilt to try to feel like a good person barnett and cherish had no reason to worry about him because he hadnt been in on the plot until he began talking to cherish troy on the other hand was an immediate threat and was eliminated quickly whats the name of that seminary she went to fulton any idea where it is i shook my head according to cherish troy s buried there she convinced the dean to donate a plot oh ill bet she did he laughed and cracked his knuckles cherish is a word i use to descriibe on the other hand i said what its a great house of cards but all we really know about cherish is that shes sleeping with barnett malley his face got hard so we find out more thats what lifes all about right broadening ones horizons chapter iwalked milo to his car was kristal buried or cremated youre thinking dna if you ever get a sample from barnett it would answer the paternity question let me tell you about dna in the real world we used to send stuff to the sheriffs crime lab but theyre backlogged till the next millennium and they cant get the county to pay for the latest equipment so they sometimes have to send stuff out department recently contracted with orchid cellmark in new jersey but its a priority game sexual homicides first then rapes then crimes against minors the quickest you can get something back is two to four months and thats after you get your requisition approved by the pencil pushers in this case if kristal was buried id need an exhumation order which could take even longer than dna analysis especially with no consent from the surviving relative going that route would also mean letting malley know hes under suspicion just a thought i said on the other hand maybe the coroner kept something from kristals autopsy and i can send that to cellmark ill head over to the crypt see if they can find something ciao i returned to the house in order to educate myself about foster child reimbursement in la county and to learn more about fulton seminary the first assignment was easy i phoned olivia brickerman at home shes a professor in the department of social work at the gracious old university across town a battletoughened veteran of the ground war that is california s social services system the widow of a chess grandmaster a frizzyhaired fireplug old enough to be my mother and one of the smartest people ive ever encountered she said you only call when you want something im a bad son she laughed finished with a gasp you okay i said as if you care of course im on my feet darling which is a positive sign considering so hows it going with dr snow white allison the ivory skin the black hair the soft voice all that gorgeous the analogys obvious am i overstepping boundaries here allisons fine and robin robins in seattle i said which begs the question last time i spoke to her she was doing well olivia so thats it she said i didnt answer im a terminal yenta alex slap my wrist seattle eh the genius and i used to go there before the computers and the coffee the genius could row a boat pretty well we used to go out on lake washington robin still with voiceboy yup mr tra la la she said she brought him by a few months ago for sunday brunch unlike other people who cant find the time allison and i took you to dinner at the belair dont quibble what im getting to is that i didnt care for him robin does hes too quiet she went on aloof if you ask me not that anyone has im always open to your wisdom olivia ha so what do you need to know how well does the state pay for foster care i was hoping for more of a challenge darling first of all the state mandates foster care and sets up basic fees but each county distributes the funds counties also have the discretion to supplement the state traditionally theyve been tight with the purse strings the rates vary but not much which county la the other thing you need to know is that officially foster parents arent paid a stipulated amount is allocated per child and the custodial adult gets to disburse it meaning foster parents are paid i said exactly the basic rate varies with the age of the child four hundred twentyfive a month to five ninetyseven older kids get more id assume just the opposite i said babies require more care youd be thinking logically darling this is the government no doubt some number cruncher set up a formula based on pounds of flesh what age group gets the max over fifteen twelve through fourteen gets five fortysix and so on down to the babies who get four twentyfive which doesnt pay for a lot of formula and diapers quite often its family members who take the kid in and apply as kinship guardians that what were talking about here no these are nonrelatives i said can the basic rate be supplemented wards with special needs get extra payments right now the max is a hundred seventy a month thats through childrens services but there are other bureaucracies you can tap if you know how to play with paper the systems full of goodies would kids with add be considered special needs absolutely its a recognized disability is there any point in my asking you why you want to know all this there are some people under suspicion i said milo wants to know if theyre getting rich at the public trough dear milo has he lost weight maybe a little meaning no well i havent either you know what i say to constitutionally skinny people go away anyway if you want you can give me names of these suspicious individuals when i get back to the office ill run them through the computer drew probably andrew and cherish daney i spelled the surname and thanked her cherish as in i love you as in except maybe she loves money too much its a possibility anything else you want to tell me how many foster children can one family care for six these people have eight then theyre being naughty not that anyones likely to notice theres a shortage of what the state feels are decent homes and very few caseworkers to look into details if nothing terrible happens no one pays attention what comprises a decent home i said two parents middle class would be great but not necessary no felony record optimally someones working but theres also someone in the home to supervise the daneys fit the bill on all accounts i said does the state pay for homeschooling same answer it depends on how you fill out the forms theres a clothing allowance a supplemental clothing allowance all sorts of health care surcharges that can be tapped whats up darling another one of those scams its complicated olivia she sighed with you it always is fulton seminary offered one degree a master of divinity according to its website the schools curriculum emphasized scriptural ministerial and public service aspects of professional evangelical training students were allowed a range of intellectual concentrations including christian leadership evangelical promotion and program supervision several paragraphs were devoted to the schools philosophical underpinnings god was perfect faith in jesus superseded all actions humans were depraved until saved worship and service were essential elements of fixing a world in dire need of repair the campus sat on three hilly acres on glendale s northern rim a fifteenminute ride to the motel on chevy chase i scrolled through pages of photos small groups of cleancut smiling students rolling lawns the same glassfronted sixties building in every shot no mention of an onsite cemetery the faculty numbered seven ministers the dean was reverend doctor crandall wascomb dtheol phd lld crandalls picture made him out to be around sixty with a thin face above a high smooth dome of brow silverwhite hair that covered the top of his ears and crinkly eyes of the exact same hue as his powder blue jacket i called his extension a womans taped voice told me dr wascomb was out of the office but he really cared about what i had to say please leave a detailed message of any length and repeat your name and phone number at least once thank you and god bless and have a wonderful day my message was short on details but i did toss in my police affiliation there was a good chance id made it sound more official than it was but dr wascombs training prepared him for minor transgressions repeating my name and number i hung up reflecting on human depravity just after nine pm dr crandall wascomb called while i was out with allison my service operator said such a nice man then she gave me the number different from his office it was nearly eleven but i phoned anyway and a softvoiced woman picked up dr wascomb please may i ask whos calling dr delaware im a psychologist one second seconds later wascomb came on greeting me as if we were old friends his voice was a lively tenor that conjured a younger man do i understand correctly that youre a police psychologist i consult to the police dr wascomb i see is this about baylord patterman pardon a beat never mind he said how can i help you sorry to bother you so late doctor but id like to talk to you about a fulton alumna alumna a woman cherish daney pause is cherish all right so far so shes not a victim of something terrible he said sounding relieved no is there some reason youd think that the police arent generally messengers of hope why are you concerned about cherish ive been asked to learn about her background in what context its a bit complicated dr wascomb well he said i certainly cant talk to you over the phone about something complicated could we meet facetoface to talk about cherish yes i must tell you i have nothing but good things to say about cherish she was one of our finest students i cant imagine why the police would want to learn about her background why didnt she finish her degree i said and whos baylord patterman perhaps said wascomb we should meet ill be happy to come to your office my office calendars quite full he said let me leaf through my book it appears as if i have one opening tomorrow one pm my usual lunch break that would be fine dr wascomb i wouldnt mind getting away from campus he said but it has to be somewhere close ive only got fortyfive minutes i know a place i said a bit south of you on brand pattys place pattys place havent been there in ages back when the school was undergoing remodeling id sometimes meet there with students did you know that sir no i said i just like pancakes baylord patterman pulled up five hits on google a burbankbased attorney hed been arrested a year ago for running an insurance fraud ring that set up phony traffic accidents the bust resulted when a fender bender on riverside drive turned into an airbag disaster that killed a fiveyearold girl patterman his hired drivers a couple of crooked chiropractors and assorted clerical staff were charged with vehicular homicide most were pled down to whitecollar crimes patterman ended up with a conviction for involuntary manslaughter was disbarred and sentenced to five years in state prison the fulton seminary connection appeared in two of the citations patterman was the son of a founding trustee of the school and a continuing donor to the cause dr crandall wascomb was quoted as being unaware and appalled by his benefactors dark side if he was sincere i felt sorry for him all those years pushing virtue and he was going to be disappointed again chapter my week for coffee shops pattys place smelled of butter and eggs meat on the grill pancake batter the soapandwater breeze that accompanied a cheery young latina waitress nametagged heather who said anywhere you like the restaurant was halffilled with serious eaters of retirement age big portions tall glasses grease on chins to hell with the food nazis my presence brought down the median age by a decade i took a booth with a view of the entrance and happy heather brought me a mug of dangerously hot coffee unspoiled by pretentious labeling dr crandall wascomb showed up at seven after one tugging at the knot of his tie and smoothing his white hair he was short very thin wore blackrimmed eyeglasses too wide for his knifeblade face he had on a brown herringbone sport coat a white shirt lighter brown slacks and tan loafers his bright blue tie stood out like a nautical spinnaker when his eyes found mine i gave a small wave he came over shook my hand sat down the hair was shorter and sparser than in his official photo his smooth dome was scored by parallel lines i guessed him at seventy or so he blended right in with the clientele thanks for meeting with me dr wascomb certainly he said do you have preset notions about evangelical christians dr delaware when i judge people its by behavior not belief good for you his eyes didnt move bluer than in the photo or maybe theyd absorbed some of the neckties intensity i assume you checked into the baylord patterman issue i did i wont offer excuses but i will explain baylords father was a fine man it was he who helped us get started that was thirtytwo years ago id come out from oklahoma city worked in the petroleum supply business before going back to school i wanted to make an impact gifford patterman was that rare man of wealth with an open warm heart i was naive enough to think the same applied to his son heather arrived pad in hand wascomb said its been a long time since ive been here are the flannel cakes still fabulous theyre awesome sir then thats what ill have full stack or half full butter syrup jelly the works wascomb flashed creamcolored dentures nothing like breakfast in the afternoon to make the day seem young something to drink sir hot tea chamomile if you have it and you sir ill try the flannel cakes too good choice said heather youre gonna love your meal wascomb didnt watch her leave his eyes were on his napkin i said baylord patterman let you down he let fulton down the investigation into his activities gave us a black eye because we were the largest beneficiary of his filthy lucre you can imagine the reaction of some of our other major donors race to the exit stampede said wascomb it hurt were a small school operating on a shoestring budget i call us the seminary that does more with less the only reason were able to survive is that we own the land the school sits on and maintenance costs are just about covered by a good christian womans will baylord pattermans grandmother his tea arrived pressing his hands together he bowed his head and uttered a silent grace before sipping sorry for your problems i said thank you were getting our head above water which is why i chose to meet you here rather than at the school i simply cant afford any more bad publicity i have no intention of giving you any he studied me over his tea thank you im going to deal openly with you because im an open person and frankly theres no longer any privacy not in the computer age but that doesnt mean i can talk freely about a former student without that students permission not without good reason holding on to his cup he sat back in the booth i said what would be a good reason why dont you tell me what youre after im limited in what i can say too dr wascomb there are certain details the police keep to themselves so this is a homicide case he smiled at my surprise i took the liberty of researching you dr delaware your consultations to the police seem to center on homicide that shocked me i cant imagine cherish involved in anything criminal let alone homicide shes a gentle person as i told you one of our finest students but she didnt finish her degree that he said was most unfortunate but it had nothing to do with her i waited wascomb looked over at the counter heather was standing around talking to the cashier doctor i said cherishs misfortune was somewhat similar to mine said wascomb visàvis baylord patterman she had something to do with the accident scandal no i was speaking analogously the bible issues repeated exhortations against keeping bad company cherish and i failed to heed those warnings but i was the teacher and she was the student so i suppose some of her error lies at my door cherish got blamed for something a friend did cherish was put in an uncomfortable position through no fault of her own heather brought our food here it is guys wascomb smiled up at her it smells wonderful dear her left eyebrow cocked enjoy he uttered a silent grace then cut his stack of hotcakes in half sawing straight through to the bottom rotating the plate he sliced again then once more until the pile had been sectioned into eighths lauritz montez would approve montez and wascomb had both chosen to minister to sinners i supposed they couldnt be blamed for seeking the illusion of an orderly world wascomb ate with such enjoyment that it seemed a shame to interrupt him i worked on my own plate finally said who was cherishs bad friend he put his fork down this is absolutely necessary for your investigation i cant answer that until i know doctor appreciate your honesty he wiped his lips removed his glasses touched his temples with his fingertips not a friend her husband drew daney slow nod howd he get her in trouble i said oh said wascomb as if the memory made him weary i had reservations about him early on were small and chronically short on funds we need to be selective in who we accept our typical student is an honors graduate of a respectable bible college trained in the evangelical tradition cherish was such an individual she graduated first in her class from viola mercer college in rochester new york and drew drew claimed to have attended a very solid school in virginia in truth he dropped out of high school that was the extent of his education he lied on his application he falsified transcripts wascomb sighed he pushed his plate away onethird eaten no doubt you think im a gullible fool or slipshod without sounding overly defensive i would like to stress that this was an aberration the vast majority of our graduates are out in the world doing the lords work in an exemplary manner drew mustve been good to fool you he smiled thats very kind sir yes he did say the right things seemed wellgrounded in scripture as it turns out his religious experience was limited to serving as a counselor at several christian summer camps he learned the jargon i said exactly when did all this come out seven and a half years ago precise memory six months after kristal malleys murder i said what caused you to look into his background someone else looked into his background said wascomb a very angry man who claimed that drew was committing adultery with his wife he winced a claim that turned out to be true tell me about it he shook his head pushed his plate away there are issues of respect here for innocent people involved a half year before you found out about drew he and cherish were involved in a murder case as part of their community service work for fulton counseling a boy whod killed a toddler im sure you recall that dr wascomb he blinked twice started to speak stopped himself sir that poor little girl his voice had gone hoarse theres more to that after all this time one of the boys who murdered kristal malley has been murdered himself wascomb winced oh my then i suppose i need to be forthright he clicked his dentures drew committed adultery with one of the lawyers on that case a defense attorney sydney weider nod it was her husband who barged into my office with medical reports raving about the school my incompetence how could i train a person like that i was a hypocrite all bible freaks were nothing but hypocrites he looked away from me im afraid ive lost my appetite sorry i said but not sorry enough to drop it were talking about martin boestling a movie producer a loud man at the time i thought him crass after some consideration after the shock wore off i considered what hed endured and felt compassion for him i called him tried to apologize he was gracious as far as that went what hed endured i said more than adultery he stared you said boestling brought medical reports as in lab tests slow nod his own and his wifes hed been infected with something aids not that bad said wascomb but bad enough gonorrhea his wife had given it to him and boestling claimed drew had given it to her wascomb shook his head the implication of course was promiscuity i took a closer look at drew learned of his lies and expelled him weve had no contact since then and cherish left with him i said because she was a dutiful wife because she was ashamed as i said were a small community he fooled with his fork how is cherish nowadays are they still together they are has drew repented i couldnt say i always hoped shed find peace now youre here asking questions about her they may come to nothing sir is she has she maintained herself as a woman of character dr delaware or has drews influence polluted her soul if you only knew i said from what i can tell she continues to do good works and him whats he up to the same his eyes got flinty theres a lesson for you dr delaware judging behavior isnt always sufficient its whats beneath the surface that matters how do you measure that sir you dont he said we dont he got up to leave god does the measuring one more question dr wascomb cherish told me troy turner was buried on the grounds of your school he placed a hand on the table as if needing support thats partially true how so cherish asked me begged me weve got a small cemetery in san bernardino for faculty and indigent individuals recommended by donors and other trustworthy people we view it as a community service cherish qualified as a trustworthy person she still does dr delaware unless theres something you tell me that suggests otherwise i didnt answer he said affording that boy hallowed ground was compassion for the sinner after some deliberation i felt it would be appropriate we provided the boy with a service who attended cherish and myself and my wife not drew drew as well he said he wanted to lead the service i decided to do it myself what about troys mother no said wascomb cherish said she had tried to reach the woman but was unable i remember the day late spring nice weather the air was clean small coffin it barely made a sound as they lowered it into the ground he placed money on the table i said on me no i wont hear of it split check then all right he smiled at me sorry if this was upsetting dr wascomb no no youre doing important work he turned to leave stopped touched my shoulder the boy did a terrible thing dr delaware but youd never know it to look at that coffin chapter heather came by and eyed wascombs uneaten food do you want a doggy bag no thanks she followed wascombs slow walk out the door he barely touched his food is he okay hes fine is he your dad no i said i handed her the total plus ten bucks keep the change big smile were you working yesterday here she said i think so yeah yesterday i was here working two jobs three here kfc after five and then thursday and friday nights i babysit for an emergency room doctor at glendale memorial tough schedule thats what my dad says he keeps bugging me to quit something and have some fun she stuck her tongue out im saving up for fashion school good for you i said yesterday morning around nine did you notice a couple who came in for breakfast she had long blond hair he was tall and wore a leather cowboy hat them she said sure i served them i remember him because he reminded me of this actor my dad used to like peter peter something fonda thats it theres this real old movie my dad watches over and over its got jack nicholson in it but hes a lot younger and skinnier easy rider uh huh jack and some other guy and the other guy peter theyre like biker hippies she giggled peters kind of a cutie if you go for that retro hippie thing thats what that guy the guy with the hat reminded me of retro lost in the sixties his hair was like down his back and his shirt had snaps on it which gave me an idea for a dress cowboy punk thing original thanks how come youre asking about them i work with the police her eyes got huge youre a cop consultant wow she said they did something nasty theyre just people were interested in like witnesses something like that is there anything you remember about them not really they didnt talk much to each other to each other or me im a real motormouth like you cant tell im always talking to the customers it makes them feel youre interested in them and it pays off in the tips department didnt work with those two they just sat there like they were having a fight they eat they ordered but only he ate bacon and eggs she asked for a sweet roll and milk but she didnt touch it like that old guy you were with i figured there wouldnt be much payoff and i was right ten percent tip which is old she paid overhear any conversation there wasnt any that i saw have they been here before once before she said last week lauren served them it was dinnertime and i was going off shift when last week lets see she pressed a finger to her lower lip lauren works tuesdays and thursdays and fridays and it wasnt friday because im off friday and it wasnt tuesday because she called in sick tuesday because her boyfriend got tickets to the jason mraz concert she stopped for breath had to be thursday around what time fiveish wow so this is like an investigation uhhuh you cant tell me what they did sorry heather cool i understand so theyve only been here twice thats all i saw how long have you been working here three years off and on howd they act on thursday the same thats how i remember lauren said they didnt talk just sat he ate she didnt ten percent tip eight percent actually she grinned i guess its my charm i thanked her and gave her another ten oh wow you dont have to she said but she made no effort to return the money if you want i can keep an eye out and if they come in again ill call you i was just going to ask i handed her my card psychologist she said like crazy criminals hannibal lecter stuff its not always that exciting my sister went to a psychologist she was pretty screwed up had some real bad friends did it help her not really but at least she moved out and i dont have to listen to a bunch of yelling guess youd call that partial success i said yeah she said absently as she drifted back to the register i saw her recount her money i got back on the west checked for messages when traffic slowed one from olivia brickerman i exited the freeway on laurel canyon drove to ventura boulevard found a spot across the street from an adult motel and called her office your mr and mrs daney are pretty good at the paper game she said they total about seven grand a month fostering theyve been taking in kids for just over seven years havent made any attempt to hide the fact that theyre exceeding the limit by two wards that tells me theyre vets who know the systems broke mrs daney has also applied for certification as an educational therapist which would entitle her to additional treatment money generally that requires some sort of teaching credential but theres been some loosening of the regs due to shortages of providers this help very much how badly is the system broken the geniuses in the state legislature just turned down a request for more caseworkers and the counties are already severely shorthanded meaning no one checks anything a couple more things about the daneys they always foster teenagers with learning disabilities what i found really interesting is that all their wards have been females which is unusual theres no shortage of boys in the system can foster parents pick and choose age and sex i said theres supposed to be mutual consent between the agency and the caregiver in the best interests of the child so you can ask for a girl alex she said right now if youre white and middle class and dont have a criminal record you can ask for just about anything and get it i thanked her and asked for a list of the daneys wards she said all ive been able to find is the last few years ill fax it to you soon as i get off regards to allison i hope i wasnt too cheeky with the snow white stuff not at all i said brilliance has its privileges you flatter me darling the only martin boestling i found listed in the phone book was a confectionery dealer on fairfax avenue unlikely but it was an easy drive over laurel canyon the nut house turned out to be a double storefront a block north of the farmers marketgrove complex the parking in rear sign kept its promise and i found a space next to a green van with the stores name address and website under a giant cashew that resembled an eyeless grub a locked screen door covered an open delivery arch i rang the bell and a heavy kerchiefed woman in her sixties peered out turned the bolt and trod back wordlessly toward the front of the store the space was one big room lined with bins of candy coffee tea rainbowhued desiccated things equally garish jellied morsels and nuts at least a dozen varieties of almonds a sign said no peanuts here allergic people dont worry the shoppers all female strolled the aisles and scooped goodies into green bags rolled from overhead spools the greenaproned man at the register was midfifties roundshouldered and stocky with dark wavy hair his face looked as if it had argued with a wall and lost his hands were outsized and blocky and he bantered easily with two women checking out in the internet photo id found hed been tuxedoed arm in arm with sydney weider shed changed a lot martin boestling hadnt i scooped smoked almonds into a bag waited until the shop was quiet and approached boestling rang up the sale youll like these an indian family in oregon does the smoking themselves great i said paying mr boestling his eyes narrowed why im looking for a martin boestling who used to produce films he transferred the almonds to a paper bag slid it across the counter started to turn away i showed him my police id he said police shrink whats this all about i consult to and now youre at the nut house how apropos his eyes aimed at the woman behind me in line next i stepped aside waited until she checked out martin boestling said anything else i can do for you purchasewise its about sydney weider i said and drew daney his big hands became flesh cudgels what is it exactly that you want a few minutes of your time mr boestling why daneys the subject of an investigation silence it could be serious i said you want dirt if youve got any he waved the kerchiefed woman over magda take over an old friend just dropped in we walked up fairfax found an unoccupied bus bench sat down martin boestling had forgotten to remove his apron or maybe he hadnt he said sydney was a bitch from hell he was a fucking bastard end of story i know about the gonorrhea know how big my dick is too if its relevant i can probably find out he grinned youd think it would be relevant size mattering and all that i married sydney because she was smart and rich and goodlooking and loved to screw turned out she was making a fool out of me from the day we tied the knot promiscuous if she had showed restraint you couldve called her promiscuous day of the wedding she screwed one of my socalled friends he began ticking his finger the pool boy the tennis pro the fish tank guy bunch of lawyers she worked with it was only later after the divorce that people started to come up and tell me phony sympathy in their eyes sorry marty we didnt want to make waves i could never prove it but im convinced she screwed some of her clients too you know the kind of clients she worked with indigent murderers robbers scumbags think about that shes keeping long office hours in order to spread her legs for lowlife while im hustling to support her in the style to which shed become accustomed i hated the industry stayed with it because i was desperate to impress her know where we met where your investigation didnt carry you that far back we met at the palisades vista country club where her family belonged and i was working my way through the u as a towel jockey spritzing rich people with bottled water while they turned like chickens on a spit shouldve known how it was going to be when sydney left her rich boyfriend in the dining room so she could do me in a cabana we dated off and on for a while until i graduated and got a job in the mailroom at caa and convinced her to marry me i said was it her idea for you to go into the industry i had a ba in english which is about as useful as a second appendix it sounded interesting and i was good at it mostly i did it for sydney i was crazy about her he plucked at his apron her old man got me the mailroom gig but i earned the right to stay worked like a galley slave and took abuse from the worst people youll ever meet i produced more than all the ivy league dilettantes who were doing it for fun climbed fast was making serious money while sydney finished at the u schoolwise she was always smart graduated summa took a break to have the kids then we all moved to berkeley so she could attend boalt law school i stayed down in la flew up on weekends to be with her and the boys i had it down to a science the four pm friday into oakland to avoid the fog return late sunday the boys turned out good considering they both hate her it didnt take long for the marriage to go sour we were bored with each other but no one elses marriage seemed any better so i didnt think anything of it until the lab report i said the lab report came later what blew everything up was i caught her doing daney in my house my bed my robe and slippers on the chair he laughed total cliché i had a meeting over at fox tv on a script the moron in charge cut it short because she heard my demographic wasnt right meaning my projects were aimed at iqs higher than that of a rutabaga i was expecting a longer meeting brought along the writer poor schmuck so im out of there in ten minutes in a notsogood mood decided to go home take a swim and a shvitz in the brandnew sauna i put in when i get home i hear moaning and groaning from upstairs and go into the master suite which i just paid a fortune to remodel let me tell you our place in brentwood was state of the art the doors wide open and sydney and that pissant are doing the twoheaded goat his voice had risen loud enough for passersby to notice smoothing his apron he cracked his knuckles i yell sydney opens her eyes then she closes them and keeps going i rush over and im hitting daney on the back and neck and he wants to get off her but shes got a leglock on him im pounding him on the back his head anywhere i can land a punch and hes struggling to get free but sydney still wont let him finally she finishes and shoves him off and the bastard grabs his clothes and runs out of there like his nuts are on fire he laughed until his eyes got wet i can laugh at it now even feel sorry for the idiot i smiled mr subdued reaction he said remind me not to put you in the audience anyway thats the story any idea how long theyd been carrying on no because we never talked about it sydney locked herself in the bathroom took a shower when she came out i was ready to fight she breezes past gets in her car and leaves she stayed out all night luckily the boys were away at school i sat there like a lox waiting for her finally got myself a room at the hotel belair a few days later pus started coming out of my dick but i got her good guess how something financial the prenup which her old man put in for her sake the deal was she got to keep all the assets she came into the marriage with only problem for sydney was the old man made some real bad investments and emptied her trust fund her sole assets were zippo leaving only our joint assets which wasnt as much as either of us thought because we were living way beyond our means for me it was no big deal my dad worked for a living the nut business i used to put it down for not being glamorous till i learned about the industry sydney had trouble coping i said sydney was a spoiled bitch who became a lawyer for status and fulfillment after we split she tried to get herself a private practice job but it didnt work out meanwhile the divorce lawyers are looting whatevers left her mother finally died and left her enough to get herself a place in the palisades along with a small monthly allowance the zip codes right but its a dump and she doesnt maintain it she was always hyper now i hear shes downright manic he looked to me for confirmation i said what happened to her private practice job ah that said boestling smiling unfortunately her boss received a copy of that pesky lab report so did every other serious criminal defense firm in town now whod do something so vengeful he yawned and you told daneys seminary about him i figured i was doing the lords work thanks for the memories doc time to get back to real life you said daney should have thanked you damn straight he shouldve i got sydney and him meetings with some serious people to make a film no to make polish sausage yeah a film a feature not tv sydney made a big point of that her attitude was always i was tv so i was low on the food chain her project was going to be stars and a substantial shooting budget the two of them thought they had the greatest story ever told but who did they come to when they wanted references was the story the kristal malley murder i said yup said boestling two kids kill another kid and go to jail not exactly titanic whose idea was it cant say for sure but my bet is daney was your typical delusional jerk and he infected sydney he snickered along with other things you know for a fact that he gave her the clap or it was one of the other five thousand dicks she rode hes the one i saw so im putting a face on it so to speak he shrugged for all i know it was the other kids lawyer some latino guy lauritz montez i said she slept with him too for sure how do you when sydney first started on the case she did nothing but badmouth montez stupid no experience an albatross who was going to drag her down then a couple weeks in she started taking late meetings with him lots of late meetings working on a joint defense i bought it until i caught her with that scumbag daney and finally stopped being the densest moron in the galaxy the only joint defense going on was when montez tucked his dick back in his pants i said nothing boestling said just another waltz down memory lane now if you did sydney say anything about the malley case that you thought was unusual this is about that after all these years he said whats daney suspected of cant get into details sorry oneway conversation unfortunately well unfortunately for you all sydney told me was that her client was a murderous little monster and there was no way she was going to get him off seen her recently i tried to talk to her a few days ago she got very upset and went nuts on you and started screaming right right good old sydney he said freaking out was always her technique in court she was real controlled but outside anyone tried to disagree with her shed just blast out with this wall of indy noise at me the boys her parents he shook his head amazing what i put up with my second wife was a different story mellow couldnt be sweeter dead in the sack though eventually ill find the right combination he got up and headed back toward his store i walked with him pressed for more details about the movie never saw a script never got involved directly dont forget i was just a tv guy you were good enough to set up meetings i said exactly he scratched his chin i did all kinds of stupid things back then had a little substanceabuse problem that clouded my judgment im talking to you in the first place because my sponsor says i need to be honest with the world same thing nina balquist had said how much of what passed for honesty nowadays was atonement i said i appreciate that im doing it for myself said boestling shouldve been a lot more selfish when it counted i drove to beverly hills and caught lauritz montez exiting the court building on burton and civic center the doublewide briefcase he toted dragged at his right shoulder as he headed for the rear parking lot mr montez an eyebrow lifted but he never broke step i caught up what now a reliable source tells me you and sydney had more than a business relationship and who might that be cant say no answer i said tell me about sydneys movie ambitions why would i know anything about that funny i said you didnt say what movie we entered the lot and he walked to a tenyearold gray corvette put his case on the ground youre getting annoying judge laskins retired but hes got friends im sure the judiciary and the bar association would be thrilled to know how you comported yourself during a major case is that a threat heaven forbid i said then again maybe youd rather file indictment forms in compton for the next twenty years youre a real piece of work he said keeping his voice low my money says lapd has no idea what youre doing i held out my cell phone speeddial five which wouldve connected him to my dentist he didnt take it a beverly hills cop drove past us in a brandnew suburban one officer all that curb weight gas economy doesnt mean much in i pocketed the phone montez said what do you really want his voice wavered on the last two words what you know about the movie and anything else you can tell me about sydney and the daneys he backed away positioned himself between the corvettes scoopnose and the parking lot wall the daneys he said smiling coldly always figured them for your typical jesus freak hypocrites and i was right right how daney was doing sydney any way he wanted howd you find out saw her going down on him in her car in the parking lot after dark asked her about it the next day and she screamed at me to fuck off and get out of her life which parking lot county jail same place shed offered her baby blue bmw for the interview with jane hannabee highrisk behavior i said that was the thrill for sydney so daney broke the eighth commandment i said what made his wife a hypocrite cmon said montez she had to know sydney and daney were hooking up all the time how couldnt she know he worked his lips as if to spit wiped his mouth with the back of his hand she rubbed me the wrong way psychobabblespouting airhead the only one she cared about was troy i couldnt get her to even talk to rand you really care you reach out to everyone whyd you want her involved character reference whyd she favor troy they both did because they knew troy from before he said he was one of their dogooder projects at city which shows you how effective they were rand wasnt a project rand never got into bigtime trouble until he met up with troy so he never had the benefit of their wise counsel not that it wouldve made a difference like i told you the script if you dont believe theres a script for everything you dont deserve that phd what happened with the real script sydneys movie what do you think nothing happened this is la what was the story line how would i know never read it no way this was top secret dont even know if there was a script he pulled out a remote and disarmed the corvettes alarm moving around me he opened the door what was there he didnt answer suit yourself i said and clicked open my phone he said all i saw was a summary okay a treatment sydney called it only reason i knew about it was i found it in her desk when i was looking for matches tiny smile i like to smoke afterward you and she got it on at the office those cheap government desks are good for something what did the treatment say the names were changed but it was basically kristal malley except in her story the boys had been manipulated by the kids father into killing her what was his motive it didnt say were talking two paragraphs sydney came back from the john saw me reading tore it out of my hand and did the old scream bit i said interesting theory maybe we can use it for real she freaked out and kicked my ass literally she kicked me he rubbed his rump she had on these pointy pumps it hurt like hell so the treatment was written before the case closed before the formal sentencing but everyone knew how it was going to go down i said whose idea was the deal sydney proposed it laskin accepted she lied and told him id agreed i ended up agreeing anyway because i thought it was the best i could do for rand get the boys started on their sentence and party with cocounsel i said it wasnt like that he said that night her desk was after wed done the bulk of our work thats when sydney and i really started getting it on before that it was only minor stuff we kept it outside the office motels none of your business in her car you want to be a judgmental prick go ahead its no crime to have fun fun till she started kicking you she was insane he said but let me tell you she had her talents chapter nymphomaniac said milo to use a quaint old term he blew cigar smoke into the air the way the air felt today he was cleansing it not that im nostalgic for quaint old terms having borne the brunt of such queer is common parlance now i said sos niggah if youre snoop dogg try it on some dude at main and sixtyninth and see how many giggles you get smoke rings floated upward wiggled and dissipated we were two blocks from the station walking slowly thinking in silence talking in bursts so everyones screwing everyone he said literally and otherwise you think weiders story line pinning it on malley was fiction or did she and daney latch onto something eight years ago like malley not being kristals father like troy telling weider that malley had put him up to it montez jokingly suggested to weider that they use it as a red herring and she freaked out maybe that was more than keeping her hot idea under wraps shes got exculpatory evidence but conceals it because her main goal isnt defending troy its cutting a film deal cold as in what passes for morality in hollywood i said if weider needed to rationalize she couldve malley pulled the strings but the boys did the actual murder and were going down for a long time no matter what she said as much to marty boestling her advice to troy wouldve been keep quiet ill get you out of jail quickly and youll be rich that would explain his fantasy of wealth troy was a streetwise little thug alex think hed buy it he was also a thirteenyearold with no future i said kids flock to hollywood every day believing in rich and famous still because he was a kid his patience couldnt be relied on indefinitely maybe troys death wasnt malleys doing after all he bit down on the cigar choppy smoke created a jagged halo picking a scrap of tobacco from his tongue he spat and frowned weider was a pd shed have known how to connect to a guy like nestor almedeira maybe so would daney i said working with disadvantaged youth he and cherish both visited troy daney was the white guy nestor talked about not malley jesus puff puff yeah it could go that way as easily as cherish being jacqueline the ripper especially cause ive got no real evidence for either scenario he dropped the cigar ground it out on the sidewalk waited until the butt cooled and pocketed it what a good citizen i said enough dirt in this city so how would rands murder fit with a weiderdrew thing same as with a cherishbarnett thing rand was never in the loop so he was allowed to live somehow he figured out the truth behind kristals death and made himself a target the truth being malleys revenge because he wasnt kristals daddy that seems to be the constant i said any progress on the dna filled out a requisition waiting to hear from the muckamucks id still like to know how and when cherish started sleeping with barnett but now maybe we know the why payback for drew screwing around makes sense the waitress at pattys said cherish and barnett had only been there once before and shes been working there for years cherish chose pattys because she knew it from her seminary days wascomb used to meet there with students but the two of them could have other spots their main spot was the motel ill go by there and see what the clerks have to say another possibility i said is cherish snitched rand out to drew not barnett shes cheating on drew why would she confide in him she didnt have to confide just mention that rand seemed really nervous was dropping hints about troy because she suspected that drew played a role in troys murder and if she could get him to eliminate rand it would save barnett the trouble dutiful girlfriend posing as a dutiful wife he said thats manipulation elevated to an art form wascomb said she was a spiritual girl wascomb hasnt learned the fine points of cynicism he took out another cigar left it in its plastic wrapper and rolled it nimbly from finger to finger nifty little trick id never seen it before theres another manipulation to think about i said drews story about the black truck was the reason we started looking seriously at barnett malley but given what weve learned about him we need to consider that he was playing us not afraid of malley just wanting to point us in malleys direction unfortunately for drew it got us looking closely at him three dead kids he said maybe two teams of murderers we turned a corner alex now im thinking i need to take jane hannabee more seriously as a related crime if troy told his mommy about the movie and she wanted in that wouldve made her a problem for sydney and drew an addict down on her luck i said shed definitely want in we were saying cherish coulda known where jane slept being janes spiritual adviser but the same applies to drew he jammed his hands in his pockets this is growing like cancer you ever find out how much the daneys are sucking from the county tit seven thou a month not bad for a coupla defrocked mopes i said with some of it illegal olivia said no one enforces the regulations but it could be a wedge if you need one i asked her to fax over the names of all the kids theyve fostered drews got a history of falsifying documents maybe hes been naughty in other ways good thinking what about hot pants weider think i should confront her boestling and montez both said the way she went off at me was her usual approach to conflict all youve got on her is hearsay adultery and she doesnt practice law so any threat of disbarment would be empty i could still embarrass her after the way boestling humiliated her i dont imagine thered be much selfesteem left to threaten all the more so he said hit her when shes down you could try it but you wouldnt not now i said too little bang for the buck then whos my target not who i said what paperwork i walked him to the lot across the street from the station where he retrieved his unmarked and followed me home passing me up at westwood boulevard he got there first the fax from olivia sat in my machine one page of names and social security numbers birth dates periods of foster care twelve girls between the ages of fourteen and sixteen eight were still living with the daneys one name was familiar quezada valerie the restless resentful girl cherish had tutored in math cherish leading her through the steps the essence of patience moments later cherishs tears when she talked about rand the list covered only a twentyfivemonth period olivias handwritten note at the top said this was as far back as i could get the geniuses archival system is a mess maybe permanently milo said lets start by crossreferencing the four who no longer live with them to what worstcase scenario for starts he phoned the coroner asked to speak with dave and said no not today but im sure ill get there eventually and get me a better mask next time im no stranger to decomposition but yeah nothing like water damage listen dave what i need is just a recordcheck yeah i know hearing my voice makes your day five minutes later we got the callback from coroners investigator david oreilly none of the four names matched the crypts roster of unnatural deaths milo phoned the hall of records got the runaround before hooking into county records and the roster of natural deaths he put the phone down they all seem to be alive our bit of good cheer for the day i thought they couldve died outside of la county what next any ideas you could try to locate them see if theyve got anything to say about the daneys id focus on these two who are still minors maybe life got better for them and they no longer need fostering on the other hand i like that he said constructive pessimism olivia gave us a contact at dcs and we had the data by three pm leticia maryanne hollings seventeen was still a state ward living with a kinship guardian an aunt in temecula no one answered the number and milo filed it for future reference wilfreda lee ramos sixteen was no longer on the foster list her last known contact was a twentyfiveyearold brother george ramos phone listing for him but no address city of residence was la ca occupation student the number made the u a good bet i tried it inactive a phone call to the university registrar revealed two george ramoses currently enrolled one was an eighteenyearold freshman the other twentysix was a firstyear law student and that was all i could learn milo got on the line pushed his credentials couldnt cadge any more out of the clerk same thing at the law school office we drove to campus parked on the north end walked to the school where milo bantered with an amiable whitehaired secretary who said you just called unfortunately the answers the same privacy regulations all we want to do is talk to mr ramos maam maam just like in a cowboy movie she said smiling im sure thats true lieutenant but dont forget where we are can you imagine how many of these people would love to file a suit for breach of privacy good point he said would it help if i told you mr ramos isnt in trouble but his sister could be im sure hed like to know maam sorry i wish i could help he relaxed his shoulders deliberately slowly the way he does when hes struggling to stay patient big smile he pushed black hair off his forehead and pressed his bulk against the counter the secretary moved back instinctively where are the firstyear students right now they should be out of jurisprudence class maybe out on the lawn how many are we talking about three hundred seven milo said male hispanic you guys doing better with your minority admissions or will that narrow it down hes not real hispaniclooking said the secretary milo gazed at her she blushed leaned forward whispered if someone was real tall theyd be easy to spot milo smiled back we talking basketball here maybe a guard long slow strides carried george ramos across the lawn in an awkward but purposeful trajectory like a wading bird an egret making its way through a marsh i put him at sixsix pale and balding and stooped carrying a stack of books and a laptop whatever hair he had left was medium brown and fine and streamed over his ears he wore a blue vneck sweater over a white tshirt pressed khakis brown shoes tinylensed glasses perched above a beak nose young ben franklin stretched on the rack when we stepped in front of him he blinked a couple of times and tried to pass us when milo said mr ramos he stopped short yes badgeflash do you have a moment to talk about your sister wilfreda behind his glasses ramoss brown eyes hardened his knuckles bulged and whitened youre serious we are sir ramos muttered under his breath sir my sisters dead im sorry sir what in the world led you to me were looking into some foster children and lee committed suicide three months ago said ramos thats what everyone called her lee if you knew anything about her youd know she hated wilfreda milo kept silent she was sixteen said ramos milo said i know sir its rare for him to have to look up at anyone he didnt like it ramos said what kind of parents would name someone wilfreda the three of us found a bench on the west side of the lawn george ramos said what do you want to know lees experiences in foster care what a scandal maybe something like that her experiences said ramos for lee foster care was a lot easier than being at home her father my stepfather is a fascist those preachers she lived with didnt give her any supervision customorder for someone like lee what do you mean said milo lee was rebellious in the womb did her own thing no matter what she got pregnant when she was in foster care had an abortion the coroner told us that after the autopsy the preachers talked a good case but my feeling is they collected the money and let lee run wild which coroner told you this santa barbara county lee was living in isla vista with some dopers when she ramos removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes this was after she got out of foster care said milo ramos nodded the fascist finally allowed her to come home on condition she stick to all his rules she was home for two days before she ran away the fascist said she should live with the consequences of her own behavior and my mother has always been totally under his thumb so no one went looking for lee we found out where shed been staying after she died some crash pad in isla vista ten kids living like animals i said the fascist isnt your father but you and lee had the same last name we dont her names monahan when he got so fed up with her that he made her a ward of the state he burned her clothes and locked her out and told her she was no longer his daughter she said fuck you and started calling herself ramos sweet guy said milo real peach said ramos cracking his knuckles she phoned me from isla vista wanted me to have her name changed legally i told her i couldnt do it because she was a minor and she hung up on me i said ramos is listed on state documents ramos laughed the state doesnt know its ass from a crater on the moon theres little about the system that doesnt need changing milo said that why youre in law school ramos stared at him myopically thats a joke right milo smiled sure im breaking my butt for a lifetime of mindless bureaucracy and shitty pay said ramos he laughed when i get out im going corporate we talked to him for another quarter hour i ended up doing most of the talking because the topic had slid into my bailiwick wilfreda lee monahanramos had exhibited severe learning disabilities and a history of disruptive behavior as long as her brother could remember george ramoss father had died when he was five and a few years later his mother married a former marine who thought raising kids was a variant of boot camp for lee adolescence had meant promiscuity drugs and mood swings so severe i was willing to bet they resulted from more than substance abuse by fourteen shed made two suicide attempts overdose cries for help cursory attempts at counseling followed along with a flood of recrimination at home when her father found her having sex with a boy in her bedroom he kicked her out george ramos wasnt aware of any notable problems during her six months under the daneys care but he admitted with downcast eyes that he had never visited her lee ramos had left foster care a month before turning sixteen on her birthday at midnight shed stayed home while her roommates went out to party shortly after she cut her wrists with a rusty box cutter lay down on a ratty mattress and quietly bled to death chapter talking about his sister had left george ramos pale and worn milo apologized for intruding ramos said youre just doing your job and stared at the grass i said did you have any contact with the daneys i called them once after lee died dont ask me why maybe i thought theyd care they didnt i spoke to the wife charity chastity something like that cherish thats it he said she broke down sobbed got damn near hysterical maybe im cynical but i thought it was a little over the top putting on an act said milo they only had lee for a few months and obviously they didnt do a very good job you tell her that no said ramos i didnt wasnt in a mood to talk cherish do anything to make you think she was faking her grief no but who knows said ramos who knows about anything ever speak with her husband nope just her ramos stood and snatched up his books and his laptop i said did lee ever hint around about getting pregnant ramoss long face turned sad dont you guys get it we didnt talk he let the books dangle clutched his laptop to his chest and birdwalked away other law students continued to stream out some chatting in tight little groups a few preoccupied loners forging their own trails milo got up and stretched i just creaked didnt hear a thing so the daneys take on too many wards but dont supervise fits with moral laxity it does ready to go i stayed on the bench alex what if i said he sat back down a group of students passed us when they were gone he said what evil thoughts have seized that brain of yours george ramos assumes lee got pregnant on the street it couldve happened inhouse literally daney he was the only male in the house which come to think of it is a haremlike situation all those teenage girls from troubled backgrounds maybe theres a reason the daneys ask for female wards oh man we know daneys a fraud and an adulterer and weve just raised suspicions about his involvement in murder impregnating a minor under his care doesnt seem out of character hed have been sure to terminate the pregnancy which fits with lee ramoss abortion it could also explain her suicide were talking about an extremely troubled girl whose relationship with her father was hostile shed be looking for a compassionate substitute the state found her one but if he betrayed her then had her sweep away the evidence that wouldve been traumatic surrogate incest precisely the kind of violation that could have led to serious depression slashing her arms on her birthday he said if it was suicide youre thinking it wasnt im letting my imagination run free he phoned the santa barbara coroner spoke to the forensic pathologist whod conducted lee ramoss autopsy did a lot of listening hung up shaking his head doesnt seem to be any doubt about suicide she locked herself in the room from the inside put on music the only window was painted shut no sign of struggle no defense wounds just deep longitudinal gashes on her arms serious intent beforehand she polished off a pint of southern comfort and swallowed a bottle of valium if the razor hadnt done it the dope wouldve the kids she lived with said shed been really down for the last few weeks theyd tried to get her to go party with them it was for her birthday lee begged off at the last moment said she was feeling sick my eyes got tight a girl id never met birthday suicide i said unable to face another year milo put his weight on the back of the bench showed me the back of his head folded his arms across his chest a breeze ruffled the trees behind us the grass responded a few seconds later she always had some cash so the roomies suspected shed been turning tricks sixteen years old it doesnt get that way overnight does it before i could answer he shot to his feet marched away slapping his notepad against his thigh nothing avian about his walk bear on the prowl definitely a bear i followed not sure what i was we returned to the car and cruised along the campuss eastern periphery i said daney works the system i wonder if hed dip into his own pocket for an abortion milo slowed bastard knocks up a ward and bills the state hes been getting away with everything else sure why not its one thing i said that we could elevate from theory to fact olivia said officially the files are confidential so im not sure you could use it in court lets see if theres anything to use i said your call darling it could take some time youre always worth waiting for oh yes she said my girlish allure my cell squawked as we drove up the glen a mile before my house some time had been five minutes nothing under ramos olivia said but the termination of wilfreda lee monahans pregnancy was indeed billed to the taxpayers the providers in north hollywood the womens wellness place she recited an address on the six thousand block of whitsett short ride from the daneys house more of that same tight net did an adult accompany her i said that wouldnt be in there state supreme court nixed parental consent back in even with her being in foster care even with in fact with the girl already on the rolls billing wouldve been a cinch just toss another code into the mix codes plural looks like she also got a full physical obgyn checkup pregnancy counseling and aids education thorough i said sounds like major league chutzpah at play here you dont want to know liv would you do me a favor and run another name through leticia maryanne hollings seventeen years old another one she said so its worse than chutzpah leticia hollingss abortion had taken place a month before lee monahans same comprehensive billing same clinic the womens wellness place stuck in my head but i couldnt say why i asked olivia to crossreference the two girls whod left the daneys and had reached majority one a girl named beth scoggins now nineteen had also terminated a pregnancy at the womens wellness place two years ago when shed been a foster ward olivia said this is getting yucky i told milo about scoggins his eyes blazed and i could hear his teeth grinding as he snatched the phone from the soft gentle way he thanked olivia youd never have known we pulled up in front of my house and i rushed ahead of him into my office thirtyeight hits for womens wellness place most citations referred to legitimate programs at major hospitals three matched the north hollywood clinic the first explained my déjà vu id come across it before researching sydney weider fundraiser eight years ago weider and martin boestling among the donors publicity photo taken during better times the other two citations were dated two years later also parties to finance the compassionate nonprofit programs of the clinic no mention of weider or boestling by then theyd split up and dropped several social rungs what the two hits did offer was a roster of womens wellnesss professional staff alphabetized list a name as blatant as a scar sandwiched among mds and phds chiropractors counselors art therapists massage specialists drew daney mdiv pastoral consultant the growling noise behind me raised the short hairs on the back of my neck i do some work with nonprofits milo said sure you do dude youre a regular fucking saint maybe he gets a kickback i said percentage of total billings an additional incentive to get them pregnant and terminated additional something like that is never just about money we moved to the kitchen and i brewed coffee at the very least this guys abusing young girls said milo if hes done everything weve wondered about hes a dimestore manson problem is i cant do a damn thing about it because officially im not allowed to have access to the girls medical files even with the files theres no proof daney was responsible for the pregnancies as a psychologist im obligated to report abuse i said the rules of evidence dont apply how much proof do you need in order to report the law says suspicion of abuse what that means is unclear every time ive tried to get clarification from the medical board my lawyer the state psych association ive failed i know colleagues whove gotten into trouble for reporting and those whove been screwed because they didnt the laws an ass he said bypassing the coffee and getting a beer from the fridge one thing puzzles me alex even with kickbacks daney getting all those girls pregnant would be dangerous be easier to get them birth control or use some himself than risk their telling someone they havent told yet i said or maybe they did and no one listened the poor ramos kid i nodded even if daney didnt murder anyone else if he was the father of her child hes responsible on some level for her death he popped his beer but didnt drink so how do i find out how about this i could try to talk to leticia hollings and beth scoggins couch it as a general inquiry into foster care if they mention or hint about being exploited ill have a clear obligation to notify the police any police in particular in a pinch youll do he smiled weakly the problem is alex if you approach them as a police surrogate the confidentiality thing will still get in the way of a criminal investigation not necessarily i said i began as a police consultant but veered off to independent research thought that was a cover story it could be real he looked up how so i learned about lee ramoss suicide working with you and got intrigued on an intellectual level intrigued about what the relationship between foster care and suicide the articles i published years ago on stress and abuse would make it a natural you still do research havent for a while but im a full professor and full professors get to do what they want when did you get promoted last year you never mentioned it no big deal i said its a clinical appointment what it boils down to is once in a while they ask me to supervise an intern or a grad student serve on an ad hoc committee or read a research proposal you get paid for that no i said its my way of giving back i formed a halo with my hands and held it over my head what a guy he said you dont look a day over associate professor his phone beeped sturgis oh hi yeah long time youre kidding thats great thanks a mill i owe you big time wide smile long time since id seen that that was coroners investigator nancy martino rn she found tissue samples from kristal malleys autopsy stored in a cooler kidney and stomach sections some of it looks degraded but there might be enough for analysis theyll hold it until i give them the word congratulations i said for what its worth his smile died now what whats the dna really gonna do alex confirm what we already know from the eye color the cowboy wasnt kristals daddy what it wont accomplish is get me any closer to malley for rand or to daney for whatever bad stuff he did he tapped a calypso beat against the beer bottle two bad guys no leads life is beautiful better than no bad guys how comforting he said you must be a therapist chapter i copied down leticia hollingss phone number in temecula and milo got elisabeth mia scogginss lastknown address from the dmv in santa monica it matched a phone book listing for scoggins e chucking his beer bottle he saw himself out beth scoggins lived in an apartment on twentieth street near pico lowrent section of the beach city but the thought that shed achieved some sort of independence was encouraging it was sevenfifteen pm allisons office was on montana the highrent north end of santa monica i knew she was booked with patients until nine but her usual dinner break was at eight if i managed to set up a meeting with beth scoggins maybe id have time to drop in later mr halo a young woman picked up the phone sounding wary ms scoggins this is beth i gave her my name and my title asked if shed be willing to talk about her experiences in foster care howd you find me she said panic in her voice made me want to back down but that might scare her more im doing research is this is this some kind of ripoff no i really am a psychol what research what are you talking about im sorry if what research the stresses of foster care silence i consult to the police and a young woman who was cared for by the same people who cared for you was found cared for is that what you said cared for whats your name i told her scratching sounds copying it down ms scog you shouldnt be calling me this is wrong click i sat there feeling dirty plenty of time to drop in on allison now but i was in no mood to be social logging onto my med school computer account i ran an ovid search on suicide and foster care found no objective studies only suggestions that kids taken out of their homes were at risk for all kinds of problems gee thanks academia i thought of calling beth scoggins back couldnt see any way that wouldnt make things worse maybe tomorrow or the day after give her time to consider by eight i was starting to feel the need to eat not hunger more like an obligation to keep my blood sugar up maybe id be useful to someone as i was contemplating canned soup versus tuna robin called the sound of her voice tightened my scalp hey i said eloquent am i interrupting something not at all okay she said theres no easy way to tell you this alex but i felt it was the right thing to do spikes not doing so great whats the matter age hes got arthritis in his hind legs you remember the left one was always a little dysplastic now its really weak also his thyroid functions low and his energy levels flagging i have to put medicine in his eyes and his night visions just about gone all the other tests are normal except for a slight enlargement of his heart the vet says its understandable given his age for a frenchie hes a real old guy the last time id seen spike hed hurled his twentysix pounds three feet in the air and come down insouciant poor little guy hes not the same dog youd remember alex lies around most of the day and hes gotten pretty passive with everyone even strange men thats a switch i just thought you should know hes getting good care but no buts thats it i thought you should know appreciate it i said glad you found a good vet up there im talking about dr rich youre back in la have been she said for a month permanently maybe i dont want to get into that i cant honestly say how much longer spikes got this seems better than calling you one day with bad news and have you not prepared thanks i said i mean it if youd like you can come see him or i can bring him over sometime pause if allison doesnt mind allison wouldnt mind no shes sweet how are you doing i said not great a beat tim and i are over im sorry its for the best she said but this really isnt about that its about spike so if you do want to see him id like to if you think it would be helpful for him last time i dropped by he was pretty eager to have you to himself that was ages ago alex hes really not the same dog and deep down he loves you i think competing with you for my attention gave him a reason to get up in the morning the challenge of another alpha male that and food i said i wish he still stuffed his face now i have to coax him the funny thing is he never paid much attention to tim one way or the other no hostility just ignored him anyway ill get by soon i said where are you living same place she said in the physical sense bye alex be well eeny meeny miny mo made it canned soup chicken noodle the decision shouldnt have taken fifteen minutes i was opening the can when the phone rang allison said hi its me got a problem busy i was thinking we could get together but tomorrows fine we have to get together she said now thats the problem i was at her waiting room twenty minutes later the space was empty and softly lit i pushed the red button next to the sign that said dr gwynn and she emerged no hug no kiss no smile and i knew why her hair was tied up and the day had eaten most of her makeup she ushered me to the small side office usually occupied by her assistant perching on the edge of the desk she twisted a gold bracelet she says shes ready your patient i said i still cant believe it believe it she said five months of therapy can you tell me how she came to you i can tell you everything she said she gave me carte blanche not that ill use it because in her present state she cant be trusted to make optimal decisions im sorry ali she was referred by one of the volunteer counselors at the holy grace tabernacle shed been searching for therapy took some wrong turns finally found someone with the good sense to refer out shes a resilient kid and on the surface shes been doing okay a research study would rate her as doing great because theres no substance abuse and shes gainfully employed works at the gap she owns a fifteenyearold clunker that usually starts and shares a onebedroom apartment with three other girls you see her pro bono theres no such thing as free she said i dont sell delusions allison volunteered once a week at a hospice was one of the few busy westside therapists who saw patients at deep discount that i supposed made beth scogginss presence a bit more than coincidence the first three months were spent earning her trust then we started dancing around the issues the history of abandonment was obviously crucial but she was resistant wouldnt talk about foster care either other than to say it hadnt been fun id gotten more directive the last few weeks but its been a drawnout process her next appointment wasnt for four days but an hour ago she put in an emergency call agitated crying ive never heard her like that shes always been a restrained girl when i finally calmed her down she told me someone claiming to be a psychologist had called her out of the blue a research project on foster care it confused her and scared her she didnt know what to think then she told me the callers name she crossed her leg she broke speed limits to get here alex began to unload before she sat down what a mess im sorry ali on balance maybe itll turn out to be positive her eyes met mine blue cool direct are you really conducting research of sorts of sorts as in milo stuff i nodded she said thats what i was afraid of you felt deception was absolutely necessary i told her what wed come to suspect about drew daney lee ramoss pregnancy abortion and suicide the trail of deceit and betrayal that had led me to beth scoggins im sure that made it seem exigent she said right now ive got an extremely vulnerable nineteenyearold in my office ready do you think thats a good idea you assumed it was a great idea before you knew she was my patient allison lets not deal with that now alex shes waiting and ive got another patient in forty minutes even if i didnt think it was a good idea at this point i cant dissuade her you opened up some kind of pandoras box and shes a very persistent young woman to the point of obsession at times i havent tried to quash that because at this stage of her life persistence might be adaptive she slid off the desk ready any guidelines i said lots she said but nothing i need to spell out for you beth scoggins sat stiffly in one of allisons soft white chairs when i entered she flinched then she held her gaze steady allison made the introductions and i held out my hand beths was narrow freckled cold nails bitten short a hangnail caught on my flesh momentarily as she pulled away i said thanks for meeting with me she shrugged her hair was straw clipped in a page worry lines tightened a narrow mouth wide brown eyes analytic salesgirl at the gap but tonight she wasnt making use of the employee discount her navy suit looked like vintage poly a size too large grayish stockings encased skinny legs blue flats with square toes blue plastic purse on the floor next to her a string of costume pearls settled on her chest costuming herself as a dowdy middleaged woman from another decade allison settled behind her desk and i took the other white chair the cushions were warm and smelled of allison the position placed me three feet from beth scoggins she said sorry for hanging up on you im the one who should apologize maybe you did me a favor she glanced at allison dr gwynn said you work with the police i do so what you told me about research it wasnt true its possible that i may look into the general topic of foster care but right now im focusing on some specific foster parents cherish and drew daney drew daney abused me she said i glanced at allison allisons eyes were on beth it brought back my intern days talking to patients while being evaluated by supervisors behind oneway mirrors beth said he started off being really nice and moral i thought id found someone honest her eyes turned blank then they came back into focus and shifted toward allison should i give all the background whatever seems right beth beth breathed in deeply and squared her shoulders my father left my mother when i was eighteen months old hes some kind of roofer but i dont know much about him and i dont have any brothers or sisters my mother moved from texas to willits thats up north then she left me to raise horses in kentucky when i was eight i have severe learning disabilities we were always fighting over school and everything else she always told me i was a hard kid to raise and when she moved away i figured it was my fault her knees pressed together glossysilver knobs in gray nylon she always liked horses my mother liked them better than me and im not just saying that i used to think it was because i gave her problems now i know she was lazy just wanted an animal that was easy to train chapter beth scoggins stopped talking and stared at the ceiling allison said hon beth lowered her head and nudged the purse on the floor with one shoe deep breath her tale of abandonment continued in a soft flat voice cared for by a widowed maternal grandmother who eked out a living running a thrift shop passing through school without learning much discovering boys and dope and alcohol and truancy at twelve a habitual runaway by her thirteenth birthday grandma got mad but she always took me back the cops said she could declare me incorrigible but she figured she had to be a responsible person if shed been my patient i mightve suggested that her grandmother cared about her this wasnt therapy what was it the last time i ran all the way to louisville took the bus and hitched and i finally found her after a week my mom she had different hair had got skinny was married to another horse groom and they had a baby real cute a little girl amanda she didnt look a thing like me my mother was like freaked because i showed up she couldnt believe how big i got she said i could stay i hung around for a few days but i dont like horses and there was nothing for me to do so i came back grandma got liver disease from her drinking and died and they collected her junk from the shop in boxes and took it away some people from the state wanted to talk to me but i got out of there she went silent again a history not unlike troy s and rand s theyd murdered a child this young woman was struggling to make it coming along nicely until a stranger called allison said youre doing great beth beths freckled hands gathered skirt fabric i went all the way up to oregon then back to willits some people were coming down to la to see a concert at the anaheim pond they said theyd get me tickets they didnt but i was here so i stayed in hollywood i met some other people she blinked several times i ended up at a shelter in glendale run by this church school they assigned me to mrs daney and she was nice her hair reminded me of my moms she said i could leave the shelter and move in with her she had other girls everyone was cool i just couldnt use drugs i moved in and it was okay except there was too much praying and the other kids were mostly mexican mrs daney was homeschooling everyone had all these books and lesson plans i was seventeen hated school mrs daney said you should do something so i ended up being mr daneys assistant that meant id go with him when he went to all these places and help out what kind of places i said sports programs churches church camps he drove around doing jobs church jobs sometimes hed lead prayers or grace she said mostly he was like a camp counselor or a coach or hed teach bible he did it because he needed the money he told you that he said that after he gave up a career as a minister he didnt make enough money to do just one job said all the foster money went to the kids they did feed us pretty good and we always had clean clothes even though it was mostly cheap stuff i was being his assistant for about a month when he started to abuse me she stared at the carpet allison said you can stop any time beth chewed her lower lip i think what he did was put something in my sevenup a roofie or something he drugged you i said im pretty sure we were in the car driving home from some camp and it was late and he said he was hungry we stopped at a burger king and he bought a cheeseburger for himself and two sevenups after i drank mine i started to feel sleepy when i woke up we were parked somewhere else some road real dark i was in the back of the car now and he was next to me and my pants were off and i knew from the smell that we did it she bent forward as if in pain two breaths after that we started doing it pretty regularly he never asked just pulled over in the car and led me to the backseat he held my hand and opened the door for me and talked nice and didnt hurt me it was always real quick which made it kind of like nothing sometimes he said thank you its not like it was i mean i wasnt feeling much those days moisture collected in the corners of her eyes i guess i thought he cared about me because sometimes he asked if i felt okay was it good could he do anything to make it better she fingered her beads i lied and said it was great a few months after we started i was late for my period when i told him is when he started acting weird two hands filled with fabric gathered her skirt above her knees she smoothed it down quickly patted her eyes with her fingers weird how i said like part of him was happy but part was freaking out happy about getting me pregnant like he was he never said great youre pregnant but there was something the way he looked at me like he was dr gwynn proud of himself said allison yeah proud of himself like look what i did but there was also the angry part exactly dr gee like look what you did stupid he called it the problem its your problem beth but im going to help you fix it i said maybe im just late that happened before her eyes shifted to the floor what i didnt tell him was that i was pregnant before years ago but i lost the baby it wasnt really a baby just a little glob of blood i saw it in the toilet this was in portland the people i was hanging with took me to a free clinic i got scraped out and it hurt like cramps i didnt want to do that again unless i was sure he wouldnt listen allison said he demanded that you fix your problem he said we cant afford to wait bethy thats what he called me bethy i hated it but i didnt want to hurt his feelings she turned toward allison dumb huh not at all beth he manipulated you into thinking he was kind beths eyes got wet yes exactly even when he talked about fixing my problem he was patient but he wouldnt let me disagree put a finger on my lips when i tried to say lets wait cause i didnt want to be scraped again anyway the next day he told mrs daney we were going to a sports night out somewhere far in thousand oaks i think instead we went to this place a clinic that was close to the house it was nighttime and the place looked closed but the doctor was like come on in she put me in a room and i got aborted really quick remember the doctors name i said she never said she had an accent short and dark kind of not fat but thick you know like shed have a hard time wearing fitted jeans would need relaxed fit there was no one there with her but she moved real quickly everything went real quick afterward drew was hungry and we went out for doughnuts i had some cramps but they werent so bad a few days after that he stopped taking me to the nonprofits and he got another girl to be his assistant a new one shed just been there a couple of days i guess i felt jealous for sure i was real bored so i took some money out of his wallet and went to fresno i met some new people dr gee im thirsty she finished two cups of water thanks that was refreshing to me you can ask me questions if you want do you remember the name of the girl who became mr daneys new assistant miranda dont know her last name she was younger than me maybe sixteen mexican like i said most of the girls were mexican she thought she was street but she was just spoiled had attitude when she became his assistant she was like im all that she twisted and faced allison maybe i shouldve told her dr gee what being an assistant was but even though she was just there a few days she was mean to me and i figured if she was all that she could handle it you had a lot to deal with it wasnt your responsibility to protect anyone else said allison i guess also like you were saying before i didnt really figure out it was abuse i thought it was attention beth faced me i had no feelings back then it felt like attention tears trickled from her eyes and she turned back to allison what you said last week dr gee everyone looks for someone to attach to i guess that was it allison walked around her desk and stood next to beth beth held out her hand and allison took it im okay really sir doctor you can ask questions youre sure i said yeah allison patted beths arm and returned to her seat i said do you think mrs daney knew what mr daney was doing i dont know he was always lying to her about little things like it was fun to fool her what kind of little things buying doughnuts and candy and hiding them in his jeep hed be like cherish doesnt want me to spend money on junk food but we wont tell her huh then hed wink like i was part of the scheme i guess youd call it but then he didnt share the doughnuts and the candy he was like youve got to keep that fantastic figure bethy she laughed like i was some supermodel mrs daney was the strict one making all the rules making the kids do their lessons she could be a little bossy i figured she didnt have much fun whys that she was stuck in the house cooking cleaning while he was driving around to all his nonprofits he told me cherish doesnt like to have fun then hed be like im so glad ive got you bethy because youre so beautiful and young with that gorgeous figure and you do know how to have fun then hed go off on some religious stuff he talked about religion like a sermon in church like funs not a sin bethy god made a beautiful world and if we dont enjoy it thats the sin bethy she smiled that was usually right before hed unzip his pants it was like he had to convince himself what he was doing was okay with god she waved a hand impatiently hed go off on these long stupid speeches about god and fun about god not being a god of vengeance like in the old testament god was basically this cool guy who wanted everyone to have fun the creator as party animal hollywood would love it beth scoggins emitted a ragged laugh it was like he had to convince himself he was a nice person then i got pregnant and it was like youve got a problem i think he enjoyed it enjoyed what getting me aborted on the ride over he was real quiet but when it was over he was in a great mood lets go out for doughnuts like the whole thing was fun i asked her if she remembered the name of the abortion clinic womans something the womens wellness place yeah thats it they had all these posters about aids and safe sex and making smart choices did the doctor do anything besides the abortion like what blood tests a general checkup no nothing like i said she was real fast something for the pain before then scrape scrape its over heres some midol if it starts to hurt she shivered kind of spooky no one was there most of the building was dark and i was by myself drew handed me over to the doctor and left he was parked out on the street when i came out did you go back for a followup visit uhuh she said i took the midols thats it drew offered me some different pills i think they were demerol i didnt take them id been pretty clean and sober since they put me in the shelter except for a rohypnol to get things going beth do you know if he abused any other girls besides miranda and you i never saw anyone but probably cause he was like there was no nervousness it was like something he was used to you know and he had only girls in the house why are you investigating him i turned to allison she said its okay a girl he cared for committed suicide beths eyes remained steady how she cut her wrists thats terrible she said that would hurt i asked if there was anything else she wanted to know nope thanking her again i got up and shook her hand no warmer allison said ill be back in a sec hon and walked me out it was nearly nine and passersby strolled montana avenue as far as im concerned she said ive got no obligation to report because shes nineteen hes a monster but thats not my problem right now she may change her mind but in the meantime i insist you dont bring her into any police investigation no argument she touched my hand her lips looked parched i need to get back in there well talk later i can come back when youre through no she said im bushed and ive still got two more patients tomorrows pretty heavy too ill call you i leaned in to kiss her she squeezed my hand and offered her cheek chapter back at my office i found the citations id printed for the womens wellness place the only fulltime physician was the medical director marta a demchuk md four hits for her the oldest five years ago was a state medical board listing of doctors facing legal prosecution or ethical censure the charge against demchuk was billing fraud five years ago but she was still in practice no answer at milo s house but i connected with his mobile out on the town big guy if the towns van nuys he said just got finished talking to a creepy little lady doc about the specifics of her gynecology practice marta demchuk silence what the hell if you were hiding in a corner i didnt see you i recounted beth scogginss story he said allisons patient talk about karma unfortunately she wont be available for followup why allisons protecting her maybe you could i cant silence okay i said howd you get onto demchuk the more i thought about that clinic the worse it started to stink daney gets minors aborted there the bills are probably padded and hes listed on the board with a fake divinity degree i ran the same search you did found out who the boss was and that she was brought up on fraud charges i did a little more background learned shes ukrainian had to take the licensing exam three times before she passed so now im figuring some russian scam and i call a guy i know at the medical board from what i can tell abortions always been demchuks thing she started doing it the minute she got licensed first at other clinics also run by ukrainians then she started her own place nine years ago womens wellness the main wellness is hers he said its strictly medical shes into high volume rakes it in she claims to be nonprofit all those fundraisers what that means is demchuk filed as a nonprofit and lists herself as an employee she takes a huge salary and the clinic never makes it into the black what got her in trouble six years ago was sloppy recordkeeping that led to some duplicate billing she claimed clerical error ignorance of what her staff was doing got a sixtyday suspension of medical billing privileges slap on the wrist i said the right friends her husbands a bigtime immigration lawyer contributes to politicians hence the fundraisers hence i dropped in on her an hour ago shes pulling seven figures but the décors plainwrap that probably tugs at contributors heartstrings i said you found her working late the lights were on and demchuks mercedes was the only vehicle in the parking lot i woulda kept going except i noticed another vehicle parked up the block white jeep daney was there extremely there chilling in the front seat eating something and from the way his head was moving listening to music i circled around and positioned myself half a block down twenty minutes later demchuk comes out with a girl whos walking kind of shaky daney gets out of the jeep puts his arm around the kid guides her in and they drive away i recognized her the girl cherish was trying to teach math valerie quezada sixteen years old with add obviously he likes them young and vulnerable the thing is her body language said she liked him too putting her head on his shoulder before she got in the jeep she kissed his hand and this is right after shes had an abortion beth scoggins said his manner was gentle solicitous flattering until she got pregnant then he got stern and broke it off with her well he hasnt broken it off with valerie yet meaning even if i could find a way to talk to her shed clam up now youre telling me scoggins wont cooperate im stuck beth said a girl named miranda was her successor anything like that on the foster list ill check tomorrow he said so allisons not impressed by the magnitude of this assholes offenses allisons got to think about beth scogginss mental health in the short run i said also right now i dont hold much sway why not she saw me in another light and didnt like it what lights that deceptive a woman who still thinks men dont lie he said thought she dug all the police stuff until it got too close i said you really think its useless to talk to her again maybe in a coupla days ill play it by ear eventually beth might decide to go public right now allison feels it would be too much to handle eventually daneys gonna knock up more girls i didnt answer he said fine anyway after daney drove away demchuk stayed outside and lit up a cigarette white coat and shes puffing away i decided to take the risk walked up on her in the dark flashed the badge scared the hell out of her she drops her smoke gets ashes all over the coat but she recovered pretty fast got cagey told me she had nothing to say headed back inside i followed her and she yapped about civil liberties and made empty threats and i postured right back and eventually we ended up finding some common ground because she doesnt care for daney either says hes a greedy fellow he gets a kickback she admitted that she claims nyet that was never part of the plan it was just a mutually convenient situation it started when she put his name on the advisory committee at sydney weiders request something about weider wanting him to have credibility for a movie deal soon after that he started bringing her girls demchuk ever suspect he was more than a concerned foster parent she denied it but come on all those abortions all the agreement we came to was that when i busted daney id do my best to keep demchuks name out of it in return she had to document every daney ward whose pregnancy shes terminated and be forthcoming with other information as requested she had it right there in the computer and printed it out for me nine girls in eight years my god i said like you said drews underage harem this guys beyond bad news hes got the perfect victim pool living under his roof abandoned girls with low selfesteem learning problems probably histories of sexual activity he impregnates them deliberately gets a kick out of destroying the fetus and the taxpayers pay for everything without getting into the whole whendoeslifebegin thing alex hes basically a prenatal serial killer right whats the thrill i thought about that create and destroy playing god nine girls he said and not one of them has complained hes gentle seductive not coercive ties it in with the whole paternal intimacy thing when he moves on to another girl they think its their fault beth admitted being jealous she dealt with it by escaping that place of his he said main house converted garage and that weirdlooking cinderblock building lots of construction for a small lot i was figuring dorms for the kids but who knows what goes on there no way cherish couldnt know right beth says drew delighted in going around cherish from petty stuff like eating doughnuts on the sly to leaving her with the scut work while he took his assistants out on the road okay he said maybe that worked for a while but she finally caught on and started sleeping with barnett malley her own brand of sin i said how did daneys greed come into the picture with demchuk hed been hinting around for a while about getting a cut of the action demchuk lent him money to put him off small amounts he never repaid she figures three four grand total recently though hes gotten pushier coming out and asking for his share outright insisting hes her best referral source implying he might go elsewhere demchuks not the sharing type and daneys timing couldnt be worse because demchuks ready to retire wants to sell the clinic she was figuring shed buy him off with a screwyou payment i told her selling the place wasnt gonna be easy when all the bad stuff about daney came out made that sound more imminent than it is demchuk tried to stay cool but i could tell i shook her thats why she was willing to deal him off as in handing over valerie quezadas aborted fetus she keeps them no she tosses them in the trash out back which is a health code violation i had her fish it out and put it in dry ice then i brought it over to the coroners to be stored with kristal malleys tissue samples which is where i am now breathing in the aroma of decomposition and drinking county coffee no word on my dna requisition yet but now it looks like ill have another package to send to cellmark we get daneys dna in the fetus ive got a gift for the juvey sex crimes unit they just started downtown youre bringing them into it not yet he said not until i get closer to daney for murder but the pedophilia thing could turn out to be good leverage how long can you sit on it eight girls living on galton street bothers my sleep but i cant risk screwing things up by moving without evidence first order of business is to get dna from daney any suggestions about how to approach it arrange a meet by playing his ego youve bought into his suspicions of barnett malley but malley remains a mystery man ask him if he has any other suggestions that parts true still researching malley and cant come up with a damn thing okay a facetoface with dynamic drew then what swipe his toothbrush for the sample thats the easy part i said he likes doughnuts chapter rain fell the next morning and the temperatures dropped into the high fifties la finally auditioning for winter when milo pulled the unmarked into the dipsy donut lot at ten am the sky had closed and vanowen boulevard smelled of wet laundry drew daney was there drinking coffee at the same aluminum table exact position hed occupied the first time a man of patterns he had on a brown corduroy car coat rested his denim haunches on newspaper hed spread to soak up dampness from the bench when he saw us he smiled and waved warm smile it spread his stubbly silver beard his eyes crinkled this was the face of evil he couldve served as a model for a tool supply catalog milo pumped his hand as if they were longtime buddies morning not hungry daney winked waiting for you guys how about i get us an assortment sounds good lieutenant milo left and i sat down opposite daney my assignment should i choose to take it was to check out nonverbal cues and whatever psych stuff i came up with way i figure alex having you along will play to his ego make him feel like a peer even though youre peerless i watched daneys teeth disappear as his smile shifted to a closemouthed one thanks for meeting with us on such short notice hey anything i can do to help under his car coat he wore a spotless yellow polo shirt tight across his broad chest welldeveloped musculature his complexion glowed and his eyes were clear picture of vitality sometimes too often good things happen to bad people i said hows your wife doing the question made him blink in terms of rand s death she seemed pretty affected of course she was he said we all are its a process healing your foster kids were affected definitely rand wasnt with us long but he was a presence you know what its like dealing with death that and kids in general he said the developmental stages they go through whats the age range of your wards theyre all adolescents theres a challenge you bet is that by choice were masochists he said chuckling seriously a lot of people dont want the baggage teens bring to the table so cherish and i figured thats where our efforts would be best spent boyish shrug sometimes i wonder though it can feel like temporary insanity that i can believe he looked over at the doughnut stand crowded just like the first time i said rand wasnt that long out of his teens that could also be an issue for your kids sure he said quickly but his eyes told me he wasnt tracking perceived similarity i went on theres a whole bunch of data on how it relates to empathy if it could happen to him it could happen to me he said sure makes total sense but what i was referring to are the core issues theyre wrestling with sense of identity establishing autonomy and of course they think theyre immortal wry smile we did at that age right all that stuff we kept from our parents i forced my own smile trying not to think about what this guy did to young girls autonomy a thirteenyearold bleeding out in a prison supply room i said thank god my parents never knew some of the things i did you were a wild guy he said shifting closer engaging me with those warm dark eyes as if i were the most important person on earth return of the teeth charisma the most skillful psychopaths know how to play it like a guitar sometimes the smartest ones get to the top of the corporate ladder or the highest rungs of elected office in the end though shallow theatrics are often counterbalanced by laziness and sloppiness doing someone elses wife in the marital bed writing and shopping a thinly described screenplay and expecting it to make you an overnight millionaire impregnating minors for a hobby and billing the state for their abortions for all his wizardry at manipulation daney was miles from where he wanted to be the lifestyle hed glimpsed after hooking up with sydney weider brentwood aspen private jets red carpet fantasies all that upscale pillow talk fevering his brain look at me look at me look at me eight years later instead of all that he was a middleaged guy running around singing camp songs and trying to cadge money from dr marta demchuk fools move demchuk was tough and daneys smarmy mojo worked only on the weakest of victims he flexed a thick wrist ran his hand through his thick wavy hair i said i was never wild enough to get into serious trouble but i had my moments ill bet you did how about you he hesitated for a moment nah i was a good boy maybe too good choir boy i was brought up thinking fun meant good deeds preachers kid you guessed it a shadow darkened his face then a larger shadow bearish tinted the aluminum table pewter daney turned to see milo looming behind him holding a greasy cardboard box fresh out of the fat smells yum detective milo let him have the first pick jellyfilled just like last time as he chewed with obvious pleasure i told myself to turn off the analysis maybe he just loved jellyfilled doughnuts he wiped his beard took another bite arent these just the best milo said guilty pleasures rev and swallowed a mouthful of cruller i got to work on a mapleglaze cars drove in and out of the lot the air got warmer a flock of pigeons flew over from across vanowen and began exploring the leavings milo tossed them a crumb and they flittered like paparazzi daney said theres your good deed for the day we laughed just a bunch of guys stuffing their faces with junk food on a damp day in the valley milo said so have you come up with any insights rev drew daney scanned the doughnut box picked out a pink thing topped with chocolate sprinkles you havent been able to learn anything at all about malley i wish guy seems to be a cipher guess that fits said daney with what if he had a history of antisocial behavior hed want to cover his tracks well said milo if there are serious tracks well uncover them that sounds pretty confident lieutenant we usually get to the bottom of things its just a matter of how long it takes hand me that chocolate thing the box was within milos reach but daney stretched to comply anyway he said after you called last night i spent some time thinking about why malley would get so violent after all these years the only thing i can think of is that rand became some sort of threat to him or malley perceived rand that way now that would mean the two of them communicated somehow so i looked at my phone bill to see if rand made any calls over the weekend he didnt so unless he spoke to malley from prison or used a pay phone i dont know what to tell you wheres the pay phone closest to your house said milo daneys eyes shifted to the left youre able to check them sure well said daney i think theres one a few blocks that way pointing east i never really paid attention nowadays with cell phones who uses pay booths people with no money said milo hmm guess so i said seems to me the where isnt important its the what were after what rand told malley daney put his pink doughnut down that was speculation on my part because you asked me to speculate for all we know malley simply went nuts after he heard rand was getting out old wounds opening or wounds that never healed said milo the way he looked at you in that hardware store true said daney that was pretty intense still any sign of the black truck daney shook his head but im gone a lot milo turned away seemingly distracted daney watched him then returned to his pink doughnut but didnt eat i let the silence grow for a while before saying for arguments sake lets go with the assumption that rand told malley something that set him off what do you think it couldve been daney said hmm i guess it wouldnt have been anything malicious and i cant see rand being confrontational he was basically a nice kid he waited for milos reaction to that none followed the only thing i can think of he went on is there was some sort of miscommunication such as said milo im not sure what i mean said daney like i said this is all theorizing understood said milo but give it a try cause weve got nothing else well said daney when we brought rand home he was clearly troubled like i told you the only explanation i can come up with is lingering guilt maybe he tried to get some closure by meeting malley facetoface and apologizing or malley accosted rand and demanded an apology i said sure that too milo said that makes more sense to me rev malley follows rand when he leaves your house to go to the construction site gets him in the truck either by convincing him hes friendly or at gunpoint then something could be an apology demanded by malley or something else goes haywire what do you think doc i said makes sense daney said rands verbal skills were poor detective i can see him saying the wrong thing phrasing something in a way that would spark malleys rage i mean isnt that how so much crime originates miscommunication two guys in a bar said daney an argument gets out of hand isnt that a big part of police work sure said milo daney took a bite of the pink doughnut ate half and put it down there is something else kind of farfetched but as long as were theorizing whats that daney hesitated sir this goes way back detective to the boys hearings i was spending a lot of my time on the case because the defense asked me to be there as support cherish and i attended everything and i got to look at the evidence something about the evidence was off said milo no no nothing like that what im getting at is in my field you learn to observe people their reactions kind of like what you do doctor i nodded im a little uncomfortable getting into this said daney its nothing id want to sign my name to and i really wouldnt be comfortable going on record as the source but if you could confirm it independently he broke off scratched his beard shook his head sorry for waffling but its he slung his jaw shook his head i dont know maybe its not a good idea milo said were in bad shape on this one reverend anything you can tell us would be helpful and if its something i can confirm independently i promise you i will okay said daney first let me say that i never brought this up because the boys had clearly done the crime that isnt to say i didnt think they deserved compassion but everyone had suffered enough there was simply no point he reached for another doughnut chose blindly and extracted an apple turnover holding the pastry in one hand he watched as flakes of dough snowed on the table eye color he said barely audible little kristal had brown eyes id never have noticed but in the evidence packet were photos of that poor little girl in life and in death the postmortem shots i couldnt bring myself to look at the others were baby pictures the prosecution was going to use them to build sympathy emphasizing how small and cute shed been thats neither here nor there the point is i saw those photos but at that time the fact that kristals eyes were brown didnt mean much until i noticed that both lara and barnett had pale eyes hers were blue or green im not sure his are definitely blue im no geneticist but ive learned enough science to know that brown eyes are dominant and lighteyed parents usually cant have darkeyed kids i had my suspicions but like i say there was no reason to open that can of worms who would it help but last night after you called and asked me to give the case some serious thought i went on the internet to confirm and its highly unlikely close to impossible for two blueeyed parents to produce a browneyed child his speech had grown rapid and the last few words had tapered to whispers inaudible gulping air he exhaled and put the turnover down im not out to slander anyone but kristal wasnt malleys kid said milo whoa its the only logical conclusion lieutenant and that could be the source of mr malleys rage kristal was nearly two said milo youd think malley wouldve figured it out he struck me as an unsophisticated person he worked rodeos or something like that rodeos riding roping or at least thats what i heard said daney from the defense sounds like ms weider did her background research you bet she was extremely hardworking and thorough i was glad when she got the case you were involved before she got the case i said i thought she brought you on as a supportperson just the opposite actually said daney i brought her on not officially but i had a hand in it how so i knew troy from working with him at city i also knew ms weider from some other youth work id done my seminary had a program working with innercity teens trying to get them involved in summer activities in the course of that i developed some contacts with the public defenders office because thats where so many of our kids ended up i knew several of the pds but thought ms weider would be perfect for the boys because she was so thorough i called her and asked if she could help out she said there was a system in place but shed see what she could do as a favor to you partly said daney to be honest the case attracted her because it was highprofile she was pretty ambitious and then she asked you to stay on for support said milo exactly you ever tell her about the eye color thing no like i said i didnt see the point milo exhaled wow thats a bombshell all right thank you rev i dont like telling tales but so youre figuring rand knew kristal wasnt malleys kid and mentioned it to malley no no said daney i hadnt taken it that far but it coulda happened that way no i honestly dont think so lieutenant how would rand know same way you did he noticed daney shook his head rand just wasnt that observant but even if he did know thered be no reason to throw it in malleys face what then what im getting at and this is really out there is maybe barnett malley wasnt a total victim daney flinched pushed the turnover away i feel like im wading into something and im really not comfortable sorry pushing up a corduroy sleeve he peered at a blackfaced sports watch milo placed a hand on his arm flashed that lupine smile daney stiffened for a second dropped his shoulders shot us a look of misery ive got that sinking feeling guys like when youve gone too far you know i said youre saying malley found out lara had cheated on him built up a whole lot of rage and decided to act out against kristal i dont want to say more said daney because im scared and not ashamed to admit it scared of malley said milo a lot of people depend on me detective thats why i dont skydive or ride a motorcycle or go mountain climbing miss all that not anymore said daney now i really need to get going i said its a whole new way of looking at it milo to daney did malley know troy and rand before the murder i wouldnt know said daney lara went to the mall frequently and so did the boys so thered be opportunity for barnett to see them as well i turned back to milo they hung out at that arcade maybe malley was into video games too being an unsophisticated guy both of us stared at daney he said its possible milo said troy and rand never mentioned knowing malley after they got arrested troy definitely didnt said daney i wasnt talking much to rand he was pretty nonverbal back then right doctor you bet i said but i always got the feeling he was holding back defensive he said yes i sensed the same thing frustrating i tried to open him up said daney but not being a psychologist i didnt want to step into uncharted territory in the end it didnt matter because the case got settled optimally or so i thought what do you mean said milo look what happened to troy and to rand i hear what youre saying rev about rand not being perceptive but if he really knew malley had some culpability would he hold on to it for eight years maybe said daney he was confused he stood quickly im sorry this is getting way too complicated and theres nothing more i can tell you if it ends up helping you great but please keep my name out of it he ran his hands over his shirt as if brushing off dirt milo got up and faced him used his height to advantage absolutely sir i wouldnt lose too much sleep because to be honest i dont see any way of pursuing any of this daney stared up at him milo said like you said too speculative daney nodded good luck he pivoted and began to walk away i mean the only time it would ever be relevant said milo is if we got solid physical evidence on malley and put him behind bars then wed ask you to give a deposition daney stopped weak smile if that happened detective id be happy to do my part chapter milo watched as the white jeep drove away wish there was a shower nearby he took an evidence bag out of his attaché case gloved up sealed daneys coffee cup and slipped it in into a second bag went the halfeaten pink doughnut i said he snarfed that right before he graced us with his reluctant insights on eye color his appetite peaked because he was aroused by the game letting us know the cowboy wasnt kristals daddy thinking hes being subtle it was a dual thrill he gets to be the hero of the story granting you vital information and he heightens the focus on malley all that frightydighty about mean old barnett but right off hes telling us malleys antisocial covered his tracks that couldve been more than a diversion strategy i said attributing his own behavior to malley consciously or otherwise hes covered some tracks of his own the lies didnt start with his seminary application the image he pushes is fun guy with a sensitive spiritual side while you were ordering he told me he was a wellbehaved kid brought up in the church be interesting to know what his childhood was really like he stashed the bags in the case time for some serious digging be nice if its more productive than my research on malley cant find any insurance policies on lara or kristal the cowboy seems to be using his real name and social security number has no arrest record no military record no real estate ownership i was able to trace his birth records to alamogordo new mexico but the local law doesnt remember him and there are no malleys living there now maybe im missing something there are all these new computer tricks the department doesnt have he snatched his phone from the table punched in a number and asked for sue kramer two seconds later nancy drew its joe hardy listen i dont know what your schedules like but did it excellent listen sue all those things you private hotshots can do that i cant the hightech stuff yeah exactly i need a couple guys looked into him and also the spiritual adviser daney lets just say hes become interesting the usual and anything else you can think of sooners better than later ill pay you personally no no send me a full bill i mean it sue okay fine but send something thanks have a nice day hope the winds are good clicking off he said her bh surveillance just ended she spotted the korean widow going into the apartment found the lady praying at some kind of shrine crying how much she loved hubby whyd he have to go kill himself so the suicide stands and suell start digging tomorrow when she gets back from a little r and r the winds i said sailing thinking about his brief fling as a pi during a suspension from lapd the rise in income the plague of tedium when the department took him back he had raced home like a trained pigeon sailing on her new boat he said over the bounding main ever miss private enterprise the lack of red tape and paramilitary rigidity the chance to make serious money why the hell would i miss that he stared at his phone clicked it shut that comment daney made about my sounding pretty confident what was that a taunt or fishing for information or both i said he was clearly fishing when he steered the conversation to the topic of pay booths your line about being able to trace pay calls made his eyes jump yeah i noticed that rand called me from a pay booth but daney would have no way of knowing that unless he was there his eyes compressed to surgical incisions daney was with rand the day he died or nearby watching rand make the call i said which got me thinking what if he made up the story about the black truck to divert attention from the fact that it was him not barnett who followed rand cherish told us he wasnt home that afternoon off at one of his nonprofit gigs he passed his phone from hand to hand tapped the table rubbed his face finally he said daney did rand not malley the only reason we focused on malley is because daney pointed us in that direction that and malleys motherinlaw said he was a scumbag dope dealer who was rough on lara a scumbag dope dealer with no arrest record or known aliases who uses his own social security number i said who registers his guns legally in a sense nina balquin was a character reference for malley she hates his guts but shes never suspected him of murdering lara he slipped the phone in his pocket ungloved and grabbed a bear claw and chewed spewing crumbs theres still the eye color issue malley had to know he wasnt kristals daddy maybe daneys right about him being too unsophisticated to figure it out but even if he did know unless we find something psychopathic in his background its a long stretch to killing a toddler unlike daney who we know to be an extremely bad boy i nodded its also possible malley knew about kristals paternity and didnt care he put down the bear claw guy has no problem raising someone elses kid thats a stretch of another kind the malleys had fertility problems for years lara eventually got pregnant but what if the fertility problem was barnetts and he came to accept the idea of a surrogate he let some other guy go to stud with lara or lara slept with someone and got pregnant and barnett accepted it if balquins dope suspicions are ontarget lara and barnett couldve gotten into some alternative behaviors promiscuity swinger parties or just plain old infidelity she gets knocked up at an orgy and barnett says keep it thats pretty damn tolerant alex youre probably right but in any event now that we know the truth about daneys character we cant ignore him for rand he hasnt been directing us to malley out of civic obligation he gave the bear claw another try grimaced and put it aside i drank coffee it sloshed in my stomach burned like drain cleaner when my thoughts uncoiled daney fed us another tidbit he shouldnt know about malley riding the rodeo he claims sydney weider told him and maybe she did but i read all the court documents and it never came up in fact my sense was weider wasnt paying any sort of attention to the malleys daneys playing us milo and screwing up in typical psychopath fashion because hes too clever for his own good daney did rand he said looking off into the distance no reason why it doesnt fit something else whether or not the boys knew lara or barnett is an open question but one of them sure knew daney troy was a budding psychopath daneys the fullydeveloped version put them together and theres no question whod pull the strings daney got troy to do kristal and now hell help you solve the case man he said you are full of evil thoughts so ive been told he said guess its like those firebugs who return to the scene and rescue people or one of those munchausen mommies racing to resuscitate their kids it fits daneys act i said image is important to him outwardly hes a man of faith a tireless youth worker caretaker of downtrodden teens while you were ordering he spun off a bunch of psychobabble told me he and cherish chose adolescents to foster because no one else wanted them if i didnt know better id have bought it meanwhile hes cheating the government seducing minors and impregnating them intentionally getting off on having the pregnancies terminated and trying to snag a share of the fees what a prince at least when the dna match comes through weve got him for kiddie rape on valerie quezada he shook his head one reinterview and hes our new hitler what does that say for cherishs guilt or innocence dont know their relationships a big question mark i can buy daney as a scumbag he said but speaking of questions marks what was his motive to have kristal murdered kristal survived i said survived what survived period daney has a thing about his progeny living and breathing daney was kristals daddy whered that come from more of the ugly in here i tapped my forehead think about it daneys kick is playing god generating life and terminating it we know his sexual exploits went beyond teenage wards sydney weider why not other married women and why not play the pregnancy game with them too your remark about a prenatal serial killer was ontarget and serials need increasing amounts of stimulation from fetus to fullterm victim he said there are mothers like that i said get pregnant repeatedly but cant tolerate parenthood fathers too how many cases have we heard where the boyfriend or daddy shook the baby too hard we always assume its an impulsive thing poor anger control but maybe not it sure happens with primates chimp moms defend their babies from aggressive daddies all the time i create i destroy except that seducing vulnerable teens is one thing alex getting a married woman pregnant means a whole lot of carelessness on all accounts hole in the condom or some other trick beth scoggins thinks daney drugged her maybe he did that routinely and in a sense married women would be easier targets than teenage girls because convincing them to terminate would be a cinch until daney met up with a married woman who resisted because shed been yearning to have a baby for a long time lara he said daneys got brown eyes hed like us to think hes mr observant but he didnt chance upon the genetic angle and now hes throwing it in my face with all that phony reluctance oh man i reached over and tapped his attaché case long as youre at it id suggest a few other dna tests we took the to the south headed for the mission street exit milo drove way too fast seemed distracted if malleys innocent why wouldnt he talk to me the system failed him hes a burnout i dont know the same logic could be twisted in his favor if he was hiding something would he want to get you suspicious i guess he said but im still not comfortable dropping him even if daney does turn out to be kristals daddy hey i said an open minds a terrible thing to waste he laughed gripped the wheel and fed more gas glanced back at the case on the backseat all of a sudden therere all these possibilities i have a confession if daney did everything you think he did i have encountered a level of bad that creeps me out so youre human only on alternate days he took another look back at the case the unmarked stayed in lane either way he said the motive for rands the same covering up the truth about kristal but theres still the problem of how rand found out and the fact that kristal was nearly two talk about your lateterm abortion if daney has this psycho lust to destroy his own sperm why would he wait that long maybe he kept working on lara to terminate she got angry refused broke off their relationship daney had to step aside but he couldnt accept losing he kept fantasizing plotting found a thirteenyearold he could hire to kill lara shopping at the mall the boys hanging at the arcade another possibility i said is that laras relationship with barnett grew progressively rockier and she decided to leave him because she had her own fantasies hooking ol drew the guy whod come through biologically but putting pressure on drew wouldve been a fatal error he puts a hit on the kid does lara too or she really was a suicide she had an inkling of why kristal had been killed couldnt come forward because it would have implicated her her depression deepened and she killed herself headshot in a car he said same as rand to me that says they were both murdered by the same person or whoever shot rand imitated laras suicide he knuckled his temple made an abrupt lane change put on more speed daneys character notwithstanding malleys the one with the guns and it was one of those that killed lara and hes also got a thing for other guys wives he slapped the dashboard how bout this for a screenplay the malleys werent the only ones swinging they met drew and cherish at a swap party drew and lara parted ways but malley and cherish are still doing it i considered that it might help explain barnett accepting laras pregnancy if it was the product of a group scene the threat would be depersonalized it takes a village he said whatever the case no way im scratching the cowboy off my list we parked in the coroners lot and entered the north building milo talked to dave oreilly a thin redfaced whitehaired man with a keen searching intellect and asked for kristal malleys tissue samples and valerie quezadas aborted fetus you just dropped quezada off said oreilly something come up you dont want to know im sure i dont okay ill call down and have them put it in a refrigerator bag and a styrofoam biohazard box all official said milo i like that i like tall skinny brunettes with big natural boobs we returned to the car milo put the box in the trunk along with the attaché case and started up the engine a white coroners van pulled around from the back of the building and cruised through the lot before turning toward mission he said wonder what police work was like in the rubber hose days you and daney alone in a room me and anyone i damn well want alone in a room he bared his teeth think daney was telling the truth about knowing weider before the murder why would he lie puffing up his chest more heroofthestory crap he said making like hes got bigtime contacts at the pd masterminded the whole defense easy enough to check out i said and if he was telling the truth about working with innercity teens id be interested in one particular delinquent other than troy nestor almedeira and the dedicated lawyer who stood up for his rights not that easy to check out we sat in the coroners lot and milo phoned the public defenders office several transfers later he ended up with a supervisor i watched as amiability morphed to wheedling then deteriorated to veiled threats he hung up growling all i want is what would be in a normal court record if nestor wasnt a juvenile and the file wasnt sealed i can get it eventually if i fool around long enough at the hall of records but its gonna take time stonewalling bastards they hate cops and everything else thats good and true try lauritz montez i said he likes cops hes vulnerable and weakwilled the call to montezs beverly hills office was answered by a tape i took the phone punched and asked for the number of dr changs dental office on alvarado theres nothing more effective with a doctors staff than having a doctorate i had anita moss on the line within seconds how may i help you doctor ms moss i was with detective sturgis the other day with him youre not a cop im a psychologist i consult to the police im sorry im busy just one question and ill be out of your way which attorney represented nestor on the manslaughter charge why it could be important well find out anyway but you could make things easier okay okay a blond lady she said with a funny name sydney something sydney weider she put a lot of pressure on my mom to attend every hearing even though my mom wasnt in good health she ordered her to sit where the judge could see her and cry a lot told my mom shed have to take the stand when it came time for nestor to be sentenced and lie about what a good son nestor was and then cry a whole bunch more coaching her as if mom was stupid as if mom wasnt crying all the time anyway she put on an aggressive defense i guess she said i always felt she was doing it more for herself to win you know if she cared about my mother she wouldnt have bossed her around like that it didnt matter anyway nestor was guilty they did this pleabargain thing which was okay with me i didnt want my mom to have to cry for strangers was a man named drew daney involved with nestors case it sounds familiar but a divinity student and youth worker oh yeah him the church guy she said a few months before nestor killed that dealer he got sent to some drug rehab program and the church guy worked there did he do something wrong cause that would surprise me why him i liked he seemed real sincere about wanting to help nestor wrote a letter to the judge for nestor puts everything in place doesnt it said milo driving out of the lot daney visits troy in stockton i said uses the opportunity to drop in on nestor and set troy up meanwhile rands over in chino think thats the reason daney left him alone no juvey hit man planted there more likely rand wasnt a threat until he was he got back on the freeway you in the mood to ply your trade with who a crazy woman chapter sydney weider opened her front door wearing a soiled white tshirt with a surfside country club flying dolphin logo over her left breast gray stretch athletic shorts and bare feet up close her face was pallid scored vertically by wrinkles that began at the corners of her eyes and tugged her mouth down her legs were white varicosed her feet hangnailed and grubby around the ankles she opened her mouth in surprise milo said maam and showed her his badge she slapped him hard across the face as he hauled her out to the unmarked cuffed her hissing and twisting a snick sounded from across the street and a woman ran out of a pretty blackshuttered colonial same neighbor whod watched weider scream at me a few days ago here we go muttered milo wheres the damned video camera weider growled and slammed her head into his arm and tried to bite him he held her at arms length open the door alex as i did the woman from across the street sped toward us late thirties blond ponytail shapely in tight black pedal pushers and a seagreen tank top grace kelly facial definition sydney weider in a younger happier time she looked furious lets hear it for neighborhood watch as she got closer milo said maam good for you she said that bitch screams at all the children and terrifies them she makes everyones lives miserable whatd she do to finally get you to take some action sydney weider spat in her direction the gob landed on the sidewalk the woman said youre disgusting as always before weider could respond milo pressed down on her head managed to get her into the car and slammed the door his face was flushed whatd she finally do the woman repeated you people said there was nothing you could cant discuss that maam now if youd please thump thump thump as weider kicked the window the ponytailed woman said see shes insane ive got a list for you give me your fax number shes been that big of a problem i said everyone will rejoice when shes gone well have a frickin block party a child touches her lawn she steps out and screams at the top of her lungs last month she threw a kitchen knife at poppy and poppys not one of those aggressive sharpeis hes sweet as can be ask anyone theyll tell you she runs up and down the street talks like a banshee shes insane believe me totally insane im sure everyone on the block will be happy to give you a report or a deposition or whatever milo said appreciate it maam good riddance said the woman glaring through the window sydney weider lay on her back feet up she began kicking the window again barefoot but hard enough to make the glass shudder the woman said you should hogtie her like on cops as we drove away other doors opened but no one emerged sydney weider screamed wordlessly and resumed kicking the window milo stopped the car parked retrieved a set of plastic ties from the trunk and defended himself against weiders gnashing jaws and vicious feet as he fought to bind her ankles i got out and held weiders heels yet another divergence from accepted psychological practice finally he managed to flip her on her stomach pull the ties snug she writhed and foamed at the mouth and butted her head against the door as the car pulled away pottymouth tirade all those years in law school spent parsing and composing elegant phrases wasted i felt sorry for her when milo reached sunset she turned silent panting then snuffling filled the car i glanced back still flat on her belly eyes closed inert i figured hed take her to the jail at the westside station but he drove east through the palisades and turned in to will rogers state park a littlegirl voice from the back said i used to ride horses here good for you said milo moments later what did i do to make you so angry how about assaulting an officer oh she said im sorry i really am i dont know what happened i just you scared me i thought you were sent by my husband to torment me one of those process servers he wont let go one halloween he sent a process server dressed up as a goblin and i opened the door for trick or treat and this goblin threw court papers at me and when i threw them back he grabbed me made contact with my arm that was real assault believe me much worse than what i did im an attorney i know what assault is when i see it listen i really didnt mean to hit you i was defending myself you really scared me no pause for breath the neighbor had talked about weiders racing up and down the block i remembered her as a fast talker and marty boestling had called her manic the only marathon was in her head really she said i know now what i did i see it clearly and im so so so so sorry we parked in the nearly empty lot that faced the polo fields no horses anymore everything goes to shit in this city please said sydney weider just take off these things i hate to be restrained i really hate it milo switched off the engine please please i promise to behave appropriately why should i trust you sydney because im an honest person i know i acted irrationally but i already explained that to you its my ex he never stops he wont give up making my life a living hell how longs he been doing that i said at least the foot thingies please they hurt theyre bending my legs in a notgood way im constricted its hard to breathe milo got out and undid the plastic ties sat her up careful to maintain distance from her teeth weider smiled and flipped her hair and looked pretty for a pathetic second thank you thank you youre a doll thanks so much now how about the cuffs too milo returned to the front seat so how longs your ex been tormenting you always but what im talking about is since the divorce seven years seven long years of nonstop torture thats after he robbed me blind took everything my father left me my father was a film producer one of the top guys in hollywood and that bastard knew where everything was kept he looted me looted me like something from the watts riot we used to have a house cars angelo donghia furniture sarouk rugs you name it we had a great life on the surface how come mr boestlings so angry what do you think hes a jew said weider vengeful eye for an eye they dont let go until youre sucked dry whats he want revenge for for my being superior for my being its complicated hell never be happy hes consumed about what about making me pay and pay and pay for those people its all about money he libels me tells everyone im crazy manicdepressive just because my energys superior to his he could never she stopped abruptly you the psychologist you can tell im fine her eyes were bright with madness i said sure milos eyelids vibrated the mark weider had left on his cheek had started to fade she smiled again there you go you know about that kind of thing you tell this very kind police individual im an attorney a wife a mother did it all raised two beautiful boys you should see the deal microsoft offered them both of them but they didnt take it they have their own software to develop why should someone else get rich on their accomplishments i said despite all that marty boestlings being vengeful mindlessly vengeful hes a nothing maybe milo broke in finding you with drew daney wasnt a real fun experience for him weiders mouth hung open she sank back down you are blaming me for his inadequacies do you think if he could wait you talked to him are you really police are you from him a process ser no milo bellowed im an lapd lieutenant who couldnt give a rats ass about your marriage or your sex life i am interested in talking about drew daney weider twitched rolled her shoulder looked out at the polo field what about him what kind of guy is he what kind of guy is he scum pond scum the black stuff under pond scum you two have a lovers quarrel said milo ha hahahahaha there was no lover no love no lovemaking this was straight you know what he was nothing to me none of them were who dont pretend marty didnt tell you he told you did he also tell you he got it started he was the one who liked watching me with other guys it only became a problem when i started to act independently meaning when he wasnt watching did he tell you that did he like i said sydney your sex life doesnt inter right right you want to talk about daney all daney was to me was a male organ and not a big one at that you want to know about him ill tell you hes a loser and a liar thought he was so smart thought he could get me to play his game what game was that you tell me youre the lapd lieutenant why would anyone want to do anything so stupid you tell me that what was stupid sticking a pin in the condom i always used condoms always bought them myself because when men think with the little head theyre retarded and no way was i going to get messed up that way no way and i dont like the pill its supposed to be good for your skin but it messed up mine gave me adultonset acne and my mother died of cancer so who needs that so it was always rubbers slow spreading smile with tickly things howd you know daney poked holes in one found him thats how he sneaked off into the bathroom she said he thought i was dressing up in the tacky things he bought over at trashy lingerie costumes all that stupid cliché stuff like i was going to dress up for him ha no way so i was already out of my bathroom he was in martys bathroom and heard him messing around in there and walked in on him said what the hell do you think youre doing he made up some lame story about testing out a sample to see if it was strong to be extra careful i saw that i bitchslapped him she stopped milo said he got you mad wouldnt you be mad if there was someone sneaking around on you doing that weider laughed not that he was getting off the hook i opened a new one made sure it was fine and had him put it on in front of me made jokes about maybe i shouldve gotten a size small believe me that slowed things down fine with me i set the tone he never had me i had him did that end the relationship said milo what relationship he was a tool what ended it was marty being a loser screwing up a pitch meeting and coming home early and finding us not that i cared about marty it was the way he reacted daney just scurrying off with his you know what tucked between his legs she flipped her hair my motto no wimps no losers no complications howd daney react to your breaking it off called me kept calling me finally he gave up i said why do you think he punctured the condom you tell me youre the psychologist said weider could he have wanted to get you pregnant no because he didnt like kids he told you that sure more than once he said his wife wanted them she couldnt have them he said no way he didnt want the hassle he confided in you he talked about everything i couldnt get him to shut up whatd he do anyway you never asked him to explain why hed tried to puncture the condom i told you he gave me that stupid story and i hit him upside the head i didnt care what his story was the main thing was do things my way another hair flip i dont think it was pregnancy per se i think it was sperm pardon sperm he thought his was the elixir of the gods hed go off on these long speeches about his youknowwhat and how it was the magic wand of the future you could create cities countries continents with a teaspoon hed get like that after he had his glorious three minutes all he wanted to do afterward was raid my refrigerator and blab magic sperm said milo he was really into it really weird obsessive whats that other word fixated thats a psychological term right thats what you guys call it fixated i nodded milo said daney had a sperm fixation want to know what i think about daney i think he was a fixation sperm egomaniac everything about him was so so important he even started thinking he was an attorney thought he could tell me how to run my case believe me that didnt last long i put him in his place i said the malley case he watched too many movies had all these ideas these bad tv movie ideas like crossexamine the cops until they wore themselves out or shift the blame to the kids father so thered be reasonable doubt i said shutup this isnt perry mason the little bastards were caught with the body they admitted they did it ill get the best deal for them but theyre going away and thats what happened daney wanted to blame barnett malley he said i should dig into malleys background and find out if malley and the mother were getting along and if there was some sort of conflict i could suggest malley hated the wife and the kid hired those two little bastards to kill the kid i said youre insane thats the stupidest thing i ever heard of he said not if troy backs it up i could talk to troy troy trusts me troy would say anything i tell him to because we have rapport daney knew troy that well he knew him from working as a youth worker thats a laugh a youth leader who doesnt like kids he kept trying to convince me with his stupid story finally i threatened to stop sleeping with him told him what youre asking me to do is suborn perjury you idiot the facts are clear the best we can hope for is extenuating circumstances rough childhood abuse neglect all that if you can find me some abuse some real abuse ill go to the damned judge with that but otherwise stay out of it can you take off these cuffs milo said going to behave havent i you havent had much choice sydney even without cuffs whats my choice youre three times my size in your arms im a little girl hair flip milo said one screwup and they go back on fine i get it youre the boss the man you call the shots he made another trip to the backseat sydney weider said ahh its like joni mitchell said you dont know what you got till its gone so why all these questions about daney he finally do something real stupid milo walked around the car got in back and sat next to her as opposed to smalltime stupid exactly he was always smalltime stupid how exactly did you meet him another case she said another little psychopath daney doing his youth work bullshit he calls offers to help any way he can i figured why not maybe he could put a letter in the kids file for sentencing same thing he did for troy i said thats the way it is at the pd ninetyfive percent of what we did was process guilty people and angle for the best deal remember the name of the other little psychopath some latin junkie he shot some other junkies downtown i got it pled down to manslaughter nestor something almodovar thats it nestor almodovar milo didnt correct her daney wrote a letter for nestor your basic character reference nestor was a good kid rough childhood extenuating circumstances blah blah blah and daney just happened to be working on another of your cases no no no said weider daney called me asked me to defend troy at first i didnt want to do it because believe me i was putting in the hours who needed the hassle but he kept working on me telling me i was the smartest dpd in the office which happened to be true then i figured why not it could be interesting how so i said interesting weider repeated then she stared at me went silent twisted her mouth nonstop as if compensating for the lack of sound milo said interesting as in highprofile as in getting your name in the paper weider turned toward him why shouldnt i get some of the good ones you put in the hours why not get a little coverage and a movie deal said milo weider did the openshut thing with her mouth again more panting more lip acrobatics she snapped her head away from milo and stared out the window that was after the case resolved nothing illegal about that it happens all the time was the movie your idea or daneys his she said too quickly he used to say look at marty such a total loser but hes driving a mercedes and lunching at the studio commissary even though with all that opportunity he still couldnt produce anything better than grade c madefortv crap daney figured he could do bet he figured if he had martys opportunities hed own a studio delusions of grandeur said milo doesnt stop anyone else in hollywood said weider i could tell you stories besides i knew why he was talking himself up like that why smug smile to get himself hard thats what hed do when he had problems hed talk himself up and put marty down thats what its all about for men outdicking the other guy still i said you took the movie idea seriously what do you mean didnt you and daney take meetings everyone takes meetings you stop taking meetings the industry shrivels up like daneys youknowwhat when he got nervous everyone takes meetings but so did you yeah i went i took it as seriously as anything else why not what was there to lose do you guys have anything to drink im really thirsty sorry no said milo damn im parched thats why i hate her head dropped staring at her legs what do you hate pills dope poison i refuse to take anything to hell with stupid doctors the best thing for stress is activity work off the toxins speaking of which im starting to feel really confined could we walk a little take a little stroll milo said who set up the meetings i did daney tagged along thinking he was smooth not marty marty gave us some names big deal i already knew them from my father he had a rolodex to die for dont listen to anything marty tells you hes nuts do you have a copy of the treatment i said no why would i ever register it with the writers guild no why would i isnt that basic procedure if you care she said i lost interest after a couple of meetings you could tell from the reaction it was going nowhere fast thats the way it is in the industry youre instahot or instanot stupid mistake my one mistake what was that letting daney write it he put in the same old crap hed wanted me to use with troy blaming barnett malley i said blaming barnett malley but kicking it up to an absurd level now malley was some kind of serial killer obsessed with power and control and body parts sounds a bit like daney himself i said hey she said merrily you must be some kind of shrink chapter milo said ill take you home sydney im still thirsty could we stop somewhere if i pass a place ill get you a coke how about joya juice theres one near my house as we left the park she turned silent and fidgety i said what was your impression of cherish daney drew said she was a real religious type wanted kids a whole bunch of them a brood was the term he used but she couldnt have any she was sterile it was an issue not having kids adoption she finally accepted she couldnt have her own decided she wanted to adopt was really obsessed with adopting even a kid from china bulgaria bolivia one of those places he didnt want it didnt want the commitment i said what about foster kids that way she gets to play mama then they leave and youre off the hook and you get paid drew like the idea of fostering he loved it said brilliant syd youre a genius thats what he called me syd extremely irritating big burr in the saddle but he kept doing it a real loser when we get to joya id like something with pineapple in it okay she directed him to the juice bar just north of sunset in palisades village he left her cuffed and went inside women who looked like weider were all around she sank down and lay flat on the rear seat i asked her about barnett malley but she claimed to know nothing about him no impressions why would i he was the other side daneys theories never got you curious that was bullshit what about malley riding the rodeo what are you talking about milo returned with a giant cup and a straw she sat up and said take off the cuffs i need to hold it he leaned into the car and held the straw to her mouth she said oh cmon but drank greedily cheeks deflating when she stopped for a breath a speck of froth remained on her lower lip milo wiped it off she looked up at him with fear please let me hold it no more problems i promise really gonna avoid issues with the neighbors she smiled what do you care about that youre a bigissue guy its daney youre after obviously hes done something serious but i dont even care what no curiosity i dont live in the past the past is like a dead body just keeps rotting and stinking may i have another sip please and can you please take off the damned cuffs you and drew dont talk anymore hoarse laugh havent talked to that loser in seven years what do you think im going to call him tell him you were here thatll be the day if he ever tried to get near me id cut off his youknowwhat bet you would said milo he freed her hands and handed her the cup she sipped remained docile and silent during the ride back to her house when we got there milo helped her out of the car she stood looking at her front door as if shed never seen it before milo took her by the elbow and walked her up the drive halfway there he hung back she stopped flipped hair flashed teeth said something that made him smile stood on her tiptoes and pecked his cheek he watched as she walked to her door stood there as she crossed the threshold returned shaking his head i said what was the joke the oh that she said youre sending me off like a little birdie out of the nest chirp chirp chirp he jammed the key in the ignition it caught me off guard for a second she seemed kinda cute he frowned that kiss i need to wash my face a block later he said shes completely nuts but everything she told us fits what do you think of daneys spermobsession all part of his meobsession what interests me is that right from the beginning daney wanted to focus blame on malley why would that be unless he knew malley before kristals murder and had some reason to resent him i brought up the rodeo to weider and she looked at me as if i was crazy so daney lied about hearing it from her he knew barnett eight years ago or did research maybe the swingers scene like you suggested or a tamer possibility i said now that we know weve got two couples with infertility problems a clinic he said they met at a damned fertility clinic weider said cherish had finally given up on having her own children that implies she had tried to conceive for a while that had to include medical treatment chatting in the waiting room the old misery loves company bit until drew and lara took the friendship a step further i said the two spouses who just happened to be fertile its possible neither of them knew that and laras pregnancy caught them by surprise drew had to figure shed terminate because of the repercussions with barnett but she refused having a baby meant more to her than her marriage all of a sudden the malleys are having a baby and the daneys arent leaving cherish with a whole lot of frustration and anguish three guesses who shed vent to she gets on drews case pushes for more fertility treatment which would be expensive and a monumental hassle for something drew didnt want in the first place either he agreed and it didnt work or he refused in either case cherish switched her goal to adoption became obsessed with it idiot thinks hes the cleverest guy in the world and all of a sudden his lifes getting knotted up because of a problem he helped create talk about insult added to injury so he decided to eliminate the source of the insult i said turned kristal into an object lesson for cherish see the joy babies bring hon at the same time he was able to play out his god fantasy and free himself of any future demands from lara and as long as he was cleaning house why not get a movie deal out of it he hunched and scowled and gripped the wheel as relaxed as a student driver salt air blew through the cars open windows charming neighborhood how long before sydney weider imploded milo said cleaning house permanently kristal then troy because he killed kristal then nestor because he killed troy and lara either because she wanted to get serious with him or she had figured out he had something to do with kristals death jane hannabee too because daney couldnt be certain troy hadnt said something to his mother and now rand think drew did any of them himself or were they contract deals whoever did lara did rand my moneys on daney for those hannabee couldve gone either way six bodies he said and theres something i neglected to mention i checked for any mirandas on daneys foster list nothing close why would daney take in a ward and not bill the state why indeed oh i said now how the hell am i going to prove any of it with no evidentiary connections i had no answer yeah he grumbled i was afraid youd say that he dropped me home at oneforty pm allison hadnt called my cell and there were no messages on my machine in five minutes shed be between patients i watched the clock had a cold cup of coffee phoned her office when the big hand touched the nine hi she said im in the middle of something promise to call as soon as i can emergency something like that were okay silence sure it was seventhirty when i heard from her emergency resolved this morning beth scoggins went into a changing room at work and locked herself in it took awhile before anyone noticed when they found her she was sitting on the floor curled up sucking her thumb she was unresponsive had wet her pants the manager dialed and the ambulance took her to the u they gave her a physical and a tox scan then some psych residents tried out their interview skills on her finally she let someone know i was her therapist and an attending psychiatrist called me it was him i was talking to when you phoned i canceled my afternoon patients and went over there just got back to the office hows she doing still regressed but shes starting to talk about things she never talked about before more about daney or i cant get into it with you alex sure i said allison if i had anything to shes obviously been sitting on a mountain of issues a volcano i was probably too laidback shouldve worked harder at opening her up same thing nearly word for word that cherish daney had said about rand this was different allison was trained cherish had been running with scissors out of her element or maybe not my head flooded with whatifs i said im sure you handled it optimally that came out hollow whatever listen ive got to phone all those cancellations rearrange my schedule extend my hours then go back to the hospital its going to be awhile before we can socialize dont even suggest to milo that hell ever have access to this girl its not an issue i know whats at stake alex but were on opposite sides on this one im sorry but thats the way it has to be three hours later she was at my door dangling her car keys her hair was tied up in a careless way id never seen before black as the night sky behind her one of her stockings sported a run from knee to midcalf the polish on some of her nails was chipped and her lipstick had faded a picture id badge was clipped to the lapel of her black cotton suit temporary privileges department of psychiatry her eyes always deepset were captives in fatiguedarkened sockets she said i havent meant to be distant though i still have problems big problems with the whole deception thing have any dinner yet not hungry cmon in she shook her head too tired alex i just wanted to say that come in anyway her chin trembled im exhausted alex wont be good company i touched her shoulder she edged past me as if i were an obstacle i followed her into the kitchen where she tossed the keys and her purse on the table and sat staring at the sink she refused food but accepted hot tea i brought a mug with some toast persistent she said so ive been told i took a chair across from her its ridiculous she said ive had patients go through worse than this a lot worse i think its a combination of this particular patient maybe i let the countertransference get out of hand and your being involved she raised the mug to her lips when i met you what you do it turned me on the whole police thing the whole heroic thing here was someone in my profession doing more than sitting in an office and listening i never told you this but ive had hero fantasies of my own probably because of what happened to me i guess ive been living through you on top of that youre a sexy guy no question i was a sucker what had happened to her was sexual assault at age seventeen warding off attempted robbery and gang rape years later she eyed her purse and i knew she was thinking about the shiny little gun what you do still turns me on but this has been a rude awakening im realizing that maybe there are aspects of it that arent healthy like deception and holding down a womans ankles so a detective can hogtie her her eyes turned the color of gas jets you flatout lied to her alex a girl you didnt know with no consideration of the risks im sure most of the time its no big deal just a fib in the service of law enforcement and no one gets hurt this time maybe in the long run it will be good for her but now she put the mug down i keep telling myself if she was this close to the edge she wouldve been tipped over eventually maybe its my ego thats wounded i got caught unawares i touched her hand she didnt touch back deceptions okay for milo i understand the kind of people cops come into contact with but you and i took the same licensing exam and we both know what our ethics code says she freed her hand have you thought it through alex i have and im not sure my answers going to make you happy try me when i see patients in a therapeutic setting the rules apply when i work with milo the rules are different different how id never hurt anyone intentionally but theres no promise of confidentiality or truthfulness i didnt answer no sense mentioning the man i killed a few years ago clear selfdefense sometimes his face came to me in dreams sometimes i manufactured the faces of his unborn children i dont mean to attack you said allison i dont feel attacked its a reasonable discussion maybe one we shouldve had earlier maybe she said so basically you compartmentalize that doesnt wear on you i deal with it because bad people sometimes get whats coming to them that helps i worked hard at keeping my tone even saying the right things though i did feel attacked thinking about six bodies maybe seven no obvious solution thinking about cherish daney in a way that i couldnt let go of allison said is deception a big part of what you do no i said but it happens i try never to grow glib but i rationalize when i have to im sorry about what happened to beth and im not going to make excuses the only lie i told her was that i was researching foster parenting in general i dont see that as a factor in her breakdown getting into the whole issue precipitated her breakdown alex shes an extremely vulnerable girl who should never have been drawn into a police investigation in the first place there was no way to know that exactly thats why we learned about discretion and taking our time and thinking things through about doing no harm witnesses are often vulnerable i said long silence she said so youre fine with all this would i have approached beth directly if id known she was going to decompensate of course not would i have taken another approach like going through you you bet because a lot is at stake even more than ive told you and she was a potential source of crucial information what more is at stake i shook my head why not she said theres no need for you to know youre mad so youre doing a tit for tat im not mad i want to keep you from the bad stuff the way i used to keep robin because i cant hope to understand i thought you did but its too much ugly theres just no reason for you to get involved allison im already involved as a therapist so i just run off and do my therapy thing and keep my nose out of your business that would simplify things its one of the ugliest cases ive ever worked on ali you already spend your days soaking up other peoples crap why would you want more soul pollution and you what about your soul such as it is i wont accept that it doesnt affect you unborn children i didnt answer she said you can handle it but i cant i dont ask you about patients thats different maybe it really isnt fine she said so now theres a new taboo in our relationship what binds us together hot sex i pointed to the toast and haute cuisine she worked at a smile got up and took the mug to the sink where she emptied and washed id better be going stay why i walked behind her slipped my arm around her waist felt her abdominal muscles ripple as she tensed up she removed my hand turned and looked up at me ive probably put some kind of wedge between us maybe ill wake up tomorrow and feel like a firstclass idiot but right now ive still got some righteous indignation burning in my belly i said the higher stakes are six murders maybe seven if you include the girl who succeeded beth as daneys assistant she seems to have vanished and shes not on the foster rolls she stepped out of my arms braced herself against the counter and stared out the kitchen window plus a toddler i went on two teenage boys three women a mentally challenged young man and so far no way to prove any of it she lowered her head into the sink heaved and dryretched i tried to hold her as she shuddered sorry she whimpered pulling away splashing water on her face she dried it with her sleeve snatched up her purse and keys left the kitchen i caught up as she opened the front door youre exhausted stay ill take the couch her lips were parched and tiny blood spots freckled her cheeks petechiae from the strain of vomiting its a nice offer youre a nice man id like to be a good man her eyes shifted i need to be alone chapter ireturned to the kitchen chewed on the toast id made allison and thought about what had just happened tomorrow i might also wake up feeling rotten if i slept at all right now i was glad to be alone reunited with the possibilities that had flooded my head it was elevenfifteen i figured milo wouldnt be sleeping much either and if he had drifted off too damn bad what time is it he rasped cherish daney told me she tried to open rand up wished shed been more effective for his sake but what if she had another motive what if she found out what drew had done wanted rand to come forward about drews involvement in kristals murder he let out a couple of barking coughs cleared his throat good evening to you too whered all this come from youve been saying all along cherish had to know something maybe she had suspicions but was able to deny them until she finally came upon something blatant like what trophies someone with drews control obsession might very well keep some he got a kick out of sneaking around cherish a hidden cache would be great fun but arrogance leads to carelessness maybe he slipped up and left something for her to find or all those trips with assistants got her suspicious and she started to snoop around the house if shes anything but a monster herself finding hard evidence of drews crimes would horrify her shed also be scared on a selfish level if the truth ever came out she was sure to come under suspicion as an accomplice one way to deal with all that would be to come forward with evidence of her own and bail having rand corroborate drews involvement in kristals murder would be a big step in that direction daney molests and murders for years and shes little miss clueless until now nothing weve learned so far says she did anything worse than exceed the foster limit beth scoggins said she filled her days cooking cleaning and teaching my bet is she kept busy so as not to think not to mention seven grand a month for drew it was the money i said maybe for her too but she drives an old heap and lives simply plus you saw how she worked with valerie patient despite valeries resentment the dutiful hausfrau he said meanwhile drews out doing his sperm thing im still not convinced shes squeaky clean but fine lets run with it she wants rand to rat out drew does therapy with him then what she fails the most common errors unqualified therapists make are moving too fast and talking too much toss in cherishs anxiety and shed have come on way too strong she needed rand to see that drew had contracted troy to kill kristal whether or not he had she tried to plant it in his head it started during prison visits hinting around hoping to set off a spark in rands head rand was a submissive personality impressionable so perhaps he actually recalled something seeing drew talk to troy shortly before the murder an offhand comment by troy about drew or he thought he did because an adult mastermind would be welcome news for him reduce his own culpability im a good person im a good person because daney was behind it and troy was his henchman and i was in the wrong place at the right time cherish couldve even presented it to him that way if he bought it why didnt he open up eight years in jail being beaten and stabbed and left to fend for himself had taught him to be wary nevertheless the idea cherish planted took root and it terrified him hed be living under the roof of the devil whod ruined his life thats why he was so anxious when he was released to the daneys then whyd he go there in the first place he had no immediate alternatives no family no resources no grasp of what the world outside prison was like he also had to be careful not to set off drews suspicions with a sudden shift in plans but ill bet he intended to get out of there as soon as possible as soon as he could get someone to listen you cherishs eagerness could have made him even more wary lauritz montez had defended him by the numbers he sure wouldnt view the da or the police as sympathetic that left me modesty modesty he said so he gives the daneys a phony story walks away somehow makes it over the hill calls you from westwood i dont think he made it over the hill alone he couldnt keep his anxiety under control and drew did catch on that something was wrong drew was out of the house when rand left he couldve been nearby watching rand or he called in and cherish told him rand had gone to the construction site that fed drews suspicions because he knew the site was closed saturday except for cleanup he went after rand spotted him picked him up in the jeep and took him into the city why to allay rands fears i said rands shuffling along disoriented looking for a pay phone or just trying to clear his head daney cruises by all smiles says hop in lets grab a bite caught off guard rand wouldve felt forced to comply so as not to appear nervous daney drove over the hill and disarmed rand further with small talk dropped him off at the entrance to westside pavilion with some pocket change told him to have a good time hed pick him up later no one from the mall remembers rand he may never have gone in this was a dull confused kid whod grown up behind bars it would have been like dropping him on mars why would daney go to all that trouble why not drive him somewhere secluded and kill him right off daney had his suspicions but at that point daney wasnt sure killing rand was necessary another kristalrelated death might set off a whole chain of events he couldnt control which is exactly what happened after he dropped rand off he stuck around to watch saw rand walk away from the mall watched him head for the phone booth rand was agitated when he called me his body language wouldve been easy to read when rand left the booth drew went after his quarry picking him up again he said this time it would have to be at gunpoint rand wouldnt have gone willingly drews deviousness cant be discounted i can see him using a phony story cherish had suddenly taken ill they needed to get home fast maybe rand figured that if he didnt show up at the pizza place id sound some kind of alarm and someone would come to his aid if so hed overestimated me milo said okay one way or the other he gets back in the jeep and drew drives somewhere secluded the dump site says it was probably up into the foothills of bel air rand not knowing the city doesnt catch on that drews taken a detour drew finds a spot pulls over then what rand was big and strong so drew needed to avoid a physical struggle by keeping it friendly hed prepared by opening the jeeps passenger window came across calm paternal even spiritual rand was probably looking straight ahead scared and confused but fighting to maintain calm when drew pressed the gun against his temple and pulled the trigger drew had plenty of time to wipe down the jeep and look for the bullet then he cruised back to sunset after dark drove to the onramp made sure no one was watching and dumped the body the next day he probably washed the jeep but there still might be some kind of transfer blood powder residue tiny bone fragments good story alex great story makes perfect sense but clever plots dont earn warrants youve already got grounds for a warrant i said drews statutory rapes get the downtown juvey team interested toss the house include the jeep in the paperwork for that i need dna to prove what daney did to valerie he said or one of the other girls coming forward you saw him with valerie at the clinic i saw him waiting and picking her up its suggestive but not probative any progress on beth scoggins no just like that just like that allisons adamant lets leave it at just like that i said silence any other suggestions isolate cherish and talk to her dont mention the murders right off tell her you know about valeries abortion and that you suspect drew was the father she might be willing to acknowledge her suspicions about the molestations or even go all the way and talk about kristal if shes so intent upon clearing herself why didnt she come forward after rand was murdered like rand shes living under the same roof with drew maybe shes worried she doesnt have enough evidence to ensure hed be put away makes sense he said but weve left something out cherish and malley if hes her squeeze why wouldnt she tell him and if she did why didnt he cooperate with me somethings still wrong with the picture alex im not ready to put barnett or cherish on the goodguy list we know what list drews on and hes living with eight underage girls then theres miranda i am not unaware of the exigencies didnt mean to imply you werent let me sleep on this so to speak in the morning ill get binchy to watch the daney house really early which aint gonna be a snap galton street being so quiet if cherish leaves first seanll follow her and hand her off to me if drew leaves seanll stay on him and ill pay cherish a little visit either way let me know you might very well be there chapter the doorbell followed by spirited knocking woke me at seven am my clouded brain knew what was happening allison had come by before work wanting to make up i stumbled out of bed padded to the door in my boxers flung it open with a welcoming smile milo stood there wearing a tired green blazer gray cords yellow shirt brown tie in one hand was a box of daffy donuts in the other two extralarge cups of the same outlets coffee he squinted at me as if i were a rare and unsavory species revenge i said for what last nights wakeup call huh oh that no i was just dozing in the chair stayed up till three working over a bunch of scenarios he stepped past me i left him in the kitchen and put on a robe when i returned the box was open revealing a jarringly vivid assortment of fried things milo s paw was wrapped around a coffee hed made admirable progress on a bear claw the size of a puppy same thing hed ingested during the second meeting with drew daney and i said so yeah i was inspired he said spewing crumbs give grease its due he pointed at the other cup drink and awaken lad daffy instead of dipsy my local purveyor indie outfit im doing my bit for free enterprise i sipped the coffee tasted copper and dishwater and something vaguely javalike fighting the urge to spit i said decide on any new scenarios no ive decided to go steady with the one you gifted me with cherish tried the shrink bit moved too fast scared the hell out of rand drew caught on he stuffed what was left of the bear claw in his mouth sugary lips twisted upward here i was thinking all that pacing you therapy folk do all those months of uh huhs and i hear yous was to keep the payment rolling in here i was thinking cops didnt always sacrifice their pancreases to sucrose i yawned are we off somewhere this morning or is there more to talk about were off when sean calls whens that i told him to start watching the house at seven and touch base hourly finish your coffee get cleaned up and dressed two out of three aint bad i said and left the cup on the table when i got back he was sprawled in the living room cell phone to his ear nodding and pumping his left leg thanks great really great snapping the phone shut he stood you still look halfasleep you dont i said whats fueling you the remote possibility that things could fall into place that was sue kramer god bless her she was up with the birds too following leads in other time zones if i were of the hetero persuasion id betroth her shes already married picky picky anyway she found out a few things about both our boys lets get going ill tell you in the car he asked me to drive and when i started up the seville his head dropped onto his chest as i took the glen toward the valley he snored with gusto at mulholland his head shot up and he began reciting as if thered been no lull the cowboy was born in alamogordo like i said moved to los alamos when he was ten because the ranch where his dad worked shut down and pops got a janitorial gig at the nuke lab the family lived there for ten years one sib an older sister married with kids works for the city of cleveland after high school barnett did a couple of years as truck driver then he got a job with santa fe pd he was a cop worked patrol for eighteen months until a couple of complaints about undue force brought him and the department to a mutual understanding he quit no prosecution he nodded after that there were some years when he reported no income as best as sue can tell he drifted around as a laborer he got on the dude ranch circuit ten years ago moved to california after he got married he switched to swimming pool maintenance other than a short temper with suspects when he was twentyone hes got nothing iffy in his background the surface impression seems to be all of it a taciturn loner whose life hasnt turned out so great as opposed to daney reason he was hard to trace is he changed his name he was born moore daney andruson is five years older than he claims on his drivers license grew up in rural arkansas one of seven kids at least three of whom have ended up in prison for violent crimes his folks were itinerant preachers on the hillbilly circuit the part about growing up in the church was true i said more like growing up in revival tents with reptiles his daddy was one of those rattlesnake handlers religious rapture supposed to protect him against venom until it didnt howd sue find all this out despite being a scumbag the name change was legal and daney has been reporting income with the irs on and off since he was eighteen his credit history as moore d andruson bottomed out twelve years ago lots of unpaid bills a couple of bankruptcies wonder why he bothered to file returns i said he didnt have much choice his early jobs were salaried required withholding ssi all that good stuff now that he bills the state theres different paperwork required what kind of jobs are we talking about guess youth work camp counselor substance abuse counselor substitute teacher sunday school teacher gym coach always in small towns he put bogus degrees on his applications and that eventually got him kicked out of three jobs in three different towns after that he tried suburbia drove a school bus for a girls preppie academy in richmond virginia what a surprise thats where he met cherish he was drew daney by then shed gotten a degree from bible college was teaching retarded kids at another school hes got no southern accent i said more reinvention his employers discovered his phony credentials after theyd hired him meaning they got suspicious about something else and checked him out no doubt but no ones being free with the details sue had to work just to get them to admit they knew him meaning they kept it inhouse anyone report the credentials scam nope they just sent him packing to his next victim so what else is new he said he did manage to acquire a police record but not the type that would get entered in ncic or any other national file indecent exposure pled down to a misdemeanor trespassing in vivian louisiana bad checks settled by reimbursement no jail time in keswick virginia sexual assault in carrol county georgia that one was dismissed sheriff said he knew andruson did it but the girl he was accused of seducing had cerebral palsy and could barely talk they figured she wouldnt make the grade as a witness wanted to spare her the ordeal moral of the story go for the vulnerable i asked sue to find what she could on that missing girl miranda gave her olivias number talk about your meeting of the minds out of his jacket pocket came tinny music no more beethoven some sort of latin beat he reached in and extricated his cell phone it kept tangoing as he checked the callers number he had reprogrammed the ring id thought it was mostly kids who did that sturgis yeah hi no theres no parking on the property im sure sean youre positive you didnt miss anything well that definitely complicates things hope not yeah yeah check all that out our etas fifteen twenty ill call you unless you learn something earthshattering click seans been in place since six fortyfive neither daneys jeep nor cherishs toyota are in sight ditto for malleys black truck the gates closed so he cant tell if anyones home no sight or sounds of any kids but hes a hundred feet up i told him to list the plates of any cars on the block and run them both gone separate cars i said maybe they went for doughnuts why dont you drive a little faster i sped over the canyon raced through morning traffic finally reached vanowen just after eight milo got back on the phone and asked binchy about the vehicle registrations no keep going no no hold on repeat that one interesting okay stay there until we show up thanks mucho lad something come up i said creamcolored cadillac deville parked right in front of the house he said and guess who pays the sticker fees the reverend dr crandall wascomb looked as if his faith had been tested and he wasnt sure hed passed he opened the gate within seconds of milo s pounding stepped back stunned dr delaware milo s badge made his shoulders drop not dismay relief police thank goodness cherish called you as well when did she call you sir said milo early this morning said wascomb just after six his white hair floated above his brow and he had dressed haphazardly heavy gray cardigan buttoned out of sequence so that it bunched midchest white shirt with one bent collar point maroon tie knotted well short of his neckline behind his blackframed glasses his eyes were watery and uncertain what did she want reverend she said she needed my help immediately mrs wascombs not well and i keep the phone in the hallway rather than at bedside so as not to wake her the ring got me up but at that hour i assumed it was a wrong number and didnt get out of bed when it rang again i answered and it was cherish apologizing for disturbing me she said something had come up implored me to come to her house as soon as i could i tried to get her to explain she said there was no time i simply needed to believe her hadnt she always been a faithful student wascomb blinked she had been i said was she distraught more like anxious but in an efficient way as if she was faced with a sudden challenge and was rising to the occasion i wondered if one of the children or drew had taken ill i asked her again what was wrong and she said shed tell me when i showed up if id come i said i would and went to get dressed mrs wascomb had stirred and i told her i was having one of my insomnia episodes she should go back to sleep i instructed the housekeeper to keep an eye on her got myself presentable and drove over his eyes compressed as they traveled from milo to me when i arrived the gate was open but no one was in the house the front door had been left unlocked so i assumed cherish wanted me to come straight in the house was empty i looked around came back out i was growing quite alarmed then a young woman came out of there he cocked his head toward the pair of outbuildings converted garage painted pale blue to match the house off to the side the oddlooking cement block cube the door to the cube was ajar i left it open so the girls wouldnt feel confined said wascomb theres only one window and its bolted shut two of them were in that other building the blue one but i assembled them all in one place until help arrived have you called for help said milo i was thinking about who to call when you arrived there doesnt seem to be any crisis other than cherish and drew not being here another look at the block structure none of them appear to know whats going on but perhaps she didnt want to worry them them being the kids yes the flock the flock thats how cherish referred to them in the instructions what instructions oh dear said wascomb im getting ahead of myself this has all been so from a pocket of the cardigan he pulled two sheets of paper folded to postcard size milo unfolded them read jutted his lower jaw whered you find this sir when i looked around the house i peeked into the bedroom and saw it on the desk wascomb licked his lips i noticed it because it lay in the center of the desk atop a piece of blotting paper as if she wanted me to see it was it folded no flat it really seemed as if shed intended for me to read it anything else on the desk pens pencils said wascomb and a strongbox the type banks use for safety deposit that of course i didnt touch milo handed the papers to me two pages of neat forwardslanting cursive the flock instructions for daily care patricia lactosesensitive soy milk in the fridge needs special help with reading and penmanship gloria ritalin mg before breakfast mg before dinner selfesteem issues doing well in all remedial areas but needs a lot of explicit verbal encouragement amber ritalin mg before breakfast mg before dinner allegra mg as needed for hay fever penicillin allergy shellfish allergy doesnt like meat but should be encouraged to eat some chicken math reading penmanship milo said looks like shes been preparing to be gone for a while wascomb said cherish was always an organized student if she did leave for an extended period im sure her reason was sound such as i couldnt tell you lieutenant but i do have the utmost respect for her as opposed to drew wascombs jaw set im sure the doctor has told you of our problems with drew hes gone too said milo they are husband and wife you think they left together i dont know what to think sir said wascomb when cherish called she mentioned nothing about going away reverend no is it lieutenant no she didnt lieutenant i fully expected her to be here when i arrived if cherish didnt call you sir may i ask why youre here protecting and serving reverend i see said wascomb will you be needing me any further id be happy to pledge fulton s support for the children in the short term however could you stick around a bit said milo show me that strongbox its right on the desk lieutenant i should be getting back to mrs wascomb milo s hand alit on wascombs sleeve stay for a short while reverend wascomb smoothed down his hair to no effect of course appreciate it sir now lets tend to the flock the interior of the cube was twelve feet square with a red cement floor and block walls painted a pinkish beige three woodframe double bunks were set up against the sidewalls two on the left one on the right a white fiberglass booth in the far righthand corner was labeled toilet flower stickers decorated the door a sliver of wall space hosted three doubledecker dented metal lockers an la unified school district surplus sticker was at the bottom of one practice spontaneous acts of kindness on another the solitary window was set into the back wall screened and bolted the pane was wide enough to let in a funnel of diffuse dusty light animalprint curtains had been parted the view was the rear wall of the property and the black tar roofline of a neighbors garage beneath the windowsill sat a squat sixdrawer chest stuffed animals shared the top with tubes and bottles and jars of cosmetics off to the side a stack of bibles eight girls sat on the three bottom bunks wearing pastelcolored pajamas and fluffy white socks eight pairs of teenage eyes took us in narrow agerange my guess was fifteen to seventeen six hispanic girls one black one white the room smelled of hormones and chewing gum and face cream valerie quezada sat at the front of the rear lefthand bunk fidgeting rolling her shoulders playing with the ends of her long wavy hair two other girls moved restlessly the others sat quietly crandall wascomb said morning young ladies these are the police and theyre very nice this gentleman is a police lieutenant and hes here to help you both these gentleman want to help you he flashed us a helpless look and trailed off milo said hi there valerie pointed a finger you were here already milo cued me with a tiny movement of his head i said yes we were valerie you know my name accusatory some of the girls tittered i said wheres cherish valerie left when did she leave when it was dark around what time her stare told me the question was absurd no clock in the room no radio no tv light from the window would be the sole arbiter of time the room was clean spotless the cement floor freshly swept each of the six bunk beds was set up identically with two smallish white pillows and a white top sheet folded over a pink blanket blankets tucked militarytight i didnt see wascomb ordering the girls to make their beds they had a routine i said anyone else have any idea what time cherish left a couple of head shakes neatly groomed heads the girls appeared to be wellnourished how often did they leave the property this room were meals taken in the main house or eaten here did homeschooling extend to occasional outings maybe thats why no one had answered the phone when id called a few days ago or what did it do to your sense of reality to inhabit this tight sterile space anyone want to take a guess i said valerie said they dont know nothing it was me saw her leave only i walked closer to her more giggles did you talk to her valerie silence did she say anything at all reluctant nod what did she say she had to go out someone would take care of us one of the other girls elbowed her neighbor valerie said you got a problem i aint got no problem quick retort but meek voice you better not wascomb said now lets keep everything calm young ladies milo said what about mr daney when did he leave drew left before said valerie before cherish yesterday she got mad at him cherish did uhhuh what was she mad about shrug i said how could you tell she was mad her face valerie looked to the other girls for confirmation pointed at a bespectacled girl with thin straight hair the girl began making squeaky noises with her tongue against her teeth valeries glower failed to stop her my smile did i said so cherish was mad at drew valerie stomped her foot trish pointing at a pretty longlegged girl with boyish hair and a fineboned face marred by acne short for patricia lactosesensitive special help with reading and penmanship she didnt answer valerie said you can tell shes mad from her face say that trish smiled dreamyeyed her pajamas were sky blue with white eyelet borders say it demanded valerie her face trish yawned she never got pissed at me just at drew i said another girl said he didnt come home last night prolly that made her mad i said she didnt like when he didnt come home nope was that often shrug valerie twisted a thick rope of black hair around her finger let it uncoil and watched it drop past her waist i turned back to her was it once a week something like that she gazed up at the mattress inches from her head rolled her shoulders and tapped her fingers and beat out a rhythm with one foot valerie time to shower she said where do you shower the other place the main house the other place the building next door uhhuh i tried trish again did drew go out a lot he was here except when he went out to valerie like when he went out with youu slowly spreading smile valeries eyes flashed trish said tell him you went out all the time thats why you always need to shower valerie got up from the bunk and charged her trish waved her long arms uselessly i got between them pulled valerie away soft middle but her arms were tight and her shoulders were granite lumps its like true said another girl yet another opined he went out with you all the time you gotta shower voice from a bunk across the room you get to sleep in the other place you get to shower whenever you want cause you dirty val grunted and fought to free herself from my grasp she was sweating and the moisture flew off her face and hit mine she freakin out like she always does trish said he takes you out all the time valerie let loose a string of obscenities wascomb shrank back trish said she gets up at night and walks around like a like a vampire thing thats how she saw cherish she wakes us up its good shes in the other place tell em monica you sleep in the other place now too the sole white girl pugfaced and strawberry blond stared at her knees monica goes out monica gots to shower bitch screamed valerie shed stopped struggling but shook her fist at one group of girls then the others her eyes were hard dry determined shut up admit it monica you gots to shower he take you out too monicaaaa monica hung her head admit it monicaa individual comments coalesced to a chant admit it admit it admit it admit it monica began crying fuck youuu screamed valerie wascomb said that kind of language really isnt you the fucker said trish you and monica fuck him every night and then you shower valerie fucks monica fucks valerie fucks monica fucks wascomb braced himself against the wall his skin had turned chalky his mouth moved but whatever he was saying was swallowed by the noise val lunged and nearly broke free milo came over and the two of us steered her out of the cube the chanting continued then faded behind us crandall wascombs voice thin and tremulous filtered out into the morning air some prayer how about psalms does anyone have any favorites chapter iled valerie to a lawn chair outside the same chair cherish daney had occupied the first time wed been here solemn and weepy reading a book about coping with loss her grief had seemed genuine now i wondered what she was really crying about i want to take a shower soon valerie i want hot water she bounced her knees together tickled one looked up at the sky scrunched her mouth glanced back at the block building now silent its my fuckin water i want it the bitches cant use it up im sorry they did that valerie bitches she lifted a twist of hair from her shoulder ran it across her mouth licked i said you know more than anyone do you have any idea where drew and cherish went i told you you said drew left before and that cherish was mad yeah but whered they go valerie its important why cherish is mad at him what if she went to yell at him hes okay she said he goes places like where places what kinds of places nonprofits he takes you to nonprofits silence i said you help him and the other girls are jealous bitches he trusts you i get it get what silence you get it so you help him i said uhhuh what do you get long silence valerie what do you love you understand love he prolly went to a church she said i dont know the names i want to shower a church silence valerie i know these questions are a pain but theyre important did cherish get mad at drew a lot sometimes about what not making money she let go of the hair held up a fist and glanced at the main house she felt he didnt make enough money yeah for what she wanted a trip to vegas she told you that silence drew told you back to hairtwisting drew told you cherish wanted to go to vegas shrug i said sounds like he talked to you about everything uhhuh did he want money she faced me no way he was for the soul the soul gods work she said touching a breast he got chosen and cherish she did it for the money but tough shit he wont give it to her drew has money he wont give her a smile spread across her lips i said secret money she shut her eyes valerie i got to take a shower she clamped her arms across her chest kept her eyes shut and when i spoke she hummed wed been sitting in silence for several minutes when milo came out of the cube with crandall wascomb he glanced at me while walking escorted the old man out he returned with uplifted eyebrows everything okay valeries been helpful but she and i are finished for now movement under the girls eyelids milo said helpful valerie says drew has money cherish doesnt know about valeries eyes opened its his you cant have it never heard of finders keepers said milo she didnt reply clamped her eyes shut noise from the front of the property opened them a uniformed officer came through the gate milo said now it gets noisy the van nuys patrol officer was followed by his partner then six members of the newly formed downtown crimesagainstjuveniles squad arrived wearing dark blue lapd windbreakers five female detectives one man each of them brighteyed and hyped ready to arrest someone shortly after a van nuys sex crimes detective named sam crawford showed up looking putupon he conferred with the head juvey cop and left the head was a stocky wirehaired brunette in her forties milo briefed her she gave the word and all but one of her squad entered the cube a younger detective who introduced herself as martha vasquez took custody of valerie saying sure hon you can do that when the girl asked to shower walking her to the converted garage while scanning the rest of the property milo motioned me over introduced the brunette as judy weisvogel and told her who i was psychologist she said that can come in handy milo briefed her some more emphasizing drew daneys abuse of the girls mentioning suspected homicides but staying spare with the details weisvogel said good morning world its going to get complicated do we have a crime scene over there indicating the main house havent had time to look around yet said milo at the very least its a fugitive thing missing perv and wife definitely separate cars the girls say they left separately and both cars are gone how much time elapsed between their respective rabbits from what the kids say a day or so okay ill phone in for a warrant and well get techies over to toss the place ill need a bunch of social workers too but they dont get in the office till nine civilian life said milo weisvogel said aint it a party no idea where mr and mrs perv are off to nope she may not be a perv whatever weisvogel took out her pad give me their names for a bolo milo recited drew daney he could also be traveling as moore daney andruson anderson en or on he spelled it his wheels are a white jeep she drives a toyota cherish some name you dont think they met up somewhere and split one of the kids said she was mad at him said milo cause she figured out what he was about dont know the kids are aware of whats been going on they taunted two girls who were sexually active with him if missus did figure it out she sure took her sweet time about it didnt she said weisvogel what do you think doctor one of those seenoevil pathological denial head cases i said could be i walked into that room saw those girls first thing came to mind was harem god only knows what were going to find when they get examined it sounds as if he was selective chose one or two girls who got special privileges the girl i spoke to thinks she loves him weisvogel slapped her hands on her hips her wrists were as thick as a mans so how long have you been looking at this fine citizen milo been looking at him for murder for a week or so the other stuff just came up the other stuff said weisvogel well its obviously gonna take a long time to unravel speaking of which doctor any chance you could be available therapywise i dont care how many girls he actually fooled with theyre all going to be affected right the department psychologists are pretty much tied up doing personnel evaluations and we could use some help sure i said she seemed surprised by my easy assent okay good thanks ill be in touch meanwhile lets keep each other posted milo will do judy speaking of which theres a safedeposit box on a desk in the bedroom cherish left it out in the open next to her instructions those instructions were set out on a piece of blotter paper like a presentation to me that says looky here clear invitation to scrutinize those instructions said weisvogel reminded me of some stupid memo youd get in the service she abandons these kids and writes out a manual hubby rapes the kids but they need their medicine and their nutritious breakfasts what a whack job be interesting to see whats in the box judy she shook her head before the warrant and the techies get here tsk tsk daneys a suspect in six murders maybe seven i can make a case for exigent circumstances weisvogel looked doubtful milo said judy he took the girls off the property to molest them so the house wont be your primary crime scene his jeep will we need to find him asap and there could be something in the box that gets us closer what you think the whack job left a map there are all kinds of maps judy thats pretty darn enigmatic milo im not comfortable messing with the goodies prematurely all i need is some defense attorney squawking about chain of evidence its in plain view despite obvious opportunities to conceal said milo aint that an invitation to search weisvogel smiled you shouldve gone to law school beats honest labor i couldve opened the box before you got here judy you certainly couldve weisvogel stared up at him her eyes were green lighter than milo s almost khaki with specks of blue scattered near the rims unwavering what if the box is locked ive got tools that wasnt my question milo smiled weisvogel said hell what if its ticking i know youll bring in a robot seriously it could cause evidentiary problems milo problems can be solved lets find the bastard before he does more damage then sort out the details weisvogel looked over at the house clicked her teeth together ran her hand through her terrier hair so youre ordering me as my superior to open this alleged box im asking you to be a little flexible what im hearing is you pulling rank on me seeing as im merely a dtwo and youre brass weisvogels turn to smile tobacco teeth im brass said milo as if hed been diagnosed with a noxious disease sorry to drop it on you so suddenly said weisvogel so am i getting this whole chainofcommand thing right still smiling milo said yeah yeah someone bitches it was all my idea then i suppose i have no choice said weisvogel lieutenant she joined her detectives in the cube and milo told me out to the car for what tools dont have any youve got a crowbar and ive got this reaching into a jacket pocket he brought out a small penlight and a ring of stainlesssteel burglar picks you carry those all the time some of the time he said when i think important objects are gonna be left in plain sight the house was tidy just as it had been the first time kitchen scrubbed hallways vacuumed as we entered the master bedroom i sighted down the hall at the windowless converted laundry room where rand had slept milo went into the bedroom and i joined him the desk sat to the left of the double bed plain and rickety painted brown a thriftshop piece that barely managed to fit in drew and cherish daneys cramped sleeping chamber milo gloved up and checked the closet his duds are here but hers arent looks like she packed up for the long haul and he didnt aint that thoughtprovoking he sidled over to the desk the legs were wobbly and the top slanted downward a jam glass held pens and pencils the green blotter paper cherish had used to frame her instructions was still there one of its corners was held in place by the box gunmetal safedeposit box extralarge size the kind banks offered preferred customers milo examined the lock lifted the box and inspected the bottom columbia savings stamp theyve been out of business for years surplus like the school lockers i said theyre parsimonious he frowned all that county money and theyre living like this if valeries right there was a lot of conflict about money maybe because drew was siphoning funds and stashing it away his secret cache that coulda been bullshit he gave the kid to impress her id bet on reality he had all the power right from the start with valerie didnt need to prove himself i pointed to the box he set it down looked at the lock again examined his picks and selected one lifting the box he hefted kinda light maybe cherish found the dough took it and split the question is whered he go with all his clothes still here he couldve gotten to the money first picked up on cherishs suspicion sensed the walls closing in and left with no clothes he travels light im thinking vegas because he told valerie that cherish wanted to go there the old projection game yeah vegas would fit his style easy for a scumbag to blend in okay enough conjecture gimme that pocketing the burglar picks and reaching for the crowbar he wedged the point under the boxs lid and bore down the lid popped up with no resistance and threw him off balance he fought for equilibrium and i had to swerve to avoid being hit by the bar she left it unlocked he said theres your invitation to search first came a gray felt cloth the kind used to keep tarnish off silverware no money under that but the box was halffull milo removed each object and placed it on the desk nothing that weighed much a yellowed stockton newspaper clipping seven and a half years old local coverage of troy turners murder in prison troy s name underlined in red pencil along with a sentence connecting him to the malley case kristal malleys name double underlined a pair of womans jade drop earrings any guesses he said maybe laras a black hardshell eyeglass case inside was half a blackened spoon a cheap lighter and a crude syringe fashioned from an eyedropper and a hypodermic needle brown gunk soiled the glass in the red velvet lining of the case the goldlettered address of an optometrist on alvarado under the address a scrap of paper taped to the inside lid property of maria teresa almedeira nestors mother i said nestor swiped it to house his works after daney killed him it became his souvenir milo reached in the box again and drew out a flimsy knit blouse royal blue with a horizontal red stripe holding it aloft by the sleeves he checked the label made in malaysia size s this could also be laras i said its jane hannabees she was wearing it the day i met her at the jail brand new weider was trying to pretty her up and daney deprettied her he examined the garment closely doesnt look like any blood he stabbed her in her sleep she wouldnt have worn something new he wrapped her back up in plastic rummaged through her stuff took a souvenir okay if the earrings are laras maybe her mother can verify check this out photocopy of a county document application to foster a child the ward in question was a sixteenyearold female named miranda melinda shulte drew and cherish daney had both signed the papers but they had never been sent in number seven i said milo rubbed his eyes theres no evidence he killed any other girls why her alex shed only been here a week but beth scoggins described her as aggressive moving in on beths queenbee status daney needs them to be passive maybe she asserted herself too much or she thought she wanted his attentions but when the time came she resisted not playing the game he said there could be a family out there somewhere wondering or even worse there isnt i said when we find him maybe we can learn where he buried her love your optimism he placed the foster form on the desk stared at it returned to the box pharmaceutical bubble pack nine bubbles seven of them empty two round white pills scored diagonally stamped hoffman atop the midline below it the label on the pack said rohypnol mg flunitrazepam party pills i said milo said next out came rand duchays cya id tag the photo showing rand looking baffled last at the bottom a manila envelope not much larger than a playing card fastened by a string and eyelet milo s gloved hands fumbled with the string he cursed finally got the string uncoiled brought the envelope close to the desk and shook it out carefully out tumbled a tiny bracelet square white plastic cubes strung on a pink thread seven cubes a letter on each k r i s t a l chapter like the cement cube the converted garage had a single window no larger than the cube but with only two beds it felt a lot more spacious i said valerie where did drew keep his money its important she sat on her bed i was three feet away in a pink plastic chair real bed not a bunk woodgrain headboard embossed with vines and flowers matching chest of drawers with the same embellishment a threadbare gray rug covered most of the cement floor particle board partitions created a corner bathroom complete with shower shampoo hotel soaps and lotions still sealed a host of stuffed animals on valeries bed monicas bed across the room had only a single blue teddy bear clear hierarchy lodgings for the preferred ward and her nextinline what reason had drew given cherish what had she been thinking valeries black hair was shinywet she played with a towel that said sheraton universal her eyes were pond pebbles i said in a box did he keep his money in a gray metal box the pebbles rounded around the edges as she looked away constricted pupils her hands danced on her knees we found the box valerie but there was no money in it so i guess drew made all that up no i saw it you saw the money she avoided my eyes i shrugged if you say so it was there its gone now bitch you think cherish took it she stoled it it wasnt hers we got it at the nonprofits fire in her eyes devotion beth scoggins had recounted how daney had turned off after her abortion it had been days since valeries abortion and she believed daney still cared i said guess cherish found where he hid it silence how do you think she found out shrug no idea at all valerie cleaning prolly cleaning where she got up paced the length of the room then the periphery passed monicas bed and tucked in a corner of blanket playing housekeeper she circled the room again cleaning where i said if were going to find your money we have to know where she stopped paced some more said something i couldnt hear whats that another inaudible whisper i walked over to her where valerie underneath underneath the house silence is there really an underneath valerie here running to her own bed and slapping the covers slapping them pounding them i cleaned real good but she sneaked in bitch i returned her to judy weisvogels custody milo gave me a set of gloves and the two of us moved the bed away from the corner the cement floor bordering the garages northern wall had been patched years ago some sort of grayish sealant slopped generously over cracks and crumbles grease spots shining through the white evoked the rooms original function in the corner the sealant stain was scored by four straightedge cuts shaped roughly like a square two foot square scoring the floor flush with the floor no handle or protrusions no way youd notice if you werent looking cherish daney had noticed there were all kinds of ways to houseclean milo got down and stared at the seams pry marks he worked the crowbar into the spot the slab pulled away easily underneath was a dark space three or so feet deep empty said milo no i take that back he got down on the ground stuck his arm in brought out a dusty wooden case smith wesson label inside the lid the bottom was foam with a formfitted indentation revolvershaped indentation his gloved finger prodded the foam wonder who got lucky first we left the property now cordoned by tape judy weisvogel stood by the side of the cube talking softly to valerie the girl twirled her hair and rocked from foot to foot weisvogel took a tissue and dabbed valeries eyes as i passed valeries eyes met mine and narrowed with contempt she flipped me off judy weisvogel frowned and drew her away what would allison think about my technique what did i think i drove away staying focused on a plastic baby bracelet milo said looks like you made a fan back there shes resentful cherish entered the room furious at me for prying the information out of her another violation of her turf turf like a little wife sick its going to take a long time for her to realize what he did to her oh yeah he said your jobs tougher than mine i got on the freeway and pushed the seville hard i think youre clear on the search cherish definitely wanted someone to find the souvenirs she left the box out for wascomb hoping hed open it knew that even if he didnt pry hed eventually call the authorities and the truth would come out dont think the truth means that much to her alex she abandons those kids and splits with all her clothes maybe with the money and the gun too unless drew got there first which upon reflection he probably did bad guy like that his nose for trouble would be good for all we know hes already partying at caesars palace has himself a new identity valerie said he was called away to moonlight at a church you could try to find out all the places he worked see if his whereabouts can be traced if the call was righteous if he said theres the other possibility i said cherish got the money and the gun and cherish has a boyfriend the drive to soledad canyon took forty minutes i parked a ways up the road and we walked toward the campground milo unsnapped his gun but kept it holstered no ravens no hawks no sign of any life in a grimy gray sky flat as flannel despite my heavy foot the drive had been tedious marked by heavy stretches of silence the gravel pits scrap yards and cookiecutter houses set into dusty tracts that seemed more depressing today developers would chew up the desert for as long as they were allowed families would move in and have babies whod grow into adolescents bored teens would chafe at the heat and the quiet and days that ran into each other like a tape loop too much of nothing would breed trouble people like milo would never be out of business neither would people like me as we neared the entrance to mountain view sojourn milo stopped got on the phone checked to see if the bolo had snared drew daneys jeep nothing he seemed almost comforted by failure business was slow at the campsite two rvs in the lot the generator silent that and a fresh coating of dust and the apathetic sky gave the place a desolate feel no sign of bunny macintyre we headed straight through the trees barnett malleys black truck was parked exactly where it had been in front of the cedar cabin windows rolled up milo s gun was out he motioned me to stay back proceeded slowly looked into the truck from all sides continued toward the cabins front door knock knock no whos there the welcome mat was in place covered by dry leaves and bird crap milo disappeared behind the south side of the cabin same as hed done the first time returned and tried the front door it swung open he went in called out cmon rustic woodpaneled space rubbed clean and smelling of lysol as vacant as drew daneys hiding hole except for the piano chipped brown gulbransen upright sheet music held in place on the rack with a clothespin floyd cramers last date on top beneath that country songs for easy playing desperado by the eagles lawyers guns and money by warren zevon empty gun rack on the wall through the disinfectant came the smell of male sweat and old clothes and machine oil a voice behind us said what the hell do you think youre doing bunny macintyre stood in the doorway her auburn perm was wrapped in an orange scarf and she wore a bluechecked western shirt tucked into straightleg jeans a necklace encircled her wattled neck silver and turquoise peace symbol dangling from the central stone barnett malley had worn it the day wed tried to talk to him macintyre took in milo s gun and said pfft put that stupid thing away milo obliged she said i asked you a question looks like youve got a vacancy maam and its gonna stay that way shucks maam and here i was thinking about country living then do it somewheres else this is my place gonna be a painting studio said macintyre shoulda done it a long time ago now you leave right now you dont have my permission to trespass go on dismissing wave still smiling milo strode up to her quickly when he was a foot away the smile was gone and his face had darkened macintyre stood her ground but it took effort milo said when did malley leave and where did he go and no bullshit macintyres pink lashes fluttered you dont scare me she said but strain thinned her smokers voice dont want to scare anyone maam but i will cuff you and haul you in for obstructing justice if you give me any more lip you cant do that he spun her around brought her arm behind her gingerly regret weakened his eyes a look that said an old woman this is what its come to bunny macintyre howled you damned bully what do you want from me her voice was all strain an octave higher milo released her arm spun her back so she faced him the truth she rubbed her wrist big brave guy im filing a complaint im sure it was a thrill having him here said milo younger guy im not judging but now hes gone with a woman his own age and things out in the real world have grown ugly so its time to toss the maydecember fantasies and help me get to the truth bunny macintyre gaped smiled slapped her flank and roared with laughter when her breathing finally slowed she said you thought he was my boy toy man are you stupid more laughter youre covering for him said milo all for a platonic relationship macintyre laughed herself hoarse stupid stupid stupid hes family you dolt my sisters son she died of cancer and so did barnetts father and despite what the government claims youll never convince me it wasnt because of all that radiation los alamos she blinked let me tell you they got all kinds of crazy things going on there few years back there was a huge fire burned thousands of acres black but spared the lab that sound logical supposedly it was set on purpose by some smokey bear types to control forest fires and the winds blew it out of control she snorted tell it to the marines barnetts your nephew last i heard thats what you call a sisters son im all hes got left mister hes an orphan get it i was willing to take him in from the beginning but he didnt want a handout so i sent him over to gilbert grass when gilbert retired i told him i could really use the help which was true is helping family illegal now hes got a sister in ohio macintyre pursed her lips that one married a banker rich snob she always looked down on barnett cause he wasnt much for schooling not stupid dont go thinking he was stupid he had trouble reading but give him a pump to fix or something to build and hed do it in a flash good for him now where is he hes a good boy said macintyre why dont you just leave him alone where is he maam dont know ms macintyre you deaf she rubbed her wrist some more you can pull a rodney king from today till tomorrow but i dont know he didnt tell me he left without a word he left thanking me for everything id done said it was time to go i didnt ask questions because i dont like to ask questions and barnett doesnt like to answer them hes been through enough the mans a vegetarian that tell you something he likes animals hes peaceful when did he leave three days ago his trucks here gee said macintyre sherlock holmes mustve put on a few pounds whats he using for wheels silence maam hes got another one another truck said milo its not registered its registered to me then its your responsibility not his suppose so what kind macintyre didnt answer something happens said milo the liability is yours and if its registered all i have to do is make a call she twisted her mouth if its not he said youre in trouble havent gotten around to it yet it was gilberts i bought it from his widow what make also a ford color also black where does barnett keep it somewhere in santa clarita and dont ask me where cause i dont know autostorage facility one of those customizer places hes having work done on it souping up the engine big tires you know boy stuff dont you think hes entitled to have some boy fun is he traveling alone you just said he had a girl did you know it before i told you said milo he mentioned he had a friend but thats it dont know her name never met her no but shes good for barnett and thats all i care about how do you know shes good for him hes started getting a little happy chapter we headed back to the road and milo did another bolo check as i started up the seville shook his head now im manhandling crones shell survive thanks for the support he said wheres your sensitive side dormant want me to head over to santa clarita find the garage that worked on barnetts other truck too much work for too little payoff malley and cherish are already out on the open road the question is which road theres also the matter of cherishs toyota you think theyre traveling separately you heard macintyre barnetts happy it would take more than romance to bring joy into his life what do you mean maybe he refused to cooperate with you because he had his own plan the word closure should be dropped from the english language but a guy in his position might figure getting some sort of satisfaction could ease his pain and cherish could help him payback he said thats another word for it by the time i made it back to the valley the sun was starting to drop i drove straight to the park where kristal malley had been murdered hoping for simple bloody symmetry instead of drews body we found only a scrubby sad space pocked with trash milo had his little penlight out and he washed the skinny beam over the same public lavatories described in sue kramers police report the same dumpster now reeking of waste the same swings where a pair of young killers had sat smoking and drinking beer no kids here tonight no people at all off in the distance the crumbling flatroofed units of city were toplit harshly security bulbs spanking the darkness a police siren howled then dopplered to silence shouts and laughter and drumbeats filtered through the night the air was heavy and oppressive and dangerous like hands around a throat milo pocketed the penlight nice try they could be anywhere maybe cherish really did want to go to vegas i said where exactly was lara found he sat down on one of the swings the chain howled in protest phoning sue kramer he asked her the same question listened intently made some notes and hung up and handed them to me for what its worth the sepulveda basin wildlife reserve is acres of what passes for natural habitat in la created by a dam filled with undrinkable water and armyengineered flooddrainage channels and planted with native vegetation the refuge is sandwiched between two freeways yet motionpicture gorgeous birds love it and a couple hundred species migrate in and out people are welcome with qualifications no hunting no fishing no bikes no feeding the ducks no straying off the wellmarked paths following sue kramers directions i entered on balboa boulevard just below birmingham high school cruised a treeless stretch of road a short while later the la river appeared an empty graffitimarred trough in this droughtplagued winter milo said she parked right there pointing to a spot bordering the river halfhidden by an initial planting of eucalyptus no sign of any vehicles i kept driving he said where now maybe nowhere then why bother got anything better to do continuing south to burbank i hooked a left and traversed the southern border of the reserve lots of trees here signs pointed toward the dam no more birds than wed seen in soledad canyon maybe they knew something we both saw it at the same time white jeep on the far end of a small parking lot on burbank the only vehicle in the lot signs said legal parking had ended an hour ago milo said right out in the open take that and stick it in your bolo where are the parking nazis when you need them i pulled behind the jeep he said sitting right here and no one notices i said theres your invitation to search out came another set of plastic gloves how many did he carry he walked around the jeep checked the underbody then the windows the doors were locked and the interior was empty clear view of the rear storage area through the hatchback window nothing milo said in the mood for a hike a dirt trail capped the top of the dam thicker trees more eucalyptus gnarled sycamore wild oak that enjoyed the drought evergreens that didnt plenty of opportunity to exit at paved paths feeding to burbank and victory but we stayed on the dirt twenty yards in the planting thickened even further and the trail blackened and milo s penlight cast a sickly beam that died three feet in front of us rocks and dirt and scampering bugs you came wellprepared i said boy scout days he said made it all the way to eagle if theyd only known wed traipsed halfway through the reserve finding nothing the excitement that had pinged my chest when wed found the jeep began to fade we were just about to turn back when the sound gave it away low insistent buzzing nearly drowned out by freeway roar flies milo made use of his long legs and was there within seconds when i caught up the penlight was focused on a fortyfoot sycamore tree stouttrunked thing with spavined mottled branches unlike the surrounding evergreens and wild oaks bare of all but a few desiccated brown leaves drew daney dressed in dark sweats and sneakers hung from a low branch feet dangling two inches off the ground his head was twisted to the side his eyes bulged nearly out of their sockets and his tongue was a japanese eggplant protruding from a lopsided mouth milo aimed the light at his head single gunshot to the left temple stellate entry wound larger exit tiny hyperkinetic ants crawled in and out of both openings the flies seemed to favor the exit it took awhile but he found the hole in the tree where the slug had lodged daneys eyes and tongue said hed been hung first i said overkill thinking about daney dangling just short of safety clutching at the rope trying to hoist himself up using his big upper body maybe hed managed for seconds even minutes failing inevitably feeling the life force slip away milo lowered the beam look at this daneys crotch was a busy place mangled cavity ragged around the edges where the cotton of the sweatpants had been blasted away here the flies ruled supreme milo got closer and inspected a few of the insects scattered but most of them stayed ontask looks liked gunshots a bunch of them he stooped and checked the tree trunk lower down yeah here we go looks like four no five slugs yeah five emptying the sixshooter i said a cowboy gun something else in there he lit and peered and pointed couple of rings i stepped in and saw two white gold bands specked with tiny blue gems same rings id seen at the jail eight years ago thumbtacked to what was left of daneys organ drews and cherishs wedding bands i said she made her statement he stepped away from the corpse looked it up and down expressionless whipping out his phone he called the van nuys station this is lieutenant sturgis cancel the bolo on missing fugitive daney daney ill spell it for you chapter milo and i moved away from the body and waited hang em high he said more like hang em low he was restless went over and examined daneys sneakers the fatal two inches couldnt have been comfortable think they used drews gun or barnett dipped into his arsenal id guess drews the temptation of poetic justice cherish got that along with the money if youre already going for the irony why hold back considering the need to proceed on foot up the dirt path it didnt take long for the six uniforms to arrive then four detectives and a white coroners van bearing two investigators milo briefed one of the ds very quickly then came over to where i sat just outside the tape ready for dinner thats it its someone elses problem now we had pasta and wine at octavios on ventura boulevard in sherman oaks no conversation until milo had finished half his linguini with clams then these rolls are great yes they are a glass of chianti later i said cherish may not have intended to but she helped set rand up to be killed maybe all she wanted was for him to rat out drew but it was a sloppy plan she shouldve known he wasnt smart enough to conceal his anxiety her hatred for drew overrode that sloppiness aint an indictable offense he broke off a piece of bread sopped up sauce delicious youre really through with it dont see any reason not to be what about cherish and barnett stringing up daney and blasting his balls off wild west kinda thing he said spooling linguine around his fork some of it dropped and he retrieved it ate got sauce on his chin and i aint the sheriff of dodge okay i said we dont know for a fact that malley and cherish were behind it do we guy like drew could make all sorts of enemies i stared at him he wiped his chin with a napkin in any case the valley boys will pursue it to its logical end if you say so what youre not finished with it guess i am except for therapy for the girls if detective weisvogel calls that surprised me he said given your attitude about longterm commitment what she catch you off guard that mustve been it he dove into his food again came up for breath sorry if im disillusioning you alex but im tired dont blame you im talking serious tired as in waking up and not wanting to get out of bed and dragging myself through the day sorry i said he picked up a strand of linguini sucked it into his mouth the way little kids do ill be fine two days later he called daney mighta wiped his jeep down but its a forensic trove pubic hairs semen tiny specks of blood in the ribbing underneath the door also i just got a call from downtown my request for dna has been approved and will be sent to cellmark expeditiously if i dont hear back within ninety days give a call any word on cherish and barnett not that ive heard but i might not hear not in the loop the only loop of substance was the one around that bastards neck anyway rick and i are leaving for hawaii thought id call to let you know good for you condo rental on the big island ten days thought you dont tan so ill sauté when are you leaving twenty minutes if the etd on the board is accurate youre at the airport love this place two hours of security line worked by morons i had to take off my shoes they tossed my carryon frisked me meanwhile everyone else including a guy who could be osamas twin sails through must be your dangerous demeanor if they only knew detective judy weisvogel didnt phone that day but the following morning i came back from running and found a message from my service id hoped it was allison told myself allison had her hands full and maybe i needed some of that myself i reached weisvogel at her downtown office thanks for calling back doctor still willing i am from what we can tell you were right he only molested valerie and monica strunk valerie wont talk to you but monica seems okay with it youd be more qualified to say but she seems awfully dull to me pretty close to retarded or maybe its trauma that would fit i said valerie was his number one choice monica was brought in for backup bastard she said cant say im losing sleep over what happened to him howd valerie take the news she doesnt know yet didnt know if i should tell her seeing as she still talks about him as if he was jesus damned stockholm syndrome what do you think find her someone she can relate to and ask them good idea shes got no family other than some distant cousins who want nothing to do with her poor kid i said poor everybody so when can you start ill come by tomorrow terrific weve got the social workers involved and all the girls are staying at a youth shelter downtown run by a pentecostal church but the people in charge arent doing the holyroller bit and i know from past experience that theyre righteous she gave me an address on sixth street i said ill be there at ten thanks again doctor in terms of the longterm placement if you have some advice were all open the shelters good but its temporary i cant see sending them off to new foster homes without some real careful checking she laughed now im being a social worker all part of the job unless you keep it out of the job she said and im not ready to do that yet chapter that night allison phoned im in the car ten minutes away may i come by of course i left the front door open seven minutes later she strode in cosmetics jewelry hair loose and shiny sleek white silk blouse tucked into winecolored slacks burgundy suede sandals with tiny rhinestone bows tiny gold chains across her instep she took my face in both hands and kissed my lips but it didnt last long we sat down in the living room thigh to thigh i held her hand she touched my knee it seems like ages she said since we had any fun it has been ages i heard about drew daney it was on the news something about the sepulveda dam not a lot of details do you want details not really you doing okay fine how about you me too her eyes dipped at the outer edges whats wrong i wish i could provide fun alex but i have to leave for connecticut in a couple of days gram fell and broke her hip and wes says it seems to have done something to her mind shes just not herself id be on the plane tonight but ive still got beth to worry about shes better a lot better and theres a very good resident who wants to work with her beth seems to like her but the rapport hasnt developed and theres the whole abandonment thing to deal with im hoping to get her to accept the resident in a couple of days to understand that my absence will be temporary she sighed i wouldnt tell anyone else this but nothing would thrill me more than coming back to find she prefers the resident know how you feel im so drained alex every minute im not at the office im over at the hospital now its gram sometimes i feel im a host and everyone else is a parasite isnt that horrible no one forced me to take this job i put my arm around her she remained stiff for a moment then dropped her head on my shoulder her hair tickled my nose i tolerated it a few moments later she said i know theres a lot i need to say to you but i just dont have the energy so could we just go to bed and not have sex ill understand if you say no but if you could find it within yourself id really appreciate it i got up and took her hand thank you she said at least ive got a friend shes fond of her body and usually strips down in front of me this time she undressed in the bathroom and emerged with her bra and panties on i was nude beneath the covers when she crawled in and i felt the mattress bounce i got hard and turned to keep that out of view she sensed it anyway rolled over squeezed let go its so ready she said sorry lying on her back she dropped a smooth white arm over her eyes no apologies necessary i said i neednt have bothered she was fast asleep breathing through her mouth bra cups heaving i knew sleep wouldnt come my way way off my biorhythm and too many things on my mind tomorrow morning what approach should i take with monica strunk would valerie be able to connect with another therapist where was miranda would my role as a police surrogate make any approach to the girls futile and would i end up reporting failure to judy weisvogel man in a tree baby bracelet trying to breathe myself calm i worked at shutting out the case thought about a call id need to make sooner or later sooner rather than later given the circumstances as allison slept i rehearsed mentally ring ring ring its me oh hi howre you doing okay you hanging in thats good i thought i might drop over visit spike sure
