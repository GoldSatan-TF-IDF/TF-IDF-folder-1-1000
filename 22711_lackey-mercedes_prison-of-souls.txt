prison of soulsthis is a work of fiction all the characters and events portrayed in this book are fictional and any resemblance to real people or incidents is purely coincidental lets begin naitachal said casting his black cloak to one side and raising his practice sword in salute and see if you can get through this drill without tripping over yourself he smiled softening the sarcasm just a little few ever saw a dark elf smile and survived to tell about it but naitachals smile meant only what any humans would and it warmed his cold blue eyes in a way that no other dark elf could match his apprentice alaire returned the salute with his practice sword and stifled a sardonic reply this time master naitachal youd better watch alaire thought as he checked his footing on the coarse gravel ive been practicing while you were away they faced each other on the small practice field of the dark elfs modest estate alaire was a head taller than his mentor but naitachal had decades of experi ence both were slender rather than heavily muscled at high noon the sun shone directly from above a dis advantage to neither swordsmen the contest began a graceful dance of flesh and wood their oak swords clacking away in the bright sun alaire lunged early catching naitachal by sur prise but the elf parried and thrust easily slipping out of the trap the youth was setting up trying to pin the elf against a tree alaire charged using his blade like a broadsword and using his greater reach to forc master to the edge of the field naitachal tucked and rolled becoming a blur of black motion that vanished behind alaire before he turned then reappeared at the periphery of alaires vision i thought you said no magic alaire protested fielding a counterattack with difficulty none used naitachal said smoothly pay atten tion to the sword lad alaire yielded to naitachals powerful but meas ured thrusts hoping to gain control of the contest dark elf tripped and wavered momentarily as he lost his balance but gained it back quickly good move naitachal said as their weapons clacked the contest fell into a mesmerizing rhyt alaire probed for a weakness in the dark elfs defense ten more of those and we might come out even the bardling grinned he liked how his teacher turned praise into a demand for more and better effort it kept the game interesting alaire sensed that the dark elf was intentionally ignoring his weaker left side only yesterday naitachal had drilled him endlessly attacking on his left until that side ached now nothing even as he consid ered this naitachal sidestepped off the field ducked behind a tree and came out on the weaker left alaire was ready instead of backpedaling he lunged again the tip of the sword touched the edge of nai tachals black tunic but no more the elf had sidestepped alaire cursed softly catching a glint of amusement in naitachals dark blue eyes anger surged briefly over him as the swords clashed though naitachal was only doing what any master should the pace of the combat increased the two moved back towards the center of the practice field kicking up dust in the process naitachal was not going to relinquish his control of the combat that easily dark elfs breathing was a little more labored now after first faking high to lure alaires point away from his intended target the elf came in low with his sword alaire deflected it knocking the elfs swordtip into the dirt if hed parried a little harder he might have disarmed his master and that would have been a first too easy far too easy alaire thought wondering what distracted his mentor today normally he would have landed me on my backside by now he knew he was an average swordsman naitachal was a master with uncounted years of practice behind him was something wrong had the elf learned something on his last journey to cause him worry the bardlings thoughts wandered slightly enough to give the dark elf an advantage look naitachal shouted pointing with his free hand a comet alaire looked without thinking following nai tachals gaze and pointing finger to something above and behind him as his attention wavered naitachal dropped his own blade to the side and shouldered into him the next second he was sitting in the dust in an undignified heap naitachal regarded him calmly with disappoint ment and faint elven amusement i cant believe you fell for that bardling not fair alaire protested weakly somehow man aging to laugh at himself boy was that stupid fell or rather stepped right into that one i was winning and you cheated if you were really winning you wouldnt be sitting there like that naitachal said were getting to the point in your training when almost anything is fair the real world is like that assassins he added his sword waving in the sunlight as if to punctuate the sentence will go to any lengths to kill their mark what would an assassin want with me he replied but only half seriously someone might want me dead if only to get at my father being the eighth son o king put him in an awkward position derek the first born and oldest brother would almost certainly become king one day the other brothers were train ing for important government or military positions yet the king had never planned on having so many sons as he once halfcomplained to the queen any other woman would have produced at least a few daughters along the way eventually he ran out of things to do with them alaire being the eighth and youngest son enjoyed the rare luxury of choosing his lifes work he had been a very precocious child and at six he had decided to become a bard fortunately naitachal was an old friend of the king as well as a loyal friend to many generations of the family no one questioned wh master would be this had not been a childish whim but a real voca tion naitachal had been able to assure the king that his sons talent was considerable and that all would be well in many ways his choice of lifework made him a less likely mark the older brothers would certainly make better targets than he would however alaire could not ignore the possibility that he could be sin gled out by young toughs looking for a fight naitachal had often pointed this out when he was sitting in the dust after a thorough trouncing for a year alaire had trained under the kings laureate gawaine and under his guidance convinced everyone that he had an exceptional degree of musi cal and magical talent however gawaine was getting no younger he had other students be alaire as well as the enormous burden demanded by his office of laureate gawaine eventually found it increasingly difficult to keep up with the workload since alaire was hardly an ordinary common stu gawaine had known he ran the risk of favoring him over the other bardlings it would have been a situ ation fraught with trouble for a younger man gawaine for the laureate it was something he simply did not have the strength to deal with by this time alaire was eight and he had heard enough tales about naitachal to be both excited and alarmed by having him as his master though h always assumed naitachal would be his teacher he certainly didnt know what to expect from the mysteri ous elf the necromancers becoming a bard was bizarre enough he had never seen a dark elf before hed had no notion that his father had used the dark elf so literally in the bright airy colors of the court naitachal had stood out like a drop of ink on a white lace tablecloth the black cloak he wore habitually flowed about him as if it were liquid and the tunic hose and boots seemed to absorb whatever light hit them as i bards body was a place that canceled daylight top ping the darkness was his straight silver hair that hung down his back long as all elves wore it and swept gracefully from side to side as he turned his brilliant blue eyes twin pools of color in the smooth black skin of that ageless face burned right through alaire when they first met they distracted him even now during sword practice alaire soon found out naitachal was no ordinary dark elf if there could be such a thing the somber darkness that seemed to follow him wher ever he went was only deceptive camouflage within lurked an absurdly cheerful bard a master of his trade as well as a teacher of other more practical skills naitachal had often reminded him of his royal obli gations and duties and the possibility that one day he might be nearer the throne than he was now how ever this was the first time naitachal had mentioned assassins it disturbed him at first but after a moment of reflection he shrugged it off sometimes the meaning of the elfs words didnt become clear for days or even weeks hes probably talking about years from now when i join fathers court right now the prospect of alaires ever having to deal with an assassin seemed vague how would an assassin get out here near fenrich this remote village on the northeast coast and once here how could he ever be less than conspicuous alaire loved this place its peace and quiet although he knew it would probably drive his brothers mad with boredom to stay here for more than a day it seemed the ideal location to learn bardic skills as well as magic after all there were few distractions here to speak of naitachal had chosen this location to settle in part because of the isolation but also because the village folk readily accepted him as himself his money was good after all in times of trouble naitachal had gen erously given his time and magical expertise winning considerable popularity among the townsfolk alaire stood and brushed the dust off his breeches nursing some pride back into his damaged ego living out here on the edge of the kingdom doesnt change your lineage naitachal reminded him theres always the chance some enemy of your fathers may want to kidnap you and hold you for ran som this is more likely to happen though the same people often kidnap or kill with equal indifference perhaps he said acknowledging naitachals warning but not really believing he could ever be a target at least not while he was a mere bardling and under naitachals supervision first so few people knew he even existed and even fewer knew he was way out here next door to nowhere he didnt like the sudden serious turn the conversation had taken but then what could one expect from a dark elf despite naitachals cheer he sometimes lapsed into the gloom and doom of his own kind the bardling had met only a few dark elves who were far more morbid than his master had ever been no it was probably just that naitachal was having one of those relapses into depression probably no one remembered his existence outside his own family alaire could almost forget his royal blood out here on the outskirts of the kingdom its a good thing im the eighth son i know i could never handle being king lucky derek he has the throne and all its responsibilities to look forward to by now he must feel like an actor in a play with all his lines and actions written out for him alaire struggled to his feet and answered nai tachals salute with one of his own we arent finished yet the dark elf said as if i was worried we might not be alaire thought heeding the challenge nevertheless naitachal struck with a vengeance taking alaire by surprise whats gotten into him the boy thought as he frantically defended himself the elf was attacking his left side just as he had the day before he did his best but it became painfully evident that either naitachal had been toying with him earlier or else he had been distracted by something and was now leveling his full concentration on the bout within moments alaire was struggling just to keep from being scored on within a few breaths it was obvious that he was not going to manage even that hit naitachal declared the swordpoint wavered just above his heart youre dead alaire froze then dropped his swordpoint to the ground they both bowed formally as the etiquette of swordmaster and pupil demanded then both grinned and alaire wiped sweat from his forehead with his sleeve lets take a break naitachal said then back to work i was about ready for a breather alaire admitted omitting the real reason he wanted to stop he wanted a drink to wash away the dust hed eaten they set their wooden swords on a small rack near the practice field and went to the well beside the front door dipping a ladle into the bucket of icecold w alaire drank deeply clearing his mouth of the dirt naitachal drank too though he didnt seem winded or even truly tired his folk have a constitution we humans can only dream of the bardling thought with envy at the same time uttering a brief prayer to the gods that be that he would never have to fight an elf for real the practices are hell enough naitachals age was as much an enigma now as it had been when alaire first met him from some of the old songs and tales alaire learned that he had been around in king ambers time even then he was old by human standards nows a good time to ask him again alaire thought he might even answer hed met only with annoying silence every other time hed inquired you know you seem to be holding up well for someone as well old as you alaire ventured cau tiously naitachal frowned but then he usually did when that question came up the bardlings words still came out wrong as if his mouth assumed a will of its own whenever he asked something personal abou master inwardly alaire winced he didnt want to annoy the elf particularly when the swords were within reach the next bout might be even harder how old are you master the elf took his time answering alaire wondered if he had ignored what had become a rather rude ques tion or had chosen not to hear it youre all of nineteen years old young bardling naitachal began softly after drinking from the ladle his eyes softened and alaire sighed in relief a mere infant a toddler at best a child he smiled wistfully as if considering a secret amusing thought i am old by your standards alaire waited but the elf did not answer well alaire asked older than you think he said and not as old as the hills or the trees that seemed to be the end of that the boy shrugged deciding to drop that particular line of questioning but his curiosity still burned nai tachal served king amber from what father told me he was quite the hero he mentioned that he was involved with doing away with carlotta he shivered whenever he thought of the evil princess who had tried to seize the throne by kidnapping the rightful heir prince amber the story had real meaning in his family his descent from amber gave it more impact than just a tale this particular bedtime story had places where father would say and then amber used to say or gawaine told me that kevin carlotta failed and then vanished years later she reappeared and hatched a plot involving count vol mar and a book of bardic spells gawaines own teacher kevin had searched for the book in volmars library found it and used it to defeat her that was all alaire knew about the incident the royal family seldom discussed it even among relatives and kept the details to themselves alaire knew there was some kind of scandal the royal family wanted to keep hushed up but he didnt know the details perhaps naitachal knows i feel more comfortable with the sword now mas ter naitachal alaire ventured its becoming a part of me as you said it would im sorry i came to you with such holes in my education my brother grant promised me training but he became so involved with his own he must have forgotten naitachal ignored him alaire knew from experi ence however that he wasnt missing anything alaire scratched his head a little his hair was sweatdamp and his scalp itched still i never expected weapons training when father sent me here is this the kind of fighting you used when you defeated carlotta at the mention of the evil princess naitachal turned slowly the look he gave alaire turned the boys spine to ice his skin crawled uncomfortably as if it were trying to slither off his body gods i hope that wasnt the wrong thing to say he thought he could kill me with one look if he dared who said we defeated carlotta naitachal replied casually the words stunned alaire what is he trying to say this time are you speaking in riddles to confuse me alaire asked finally or are you just posing questions to make me think naitachal replaced the ladle and dropped the bucket back into the well then gave alaire an appraising look they never told you the entire story did they alaire perked up at the prospect of hearing some secrets from his familys past they never went into much detail when i was around all i ever got was the bedtime story with the moral be good or carlotta will carry you off sometimes when he walked into his fathers study and his mother and grant and drake were talking he would overhear something about carlotta as soon as they saw him everyone got really quiet he hadnt paid as much attention to his own fam ilys past as he might have there was all the scope of history to learn a vast mine to delve in for gems that could become songs it would have seemed presump tuous to use his family as a basis for balladry still the mysterious story of carlotta occasionally nagged at him even if he was not likely to become king he still wondered what had happened back then and why they were keeping it from him no he said quickly no one ever did the whole family has been rather evasive about carlotta then perhaps i should keep quiet as well dark elf replied slyly not that they were intentionally keeping it a secret from me he quickly supplied im sure they just never well had the time or the chance i mean there are some things you just dont discuss with chil dren ive been here what eight years now nine naitachal said and you were never curi ous about it before im nineteen now im not a child alaire withered under naitachals answering look which seemed to say oh are you not really his master shrugged the royal family never swore me to secrecy on everything i insisted on a free rein in your upbringing and got it what would you like to know details like did you use this kind of swordsman ship he said pointing towards the rack of swords practice and the lethal metal kind or something a little more esoteric i was not the hero naitachal said and im still not certain any victory was had on that day by any one his gaze turned brooding as it always did when he was about to relate some story from the past naitachal gift for taletelling extended beyond songs and ballads and alaire settled back with a feeling of anticipation it began before i became involved naitachal said with a sideways glance at his apprentice a bard named aidan sent his apprentice kevin to the librar ies of count volmar to copy a manuscript called the study of ancient song alaire nodded although he had known all this before thirty years before aidan had prevented carlotta from stealing her brothers throne at the time he thought carlotta had been disposed of but he had recently learned that she was still alive although the situation had changed carlottas ambition had not since you humans have such brief lives aidan was now an old man and didnt have the strength to deal with carlotta his apprentice kevin was only seven teen then naitachal shook his head as if he could not believe the years had passed so quickly kevin was young eager and dying to have an adventure what he lacked in brains and maturity he more than made up with enthusiasm however he was rather reluctant to go off to copy some old manuscript aidan didnt tell him how important it was if aidan was an old man then wasnt carlotta an old woman alaire asked puzzled yes and no naitachal frowned carlotta was half fairy and a shapechanger because of her fairy blood she lived as long as any halfling as a shapechanger she could simply shift herself out of the ravages of old age by that time she had also mastered many o darker arts she was a fair match for anyone alaire had never heard this before now he knew why a member of the royal family was a halfbreed and she was practicing black magic good gods no wonder they wanted to keep this secret naitachal took no notice of his shock kevin was all alone in an unfriendly place so it wasnt hard for car lotta to learn what aidan had sent him to do sh kevins confidence by assuming the form of volmars pretty young niece charina this was easy enough for a shapechanger and the result was quite effective i believe kevin had even fallen in love with her alaire closed his mouth and nodded wisely what happened to the real niece he asked this was not part of the bedtime story which usually never got past the tale of amber and aidan naitachal sighed what you might expect count we later discovered murdered her to get her out of the way she apparently knew something was afoot he shook his head poor little thing they killed her before she could enjoy her life he brooded on that for a moment and alaire gen tly prodded him back onto the story so kevin came to copy the manuscript and carlotta found out what he was doing why didnt she simply take the manu script naitachal chuckled because the manuscript hid itself from anyone except aidan or his deputy when the manuscript disappeared carlotta and volmar staged the disappearance of the fake niece out of des peration they blamed both dark and white elves for the kidnapping and that was how i became involved i was visiting volmars court during some rather aim less travels count volmar appointed kevin to lead a search party to clear my peoples name i volunteered to help so thats where you came in alaire thought this is getting interesting naitachal squinted up at the sun for a moment none of us knew the book in question had a hidden spell in it a spell that could unmake carlotta which is to say to return her to her original fairy form alaire nodded somberly only full blood humans can sit on the throne of althea inwardly he was both excited and a little appalled a fairy in the royal fam ily i would really like to know how that happened carlotta is half fairy my greatgreatgreatgrand father must have ahem his ears burned as he won dered how a human and a diminutive fairy could hav stranger things have happened i suppose naitachal continued our party would have failed if not for kevins leadership he made us all work together in spite of our continuous bickering not sur prising since the count intended us to fail and chose us for that reason we were an amazon a fairy myself and a white elven fighter anyone would have thought we would never stay together for more than a day we became certain in the course of some inter esting adventures that count volmar had sent us away so carlotta could find the manuscript i would truly like to hear that in detail alaire thought but naitachal was obviously trying to make this a short tale in time we returned to the castle discovered charinas captors had released her the count treated us like heroes even though we had done nothing to rescue her his expression became grim we were all highly suspicious and as a precaution i spent an evening fortifying kevin with magical protection we were certain now that carlotta was somewhere around in disguise possibly as charina although we could not be sure when kevin finally found the manuscript carlotta was there beside him she knew what it was and she wanted it if we hadnt fled volmars castle when we did she would have seized it and destroyed us she pursued us with her magics not all of us survived those magics his voice trailed off and alaire saw something he had never seen before on his masters face grief he dared not interrupt although he was burning to hear the end of it all naitachal seemed to shake himself and completed the tale when we returned to volmars castle it was with a band of some traveling musicians kevin thought they were his masters human friends but actually they were elves and allies of king amber vol mar was staging a grand event of some sort inviting nobles from all over and we suspected it had some thing to do with carlotta we knew we had to work quickly and you were a hero alaire said naitachal shook his head hardly it was kevin for he was truly a bard by then who should get the credit for what happened in a short time he mas tered the spell and delivered it flawlessly volmar and carlotta appeared there before every body she returned to her original fairy form i thought she died alaire said thats mother said gawaine thought so too naitachal laughed but it had no humor in it thats what the queen wants to believe but alas im afraid that simply isnt what happened carlotta escaped in the melee that followed it was all we could do to volmars soldiers from executing us on the spot his men followed him blindly and it was only when they saw charinas ghost who openly accused the count of her murder that their loyalties turned and i had nothing to do with that by then id had my fill of nec romancy he took a deep breath and his face cleared of the shadows of the past and that is the end of that tale where carlotta went after that is anyones guess she didnt die she only changed do you think carlotta is still alive alaire had to admit he didnt feel too comfortable with the chance that carlotta still lived naitachal seemed to consider this seriously for a moment but alaire suspected he already had an opin ion formulated simply put yes though i havent the first clue where she would be or when she might sur face its not worth worrying about at least not at the moment you have more important tasks at hand such as learning real swordsmanship he laughed again this time with real humor when i think how kevin begged the amazon and me to teach him the sword and how horrified his master was when he learned that we had alaires thoughts and gaze had drifted during the brief history lesson perhaps this was why he didnt notice when naitachal slipped over to the swordrack and retrieved his weapon he even managed to hide it until now i hold a weapon naitachal said smirking and saluting him with the practice sword why dont you alaire opened his mouth to say something but nothing came out damn him the boy thought he knows when im not paying attention thats when he pulls these little stunts the dark elf tossed alaire the wooden sword which he caught skillfully by the hilt then took another from the rack on your guard naitachal said alaire took the position and tried to focus on the swords carlottas story still haunted him naitachal quickly tore into him with more energy than he expected once he started trying to avoid the elf instead of countering his blows he knew it was all over again alaire lay sprawled in an exhausted heap he did not even know what he had tripped over my own feet probably during the fall he lost track of his sword it was now sticking upright out of the ground quivering slightly you have more lives than a cat naitachal said holding out his hand youre dead again dont remind me alaire said struggling to his feet at least ill improve even if he beats me like this every time the sun was still high in the sky reflected brightly in the white walls and the little fishpond in the yard of their home the house was roomy and by local stand ards was certainly a mansion but of course it was nothing like the opulence alaire had grown up in that made it all the better he felt free here and the simple pleasures of country life were a welcome relief from the court rising from the center of the home was a watch tower giving the house a templelike appearance an odd conceit but one that gave both of them pleasure in watching storms and stars from the watchtower one could see the distant coastline and sometimes even the sail of a ship up on the hillside above the house in alaires line of sight with the watchtower he caught movement up there was the only road leading into the estate and the moving figure on it might have been a man on a horse or a carriage it was too far away for the bardling to make out exactly what it was much less who naitachal apparently noticed too regarding the approaching visitor with interest messenger naitachal said simply from the court alaire squinted but still couldnt make out the outline naitachal had demonstrated repeatedly that his eyesight was superior to any humans so alaire took his word f messenger he asked is he armed is he fathers personal guard no naitachal replied and alaire sighed with relief a messenger from the royal bodyguard would have been a certain sign that the news was bad it would have meant at the very least a death in the family or an invasion from a foreign land or some other earthshattering calamity naitachal frowned odd there must be some urgency to whatever hes delivering his horse is exhausted hes been riding hard for some time now visitors were a rare treat but alaire awaited this one with mixed emotions if he merely bore a friendly message from home why would the messenger run his horse into the ground what could have hap pened he wondered he tried not to let his imagination get the better of him the messenger and his horse drew closer and slowed the boy was sixteen at most and was wearing the dark blue riding uniform and plain blue sadd reynards livery perhaps he had simply ridden hard to impress his own master with his diligence inwa alaire groaned no not another fancy gaudy foofy royal visit from some princess at the castle i come bearing a message for master naitachal from his majesty king reynard the young man announced even before coming to a stop the horse a beautiful gray palfrey alaire recognized as one of the best in the messengers stable did a weary little dance as the boy pulled up next to them the messenger obviously winded and tired waved a blue envelope alaire changed his mind again he would have had to ride straight through two days to get here looking like that the horse doesnt look much better a visit from one of dereks wouldbe brides would not justify this degree of urgency and the master of the horse would take this youngster apart for exhausting his beast if he had only done it to impress naitachal reached up for message an envelope sealed in wax with the family crest please take your horse to the stables naitachal said motioning toward the somewhat dilapidated barn behind the house there is a water pump with the trough when you are done you may go into the house to wash thank you sir the young man said saying noth ing to alaire he directed the palfrey toward the stables he apparently doesnt know im the kings alaire thought all he sees is naitachals bardling it was rather refreshing and he grinned to himself with a certain amount of relief they really had forgotten all about him at court he might even be able to sneak back some time and enjoy himself without having to put up with all the nonsense well what is it alaire said unable to stand patiently any longer is it about me naitachal flipped open the wax seal and read the message quickly at a glance then he looked up well naitachals expression was neither grim nor dark ened as it would be in response to bad news it wasnt quite neutral either alaire quivered with barely restrained excitement its about me it has to be naitachal raised an eyebrow then folded the paper back up and returned it to the envelope then as it lay flat on his palm the envelope burst into flame startled alaire stepped back he wasnt expecting that naitachal calmly brushed the ashes from his hands and fixed alaire with a measuring and unreadable look tell me alaire said barely restraining himself the dark elf never became melodramatic and burn ing the message like that required an exercise of magics he seldom your father naitachal said after a lengthy and infuriating pause wants to send us on a little errand without elaborating naitachal started back towards the house for a moment alaire stared at his retreating back then flustered he hurried into the house after him naitachals study was usually a private place where he wouldnt allow anyone not even a maid alaire had set foot in the study only six times in the years he lived there and then only because naitachal had invited him when some royal crisis was abrewing now naitachal stood at the door and bec alaire to follow he cautiously followed his master into the mysterious den shivering in its chill the place gave him the creeps the study had no windows no source of light besides a single black candle as big around as alaires forearm in the darkness the candle flared to life illu minating naitachals face standing behind him was a large shelf of ancient dusty books all in elvish which had been in naitachals family gods only knew how long the bard carefully pulled and examined the vol umes which had no titles on the spines we are going to suinomen naitachal said flatly as he searched suinomen alaire thought he cant be serious the name conjured uneasy feelings king reynard discouraged all his subjects and particularly the royal family from traveling to suinomen his teachers never spoke about it in school it never even appeared on maps and it never had diplomatic relations with any country after a while one just forgot it existed the only contact althea had with suinomen was a light seasonal trade in animal hides alaire didnt even know who was ruling the country nowadays suino men why in the seven hells are we going there their home at fenrich was near the northern boundary with suinomen this probably explained why king reynard picked them since the border was a days travel away the capital two and since naitachal had often run little errands that involved diplomatic maneuvering for the royal family this still didnt explain why they were going found it naitachal said selecting a thin leather book from the shelf and placing it on the desk in the dim candlelight alaire could make out vague elvish script on the cover but couldnt decipher its meaning you still havent said why were going to this place alaire said trying to sound nonchalant since the dark elf had so few visitors to this room it took the boy a moment to find something to sit on he finally found an old stool layered with dust since his backside was already dusty he didnt have any qualms about using it naitachal was perusing the book the land is only off limits to those who wield magic he said as if in an afterthought so where does that leave us alaire asked did the king forget what you are and what you are train ing me to be even before all the facts were in he found himself resisting the whole idea no one in suinomen knows we are bards nai tachal replied absently let me explain before you prejudge the entire mission you know suinomen has been an uncomfortable neighbor for centuries but for the most part our two nations left each other alone now they are making vague but disturbing war threats alaire was about to say something else but at the mention of war he kept his silence naitachal turned a page this was why i destroyed the letter our mages through their own spells seen an impressive military buildup the suinomese have stepped up their recruiting efforts despite a pro ductive harvest why should they draft youngsters when the family farms need them the most the war threats must be taken seriously alaire shook his head it made no sense weve lived in peace with them for so long they want noth ing we have do they naitachal looked up for a moment and shrugged the king thinks theyre afraid of us i must agree only i believe the fear has gone back many centu ries for about a century now suinomen has strictly regulated magic althea of course never has to practice magic or even the lowest level of healing is strictly illegal unless the crown issues a license this is why your father discourages travel to their land too many times our people have never returned because they practiced a healing to mend a broken bone or created a magelight to start wet firewood and wound up imprisoned for life or so we assume alaire had heard the rumors of people vanishing into the north but hed never heard one confirmed it was one of the curses of living a sheltered life idle street talk seldom reached his ears even now being of royal blood meant you just didnt hear common gossip even if you wanted to naitachals attention had gone back to his book magicians even their healers take tests in specific areas then when they have paid their licensing fee they may perform only the simplest of spells and then only under the supervision of the suinomen m association what about bards alaire asked you havent mentioned them naitachals mouth twitched they permit simple musicians but never bards however they have no effective barriers to keep them out their mages are in my humble opinion amateurs they probably wouldnt recognize a bard unless one whacked them over the head with his harp alaire stifled a chuckle as naitachal continued but somehow they fumble about in their incompe tence and nab a magician or two for making a lopsided circle on the ground with onion flakes he turned another page so as i said they permit only harmless nonmagical minstrels even though no one over there knows how bardic magic really works this is how we will present ourselves we are minstrels only if anyone asks about our instruments it is our hobby the king chose us to be his temporary envoys alaire shrugged wonder why our ambassador cant handle this naitachal gave him a withering look as if he should already have known the answer we dont have o suinomen were going to be the ambassadors well have to be careful there the reason suinomen is making threats is because they feel endangered our unlicensed and unregulated magic is a threat to their security or so they claim alaire considered this while naitachal went through the leatherbound book it makes sense in a distorted fashion he decided we make perfect envoys were practically at their doorstep already and im high up on the royal lineage ladder however something else nagged at him question alaire said raising a hand if they dont permit magic how can we be the ambassadors i mean youre an elf and all elves are mages right naitachal frowned and gave alaire that look he knew so well which told him dont you see yet magic use is illegal he said with a look of bored patience they permit magicians themselves but those mages cannot invoke any powers internal or external fine but naitachal had been a necromancer and in a country that feared mages this could cause some problems youre a dark elf isnt that likely to incite well hostilities this time naitachal just shrugged my people have never had an ambassador at the suinomen court that is probably why king reynard wants to send us in that capacity chances are they havent seen too dark elves and if they have do you really think they would give me any trouble if the reputation of elves in this kingdom is bad what do you think it is over there alaire had to chuckle well i guess he has a point no ones going to harass him particularly when he can turn you to powder with a single muttered spell and its not painless either father knows he wouldnt do that of course but they dont your role in all this is to be rather subdued nai tachal said almost apologetically alaire raised an eyebrow what do you mean sub dued you are to be my secretary of sorts we will keep your real identity secret for a moment alaire was resentful then he recon sidered what better way to have fun with an otherwise serious assignment if i went as a prince this trip would bore me silly of course they cant know who i am and i bet they wont even suspect since so few people in our own kingdom know im naitachals bardling ransom you see naitachal said its something your father would rather not contend with alaire edged closer to the volume which naitachal held in his dark hands what is that book anyway a very old travel log naitachal said heres the map well need this is the less traveled route if my grandfather is right he wrote this book centuries ago alaire thought about the plan and began to feel relieved for other reasons visiting another country as the son of a king meant hours of boring endless pom posity formalities uncomfortable formal dress and no privacy going incognito meant none of this well at least not as much he suspected that being an envoy would include some of the royal trappings but not thank the gods the full course its a rather difficult responsibility naitachal admitted i think were up to it we need to find out why they are suddenly acting so aggressive and to stop them if we can do you agree alaire of course i do he said without thinking he had another thought which left him a little awed a little excited and a little afraid responsibility naitachal had described it exactly with that single word this is important work we can do for the kingdom and were the best ones for the job remember the fact that we are bards is to be kept absolutely secret naitachal said the association can regulate unlicensed magic so we must assume they must have a way of detecting it we dont know what the penalties are after all he looked up from the book again and his eyes glowed in a rather sinister fashion id rather not find out the hard way chapt early the next morning naitachal rose to the noisy arrival of men on horses he glanced through the shutters and saw the messenger greeting three older comrades each wearing the same dark blue unif theyd brought two additional horses each loaded with goods presumably for the journey to suinomen though naitachal and alaire usually didnt rise till midmorning it looked as if their day had started without them that was enough to wake the dead he thought frowning at the noise not very courteous and theyre not even trying to be quiet the dark elf threw on a robe and with a tiny amount of magic heated a cup of khaffe as he walked past alaires bedroom he saw through the open door that the boy was as usual sprawled like a monkey on a bed of twisted blankets such a raw youth naitachal thought suddenly aware how sheltered he really was watching him he felt warm paternal human feelings which surprised him even the white elves had been known to make unflattering comments about human emotions not to mention his own dark and more serious brethren asleep alaire looked especially vulnerable are you ready for this journey my boy naitachal asked the slumbering bardling somehow hed managed to keep his long blond hair from getting tangled in the covers have i done enough to prepare you for this have i taught you enough to keep you safe and to be able to take care of yourself if need be then he smiled and am i going to be able to wake you without building a fire under your bed time to rise naitachal said without much hope our horses and supplies have arrived we must be on our way nothing he spoke louder alaire will i have to cast a spell to raise the dead the boy rolled over and flung a pillow at naitachal who ducked expertly under it as it whizzed past the burst of activity was brief alaire buried his head under a wad of blanket behavior like that is not very respectful naitachal scolded water from the well should be particularly cold this morning he paused for effect if you catch my meaning get up now or you will find out in the most direct way just how cold that water is alaire reacted by sitting up slowly on the edge of the bed youd do it too he complained yawning did you say more messengers are here naitachal laughed theyre out front where i expect to see you soon satisfied that his apprentice was truly awake nai tachal started for the front door mug in hand he stepped outside to greet the new arrivals trying to look more awake than he felt milord one of the messengers said naitachal sensed fear of his race rather than his title a common reaction to any dark elf we have brought horses and supplies in the name of king reynard for your journey to suinomen another said awkwardly still mounted on his sweaty horse the kings men just stood there visibly afraid as if waiting for lightning to strike them naitachal sighed in resignation if only they knew how much i dislike necromancy he thought sadly at times like these he wished humans would regard him with a little less terror then again this was partially his own fault in the past assuming the appearance and attitudes of a nec romancer had gained him more authority than he probably deserved however naitachal had never bothered to correct those who feared him by saying that he no longer practiced the black arts the spells and powers of necromancy never go away i was a black sorcerer for many many years they are right to fear me he could still summon the forces to convert an enemy to dust or at any moment call up his sword or order the spirits of the dead to serve him he could flay the skin from living flesh and flesh from bones few humans ever guessed that he would rather put on a jesters outfit and juggle live rats than do any of that the two fine horses pleased him at least they would ride in good ambassadorial style the horses tack was more elaborate than he would have preferred however particularly since they would be riding in lands that might harbor bandits or robbers we might as well wave a banner naitachal thought with exas peration alaire appeared in the doorway he regarded the messengers calmly with iceblue eyes now wide awake with curiosity the new arrivals hardly looked at him apparently they had no idea alaire was the kings son and knew only that naitachal was a court bard by wearing simple peasant clothing naitachal saw alaire had gone out of his way to affect unimportance they probably think hes my servant naitachal thought admiring how well the royal inner circle had kept alaires apprenticeship a secret thats perfect these messengers have no idea that this is a prince of the blood royal naitachal invited the messengers inside they dis mounted reluctantly as if fearing even this show of hospitality he showed them the guest quarters and invited them to stay a night or two in their absence knowing it would have taken three days of hard riding to get here without waiting to hear their reply he returned to his own quarters and alaire followed his lead in earnest they began packing for the trip the fancy costumes the messengers had presented them with would never do for traveling they left those items securely packed away for when they arriv rozinki suinomens capital he inspected the impres sive weapons the king had sent them two new crossbows with an ample supply of arrows swords from the royal blacksmith and jeweled daggers the cloaks would at least conceal most of these he decided we must leave the jeweled weapons packed the dag gers are too tempting a prize for bandits if this was too early in the morning for alaire he no longer showed it the lad had an extraordinary amount of frenetic energy for someone who had just awakened naitachal watched him discreetly trying to determine from body language if the boy was trying to conceal uneasiness about the journey or if he really thought this was going to be a grand adventure with out pitfalls my father could tell him some tales about suinomen thought naitachal the book his father had written was more than a travelers diary it was a warning father never really said what was so frightening about the place the only thing that could frighten a necromancer would be something beyond or worse than death alaire brought out their two harps from the house the boys instrument was slightly smaller and had the brighter less mellow tone of newer wood naitachals instrument had belonged to an old hermit who claimed it was a thousand years old naitachal guessed three hundred but its tone and the odd composition of the varnish had intrigued him how long will it take us to get there by horse back alaire asked stowing the harps carefully away in their canvas sacks which became a balanced pair of saddlebags or maybe i should be asking when are we supposed to be there included in their supplies was another sealed letter which naitachal opened perhaps we do have an appointed arrival time he thought glancing over the parchment included with this was a detailed map of their route which took them around the marshes and bogs that made up the southern portion of the kingdom and led them along the fjord filled rocky coast swamp flanked the route on the west with ocean on the east the letter was from king reynard to king arche nomen stating his desire to establish diplomatic relations between their countries included in the packet was another letter for naitachals eyes only giving details of the kings thoughts on the whole mat ter and a separate certificate that conf naitachals position as a royal envoy there was noth ing that would indicate alaire was a prince once they were in suinomen he would be an underling or at least give the appearance of one no particular day to be there naitachal said i would guess two maybe three days at the most the provisions should suffice us if not we can hunt though i doubt much game lives on that narrow chan nel oh well he needs to get rid of some of that baby fat anyway since the girl who cleaned and cooked for them had not arrived from the village naitachal cooked a hearty breakfast for everyone instructing alaire to play as if he was naitachals assistant i know you outrank them but it will be good prac tice he added alaires face became a distorted mask of humility and he bowed humbly before the dark elf i am at your service my gracious master he said smirking you should be able to do a more convincing job of posing as my secretary than that naitachal whis pered they might figure out who you really are and take you hostage they are preparing for war you know the smirk disappeared aie yes youre right as usual this is a serious matter in need of your expert diplomacy i will play the role to the best of my ability alaire grabbed the wooden tray of biscuits gravy and boiled eggs we will be leaving promptly after breakfast dark elf said but alaire had already vanished into the dining room once theyd packed their belongings naitachal leaned over and gave parting directions to the messen gers on how to close up the house their curiosity didnt concern him any room they shouldnt be in they couldnt get in certain spells wouldnt allow any thing less than a mage and a more powerful one than he into the study or watchtower which were both secret and dangerous spaces similar spells would not let common bandits near the house for the most fenrich had a peaceful lawabiding population more likely to protect naitachals property than try to take advantage of his absence they mounted up the dark elf rose in his stirrups for a moment from here he could see the village deep in the hollow of a long valley they took to the road riding along a rocky ridge just above the village the sort of terrain that would become alltoofamiliar before the journey was over alaire followed his gaze should we stop and mayor woen well be gone i have already instructed one of the messengers to do so naitachal said the house defenses will take care of themselves once the messengers are gone aye they will alaire said gleefully remember i helped you lay a few of those magical traps myself should you have to step out for a little while since naitachal was the only mage of any ability who lived in the area he had become the village pro tector he had pointed out to the mayor that he was likely to come and go and that if trouble ever came to the village he might not be around to get rid of it alaires help naitachal had laid all kinds of tricks and traps to protect the village in their absence even ordinary humans have outwitted magic users alaire pointed out in my great grandfathers time the court relied as much on the ordinary non magical folk as they did the magic users to carlotta quite true a respectful fear of the unknown even unknown humans is a healthy response noted nai tachal as he glanced over at alaire who eyed his saddle as if he felt it might be loose but until we get to suinomen i doubt there is much that will bother us human or not what we have to fear once we get to there is the breaking of our magical anonymity remember we are mere ambassadors with musical abilities we are not bards or magicians we dont even do card tricks alaire made a noise naitachal couldnt immediately interpret strict hmm strict is not the word i would have chosen nai tachal replied soon the village receded out of sight the ocean came into full view on their right and mountains grew up on their left here the weather had cooled where they were going it would already be winter fortu nately the king had included two fine dieren coats with their wardrobe in the traditional suinomen cut they traveled the coastal road into suinomen weeds now grew in the rutted tracks left by the carts and wagons that brought in dieren wool the primary source of income for the northerners the dieren themselves were splayfooted antlered beasts the only visible asset of that kingdom although naitachal had never seen one alive every spring the herders carefully brushed out the wool a warm silky material which was in high demand throughout althea dieren meat was delicious and the herders even made a very succulent cheese from the milk villagers from fenrich often tried to bribe the suinomen trad ers to bring down and sell a few of the beasts preferably a mixture of male and female but they just laughed only to return with more processed dieren goods the next year but no dieren theyre not fools the dark elf thought assuming the beasts could even live in our climate why should they give us the means to breed them ourselves as if reading naitachals mind alaire said i won der what dieren look like well naitachal said feeling mischievous ill bet they have fur and four feet and antlers alaire turned slowly giving him a wry grin your powers of deduction never cease to amaze even me alaire said in jest seriously do you think well see them before we get to archenomens castle naitachal considered this a moment i doubt it all well see is coastline and marsh they herd the beasts further north on the prairies maybe ive never been there myself so i cant say as long as youve lived youve never visited sumo men alaire seemed genuinely surp what did he think i have been everywhere and seen everything no not there after my father returned from that land he warned us never to go there that something unspeakable awaited us all if we did naitachal shook his head remember that it made a practiced necro mancer feel threatened we were not likely to ignore his advice and he never said what it was naitachal wished that he had not once he seemed particularly rattled by whatever he saw his attitude concerning his children even once we were grown was obey and ask no questions so we didnt and we do not have the time to seek him out wher ever he has cloistered himself and ask him if he would even talk to me renegade that i am alaire pulled up closer to him as the trail narrowed to an overgrown tunnel of trees did he ever tell you anything else about suinomen i heard only giants live in the north in enormous ice castles and that suino men allowed some mages to cast spells that wreaked havoc with the weather naitachal replied ive heard the stories too but they are mostly rumor according to fathers journal i doubt that anyone can control the weather but as i told you these folk do permit magic under tightly con trolled circumstances their passion for regulation has frightened many visitors away not that i blame them who would want to live in a place where one cannot even cast a simple healing spell without licenses and fees then perhaps we could cast one last bardic spell before we arrive alaire asked coaxingly naitachal considered this the practice would be helpful to the young bardling but he could think of no good reason to cast a spell just then except something protective and a protective spell would last for some time if we conjured something to protect us they may detect any lingering magic for what purpose he replied reasonably as his horse shook its head until the bridle ornaments jan gled we cant go tramping into suinomen with magical residue dripping off us i assume they have some means of detecting magic if they are policing their kingdom of it which means they might even detect it from within our borders not a good idea alaire nodded apparently agreeing with his master you were up most of the night reading that journal of your fathers what else did he have to say we can expect a rather subdued atmosphere wherever we go according to father these people dont have much fun not that necromancers are known for having a good time even he remarked on that extensively he thought it might be because of the long nights or the difficult conditions that most of the people there must face it is a strange land dotted with thousands of lakes filled with islands the people tend to be small slender and very blond on a dark night some might even be mistaken for a white elf alaire shook his head i cant think of anything we have that they would be desperate enough to go to war over it makes no sense unless something has hap pened to change things within the government i mean something drastic like the overthrow o royal house naitachal gave him points for that notion he guided his horse easily across a particularly bad stretch of road before making a reply this is one of the things we must find out who rules and who follows the land has no mines no source of gold silver or gems for whatever they need they must trade heavily in dieren goods they do have amber in large quanti ties but that is all a thought occurred to him i wonder if one of the reasons why theyre making these threats is to gain access to our mines in the north i would have thought that those mines were much too far south of their border to qualify as a target but per haps king archenomen thinks he can conquer enough territory to take them makes sense alaire said ominously he appar ently hadnt considered the mines as the possible target either naitachal had not even thought of the mines until this moment because they were technically owned by the dwarves who worked them if the suinomites felt they belonged to althea and desired them that changed the complexion of things there is something in althea thats worth fighting over naitachal sensed uneasiness in the boy which car ried over to his horse which fretted at the bit alaire said i was excited about this trip and all the good it will do for althea now though i dont have a very good feeling about what might happen to us in suino men even though this trip could accomplish muc althea yesterday before that messenger arrived i wouldnt have thought twice about the place now its all i can think about but its as if theres a dark blot where there should be light or discord where there should be harmony and it makes me nervous maybe mystery and the lack of information has colored my imagination naitachal eased his horse up beside his bardling and looked carefully into alaires eyes something lurked there besides the youngsters active imagina tion maybe your magic is telling you things he said slowly alaires eyes narrowed a warning perhaps naitachal turned away himself feeling a deeper sense of warning and foreboding than he had in many many years what are we going to find in suinomen they stopped for the night at a staystation a crude oneroom stone cottage with wooden frames for their bedrolls a fireplace and a scanty supply of wood alaire and naitachal spent the better part of an hour gathering enough wood in the forest to keep warm through the night alaire suggested tentatively that he use magic to warm the place up the temperature had dropped below freezing and promised to plunge further this is only a taste of what were in for up there the dark elf commented as they met at the doorway hefting a bundle of deadwood over his shoulders we wont be able to use any of our usual powers to warm a cottage or whatever lodging we find between here and there if indeed we find any at all wed better get used to it anyway well be at the palace soon enough where we wont have to worry about gathering wood for fires of course not well be putting out political ones alaire said sardonically naitachal nodded and i wont be able to use magic to deal with that either i suspect i am going to be very busy and so will alaire chapte alaire thought he would fall asleep immediately after the long ride instead his aching muscles and the hard unfamiliar bed kept him turning and tossing all night long after the fire had burned down to coals he dozed off his dreams colored by the sounds of wild things prowling the night outside the shelter curled up in a tight little ball in his snug bed alaire awoke to the sound of sloshing water naitachal was holding a leather bucket of water above him tip ping it ever so slightly over his stomach even from this position he saw that the water was just about to drench him aeye you wouldnt alaire shouted scrambling into a defensive position as well as he could bur dened with his bedroll the bucket got his attention as did the mischievous glint in naitachals blue eyes a bizarre sight when combined with the black face dark elf ah but i would ive been calling your name for the last quarterhour he said the bucket hadnt wavered are you going to get up or am i alaire thrashed around trying to get away from the bucket but in so doing he managed to roll into nai tachals legs the sudden jostle dislodged naitachals grip with a loud slosh the water and bucket land alaires lap and yes the water was cold icy in yyyaaaaaaaarghhhl alaire shrieked throwing the soaked bedroll off his legs and scrambling to his feet as he made for the blazing fireplace he saw that hed soaked naitachal as well that was not what i intended naitachal said i assure you but it did get you on your feet we have another long day ahead of us alaire glared at him trying to think of a clever retort unable to think of one he settled for the obvi ous that water was cold he said indignantly then why did you knock it out of my hands nai tachal asked you needed a bath anyway you humans get a little ripe after a few days of not bath ing dont remind me alaire said somewhat sadly normally he would soak in a hot bath before bed without having to haul his own firewood muscles he did not use in swordwork ached at this point alaire had had about enough of this kind of adventure he could not imagine having to travel the countryside singing for his meals and bed he no longer envie bards who did should we get there today he asked hopefully naitachal glanced through the open cottage door at the sun still low on the horizon if we get on the road before the sun sets then perhaps we will ive already cooked breakfast alaire couldnt see breakfast but he could smell it a closer look at the fireplace showed him the delicious aromas source two little rabbits roasting on a spit his mood improved immediately as naitachal took both rabbits from the spit and lay one on a piece of clean bark for him yum a hot breakfast alone is worth getting drenched with ice water as alaire tore into the rabbit he realized the water hed awakened to was fresh and not tainted with the leathery tang of the old bucket where did you get the water anyway he asked between bites ah naitachal said settling down next to him and starting on his own breakfast there is a shallow spring down the side of this ridge not more than a trickle but it was enough to water the horses and bring a bucket full up here for you it was to be your drinking water not your bath alaire grinned for by now the shock of the icy water had worn off its hard to be mad at him for too long especially when he lets me sleep and catches and fixes breakfast then his mood brightened even more we could arrive in rozinki today there will be an inn with real baths they packed and loaded the horses but before leaving alaire sought out the spring it was a mere trickle as naitachal had said but it was very fresh and very cold he rediscovered as he splashed some on his face when he bent to drink he felt something distinct and familiar a wave of weak magic passed over him he froze momentarily then resumed drinking sati ating himself while pretending to ignore the magical probe that had fixed on him it felt warm and tingly like a large beam of sunlight but unlike sunlight this had a feeling of control behind it who was controlling it he couldnt guess but he had the distinct impres sion it was coming from the direction they were traveling towards good gods he thought still acting oblivious to the probe who in the world could be doing that he returned to camp but as he left the well behind him the magical eye followed youre a mere mortal remember you dont know its there you cant know its there only a bard or a mage could feel it before he reached the horses he felt the probe shift weaken then vanish relieved he quickened his pace eager to tell his master about this unexpected intrusion he found naitachal adjusting the bridle on his horse but as soon as alaire drew closer he felt the probe again this time the magic only brushed past him for it focused on the bard instead the dark elf turned and met alaires eyes with his own alaire nodded ever so slightly are you ready to travel naitachal asked tension colored his words which seemed to say ah so you feel the probe too alaire nodded again yes i believe so he said trying to approximate the same tone i wonder if ah were going to see any natives today naitachal mounted his horse and looked do alaire perhaps i suspect theyll see us first they rode for close to an hour making idle con versation about the weather that wasnt hard to manage for it deteriorated into a cloudy cold morn ing threatening rain or more likely light snow the mysterious probe followed them and alaire tried to conceal his unease it was as if a giant something was looking over their shoulder listening to their every word then suddenly the probe vanished moments later naitachal chuckled my that was interesting it was a probe wasnt it alaire said sensing it was safe to talk a watchspell who was it one of our mages naitachal snorted hardly it came from sumo men i suspect it was one of their court mages amateurish if you ask me weve been approaching their border for some time but theyre only now aware of it and they tipped their hand alaire had to agree it was quite possible to watchspell without alerting the subject the wizards of suinomen should have been more careful than that if we were an invading force theyd be in real trouble by now indeed naitachal frowned it leads me to won der if we were right and they want our mines to the west they certainly werent paying any attention to this route until now during the latter half of the afternoon the weather continued to turn what had been nothing more than a chill in the air became a frosty winter blast a hard cold wind that hit them head on from the north naitachal as usual seemed to be taking it all in stride out came the winter coats complete with hoods that buttoned closely under the chin alaires hood seemed a bit oversized and hung low over his face this obstructed his view somewhat but the dieren clothing kept out the cold perfectly the outfit even included thick dieren gloves a necessity when riding there was another advantage to the hoods he saw right away that the one on the bards coat conc naitachals ears and a good part of his face he didnt look like an elf unless seen from close up the sudden change in the weather made alaire wonder if a mage had brought the cold down on them to discourage further travel northwards he said as much to his master naitachal shrugged the suggestion off i doubt it this is simply what the weather is like around here frankly i doubt their mages could cook something up this dramatic that afternoon they crossed the suinomen border they found no guardhouse or barriers just a strange stone pillar on the althean side naitachal translated a series of elven runes which covered the marker the odd message warned all elves dark and white to stay away from suinomen it said nothing specific accordi naitachal just a general stay out to all elves who saw it alaire thought it might be a forgery by the suinomen government to persuade magic users to turn back the bard shook his head there is a residue of elven magic on the writing naitachal said they could never have forged that alaire felt strangely uneasy the moment they crossed the border into suinomen not only was he leaving his home behind he felt as if he had passed a point of noreturn and that the odds were he would never go back oh dont be stupid he scolded himself youre see ing bogeys under the bed again people go across borders all the time and nothing more happens to them except a pleasant or unpleasant journey youre not a druid or a cleric you cant foretell the future youre just a bardling and this is just a border like any other the terrain leveled out as they drew closer to the sea the fens and marshes were clearly overrunning the western side of their trail alaire winced as he imagined the difficulty in taking a horse through those miserable bogs particularly in this cold the air here was thicker and damper and redolent with the scent of the marshlands a mingling of sea scent and decay ing vegetation naitachal had trotted up ahead a few horselengths to the top of a rise then reined his horse to stop come up beside me and stop the bard said b alaire could see what had attracted his attention i see someone approaching alaires head came up as if he could scent some danger in the air like a hound naitachal didnt seem too concerned yet nevertheless his hand was on his hilt and alaire thought it prudent to follow his example presently two riders rode over the next rise they were several hundred paces away and it was difficult to make out much more than that the newcomers were also muffled in heavy dierenwool coats the two parties regarded one another in an uneasy silence for several moments then the others nudged their horses forward again remember who and what you are naitachal said i think theyre border guards but i dont recognize the livery so im not certain time to assume our new roles alaire said nothing as the men came closer but was fascinated by what they were riding the beasts cer tainly werent horses these creatures were enormous at least four hands taller than their own highbred geldings each animal had a set of enormous branch ing horns like a pair of young trees growing from their heads and larger and more dangerouslooking than any deer could ever boast of their hoofs were cloven but larger than a horses and the length and muscula ture of their legs suggested great speed and agility when he noticed the peculiar color of their coats a rich reddish brown and realized it exactly matched that of his coat he realized what they were dieren he said louder than he had intended naitachal whirled around glaring at him what did you think they were rabbits will you please keep still while i try to establish our credentials the men wore readily identifiable uniforms coats trousers boots even saddles and saddle blankets were identical over the left breast of each coat was a triangular badge with the red and green colors o suinomen flag one of the guards sported brass decorations he was older than the other and that seemed to alaire to guarantee that he was the superior officer of the pair they wore fur hats that looked like gray loaves of bread and seemed more ornamental than practical the hats looked absolutely ridiculous at first but as the guards drew their swords as they approached he decided that maybe the hats didnt look quite as silly as he had thought he had to control the automatic reflex to pull his blade naitachals sword remained in its sheath the dark elf cleared his throat and the two men started king reynard ruler of althea to the south has sent us to represent him we come in peace we would like to speak to your ruler king archenomen naitachal announced in his best minstrels voice the words carried clearly through the chill air the two guards exchanged muffled words before the older guard replied you do not look like ambas sadors look more like bandits to me show us your credentials he spoke with a thick accent making his words difficult to understand for one thing the emphasis was on all the wrong parts of the words for another they rolled the words around in their mouths as if they were gargling at least alaire thought theyre using the same language even if it does come out a little different naitachal sighed sounding more annoyed than anything the younger guard still mounted on his dieren began to advance toward them predictably both naitachals and alaires horses reared up in fright hey alaire shouted fighting to get his horse back under control the horse halfreared again then shied sideways nearly unseating him when he calmed his steed down he looked up to see how naitachals beast was behaving judging by the froth of dark sweat on its neck it was no happier about the dieren than alaires gelding the young man laughed nastily alaire decided at once that the man must be a bully by nature he had that look of unpleasant enjoyment on his face that reminded alaire of an oversized page who had liked to catch the younger boys alone and throw them into the horsetrough you must be from down south after all to be riding such loathsome cowardly beasts never seen one of our riding animals have you good thats how we like it naitachal dismounted and rummaged through his pack finally after a long wait he withdrew the enve lope alaires father had sent with the scroll decl naitachal the official envoy of althea i have a letter from my king to yours if this isnt sufficient naitachal said walking towards the guard to look up at the mounted guard he had to remove the hood when he did so the younger guard then the captain froze in shock dark elf the senior guard shouted what are you doing in our kingdom before naitachal could respond the younger guard pulled his beast back away from him they were both terr of course these people are terrified of magic elves are active practitioners and dark elves are usu ally necromancers naitachal simply raised a calm eyebrow as if he found their fear as nonsensical as a childs fear of beasts in the closet nothing that would violate your honorable laws i assure you king reynard chose me to be his ambassa dor because he trusts me i practice no elven magics either dark or white do not fear me i am only reynards servant the guards regarded them suspiciously they seemed far more concerned with naitachals heritage than his credentials the dark elf frowned well he waved the packet of papers at the guard are you going to look at this or not wed really rather not stand here in the middle of the road for much longer the two guards exchanged looks then the elder said hastily please proceed to rozinki with our blessings if you leave now you should reach the city before nightfall with that the two guards wheeled their dieren about and rode off back down the route they just traveled naitachal stood in the middle of the road watching them ride away and when they were a con siderable distance away he smiled wickedly they rattle easily around here dont they he said alaire sensed a chuckle under his words i suppose so alaire said trying to restrain his own laughter we should get going rozinki sounds pretty good right about now the road they followed showed more signs of travel the ruts made by wheeled vehicles churned up mud and animal droppings all dusted with the remains of a recent light snow naitachal strained his neck and turned his ear forward as if he was trying to hear something ahead the terrain continued to be hilly with the hills gradually rising higher and higher before them they could see nothing from the top of one but the crest of the next and the valley between an icy wintry wind blasted them at each hilltop alaire stopped thinking of the two guards stopped drinking of rozinki stopped thinking of anything except huddling on his saddle and avoiding the wind when they crested the final hill rozinkis sudden appearance below them came as a surprise at first it appeared to be a city of boats and only boats spread beneath them on a huge bay a compli cated network of wood and stone docks surround many of the boats looked like homes as well as a source of income and came in many different sizes and shapes one of these boats a long flat craft docked on the shore nearest them good gods naitachal said i had no idea rozinki was this large he stared down at the bay in silence for a moment interesting all those ships would imply they travel but it certainly isnt to our kingdom so whom are they visiting alaire shrugged the bards eyes moved upwards a bit then stopped and theres the castle alaire followed his gaze to what he had thought was simply a more regular outcropping of stone on the cliff above the bay then his first impression was that it was a military fort not a royal palace then again it was probably both palace and fortification the harsh land probably made the kind of castles alaire knew of impossible squat and round the palace perched in the cliff above the town doesnt look much like a castle alaire said absently as he urged his horse to follow naitachal down a steep section of road how are we supposed to get across this bay the dark elf said nothing as they drew closer to the shore where the road came to a complete stop a clanking bell on the flat boat caught his attention and as the people reacted he realized that this must be a signal the craft was about to leave a ferry alaire thought in surprise he had never seen a ferry large enough to take several laden carts and wagons at once the only ferry he had ever seen could only take a sin gle donkey and its little cart they have a full load already naitachal observed a man and a woman began moving about the boat tying down wheels herding people to benches along the sides or maybe not he added pulling out a purse of coins they rode straight up to the boatmaster hed started to pull the ramps back onto his ship but stopped when he saw the silver the grayhaired boat master seemed as fit as a man of thirty despite his ancient wrinkled face with a visible effort he turned away from the coins shaking his head and saying wordlessly no we can take no more naitachal held up a large silver coin and the boat master paused as if considering he came over and studied the coin and muttered something to nai tachal in a language alaire didnt understand after biting it he grinned widely and motioned for them to board the ferry horses and all alaire dismounted before they were underway and tethered his horse with several other ablebodied passengers he helped the boatmaster pole the craft across the bay the water never got very deep and what had appeared to be a large bay turned out to be a marsh dotted with tiny islands around which other boats were moored a cold icy wind whipped around them and alaire was grateful for the exercise it helped him to limber up and keep warm if the boatmaster was ambivalent about them sev eral of the other passengers were the opposite one man and woman evidently farmers and wearing con servative black and white clothing kept glaring at alaire and naitachal with resentful and suspicious glances must not see too many foreigners particularly from the sunny south he thought remembering to smile when their eyes happened to meet naitachal seemed to take this all without a single sign that he noticed or cared alaire thought that it might be because he got this kind of reaction from hu mans all the time perhaps he was simply playing his part and he had no intention of showing that these folk bothered him soon they arrived at the pier on the other side of the marshy bay and as soon as they docked the suino men natives wasted no time in putting distance between themselves and the newcomers first a bath naitachal announced then we change into something impressive and expensive and go present ourselves properly do you see anything that looks like an inn the language of suinomen closely resembled but was not identical to their own right now the differ ences were enough to keep alaire totally confused he finally ignored the voices and concentrated on simply observing he ought to be able to spot an inn simply by the customers going in and out naitachal led the way down the pier to the main wharf the stone dock ran along the curve of the shore out of sight with little activity near the ferry people and goods appeared further on sailors shouted and cursed in a babble of strange tongues that were more alien than the boatmasters naitachal seemed to know what he was doing he dismounted and led his horse up a stone ramp to a higher street and alaire followed his example on this upper level there were more shops and each had a sign over the door that indicated the shops specialty a wooden fish for seafood a bee for honey wax and candles a bigger fish with a fountain coming out of its head for oil and some kind of meat and ivory product that last sign puzzled alaire he could not imagine what a fish had to do with oil and ivory finally they came across a sign with a crude bed painted on it and behind the inn was a small stable paying for the brief use of a room and bath became an exercise in pantomime but the people here seemed to appreciate silver no matter whose face was on the coins alaire scrubbed himself pink in the communal bath while naitachal cooked himself in the adjoining steam room they returned to their room wrapped in woolen robes supplied by the inn the bardling had had only the briefest glimpse of the clothing his father had supplied for them he almost choked on laughter when he saw his masters outfit now naitachal wore a frilly lacedripping shirt a scarlet goldtrimmed coat and scarlet satin breeches a goldtrimmed scarlet hat with a trailing plume crowned the silverwhite hair the entire outfit was the land of thing young and fool ish nobles in althea would wear to impress one other the kneehigh scarlet leather boots were equally grand and the gold heels were simply the penultimate touch of nonsense no one would be able to fear someone who dressed like that perhaps that was exactly what father had in mind not bad alaire commented trying on his own courtiers garb even if it makes you look like a procurer it does not naitachal protested glancing at his reflection in a doorlength mirror my father would have been proud to see me like this who do you sup pose decided to make it some other color than black father of course alaire said pulling on a boot his outfit was nowhere near as grand as his masters but it felt good to wear fine clothes again he had fallen out of the habit when he started training naitachal after all it hardly made sense to wear silks and satins for sword practice i suspect he wants to emphasize your heritage without suggesting that you might be a practicing necromancer to gain some sort of leverage your father is canny the bard replied my race is impossible to hide so why not announce it as the proverb says if youre going to walk on thin ice you might as well dance he strutted grandly in front of the mirror the gesture was so well unelflike alaire burst out laughing what do you find so amusing human naitachal demanded fiercely alaire snorted to see him standing there hands on hips it just looks as if well youre modeling a dress i do not i have not ever naitachal said indig nantly then he paused sheepishly well truthfully i have he went on to tell alaire about the time kevin and his group dressed up as dancing girls to flee westerin by the time he finished alaire had doubled over in laughter naitachal stood over him with his arms crossed over his chest glaring like a blackandscarlet pom pous peacock well it worked he said at last alaire collected himself and straightened the fine silk shirt and suede breeches think we should carry swords naitachal shrugged of course its expected out here alaire thought he could read something else a brief disturbing expression in the elfs eyes and daggers too he thought buckling the jeweled knives to his belt naitachal led the way out of the inn into the streets of rozinki the stable hands had done an exceptional job of grooming the horses no doubt this and the brief rest had refreshed the beasts which fidgeted and danced on the cobblestone streets of rozinki they certainly knew what cobblestones were they came from the royal stables and had no reason to act as if they had never felt stone under their feet before their antics gave alaire something to think about besides their current situation be young and stupid naitachal said as they guided their horses up the ramps and streets leading to the palace everyone will be certain to ignore you and theyll dismiss anything you might let slip in other words be yourself alaire felt his face grow hot at the sly glance nai tachal cast him but before he could protest he saw for himself the wisdom of such a move i remember the way the elders of fenrich always ignored the young and foolish boys of the village back home perhaps i should chase girls discretely of course remem ber what that one old man used to say about how in the springtime when the blood runs away from the head and the mind freezes the only difference between a young man and a goat is that you can eat the goat when you get tired of its games but dont overdo it naitachal hastened to add oh certainly not alaire said i dont have a silly impulse in my body after all i dont go around wear ing dresses or pouring icecold springwater on my friends even though naitachal said nothing alaire saw the slightest grin of satisfaction on the dark elven fea tures they rode in silence then to concentrate on con trolling their skittish beasts in between hauling his horses head down and curbing his prancing alaire studied the city which followed the hills natural curves high above the castle presided over the town and bay like a squat stony frog all the citys streets led upwards to it the cobblestone streets themselves had seen better days and there were places where the cob bles were missing altogether some of the less populated streets dark in the shadows of decaying stone buildings on either side of them stank of stale beer and urine though not clearly marked these establishments were probably taverns their doors and ironshuttered windows open to air out the fetid inte riors the barkeepers blearyeyed casually threw unconscious drunks into the limestone gutters alaire rode without comment there were always cheap tav erns cheap beer and cheap drunks to populate the first and drink the second there probably always would be then in a more cheery section of town the struc tures were all of wood with more windows to let in light and air instead of thatch lush green moss cov ered the roofs this was obviously a business district and native suinomites swarmed markets and shops all wearing dieren garments of one style or another when they turned to look at the two altheans they stared at their horses everyone else rode the splay footed dieren if they rode anything not another horse was in do you notice anything peculiar naitachal asked quietly as they rode past aisles of merchants hawking fresh vegetables and live poultry alaire had to admit he had but he wasnt sure what it was granted this was a foreign country the lan guage here seemed to be a mixture of their own and one other a heavy guttural tongue that was rough on the ears the city even back in the tavern district was immaculately clean of trash and sewage he could only assume rozinki had an efficient sewer system and equally efficient rubbishcollectors even in s city one found telltale garbage but not here cleanli ness obsessed these humans then he saw what it was that was so unusual here the humans only humans here no white or dark elves no orcs no dwarves the signs also were in the human tongue and there was nothing written in elven dwarven or orcish alaire began to feel very uncomfortable for nai tachal he glanced over at his master relieved to find his ridiculous hat completely covered the top pointed portion of his ears he looked human in every other way though he was the only black human among these people he didnt seem to be attracting nearly as much attention as his gelding this is a very human settlement naitachal noted echoing alaires thoughts only humans yes i see alaire said but let me point out that your absurd hat covers your ears you look human naitachal looked relieved of course i do he said but didnt sound completely convinced his nose wrinkled i must have imagined that smell just then what smell was that the unmistakable odor of tar and feathers by the time they reached the castle the sun pre pared to set on the sea already the air had become considerably frostier alaire wished he had not packed up the dieren coat even if it didnt go with anything he now wore archenomens palace was considerably larger than it had appeared from across the bay a lesser wall sur rounded it perhaps for ornamentation since it did not compare to the castle itself either by design or acci dent it was as black as naitachal every stone every metal fixture every wooden adornment including the twin doors of the main entrance guards dressed much like the ones who had approached them earlier that day came forward with of all the silly things ceremonial spears alaire smoth ered a smile with faint amusement they were thin and gaudy and would never make a suitable weapon he would have preferred his own short dagger in a fight to one of those frail things alaire relaxed know ing no fight was likely to occur in spite of the guards and their arrogant stance state your business one of the guards said with brusque politeness naitachal rode forward and bowed over the neck of his horse we have come to see the king of this land archenomen i am ambassador naitachal rep resenting the kingdom of althea appointed by reynard the two guards conferred privately then one came forward to examine naitachals papers alaire could only suppose that he hadnt identified naitachal dark elf yet his expression was bland as he took the letter and scroll back nodding to the bard the guard said go with him indicating the other guard no horses he added so here they dismounted and stable hands appeared to take their horses the doors were a good two stories high and the knockers were so heavy the guard had trouble lifting one one solid boom announced their presence a small window opened through which the guard spoke to an unseen figure in the unknown tongue he beckoned to naitachal who again relinquished his papers the letter and scroll disappeared through this window and the huge twin doors slowly opened the small figure who greeted them did not inspire fear or confidence alaires first impression was of a man who had risen as far as he could as a servant and still didnt like his position he was old enough alaires father but was thinner and more gaunt naitachal the livery he wore had all the trappings of an upper servants attire though a little less elaborate than what alaire saw at home what struck alaire as odd was the long flowing cloak that trailed behind him the thin fabric was useless for providing warmth the man certainly carried himself as if he thought he was serving in a place far below the rank he truly deserved does he have royal blood alaires first fear however was that the servant would spot him for what he was royalty upper ser vants had a way of spotting these things alaire looked away and tried to appear submissive bowing his head slightly as he had seen his fathers secretary act at home please enter the servant said nervously wel come to the house of archenomen i am paavo the head of the house here the guards inform me that you are ambassadors from althea naitachal said the dark elf and this is my sec retary alaire of house turonen he added improvising i do hope we havent come at an inop portune time its been a long hard ride but i king isnt receiving today we would be pleased to call tomorrow alaire stifled a laugh it would be rude for a king to refuse to see any ambassador with proper credentials his masters statement bordered on the impolite as it suggested that archenomen might commit a blunder by refusing to see them perhaps im assuming too much here alaire thought this is after all a foreign land with its own rules of etiquette for all i know we are the ones being rude calling without prior notifica tion his first impression seemed to be correct paavo quickly ushered them through a grand gallery where three young servants were lighting hundreds of small candles on a chandelier they stared at naitachal as they passed but paid no attention to alaire the bardling wanted badly to gawk and finally decided that the best way to handle this was to do just that if he looked like a highborn idiot the land of young man an envoy might be saddled with he could well be taken for harmless so he gawked the young servants smirked paavo looked pained naitachal caught the ruse and sighed audibly and he and paavo exchanged knowing glances just as we wanted it alaire thought wondering just how far to take the sillyass routine he decided to wait until someone took a keen interest in him before proving there was nothing interesting about him paavo led them to a smaller chamber crowded with people in gaudy expensivelooking clothing though nothing as gaudy as naitachals scarlet glory on a dais at the end of the room there was a gilded throne in that throne was a man who could only be the king he wore a cape of purple velvet lined with ermine and a robe of the same material embroidered with bits of gold and amber a thin delicately trimmed beard covered a thick set of jowls and from his girth it was obvious he ate very well his eyes peered from the white doughy flesh like candied green cherries regarding them with a combination of curiosity and caution around him lay rugs of fur not dieren but possibly bear high above the throne set into the wall and ham mered into brass or even a plate of thin gold was a device of some kind with the prominent letter a in the center two young men boys really stood at attention at either side of the king servants alaire supposed they wore hose and tight formal jerkins with a dou ble skirt of more purple velvet slashed into panes the effect was striking alaire had to admit and began to wonder if the kings personal servants here were rela tives or perhaps favored byblows he stayed several steps behind naitachal as he approached the king and was grateful no one paid the slightest bit of atten tion to him everyone in the royal circle regarded naitachal with cool detachment though alaire detected con cealed surprise in the king he wasnt ready for a black ambassador he noted with amusement wait till the king sees the rest of him with an exaggerated motion naitachal bowed before the king as he removed his absurd feathered hat revealing the two long pointed elven ears pandemonium erupted in the room the king hissed as he drew back in surprise a look of horror and dread coming over his royal features he even held his arms up as if protecting himself from anything origi nating from naitachals general direction the two young servants were guards as well and from stands behind them they drew short swords and took a posi tion halfway between the king and naitachal a moment later large double doors burst open on either side of the throne five soldiers like the ones they had met on the road charged in but froze in their tracks when they saw naitachal behind the soldiers was a tiny trio of magicians with purple robes and ridiculous conical hats who immediately formed a protective circle around the king i think we just made a big mistake this isnt going very well alaire thought as he watched their first attempts at diplomatic relations crumble to dust resi dency in the palace dungeon was beginning to look like a real possibility elf the king roared dark elf why have you polluted us with your presence the soldiers stood their ground shifting nervously the young servantguards stood defiantly inching closer to the dark elf swordtips flashing with reflected candlelight naitachal yawned discretely and smiled your highness paavo interjected politely approaching the king on his throne although he low ered his voice the acoustics were such that alaire could easily pick out what the servant was saying it would seem wise paavo said in hurried hushed tones to remember that despite his unfavor able heritage this is the ambassador from althea i doubt seriously he is here to harm you magically or otherwise perhaps we should hear him out alaire cringed at the insolence never would a ser vant presume to offer advice to the king he thought in indignation then something else occurred to him so perhaps this is no mere servant king archenomen seemed to consider this before snapping his fingers three times quickly the soldiers withdrew slowly uncertainly behind the doors the magicians looking more like religious leaders which perhaps they were remained looking down their long pointed noses at naitachal the two boys returned their short swords to their stands and took their places beside the king i beg pardon your highness naitachal said grandly perhaps i should have sent prior warning about my family he said pausing at the end as if uncertain how to phrase the statement but i did pre sent my credentials and my nature to two of your guards upon the road here perhaps they have not yet reported this to you he raised an eyebrow and the king scowled someone is going to pay for that little omission i bear a letter from king reynard himself perhaps this will explain the situation in a little more detail he smiled a smile so gentle and without guile alaire could almost believe it himself i fear your highness that i have allowed complacency to cause an uncomfortable situation quite the contrary king archenomen said his voice boomed but the slight crack on the last syllable indicated some residual shock im afraid ive over reacted those of suinomen seldom run across citi zens of other countries especially members of less other races he smiled broadly and insincerely lesser races alaire thought completing the sen tence another way and sighed to himself we have our work cut out for us please have dinner with us tonight you may stay in our royal visitors suite will your servant be stay ing with you or should we put him in the servants quarters maddeningly naitachal seemed to consider this when he cast a brief glance in alaires direction alaire thought he sensed the hint of a devious smile you wouldnt alaire thought although he knew that the bard would if he thought it amusing enough after considering this naitachal said indiffere no i will be requiring his presence for secretarial work allow me to introduce alaire although he is my assistant he is near and dear to the kings heart naitachal let this last statement dangle in the air for just the right amount of time with just the right amount of inflection suggesting innuendo near t kings heart could he be implying to his majesty that im a royal bastard the ruse seemed to make sense that would explain my clothes and why im with naitachal otherwise it would look odd the king gazed thoughtfully at alaire then with a knowing look nodded in his direction i see we will be most hospitable to you both naitachal didnt seem to hear this if it is conven ient could we put him in an adjoining room if not he can sleep on the floor of my room what certainly certainly the king said paavo would you please show them their quarters as they filed out of the royal chambers alaire thought indignantly hoping that naitachal would somehow hear the thoughts on the floor really master we are going to have a little talk very soon chapt alaire was glad to find a comfortable if lumpy goose feather bed tucked away in a corner of his room which turned out to be the antechamber to nai tachals quarters the walls were the ubiquitous stone the floors as they seemed to be everywhere in the palace were reddishgold planks of a wood he couldnt identify this explained the pleasant spicy aroma that permeated the rooms naitachal had a plush room with plastered walls and ceiling painted with elaborate scenes of buxom wood nymphs the room unlike alaires had its own fireplace with a chimney of carved stone and an ample supply of fire wood the enormous canopied bed could have accommodated a family of ten i might want to sleep on the floor anyway alaire said standing in front of the fireplace he shivered in the chill that already filled the apartment although it was still early in the evening i doubt that dragging the mattress in here would raise any eyebrows naitachal frowned in a way that was particularly disturbing to alaire they probably expect bizarre eccentric behavior from both of us i must be the first elf of any color most of these people have ever seen i knew that intellectually of course but actually dealing with it is irritating alaire wanted to quiz him more on his first impres sions but a knock sounded on the door a young servant informed them dinner was ready and tha majesty king archenomen requested their presence at the table naitachals look seemed to say well compare notes later as they walked down the torchlit halls to the din ing room where alaire smelled the overpowering aroma of cooked meat and potatoes eating with the king and his court turned out to be a complicated affair a multitiered floor held several long tables each one at a different level it looked rather as if someone had carved narrow platforms into the side of a hill and dropped a section of table onto each one the lower tables were less decorated than the ones atop the one at the apex had a huge cooked pig as its centerpiece the king presided over the event like a judge scrutinizing everyone who came in no queen was in sight and alaire made a note to find out if there was one or if the king had a harem of con cubines as sometimes happened in other distant lands the servant led naitachal to this higher tier and automatically alaire went after them no no no one of the kitchen wenches admon ished waving a wooden spoon she was hauling a kettle of gravy that probably outweighed them both only the ambassador dines with the king you sit down there she said sharply as if he was an idiot and went on with her task alaire didnt like the sound of the phrase down there one bit she led him to a section of tables almost a story and a half below the kings naitachal continued to the head table without him oh well he thought so be it perhaps i can learn something useful down there those of the lowest social order ate here he soon learned even paavo sat a tier above him the head servant sneered down at alaire as he took his seat a miserable little stool at a bare wooden table bad manners at the dinner table are illadv alaire seethed inwardly particularly when everyone has knives alaire found himself at a table lined with suinomen natives who evidently did not speak his language although some of the servants bringing food to the table did alaire appraised their clothing with a knowing eye and guessed that these folk were the servants or secretaries of those above except for one thing every one of them had a cape or cloak of fur the dining hall was a bit drafty but didnt warrant the use of furs he saw around him and he wondered if there was something no one had told them about there always is he saw a flock of young girls at the tables two levels up none of them were particularly attractive at least by his standards and some he even cringed at they watched his table eagerly he glanced up far up where naitachal was sitting and saw right away that the dark elf was too far to offer advice or distraction some of the young women were discreet but oth ers stared openly at him alaire was afraid to return the looks at least too directly even flirting could be dangerous they cant know im a prince he thought frantically i hope naitachal is covering my tracks up there i wouldnt want to become part of a deal now it wasnt only the girls near him who watched him from under their long coquettish eyelashes some of the girls sat at the topmost table with his master an king they must be his daughters if they find ou i really am i could become some sort of bargaining chip aaaargh halfway through the meal alaire noticed an empty wooden cup near his plate occasionally a servant would come by and drop a single flower petal into the vessel and when he looked inside it was half full the petals had something names written delicately on them in an odd script he shuddered considering the possible meanings and ramifications could these petals be a trysting invitation he guessed about thirty petals were in there now and they were still coming gods there wouldnt be any thing left he thought in horror he took extra care not to touch the cup after that better to be cold and dis tant than get into something there would be no getting out of besides the petals the situation was hardly com fortable paavo had claimed they were the guests of honor but he was eating with the kitchen help the food was terrible since the meat was unidentifiable and nearly raw the bread burned or still doughy and the rest all seemed to consist of variations on dried peas and beans cooked in fishoil he was here to observe so he did his best to ignore the food and the girls and keep his eyes open he noticed surreptitious glimpses towards naitachal from the greater nobles some even overtly hostile and he wondered if this was because of his dark elven heri tage or if it was because he represented a co suinomen had chosen to make into an enemy could be a little of both he thought at the first few mouthfuls of mysterymeat his hunger had overcome his aversion now the edge was off his appetite and he wished the evening could just end despite naitachals dark presence at the board of honor the meal became festive with idle chatter in both languages flowing from table to table a servant offered alaire wine but he politely refused knowing that even a little bit in his exhausted state would lay him out on the floor he seldom drank anyway as the meal ended a sixpiece consort struck up some dance music evidently there was no prohibition here against couples dancing and a few of the more bold or boisterous joined in a lively gigue in a section of floor cleared away by the servants alaire took this chance to try to get back to naitachal he encountered a barrier of noblemen and their assistants apparently during dinner word had circu lated that it might be wise to cultivate ambas naitachals acquaintance from what little alaire saw the nobles showed him at least the respect his office deserved however they kept a certain uneasy dis tance from his master who remained a solitary black figure ringed by a moat of stark wooden floors bridged only by the briefest bow and a few hurried words later ill talk to him alaire thought he seems to be doing fine given the circumstances i would only attract attention if i made a point of joining him he backed away from the impromptu receiving line looking for something to do he felt completely useless but then that was the idea at another table sat several apparently available young ladies not of highborn but of some other ranked or wealthy class a young man a teenager really stood in front of the table telling an animated tale of some sort gesturing wildly with his arms in wide sweeping motions the boys striking attire im pressed alaire more than his demeanor did his white and red cloak embroidered with gold thread hung to the side he wore the most unusual gold hos prince had ever seen despite the finery however he looked like an unmade bed half his shirt hung out over his hose and his white scarf looked ready to fall off as he drew closer he saw why the boy was drunk out of his mind alaire thought the boy was telling the women a humorous story in the native language perhaps hes some kind of wellborn court jester alaire thought but as he continued to watch it became obvious that despite the young mans brave and intoxicated at tempts at gallantry the women were laughing at him he was obviously the son of one of the nobles meeting with naitachal given his dress and hed had far too much to drink alaires heart went out to the stranger as he knew too well the stresses a royal court could put on young men and women hes of the age when parents start pairing their children off whether or not they even know each other he thought reminding himself that his father had given him more choices than most noble children it could even be that the poor young ster had just been informed of his impending nuptials and that the bride made one of the dieren look like a better mate better save this lad before he makes a complete fool of himself he decided though he knew it was prob ably too late or at least before he offends someone alaire wasnt even sure the young man spok althean language he approached his target with some trepidation and took him by the elbow to lead him off in what he hoped was a friendly manner he half expected the stranger to swing around and hit him or at least try to escape his rescuer yet in the general confusion with people of all castes milling around and music increasing in volume he led the young man away from the table without arousing his suspicion or apparently his attention alaire took him to a balcony that looked over the courtyard below no one else was out there in the cold and alaire shivered in a wind which bit sharply at his bare skin the young man started to shiver a little as well as he looked about in a land of daze as if he could not imagine how the table full of young women had turned into a balcony good maybe this will sober him up a little alaire gently turned him so lanterns burn ing on either side of the balcony illuminated his face he looked at alaire bewildered as if it was the first time he had noticed him and began babbling in his native tongue alaire shook his head no im sorry whoever you are i dont speak your language at all if i can keep him out here in this cold he might straighten up a little alaire had been drunk exactly twice in his life once on his thirteenth birthday and then more recently at the wedding of the daughter of the mayor of fenrich both times ice applied to the forehead seemed to take care of the more unpleasant side effects this wind was practically the same thing a southerner then the boy said suddenly dont get many of you around here though it was with a heavy accent including a strong rolling of the rs he spoke alaires language clearly without hesitation as the boy sobered he examined the bardling in a way that reminded alaire of the kings look as they entered the youngster even took the sleeve of his shirt and studied the fabric one thing was certain this youngster was not one of the servants he must have said that aloud for the young man started youre no peasant yourself the boy said loudly but it did not sound as if he was trying to be impolite what brings you to rozinki business of a sort alaire said hesitating im alaire an assistant to the ambassador of althea the dark fellow up there with the king ambassador from althea didnt know we even had one his face went sour as if hed bit into a bad apple who wants to discuss kingdom business tonight anyway its not even midnight yet as the boy spoke a puff of breeze blew his breath into alaires face and alaire wrinkled his nose the boy smelled like a brewery how much has he had to drink anyway alaire wondered since he didnt recall seeing him at the din ner earlier there was something about the way he phrased things that made alaire wonder is he some byblow of the royal family too then i suppose youve already had the pleasure of meeting my father the stranger continued sardoni cally the way he emphasized the word father suggested they didnt get along very well well alaire said uncertainly perhaps im sorry but which man was your father he knew he was probably committing a sizable blunder by admitting ignorance but could think of no other way to fin a broad smile creased the strangers boyish fea tures a mischievous gleam that made alaire instantly wary the young man led alaire to the balcony doors where the supper guests were still milling about cir cling around naitachal like curious but frightened little birds about a great black eagle see the big fat man up there in the purple coat the boy asked ungraciously the only person in purple was the king you king archenomen alaire was a this is the crown prince drunk as a soldier on leave prince kainemonen at your service the boy announced bowing an exaggerated bow removing his hat with a sweeping gesture but you can call me kai everyone else does when they dont call me useless wastrel or neerdowell he teetered just a little and alaire gently pushed him upright i think i was an accident i dont look like any of the family pe i was alaire stood frozen in shock at the unasked for reve lations but kai seemed to realize that he was babbling things he shouldnt and interrupted himself with a shrug well probably not such things would be too much an embarrassment i doubt they would have let me live but yes gods help suinomen ill be king whenever father croaks holy heavens he despises his father and himself and he doesnt care who knows it alaire thought with dismay assuming hes telling the truth could be the ale has gone to his mind so he thinks hes a prince but everything else certainly fits his eyebrows raised when he noticed the boys ring a chunky gold piece that flashed when the candlelight caught it just right the large letter a a simplified version of the arche nomen coat of arms i saw hanging over the kings throne perhaps he is the prince after all then again maybe he was only what alaire was pretending to be a royal bastard i might as well keep talking to him whether he is or not even a drunk having grand delusions can supply a lot of interesting information the good news is the boy continued glibly i dont have to do a thing around here just have fun thats what he ordered me to do anyway have fun dont poke my nose into politics or business and stay out of his way alaire wondered just how much to share with kai at home a prince did more than just have fun derek the crown prince of althea and the oldest of the brothers took a personal interest in the affairs of the nation after all he would eventually be in charge of it what better way to learn a job than to do it from the age of thirteen derek had been in on coun cil meetings inspected the palace guard regularly and in general kept abreast of everything going on including alaire assumed this little trip their father sent them on alaire regarded the drunk lad before him and found it difficult to imagine his caring about the affairs of suinomen is that all you do alaire asked he seems to be in quite a talkative mood why not encourage it just about kai replied alaire eyed a marble bench nearby considered moving closer to it in kai should need to sit down father told me to stay out of his business so i do they dont let me do any thing involving the kingdom or the guard and nobody in the kingdom will have anything to do with me except captain lyam and sir jehan remember those names they could be impor alaire thought though it is starting to look like kai might be a dead end for inside information there is a lot of general information i could get from him things the whole court knows but we dont for instance why do they want to invade althea well alaire kai said slapping his shoulder how would you like to flee all this pompous nonsense and go see some real entertainment well why not sure kai alaire said cautiously but i really need to inform my master that ill be going first oh youll do nothing of the sort kai said good naturedly youll get us both into trouble and someone will probably stop us ill have one of the ser vants tell him for us after were gone that didnt exactly sound like a good idea well i dont know about this but he had protested too late come on kai said joyfully grabbing alaire by the wrist this place is getting boring anyway reluctantly alaire let the boy lead him away he had both bad and good feelings about this good because he knew he would learn something about this bizarre kingdom bad because he could tell by the feral gleam in kais eye that they would both be rump deep in trouble when they got back assuming they didnt get rumpdeep in trouble long before they got back got your sword with you kai asked as they dashed down stone stairs at the end of the balcony into the chill night chap kai had obviously planned the deceptively hasty get away in advance a royal carriage lamplit at the four corners and gilded like a maidens jewelcasket was waiting for them just inside the palace walls har nessed to it were two large dieren stomping and snorting eager to get underway but despite the fin ery which left no doubt as to which family it belonged to it was obvious as they drew nearer that the carriage had seen better days somewhat dented and worn from the number of scrapes splintered places and missing bits of trim it had apparently clipped many trees and lampposts when alaire saw the driver a grubby sort of servant in dark rumpled clothes clutching a leather wine flask he knew why it looked that way the driver looked to be as drunk as kai maybe drunker dont worry about him kai said waving casually at the driver who ignored them both he can find the taverns blindfolded thats a relief alaire replied wryly stepping into the carriage the carriage lurched forward and in a few moments it was careening down the hill at full father always does get angry when i take off from official events like this kai shouted over a deafening rattle seating himself awkwardly in the shifting sway ing vehicle says it embarrasses him for me to go off like this with any luck no one will miss me ah there it is kai produced a leather flask and handed it gra ciously to alaire glad i wore at least a thin coat to supper alaire thought watching his frozen breath visible even inside the carriage gods kai probably doesnt even feel the cold in his condition he braced himself in the frigid plush seat stained with wine and beer and who knew what else he took only a small sip and returned it not too bad a red fruity party wine just the thing for young inexperienced tastes nothing like the wine he would have had at home for supper he respected good naitachal would have killed him if he had simply gulped the stuff with no care for anything but alcohol content and after that bout of sickness and hangover at thirteen he had learned to respect what bad wine could do kai naturally took a long swallow of the decadent stuff probably strong too a quick cheap drunk it was difficult to talk or drink in the swaying vehi cle they rode for some time while kai did most of the babbling sometimes shifting into his native lan guage mostly useless blather alaire realized after a moment although it was hard to hear over the loud clatter the wooden cage kai had imprisoned him in was going full tilt as fast as the dieren could go alaire guessed twice huge potholes violently jostled the carriage contents landing alaire in the floor and kai on alaires lap laughing hysterically the rear axle made a strange grinding noise which got louder as their journey progressed what lethargy alaire felt earlier had evaporated now his blood roared in his ears he clutched the sides of the carriage and feared for his life whoooooeeee kai said as the vehicle slowed to a halt then gracelessly stopped he tumbled onto the floor as the carriage lurched once more wanta go back and do that again alaire politely but vehemently refused no where are we where do you think kai said getting off the car riage floor where he had landed where the real fun is in the happy part of town he tumbled out the door leaving alaire to follow alaire emerged from the carriage knees shaking and stepped down onto cobblestone without com ment he noticed one of the carriage lamps had shaken free and fallen to the street somewhere behind them also a spoke in one of the wheels was missing grateful to be on solid ground again alaire looked quickly around the street where they had stopped it was a narrow cobblestone avenue in an old part of town lined on either side by many cheap illkept tav erns a few torches lit the streets with too many shadows for alaires comfort a small group of men staggered out the door of the tavern nearest them singing and leaning on each oth ers shoulders alaire had hoped to be able to let his guard down but when he saw the great contrast between their clothing and everyone elses he shud dered might as well paint a target on our backs attack us were rich he thought good thing nai tachals got most of the money but strangely no one seemed to pay them any par ticular attention the street crowd rough workers neerdowells loafers probable thieves who knew what else all seemed hellbent on getting drunk that night as did kai the crown prince led him down the long four story canyon of bars brothels and places that of entertainment alaires eyes nearly fell out of his head when he saw an advertisement for a show some thing for everyone he thought that is everyone except nonhumans not a sign of elves orcs or dwarves anywhere kai led him directly to the first tavern on the right carved on the wooden sign hanging over the door dulled with age was the image of a large dragon on its back its legs sticking straight up the tongue lolled lifelessly to one side the dead dragon inn alaire read deciphering the strange but legible suinomen script charming here we go kai said cheerfully stepping over an unconscious man blocking the doorway first stop of how many alaire asked not expecting an answer the tavern was small cramped and smokefilled through the haze alaire made out about a dozen tables lined up on either side of a long narrow room barmaids scurried from table to table balancing wooden steins on teetering trays serving rowdy cus tomers fending passes keeping up with the orders in one corner a musician played a harp singing some ballad in the suinomen tongue his presence sur prised and cheered alaire who had resigned himself to enduring the bellows and howls of drunks beauti ful maybe this will be fun after all kai stood glaring at everyone in the tavern alaire finally noticed this he thought the boy was looking for a place to sit then he saw he was looking for something else entirely you there in the pansy outfit a large drunk man roared from the nearest table this here be the adults bar the nursery it be down the street now git an odd silence fell over the tavern with the excep tion of the harpist who continued playin though alaire clearly saw the harpists muscles tense and his legs brace for a quick escape alaires hand crept close to the hilt of his blade fully half the tavern turned to look at them as a few got up and made a hasty exit the table in question glistened with spilled ale five men sailors perhaps had claimed it as their own the candle burning in the center was cheap fat and guttering illuminating their bearded faces in brief unpleasant flashes these were not pretty men nor from the number of broken noses and scars were they strangers to a fight a fight that would probably not stay or even start fair alaire saw far too many scars on hands and arms marks which could only have come from sharpened steel and given their present mood a joyless surly one that could quickly turn to violence they seemed ready eager to add a few more scars to their collection kai seemed to revel in the attention he gazed at them belligerently five sets of bleary aleshot eyes glared back actually four and a half one of them has an eye patch kai grinned nastily looks to me like you boys need a mother to clean up after you look at that table turning to alaire he added i think weve al ready walked into the nursery orphanage more like orphans so ugly no one wants to take them in kai shut up alaire wanted to scream im good with the sword but not that bloody good he briefly considered pulling the boy out of there before a fight started by the hair if necessary except that he didnt think hed be able to get them out of there intact kai would certainly fight him probably yell further insults at the sailors and without a doubt would precipitate the fight the prince seemed to want instead alaire did the only thing he could do he watched the table waiting for the tensing of muscles that would signal an attack what about your friend there one of the toughs asked pretty boy as he is makes me wonder is he your wife or do you two like to dress up like girls to make people think youre highborn dont bother to guess kai snorted dont bother to think youre not equipped for it whered your mothers find you five anyway under a rock some where no wonder they didnt want to keep you he grinned slyly not a chance they could ever find five men or even one ugly enough to claim paternity the five were slow to react but they reacted prob ably the bit about paternity alaire suspected that last jibe triggered the expected muscletensing they might have been dense but they werent that stupid and kai had just called them all bastards now come on boys we dont want no troub the dead dragon inn one of the barkeeps said in a wheedling voice but it was too late the men ignored him as if he was a fly annoying but powerless they rose as one with fire in their eyes and snarls on their faces i was beginning to wonder if you boys were too drunk to stand up kai said laughingly and pulled his sword as alaire pulled his the two nearest them came after kai armed with short curved swords of a kind hed never seen before how the devil do you counter those he thought in confusion and are they going for blood or they were the tall uglier one with a full face of hair that looked like a birds nest smelling of ale and sweat and salt water charged him with a bloodcurdling scream swinging his short blade in a way that left no doub alaires mind kai had managed to work this one at least into a killing rage wonderful just wonderful alaire engaged the short sword clashed with his longer blade and alaire suddenly discovered why the blade was curved the sailor bound his longer blade before he had a chance to think and nearly pulled it out of his hand he disengaged only to find his blade bound again this time he backpedaled a few steps and freed his sword again the tough came after him still full of fighting fury cant let him take my sword he still had his jew eled dagger tucked away under his shirt but that would never do against their weapons the sailor bobbed and wove like a snake forcing alaire to make desperate deflections that were nothing like any of the fighting styles naitachal had taught him if only nai tachal was here but knowing the dark elf he would probably sit back and watch alaire get out of this one himself he walked into it without naitachals help after all i was only after information kai moved into the periphery of his vision a blur of flashing metal and fine white fabric fighting two of the uglies by himself he might be drunk but he sure fights well in fact he was keeping up amazingly well with his two opponents each by himself twice kais size one of them had a gashed and bleeding wrist kai was still untouched in fact kai was having the time of his life he wanted this to happen just like thought alaire flushed with sudden anger when he got hold of kai hed beat the living daylights out of him but first he had to survive this brawl to do that he had to stay calm and think his way out easy now anger and fear are the mind clouders he calmed as naitachal had taught him concentrated everything on the moment of now his opponent seemed to slow and alaire saw the disadvantages of that odd little sword the moment of opportunity opened and alaire struck for it this time alaire bound the toughs blade and pulled it away it dropped to the floor between them before the sailor could reach for it alaire kicked it into hidden shadows under the tables weaponless the man lost all the courage that ale had given him he turned and fled leaving alaire to find another oppo nent get these two off kai he thought but there were five whered the othe a sword flashed at the edge of his vision and he ducked out of the way just in time the shwwoooosh of the blade loud in his ears in the corner the harpist was manfully trying to play on singing ill go no more roving as a strange counterpoint to the dance of death in the front of the tavern alaire did not even bother to reflect on how close that last strike had come for this new opponent had committed a little too much to the stroke and was off balance before he could recover alaire slapped his blade aside and thrust it was not even a serious attack but it caused the other to stagger hastily back wards tripping and falling backwards over one of the frail little stools in an effort to save himself arms flail ing wildly the man fell into three tables knocking their contents wooden steins mostly clanking and splashing in all directions with a roar of anger one of the customers grabbed his emptied stein and broke it over the toughs head taking him out of the fight com pletely kai wher he glanced frantically around at first unable to see his companion then the white blur reappeared from the shadows an angry little whirlwind that showed no sign of exhaustion by now half the bars customers had cleared out prudently but a fair number remained some waging bets that kai would come out unscratched amazingly this lot acted as if the fight was some kind of entertain ment staged for their benefit almost as if they had expected it that little maniac alaire seethed he wasnt fighting two anymore but three and they were huge but their size was a handicap in the bars compact interior kai was still wearing that grin of sardonic enjoyment and he had already given them a few bloody nicks alaire paused at that before throwing himse kais rescue is he playing with them he wondered kai had a wild feral look on his face no sign of fear only pleasure of the most animal sort instead of flinging himself into the fight alaire joined the spectators for a moment given the alaire had seen him display so far he came to the con clusion the crown prince could have killed all of the toughs by now if he had truly wanted to he was in no danger he never had been in any danger not from the very first he was enjoying this and that explained the relaxed attitude of the onlookers probably regulars and familiar wit prince they had known this was going to happen the moment kai walked into the bar alaire was angry all over again his attitude really stinks reckless foolish starting fights when he has no business doing so and pulling me right along with him he didnt know i could fight he could have got ten me killed all right break it up a loud authoritative voice boomed behind him alaire turned to see three uniformed men guards of some kind standing in the doorway they wore gray cloaks with gold braid shiny black boots and a single silver star badge over the breast and disapproving looks the watch alaire thought constables wonderful now hes going to get us thrown into the local gaol alaire tried to sheathe his sword before one of the constables could catch him with it in his hand but it was too late the one nearest him caught him in the act oh gods now what he thought dismayed what have i got into the entire population of the tavern froze kai glanced over his sword raised in midslash looking disappointed his opponents backed away slithering towards the rear exit where more of the officiallooking men appeared blocking their way you and you the first man said pointing at kai and alaire come with me now alaire briefly toyed with the notion of running like a scared rabbit once they got outside heaven only knew what penalties were waiting for them he didnt think diplomatic immunity extended to tavernbrawling he looked to kai for cues but the boy seemed defeated sullen as if cheated of some bizarre pleas ure he sheathed his sword with an air of disgust alaire did the same and followed the uniformed men into a store room stacked high with ale kegs no chance to run here he noted however with interest and hope that the constables didnt ask for their blades diplomatic immunity after all do they know me already i must have some kind of diplomatic immu nity in this situation alaire thought frantically no they couldnt possibly know who and what he was yet not down here in the city but kai he has something better hes the prince does he do this often enough for the constables to recognize him would his rank cover me as well could i try a little bardic persuasion no better not he paled remembering there were severe penalties for using magic better not even think too directly about that the uniformed men instructed them to sit and kai sat on the top of an upturned keg carefully dusting it off first so as not to soil his clothing his long legs dan gled awkwardly over the edge he didnt seem too concerned about the situation but then he hadnt been concerned about picking a fight with five men who were all much bigger than either himself or his companion whats going on alaire said to kai finally unwill ing to play the guessing game any longer are we going to gaol or do we need to bribe someone kai waved the question away as if it didnt matter dont be silly neither i just need to see he started then another man entered the door to the storeroom and his face lit up a broad slightly ridicu lous grin spread across his boyish features the uniformed man this one in solid black with a larger golden star on his lapel perhaps indicating higher rank strode in sweeping them all with a single glance from the way the others deferred to him he was obviously their superior ah what do we have here at the dead d inn this time he began then stopped when h kai well hello there mac kai said legs dangling against the keg what brings you to this infamous part of town oh gods mac said his face falling is this what i get for being a watch commander and your fathers friend from university putting up with your antics whenever you get a wild idea and a little too much wine in your belly he walked over to kai shaking his head and this time he continued glancing over at alaire you brought an accomplice just what i need i suppose its the same old story i didnt start it kai and mac said in unison one of the macs men laughed discreetly behind his back mac sighed of course of course but why cant you not start it in your own playground hmm dont you have enough young swordsmen in that court of yours to keep you busy weve been through this before kai admonished shaking a finger reprovingly at the watch com mander they would never kill me or even dare to spill a single drop of my royal blood that takes all the fun out of it here on the other hand at places of such high repute as this inn and others in the neighbor hood i have a more sporting chance of fighting someone not afraid to kill me therefore the chal lenge therefore the fun therefore my headache mac retorted at least you can take care of yourself you seem to be unhurt and strangely not dead drunk jet you drink more than all of my men combined kai laughed as if he found that terribly funny ha but the evening is still so young mac grimaced its an hour past midnight kai waggled his head from side to side mockingly my day is just beginning mac seemed about to reply but instead he just gave up abruptly so be it he said after a long pause just do me one small favor yes kai said sweetly dont kill anyone tonight hmm theres no more room in the morgue all the slabs are full and with this parting sally the watch commander turned and left the black cloak swirling behind him his minions followed him out the door kai jumped down to his feet his enthusiasm appar ently renewed come on what are you waiting for lets go his infectious grin was back theres hours left till dawn where alaire wanted to know though he had a sinking feeling he already knew the answer the next tavern of course alaire sighed the streets population had doubled in the brief time they were in the dead dragon inn party time in suinomen alaire thought sourly the crowds parted for them most apparently rec ognizing the crown prince it isnt just the clo alaire thought there was something else about the way he carried himself despite his relative small size that commanded the attention of everyone around him he acted like he owned the street the buildings the town and being the crown prince this was prob ably not too far from the truth but without a doubt given the way the commander had reacted when he had seen kai prince was no stranger to this part of town those who made this place their regular haunt probably did know him and given his propensity for picking fights by now it was very likely that there wasnt a local who would rise to his challenge though they also wouldnt bother to warn a stranger probably he provides a lot of entertainment for them given the way the people in the dead dragon were acting lovely the clown prince though right now he was walking and strutting like a bantam rooster eager for another fight swaggering about with an air of importance that alaire found distasteful this air seemed to coincide with kais increased consumption of alcohol he also observed but he didnt know what to do about it or even if he could do anything about it the next bar called ominously the hair o dog turned out to be a discreet drinking estab lishment for noblemen looking for cheap thrills but still wanting some of the trappings of home to make them feel comfortable a man dressed suspiciously like the palace guards carefully checked their creden tials after kai vouched for his companion they entered an establishment which bordered on the luxu rious discrete amenities like wellcushioned chairs elegant crystal glasses instead of the awkward wooden tankards of the previous inn and a guard or two placed inconspicuously in the shadows lent it enough of an air of wealth to satisfy most highborn alaire liked the place at first sir jehan kai shouted almost as soon as they were in the door waving to someone he gr alaires elbow come over here alaire i want you to meet someone he headed straight for a small gathering around one of the wooden tables no doubt the center of attention was sir jehan but this worthy was not the young nobleman alaire had thought kai would introduce him to jehan was closer to the kings age in fact and that made him oddly suspicious for kai had no reason to greet someone like this as a cupcompanion why would he befriend the prince when nobody else would sir jehan was a dark handsome fellow with graying beard and hair sitting in a thronelike chair sur rounded by roughlooking men bodyguards and tavern wenches without a doubt he was holding court ah kai my dear boy sir jehan said conde scendingly i wondered when you would be out and about tonight three or four of the entourage greeted their entrance but for the most part the attention remained affixed to the nobleman without waiting for an invitation kai pulled up a bench and sat at their huge table motioning for alaire to do the same immediately two barmaids appeared eager to take his order and his money kai ordered two carafes of vintage red wine and two glasses one for himself and one for alaire wine on ale ye gods what a fool alaire thought the last time he had gotten drunk and ill was with this same combination but hed barely had any of the ale at supper and he was too busy dealing with the fight kai created at the last stop to have any more it will probably be all right if im careful after sit ting down with this group he had pretty much resigned himself to drinking a little for appearances at least here i can have the good stuff hangovers from cheap wine are horrible sir jehan stared at alaire for a long moment before returning his own attentions to the bevy of blowsy beauties he had gathered about him like ants swarm ing a drop of honey please dont ask about me alaire prayed not knowing what he would say if the noble man did inquire about him im just a nobody a nonentity remember that everybody but does the prince usually keep company with nobodies with anybody time to play the fool again the wine arrived and before the barmaid had set the tray down alaire managed to jostle her clumsily just a little in an awkward and inexpert attempt to steal a kiss it was enough to topple one of the glasses and invoke laughter from the table alaire grinned his most stupid grin and tried to look as silly as possible sir jehan no longer paid atten tion to him apparently having decided he was no longer worth paying attention to oh dont worry about that kai said righting the glass see you didnt even break it you arent going to drink from the carafe again are you my dear child sir jehan said over the breast of a young woman who had managed to drape herself across his lap you looked like someone had run you through with all that red wine covering you a titter of laughter rippled among those assembled but kai didnt seem to mind of course not im not a total barbarian after all he poured two glasses expertly and gave one to alaire drink up the evenings still young was that a rumor i heard about you picking a fight over at the dead dragon jehan said obviously bait ing him he held a large wineglass in one hand and helped his lap decoration drink hers or did you really get into trouble so soon a wicked grin passed across kais face before an audible gulp from the glass smothered it would i do such a thing yes jehan replied well then theres your answer while alaire sipped his wine and kai guzzled his he observed sir jehan discreetly the litter of empty wineglasses and carafes suggested some heavy imbib ing but he soon realized that they were not al jehans those around him were in various stages of drunkenness and indeed jehan was encouraging this pouring wine the moment someones glass was empty or only half empty toasting laughing ordering more but jehan wasnt really drinking perhaps as much as alaire was a sip occasionally while the others were going through entire carafes sir jehan nursed a single glass odd alaire thought hes not really as drunk as the others but hes sure acting like he is why wh jehan doing here spying on kai perhaps that could be it but he doubted the mans effi ciency given the circumstances jehan seemed more interested in the dubious charms of the women around him and at any rate he could only spy on kai when kai was with him but he already knew about the disturbance a dead dragon were other spies watching them jehan have a network of watchers who brought him word while he sat at his ease here like a spider in the center of a web that was an unpleasant perhaps unjustified anal ogy sir jehan could be keeping an eye on kai for his own good that had to be it hes watching the prince to see that nothing happens to him while hes out carousing since i doubt anyone could stop him at least this keeps him from getting himself into real danger kai definitely needed someone to watch over him keep him out of trouble and bail him out if he fou alaire felt a great deal of relief at that so jehan was not someone he needed to be terribly concerned about he decided since he wasnt betraying his mis sion to kai or anyone else he only hoped his performance thus far into the evening was convincing absentmindedly without meaning to alaire fin ished his glass and kai refilled it instantly cant afford to get drunk tonight he touched his lips to the rim and since no one was looking lowered it without sipping i bid you all good evening sir jehan said grandly rising to his feet my little flock and i have other plans dont we pretty ones amid a chorus of gig gles all of the females seated also stood and for a moment alaire thought he was going to invit prince to share his companions the other men left the table wordlessly seeking the exit some visibly disappointed at sir jehans high handed appropriation of every woman at the table jehan and his flock vanished up a flight of stairs say ing no more if the crown prince felt left out he didnt show it alaires opinion of him raised considerably while not a prude alaire had been more than a little uncomfortable with jehans blatant pawing of the tavern girls he might be a drunkard but kai would seem to set higher standards on women than on wine a small miracle given his youth and his lust for adventure no not adventure alaire corrected himself misadventure together they sat alone at the big table while bar maids scurried to refill the carafes and kai proceeded to tell him his lifes story it would have been easier to understand him if he hadnt lapsed into his native tongue a time or two but alaire caught the gist of what he was trying to say anyway you know sir jehan is one of the best men in the whole country of suinomen kai slurred hes been my friend since i was thirteen and was the only one who showed any interest in my future why sir jehan he gave me my first drink in this very bar four five years ago and youve been drinking ever since you really are a decent person ill bet when youre sober di jehan turn you into a drunk or did you do that all by yourself alaire trying his best to play his role though he was found himself becoming quite annoyed with his princely friend that kai could get them both killed particularly if he picked another fight in his worsened condition didnt bother him nearly as much as kais deteriorated personality he had been drunk at the start of this carouse true but now he was becoming disgusting but kai was rambling on in that disjointed fashion of drunks everywhere and you my friend you must have been here before i know you from somewhere and we used to be best friends are best friends you saved my life back there with those sailors did you know that alaire finished off his glass of wine and kai of course refilled it as he sipped this one he recalled what kai just said about sir jehan and this bar jehan got him started drinking and he encouraged kai to drink himself drunk just now and the man wasnt a drunk himself very odd that back in fenrich he remembered the drunks were usually the ones who encouraged heavy drinking particularly in those who drank little now sir jehan seemed sinister again for jehan didnt fit that pattern he had hardly drunk enough for the wine to affect him but acted as if he was as inebri ated as kai he might have another motive for he kai become and remain a drunk there was more to the picture that he wasnt see ing whatever jehans motives were they couldnt be good what is it about that man that rubs me the wrong way meeting him had shed some light however dim on kais relationships within suinomen meanwhile lets encourage this notion that im an old friend likely as not he wont remember a thing tomorrow if hes like the other drunks i knew back at the village i might have been here some time back alaire began my parents they liked to travel in fact i met someone who looked an awful lot like you you did how long ago was this oh i must have been about fifteen four years ago anyway we stayed at this wooden lodge on a large lake although he was making a wild guess he knew there had to be a large lake somewhere based on the amount of water hed seen in the land so far and since most buildings consisted of wood he fig ured a wooden lodge was a pretty good bet as well kais eyes widened was that you alaire shrugged might have been he replied distantly kai gestured excitedly in his chair oh it was it must have been it was you alaire i remember now i remember it all that summer the royal family decided to have a peasants holiday and you were there my best friend we swore that oath of eternal friendship but my father didnt approve i thought hed forced your parents to take you away to some awful place althea and id never see you again kai leaned over and hugged alaire for what seemed an eternity the barmaid gave them an odd look alaire rolled his eyes not the impression i meant to convey alaire thought although this new level of trust promised to be very useful at the next tavern kai got down to some serious drinking this place had no sign no real front door to find the tavern they had left the main street to a darker more shadowy alley through which alaire walked clutching the hilt of his sword is this really a place we need to go alaire had whispered as kai led him into the darkness he found it difficult to envision the tavern that would be in this end of the district twice they stepped over motionless forms lying across their path one of whom had lost his belt and whatever had hung on it his cloak and any thing that had been in his pockets which hung inside out the other was probably passed out drunk kai seemed more in his element here than at the previous two places they entered the establishment through an entrance practically invisible from the alley which was just as well if you didnt know where the place was you probably didnt belong there the tavern keeper knew him by name greeting him simply as kai not sir or your highness do they even know hes a prince alaire wondered but then they didnt use titles at the other taverns and sir jehan certainly knew kai was the crown prince its almost as if he is ashamed of the title alaire con sidered as they settled down into a semiprivate booth this one with blood stains on the wall kai didnt appear to notice he might have been responsi ble for them being there in the first place so whatll it be this time kai asked enthusiasti cally alaire had managed to drink only four glasses of wine or ale that evening in spite of the pressure to drink much much more he even managed to act a little drunk to blend in with the masses but his stom ach and his head were both sending warning signals to him if he drank much more he would get drunk or worse and be completely useless in a fight which in this area of town seemed highly likely oh whatever youre drinking alaire said and kai ordered up three large steins of some foul looking brew called dogbolter two were for kai on alaires when he looked down he saw that twigs were floating around in it heaven only knew what else was in it tasty alaire said without trying it if i dump this on the floor he wont even notice the floor is already so sticky anyway that another quart of muck wont matter alaire made ready to anoint the floor with his gift from kai when a disturbance at the door distracted him the watch again alaire saw the four uniformed men before kai did the boys powers of observation had dwindled to next to nothing they were halfway across the bar before the prince noticed them turned pale and ducked behind both of his steins peering furtively between them theyre not after us alaire whispered not sure if this was even true the four uniformed men turned towards the rear of the tavern in the shadows alaire could make out a terrified middleaged man and an equally terrified older one sitting at a small table at the very back kai exhaled loudly glad it wasnt us he said thought for sure theyd changed their minds and decided to take me in show me a lesson different group alaire observed different uni forms too theyre all black like the commanders instead of gray black uniforms kai asked and peered around the booth at the unpleasant scene developing behind him apparently seeing the men clearly for the first time no not here what the barkeep went over rattling something in their native tongue it looked like he was trying to vouch for the two sitting at the table but was having no luck finally the barkeep handed over several gold coins they were going to take him in along with those two for serving them kai informed him gold is the best bribe of all here why are they taking those people in alaire asked but kai stared without answering the uni formed men took the two away roughly shoving them towards the door the moment they were gone kai returned his attention to the table and his brew magicians kai snorted in contempt unlicensed magicians damn fools dont ever learn this is what naitachal was talking about alaire thought in sudden fear careful now dont want to pry too blatantly here he noticed kai fishing one of the twigs out of his brew with a silly grin he used it to stir his drink but then again as drunk as he is right now is it going to matter im his longlost best friend after all those guys werent the regular watch were they he asked oh no they were swords of the magicians asso ciation special lawenforcement troops there he took another long swallow from the stein alaire blanched then they ba brr ah kais eyes rolled up in his head momentarily as his head tilted forward alaire thought he was going to bang his head on the table but he recovered just in time ah what was i saying is it dawn yet alaire had no clue what time it was though it couldnt be too far from daybreak the association you were telling me all about them oh right the troops the elite of the enforce ment arm of the magicians association alaire strove to look innocent and interested are they the ones who enforce the laws regarding magic kai stared at him for a long moment his head wob bling slightly should i continue this discussion tomorrow alaire wondered he looks like hes ready to pass out after all hes had to drink he should have passed out hours ago not them the association thats all they do look for unlicensed magic going on kai blinked owlishly then the association sends out the swords to bring the poor fools in for punishment thats what that was probably all about there at the table alaire tilted his head to one side and looked puz zled unlicensed magic how does one go about getting a license kai wrinkled his nose you dont know alaire shrugged i havent been here very long takes a lot of gold more than that barkeep had kai shrugged but without one too bad licenses which im assuming most of your citi zens dont have alaire continued probing thinking that it was a miracle kai was so coherent kai nodded and took another pull of his mug thats right the nobles think they should be the only ones to have magicians you can only perform magic in the association hall with very rare excep tions arranged well in advance and paid for in advance sure but what about people like the two in here and those who dont want to bother with that he continued delicately kai laughed nervously the association sends out their troops to catch the perpetrators then fines the one who paid for the unlicensed magic double what the licensed version would have cost a good incentive to pay for the license and what what about the magician the one who actually did the magic kais face lost all expression and he leaned forward to whisper he goes to the prison of souls alaire shivered at the name gods that sounds awful well said kai showing some real if ghoulish interest it is let me tell you about it he did alaire wished he hadnt they put their bodies in casketlike boxes for a minimum of one year and use crystals to capture their souls they do everything in a room deep unde hall alaire shook his head this was magic unlike any thing he had ever heard of i can see the point of imprisoning them but crystals with souls in them why kai lowered his voice still more they use the souls to help fuel the licensed magic so that they dont have to expend personal energy for spellcasting thats the real punishment you see alaire fought to maintain a neutral face but inside he was frantic this is necromancy tell me more kai it gets worse he said with a kind of ghoulish excitement like a child telling a ghost story for every year a magician spends in the prison his body ages twenty so a young man of twenty will come out a year later as a man of forty if he is stupid enough to get caught for a major crimeofmagic or to get caught a second time sixty or eighty i even hear of a mage who got sentenced to a term of five years when they let him out he staggered into the light hardly moren a skeleton fell dead on the spot in the associ hall the story horrified alaire a completely nonviolent way to mete out the most cruel punishment that must be why the people the kings people put up with it it works no violence on the mage directly so it must be perfectly just and equitable no im not likely to be working any bardic magic in suinomen but dont worry there arent any magicians around here the prince glanced back at the empty table at least not anymore kai polished off the two steins and ordered another alaire wondered if he should say something kais consumption no i doubt that would be useful hes going to drink whether or not i try to stop him so it proved after a while kai slipped into his own tongue and alaire simply nodded and grunted at appropriate intervals some time later after kai had been babbling on in his own language for a good long while alaire did manage to get him to his feet and pointed towards the door when they got outside it was already daybreak kai groaned when the early morning sun hit his face alaire felt a certain amount of pleasure at that you werent expecting that were you he asked but got no reply he escorted kai back to the main street a curiously silent place now that the sun was out save for one loud drunk singing in the gutter soon he found the carriage with the driver passed out inside du kai on the seat he roused the driver and with ges tures managed to convey the need to return to the palace slowly and with considerably less enthusiasm than when they arrived the carriage moved for ward though not hung over alaire felt tired kais little rampage had taken quite a bit out of him maybe if i could just sleep a little on the way back but he couldnt tired as he was sleep wouldnt come he couldnt get the awful image of caskets and crystals out of his the prison of souls alaire murmured to kais sleeping form gods naitachal what are we about to get into here chapt as naitachal had expected the dinner in their honor was a grand affair with all the correct seating strategies to turn it into a political event as well dark elf sat with the king and other nobles at a high table giving him a birdseye view of the dining hall the king however seemed more intent on making a favorable impression on his subjects than discussing politics with naitachal they exchanged perhaps a halfdozen words during the entire dinner after which king archenomen excused himself though not before promising naitachal a formal meeting the next day in his chambers to discuss matters of state which was just fine with naitachal given his exhaustion wine poured freely but he only pre tended to indulge knowing that if he did in his present state he would likely make a fool of himself and in turn of althea no that would not do at all he was a little put out that they did not seat alaire next to him but to maintain alaires false identity he said nothing after all alaire was a servant it wont kill him and he might even learn something after supper naitachal spent what seemed like hours getting acquainted with the highborn of suinomen but as he became accustomed to some of their nuances of speech he realized he was little more than an oddity and they were more interested in his race an elf and a dark elf at that than his appointme ambassador of althea from what he gathered from their fragments of conversation no one really seemed to want a war or even know that the king had made threats that the king allowed him to mingle so freely seemed odd if these folk intended a fight with althea shouldnt they spirit its ambassador off to his private quarters after supper to better control what he saw and heard instead they left him to his own devices the worst was the surreptitious glances as he walked past their huddled groups he soon grew tired of their impolite stares until these people grew used to him and treated him as something other than a freak he preferred the company of alaire the king or no one at all one particular nobleman a count or the closest equivalent to that tide showed a little more respect than the others he was a middleaged man wearing a fine fur jacket trimmed with silver which matched his thick head of graywhite hair he had also been indulging generously in the wine at dinner and was eager to talk in short an excellent source of dropped information in spite of his desire to find his bed and sleep for a day he entertained this count takalo slyly turning the conversation around to international relations between althea and suinomen couldnt be better the count brayed in a fine baritone voice that rattled all the crystal goblets within reach in fact im hoping to establish free trade soon naitachal nodded wisely im sure althea would reciprocate particularly if the trade involved dieren that is if you were willing to part with some of your herds the counts expression turned crafty i wouldnt know about that the plan i like best involves selling dieren of only one sex is that why youre here to talk trade naitachal smiled smoothly king reynard sent me to discuss several things during this conversation he noticed alaire talking to someone who appeared to be of noble birth given his elaborate dress at first this alarmed him alaires role put him lower on the social ladder than this other highborn lad then he relaxed realizing that if the stranger chose to speak to alaire they might learn something useful and if alaire did commit a social blunder it shouldnt really matter much they were after all silly foreigners emphasis on silly for alaire hope he doesnt overdo the stupid naive countrylad pose if he gets into any trouble hes likely to be on his own but naitachal noted with satisfaction that the bardling was still wearing his blade count takalo apparently noticed the direction nai tachal was looking and nodded at alaire and the other young man would that be your assistant i saw you with earlier yes it would naitachal replied he raised an eye brow at the younger mans antics the boy was obviously drunk very drunk whos that with him the count shrugged as if the boys behavior was of little importance oh thats the crown pr kainemonen the elf raised both his eyebrows at this prince but hes making a complete fool of himself in public doesnt his father care ach the count said in obvious embarrassment im afraid he drinks a little more than he should hes young but i hear the king was the same way when the count spoke of the royal family his voice lowered the king hes afraid the prince might want the throne a little early if you know what i mean naitachal decided to feign naivete well no i dont do you mean a revolt perhaps the count shook his head im not so certain of this but the king seems rather fearful of the prospect i cant imagine anyone taking kai seriously but there is always the possibility of someone using him as a puppet i suppose no doubt is the prince always well intoxicated naitachal asked delicately the count considered this a moment not always there are some lucid moments when the suns up naitachal sighed as if contemplating the sins of youth this younger generation i just dont know i wonder how such a lad could inspire enough trust for a revolution it doesnt seem likely i must agree the count replied yet the fear still exists he seemed uncomfortable discussing such delicate matters and promptly changed the su how long will you be staying here that much im not certain naitachal said but perhaps you can recommend some sights while we are here the conversation continued in a less dangerous vein and soon a large bosomy woman apparentl counts wife snatched him up the count bid him good night weariness settled over the dark elf like a heavy cloak he knew he should stay and fish for more infor mation here among these men but he was just too tired from the journey to make the effort also the remaining noblemen had begun talking among them selves and didnt seem to be receptive to admitting any stranger into their pockets of conversation the evening had suddenly become boring now i remember why i cant stand court functions thinking of soft beds and warm fireplaces and a muchneeded rest naitachal extracted himself from the gathering and strode out of the great hall seeking his quarters but the information he had gathered left him with plenty of food for ponderings the crown prince strange naitachal thought very very strange as he puzzled over the exchange with count takalo he wished alaires mother queen grania were here she would have dissected and devoured that group back there with ease and they would have divulged far mare than they intended before they knew what was going on very wise very crafty famous for being able to charm information right out of people grania would have been of far more use here than naitachal was being a male and a dark elf im at a disadvantage not all of granias power was due to charm though some of it as alaires bardic ability proved came from another source entirely did alaire know his mother was a powerful mage in her own right before she married his father surprisingly naitachal didnt know the answer to this she knew whenever her off spring were in trouble without casting a single spell though she no longer used formal magic oh i think thats where alaire got his gift all right naitachal decided she often said that the court mages were enough to take care of any problems magic could cure grania preferred being reynards right hand man to any kind of magery naitachal wished again that he had her with him she could get to the bottom of this mystery in no time on pure personality alone looks like were both going to have to do it on intelligence and stealth naitachal returned to their room from memory through ornate halls steep rock staircases and then smaller damper halls all lit with torches or candles the closer he got to his room the more spread out were the sources of illumination large swaths of darkness separated the tiny islands of light few peo ple evidently were staying in this part of the palace this evening when he arrived at his room he found the door slightly ajar his first thought was that alaire had arrived before he had but alaire would never have left the door open particularly in unfamiliar and potentially hostile territory then while he puzzled over this the dark elf sensed a sudden movement of air behind him as someone moved closer he started to turn but too late the garrote slipped expertly over the dark elfs neck then tight ened over his windpipe naitachal reached for the rope and stepped back wards gasping for the breath that had so quickly been shut off he could not see the attacker but judged him to be bigger and stronger than himself he pushed harder trying to force the man against the wall the attacker held on unyielding his lungs screamed for air he reached up clawing at the attackers wrists the thought formed unbidden in his mind archahai necrazach sceptre touch touch of death as he readied himself to reach for the powers he would need for the death spell his first instinctive defense he caught himself just in time i cant use magic in this land much less that magic quickly he groped for a knife he had hidden in an arm sheathe partway up his forearm with one frantic move he slashed at the hands controlling the garrote the pressure on his neck fell away as naitachal whirled and confronted his attacker face to face the man didnt seem particularly alarmed that nai tachal had freed himself through his blurred vision which cleared quickly now that he could breathe dark elf stared at his attacker who stood in the shad ows poised for another assault why isnt he running because he thinks he can still kill me and hes prob ably right they squared off weapons raised circling each other like cats about to fight naitachal realized with sickening clarity how much he relied on magic in bat tles like this the ones that really mattered when his life or that of someone close to him was at stake bardic magic was a combative weapo the human garbed completely in black wore a gauzelike wrapping wound tightly around him giving him free movement the elf saw nothing in his eyes but cool calculation no fear or panic as if he wasnt worried that the garrote had not worked on his quarry and there was something about his stance a profes sional air naitachal had come to associate with a certain class of hirelings an air that said without a word being spoken that murder was not new to this man the mans a professional assassin naitachal thought with a sinking feeling which means he prob ably can kill me reflexively the dark elf briefly thought of all the spells he might be able to use on those eyes but couldnt given the restrictions of suinomen but then now that the garrote was gone he was unarmed giving the elf a definite advantage who are you no response well it was worth a try the assassin snatched up the elaborate brass candlestick from a marble shelf set into the wall extin guishing the candle you dont really think thats going to bother me do you naitachal said as darkness fell his eyes adjusted quickly just in time to dodge as the assassin struck out with the heavy brass candle stick clumsy naitachal thought countering the strike with one of his own his knife drew blood as it sliced into the assassins hand severing tendons he heard no yelp or exclamation of pain at the strike again evidence of intensive training instead the assassin dropped the candlestick and ran naitachal ran after him the chase took him to the end of the hallway which branched into more halls after only a few turns the elf lost him and gave up the chase must have disappeared down a secret passage nai tachal thought glumly as he returned to his room wary of anything that might be lurking in the shadows theres no way to know if he vanished through a hid den door he must be familiar with the palace layout which could in turn implicate the royal family or possibly someone loyal to the king he didnt like this one hit and was uncertain what to do next if he alerted the palace guards to the attack they might be able to find the intruder how ever there was another option and that was to do nothing what the palace staff did in the next few hours could be very revealing to their true intentions particularly if he pretended this never happened before sheathing the knife he noticed a glint of blood on its blade the assassins he regarded this tantalizing bit of evidence like a starving man would a steak what a remarkable relic to leave behind what a shame i cant take advantage of it there was more than enough blood left on the blade to call the man back or track him down with magic they may have calculated this into the plan to lure him into the practice of magic so as to discredit himself his king and his mission this may in fact be an excuse to launch an attack on althea if i could only naitachal was suddenly sympathetic to the magi cians in suinomen he knew there were a few at the very least what they must endure in order to practice their craft another alarming possibility came to him what about alaire if theyre going to attack me wouldnt that make alaire a prime target as he made his way back to his room he shook the thought out of his head of course not hes just a silly servant not worthy of a moments attention unless the fool of a child has somehow revealed himself the dark elf didnt think that alaire would let his identity slip but he worried anyway naitachal had no idea where alaire and prince kainemonen had gone or what this city was like at night if it was anything like the coastal cities in althea he could have found some pretty rough trade lurking in the taverns com pany that alaire though he was far from sheltered might not know how to handle once in the room the bard stoked the smoldering fire to get some heat going instead of lying down on the huge canopy bed naitachal decided to sit up and wait up for alaire despite his efforts to stay awake he fell asleep sitting in one of the chairs several hours later he woke to find alaire entering the room sunlight poured in through the partially drawn shades though he would have rather slept horizontally on the bed the brief nap in the chair had restored a good deal of his strength alaire tiptoed carefully into the room his eyes fixed on the shadowshrouded bed holding his boots in one hand naitachal saw his breath fogging in the room reminding him that the fire had gone out he evi dently thought naitachal was in the bed and hadnt seen him yet good gods look what decided to drag its weary tail in from the night naitachal said softly but the quiet words made alaire jump startling the bardling granted some satisfaction that his apprentice had been out all night still perturbed him naitachal alaire said clearly flustered i didnt see you sitting there obviously care to tell me where youve been it was at times like these that he felt most like a par ent even though the boy was a very mature nineteen and quite capable of taking care of himself but gods its dawn where in the seven hells could he have been all this timer alaire had been in at least one fight ale and wine streaked his rumpled clothing and dirt smeared his face his excited feral look didnt fit his otherwise disheveled appearance ah naitachal thought understanding hes had what the humans call a good time are you drunk naitachal asked oh no alaire said sitting down on the edge of the bed though ive been hanging out with a lot of people who were roaring drunk naitachal raised his eyebrows includin crown prince of this kingdom kainemonen was it the very same alaire said so what have you found out so far the bard shrugged very little the perception of some of the nobles is that young kainemonen is after the crown he wanted to save the best for last so as not to taint alaires memory of his own evening if i told him what happened to me he might remember all sorts of people following him that werent there alaire proceeded to describe kainemonen in the most lurid detail appalled naitachal could not imag ine what the king thought he was doing letting the boy run riot like that fighting drinking though kai was young and bright alaire observed sadly that kai had the most unsatiable thirst for ale he had ever seen in a person he drank enough to put you me and my entire family under the table even your brother craig naitachal asked fasci nated in spite of hi alaire sighed he makes craig look sober i drank a little but did my best to stay unintoxicated it was a lot more difficult than i thought but before the evening was over he believed me to be a longlost friend from some time ago could this help us well that was a promising development if he remembers tomorrow at this point he may not even remember meeting you last night alaire shook his head sadly this is true but there is something else something far more threatening naitachal didnt like the tone alaire had suddenly taken threatening could assassins have come alaire as well he nodded as the bardling paused yes alaire please continue alaire stared at the wall for a moment as if he was thinking of something too horrible to describe or even react to rubbing his temples looking like he was summoning the nerve to discuss what hed lea alaire finally continued kai and i were in a tavern the local constables came in and arrested two men kai told me right away they were unlicensed magicians and that the swords of the magicians association had caught up with them naitachal calmly held up a hand the swords of the what the organization responsible for enforcing the magic laws they wear black and operate in groups of about six with a leader and seem to presume anyone theyre arresting is guilty without trial but thats not whats so scary about this place when i asked kai to elaborate on what was going to happen to those men he told me about the prison of souls at once naitachal felt a darkening of his spirit as if someone had drawn the curtains snuffing out the sun and a chill crept over him that made him shiver in a way that had little to do with the cold air of the bed room but the sun continued to shine warming his feet on the carpeted floor there was more to the name than the suggestive language he imagined the darkness this prison contained and saw the tortured souls stored there yes stored was this what father encountered that time he traveled afar had he trav eled to rozinki the cold chill naitachal felt seemed to have touched alaire with its spectral fingers for the bardling shivered as well its not like any normal prison like we have at home its more like a well mausoleum they store the bodies in caskets but somehow they extract the souls and keep them sepa rate storing them in crystals somewhere deep beneath the association hall aie naitachal said in dismay shaking his head even my people have yet to come up with something so malevolent or cruel oh but thats not the half of it alaire was on his feet now making broad animated gestures in the air as if by movement he could drive away the chill of fear not nearly for every year they imprison someone his body stored away elsewhere ages twenty which means let me see if i have this right which means alaire interrupted if they impris oned me in this thing for two years i would be sixty years old when they released me think of it and if one was stupid enough or desperate enough naitachal interrupted back good gods what an evil device but consider the source this came from the mouth of a young drunk who was by your accounts intoxicated are you certain he wasnt exaggerating this is almost too horrible to believe alaire paused considering i dont think so at least not this the arrest there at that tavern seemed to sober him instantly for a moment or two he was lucid enough to convince most people he hadnt been drinking this place scared him as he described it i could see it clearly in his face and it scared me though not completely convinced naitachal was almost ready to accept the story at face value i must confirm this with someone else but for the time b ill assume this to be true alaire is shaking talking about it i think someone wanted me to use magic tonight naitachal said and told alaire about the assassin i came within a breath of summoning a rather nasty dose of sceptre touch to do away with him did you stop yourself in time alaire asked vis ibly shaken just barely as tired as i was i was operating on reflexes only i wonder if this assassin realized how close to dying he really was he wasnt trying to kill me i dont think just trying to get me desperate enough to fling a spell at him naitachal decided to try and make light of the situ ation there was no point in frightening the youngster any further and if i had used magic it would not have been the end of the world i am after all a elf who knows i might be able to make friends in a place like that they might have decided i made a bet ter teacher than a body in their prison alaire made a sour face naitachal forced a laugh and with my elven con stitution a year or more wouldnt make much difference nor would the aging effect alaire frowned and pointed out the obvious but in that year the war between our two kingdoms might come to pass with you out of the way naitachal waved the comment away never mind that we both managed to get through this night with out mishap and now we know the dangers you must promise me that you will not use magic of any kind while you are here unless it is to save your life or someone elses you dont need a promise from me im not about to use the gift in this place naitachal nodded satisfied is there anything i should know alaires expression turned puzzled well thi jehan i met him in one of the taverns strange sort of fellow hes an older man middle aged one of the nobles and he seems to be the land of profligate someone like kai would turn into after a few years not sure what his rank is kai is very fond of him and im not sure why it might be because he is the only noble from the court who will have anything to do with him but theres something suspicious about him i got the feeling that everything he does is a calculated pose interesting you couldnt be a little more specific alaire shook his head not right now no just a feeling a hunch hes manipulating kai somehow and also theres this captain of the guard another friend i didnt see him out there last night but from the way kai spoke of him hes another friend i suinomen court very interesting we must look into this it could be important or it could be nothing meanwhile it looks like kai is likely to be our best source of infor mation i have to agree alaire replied what i need to find out is how i stand with him when hes not drink ing could be a world of difference there naitachal regarded the sun peeking obtrusively through the window like an unwanted guest looks like my day is beginning you my young friend had better get some sleep which i presume is what kai is doing now alaire looked pained or perhaps merely embar rassed oh yes passed out in the carriage on the way over here i delivered him to the servants who seemed to be expecting him to be in that condition and knew exactly what to do with him naitachal motioned alaire into his bed and the young man barely took the time to strip off his boots and outer garments before tumbling in on the whole the bard was proud of his apprentice he was making wise judgments thinking on his feet and had a good grasp of the dangers of me situation now naitachals only concern was that he embroil himself too deeply take too many risks he was a clever young man but those who opposed them were likely to be just as clever naitachal summoned the energy to rise to his feet and started toward a washbasin filled with water as he splashed water on his face alaires muffled snores came out of the heap of bed cover ings behind him chapte as naitachal emerged from his bed chamber he sensed the castle awakening around him even though he had slept very little he didnt feel as tired as a human would have under the same circum stances in fact he had only begun sleeping vaguely human hours in the last half century of his life a sure sign of elven middle age these humans rose slowly in comparison with elvenkind he heard them making muffled noises from the rooms and down the hallways grumbling like bears waking from a winterlong hibernation given how much sleep they needed and how short their lives were he wondered how they were ever able to build a civilization in the dimmed hallway he stopped a young servant girl to ask where he could find the head ser paavo who apparently had been the only repre sentative archenomen assigned to them she muttered something back in the native language and held her hands up in the universal gesture of i dont understand you and continued extinguishing the can dles in the hallway interestingly she did not seem to notice the missing candlestick that had stood b naitachals door the dark elf regarded the stony halls with equal parts of distaste and frustration not even a civilian guard to watch these halls he thought mildly annoyed althea afforded the highest degree of protection to diplomatic guests this could be carelessness or it could be something else altogether i was after all attacked in this very hall last night time to see the king he thought and tried to remember if king archenomen had left direc tions for their meeting at dinner the king had seemed determined to watch the behavior of his sub jects rather than engage in any kind of conversation with a visiting diplomat it would be easy right now to dip into deep pools of paranoia and find a knifewielding assassin specially groomed by the royal archenomen family in every shadow he passed but a small part of him told him this would be assuming way too much easy now its still too early to say whos responsible there could be a valid reason why i have no guards perhaps they honestly feel im in no danger there did seem to be a lack of concern one way or the other this serene morning time for answers the longer they lived in the shad ows the greater chance the forces of darkness had of gaining some advantage against them and without the advantage of his magical tools the sooner he and his apprentice learned the truth the better at the moment knowledge his diplomatic skill and his sword were the only weapons available to him naitachal made his way to the main hallway keep ing in mind the route back to his room should he suddenly need refuge here servants were more numerous and a group of them were picking up after what looked like a late night party paavo was among them issuing orders supervising the cleanup but doing very little himself from across the hall naitachal tried to get the ser vants attention but paavo appeared to be ignoring him in fact the man quickly turned his back o bard hes pretending he doesnt see me the dark elf realized and this small insight angered him far more than it should have he decided to press the issue and walked to within a foot of the servant standing behind paavo nai tachal spoke again perhaps you can help me he said loud enough for another servant further away to hear two other servants turned and gawked at nai tachals black countenance paavo did nothing no you dont my friend excuse me naitachal said stepping around the man and standing right beside him patience now perhaps the man is hard of hearing he reasoned though the servant had shown no sign of deafness the day before paavo slowly reluctantly turned and faced nai tachal oh ambassador forgive me i didnt see you enter the hall naitachal gave him a sharp look and paavo winced i seek an audience with the king to whom may i speak to arrange this i am only a servant paavo said apologetically i doubt that i would be very effective in arranging this you didnt have these problems yesterday when you took us directly to the king the second letter the one from king reynard to archenomen remained in his breast pocket it would be more than enough of a reason to justify an audienceondemand but he had already decided to hand deliver the letter to the king per instructions it may disappear otherwise he mused the elf waited a moment giving paavo a chance to continue to answer the second half of his question paavo offered a blank but polite smile lacking in com prehension as if naitachal had addressed him in a language he didnt understand naitachal tried again well then could you direct me to someone perhaps on the kings staff who could arrange what you cannot paavo seemed distressed as he struggled to answer the question or not answer the question that is a good question ambassador lets see who is not on vacation this month the servant scratched his chin and looked thoughtful perhaps it would save you the trouble by taking me directly to the king yesterday this didnt seem to be a problem naitachal replied pointedly at this suggestion paavo adamantly shook his head i am simply not of a high enough rank you see if i could indeed well there is no point in forcing the issue or reminding him that yesterday his rank was high enough for him to advise the king hell only make some other excuse or tell me that the person i saw was his twin brother then please tell me who is of a high enough rank naitachal said his patience slipping this may take some time paavo replied have you broken your fast yet this morning naitachal stared at him strongly tempted to stran gle the man what in the seven hells is going on here what has changed between last night and tonight and why is this fool blocking my access to the king no i have not eaten naitachal said slowly and deliberately pronouncing each word i spoke with the king last night and although dinner was not the appropriate time or place to discuss matters of our two kingdoms he did indicate that he wanted to meet with me today could we please arrange this today please did you make an appointment paavo asked meekly naitachal paused wondering if he should lie no none seemed necessary paavo frowned perhaps if you could go to the great hall we can arrange a meal for you and i will do what i can to arrange your meeting i recall tha king designated a member of his staff as your liaison then why didnt you tell me that in the first place he seethed but kept the biting words to himself and kept from biting paavo very well naitachal said and before turning towards the dining hall added with heavy i thank you land sir for all your help as he walked away he cursed himself for forget ting to ask him who exactly this someone was and what his position was on the staff but on the other hand was he really in a mood to deal with whatever sidestepping dialog paavo would use to avoid answering him directly with time and with a great deal of luck i might even meet this person before spring he found the great hall empty but a young maid servant appeared immediately showed him to a table and vanished between the long rows of tables he noted her passage through two huge swinging doors leading to the kitchen two other servants cooks by the look of their aprons stared over the top of the doors and conferred heatedly among themselves i sense a conspiracy naitachal thought a maid servant appeared with a plate of food a pitcher of ale and a basket of bread all of which she balanced pre cariously on a wicker tray that had seen better days there is absolutely nobody else here or signs that any one else has eaten here this morning and they had food prepared in advance they could not have con jured a more effective stalling tactic the maidservant deposited the food before him and vanished into the kitchen he wondered when the rest of the castle had breakfast then realized that very few of the evenings guests had stayed overnight or if they had they had been absolutely quiet and invisible during his trek down from his room most likely meals went directly to the rooms of the palaces permanent occupants that or the others had known he would be here and had chosen to avoid him naitachal regarded the food with annoyance the bread was cold and hard and the wooden implements would not penetrate the dense crust so he resorted to gripping the loaf and slamming it impolitely against the edge of the wobbly table this action which he had to repeat nearly tipped the table and its contents over which would have been no great loss the pheas ant or small chicken or game bird he couldnt tell which was cold its juices congealed in a greasy pud dle on the wooden trough fearing intentional or even accidental food poisoning he declared the bird thing uneatable and filled his copious time gnawing on the bread bread which more closely resembled a brick than a loaf when he looked up he saw that he had quite an audience himself the cooks the maidservants and a half dozen others peered over the door exchanging amused looks with even a giggle or two for guaran teed embarrassment this could take forever he thought ignoring the onlookers as he chewed on the barely digestible bread and ventured to conclude that this might have been the intention since every exchange so far had delayed his meeting with king archenomen he imagine king this very moment hurriedly boarding the royal carriage for an impromptu picnic in the forest arranged for the sole purpose of avoiding him theyve had more than enough time to plan this he thought darkly gaming an audience might be more difficult than i first thought he glanced back towards the entrance to the hall way and saw paavo conversing with a short squat fellow partially hidden from view they seemed to be arguing about something casting distressed looks in his direction apparently the topic of heated discus sion was naitachal naitachal was about to leave the sumptuous feast to go meet the new fellow himself when paavos com panion began walking without much apparent enthusiasm towards his table finally someone to take me to the king i hope he came directly to naitachals table his posture becoming more selfimportant as he neared a naitachals eyes his costume hardly warranted such puffedup pride for he looked as if he wore the spare clothing of six or seven different folk he wore a broad black hat with a silver satin scarf draped over it and a baldric of blue velvet which was tucked into a belt of gold braid the tunic was a dull orange with large billowing sleeves and had a skirt that termi nated at his knees over hose of green black boots thumped against the bare wooden floor of the hall the noise ceasing suddenly as he stopped to stand regard ing the ambassador as if he found himself confronted by a freak of nature please dont stand the man said although nai tachal had no intentions of getting to his feet johan pikhalas assigned to you by the king to deal with your needs he smiled greasily reminding the elf of the uneaten bird in front of him he was younger than the elf had expected perhaps in his forties even wearing the broad hat it was very clear that johan was losing his hair he had the appearance and attitude of someone assigned an important but unwanted and unpleasant task please sit naitachal said gesturing at an empty chair opposite him and have some dead bird with me but pikhalas seemed to prefer the psychological advantage of standing he shook his head politely i understand you seek an audience with the king i do naitachal said i spoke with him last night at supper and he indicated he would be happy to speak with me today pikhalas seemed to be choosing his words carefully i see paavo told me that you had arrived only today what subject may i inquire did you wish to discuss with king archenomen i am the envoy from althea naitachal said slowly and keeping a rein on his temper and this is concerning a rather delicate matter which i am under orders to discuss with him directly forgive me if this intrudes on some custom of your land that i am unfa miliar with i understand the need to protect your ruler but your court accepted my credentials last night and an envoy and ambassador has certain privi leges as well as duties naitachal reached for the letter but pikhalas raised a hand in protest that will not be necessary your credentials are not in question but the king is a very busy man and you have arrived at a rather awkward time you see it is late harvest and the king has been receiving counts from all over the kingdom for the past week internal matters taxation we keep a rather tight rein on our various houses the accounting of their properties requires his undivided attention the dark elf was not going to buy into this har vest even a late one in the winter agriculture may be more critical this far north but why shoul king play a personal role in inventorying crops pikhalas might know of the attack on him last night or might have even arranged it or might not dont jump to conclusions still it was time to take off the gloves let me cut straight to the matter here are you telling me in a roundabout way that the king is refusing to recei ambassador of althea pikhalas flinched at the accusation but naitachal let the question stand without apology certainly ambassador the king will be willing to speak with you but not today and since you seem unwilling to discuss your business with me it would seem we are at an impasse perhaps naitachal said evenly what i came to discuss is rather important and involves the future relations of our two kingdoms i am a patient being willing to adapt to whatever schedule the king requires of me but i have traveled quite a distance to be here in althea king reynard would have wasted no time to accommodate a representative of your land while i do see the importance of keeping accurate books we usually assign such a task to servants and underlings he paused waiting to see pikhalas reaction his expression was as blank and unreadable as a death mask naitachal continued may i respectfully ask when the kings schedule might allow my vital meet ing with him pikhalas was quiet for a long time and finally his expression changed as the mask dropped now he glared at naitachal with unconcealed contempt when he spoke his voice held a world of disdain we have an expression in suinomen which would seem appropriate now loosely translated to your barbaric tongue it says guests should remember that they are guests if you are a patient man ambassador show us by your actions and not your empty words i will dis cuss this with the king tomorrow i might be able to arrange something but i promise nothing if this is in sufficient to your rather trying demands i suggest that you take to the road and return to that home from which you came pikhalas turned brusquely and tossed a final saluta tion over his shoulder as naitachal stared at him good day ambassador he stamped off to whatever important business paavo had interrupted his stiff gait and posture telling the world how annoyed he was at having to deal with the dark elf naitachal gazed after him suppressing the urge to work the tiny magic needed to make him trip and fall on his nose when he had left the boot thumping fading into the distance naitachal stood summoning as much serenity as he could which wasnt much but enough to mask his own hot feelings he left the dining hall with a little more composure and a lot less noise than pikha las if im cautious perhaps i can do a bit of investiga tive work in places they would rather not see me before they declare such sites off limits it seems to be all i can do demondogs even alaire is accomplishing more than i chapter alaire set out to find prince kainemonen pausing to change into something simple but clean something black that wouldnt blind him or give him a head ache i doubt hell be feeling his very best today the clothes he chose were more appropriate for night crawling and he could only pray they wouldnt be giving kai any ideas about another round of tavern hopping an upper servant or lesser noble might wear the black hose tunic and small cape in another land his alertness had slipped once or twice the previous evening when he was out with kai but after hearing about naitachals visitor his senses were keyed to a high pitch and although it might seem logical to sus pect the crown prince who after all had dr naitachals companion off leaving him alone in his gut he knew that kai wasnt responsible for the attack or even knew anything abo there simply wasnt a devious bone in kais body foolish perhaps but not devious he puzzled over how much to tell kai about his own life most of his background was secret in sumo men and althea for benefit of his disguise if im going to get through to him ive probably got to level with him completely well almost ill have to do it without mentioning my bardic gift to let him im as wellborn as he is as well may open some doors or alienate him completely it was a chance he had to take satisfied he had struck the proper balance in his attire so he wouldnt look like a degraded peon or a wellappointed noble the land kai appeared to dislike the most he began looking randomly through the halls for a servant to take him to kai in retrospect he decided it was a good idea after all not to mention the tavern fight to naitachal although the elf must certainly have seen the signs all over him and thats all it was at the dead dragon inn a sim ple fight in a rough part of town it had nothing to do with the attempt on naitachals life so no need to tell him anything about it if he thought i was going to be walking into trouble he wouldnt be suggesting an alli ance with kai while naitachal saw that ingratiating himself with the lad would provide practical information for their mission alaire wanted it to be more than that kai needs a real friend here one day the watch might not come in time to break up whatever fight hes in if nothing else he needs people along to save whoever hes fighting one day he may kill someone quite by acciden alaire frowned as something else occurred to him what if thats what someone wants it was easy to see a conspiracy behind every one of the closed doors he passed in this early stage of the game the reality of it was he was no closer to the real conspiracy than he was last night unless sir jehan was at the middle of it he found paavo dusting shelves in one of the grand hallways when he turned and saw alaire his distaste was evident you he said softly is there somewhere else you could be right now alaire bristled at the attitude but restrained himself they should treat me like this i am a foolish assistant nothing more a hangeron why yes as a matter of fact could you show me p kainemonens chambers the elder servants eyebrows lifted ever so subtly why would anyone want to see him particularly at this hour its daylight after all alaire thought he did a credible job of looking stu pid why i wanted to thank him in person for showing me such an entertaining evening is he not receiving today that is not the point paavo sniffed hes always receiving but nobody wants to see him he sighed apparently resigned to the task come this way if you want to waste your time with that drunken child you are more than welcome at least youll be out of my way an odd way to talk about his crown prince as if he didnt matter as if he never will take the throne while paavo led him down another hallway this one painted on both sides with primitive woodland scenes alaire wondered why even a mere servant in this castle would treat the prince with such con even if he was a drunk alaire had known a few ser vants back at home who had such familiarity with the royal family but they were never as presumptuous as this man take notes file away for later we configure paavo out some other time hed expected a more regal setting for the prince but the door they stopped at was no more suggestive of royalty than his own front door in fenrich paavo waved at the door with an air of one who has done more than his duty you may let yourself in i have other more important things to do today with that paavo turned and walked swiftly away leaving behind a palpable cloud of petulance shrugging alaire opened the door and strode into a darkened room unannounced the room had no windows or wind hole and reeked of what else stale wine and ale it was now high noon and kai had evi dently decided to sleep in under cover of artificial darkness kai alaire ventured as his eyes adjusted to the dimness its alaire are you awake silly question he thought closing the door behind him he did this reluctantly because there was no other source of light but he needed privacy to discuss the things he wanted to and an open door would only attract idle ears possibly paavos the room he discov ered had windows after all but something solid and black was covering them thin lines of light made an outline giving him enough light to avoid bumping into the larger pieces of furniture he became aware of a large canopied bed shoved into a corner of the room at an odd angle heavy vel vet curtains cut off his view presumably it was even darker in the bed than in the rest of the room from the bed he heard a muffled grunt then a more articulated unngh as somebody stirred inside alaire stood uncertainly in the middle of the room wondering if he would even be visible wearing his black outfit then it occurred to him that kai might not be alone after a moment though he dismissed the idea remembering the unconscious condition hed left kai in there was a table against the wall with something on it that might be a lantern when alaire felt his way over there he discovered that it was a lantern with the shutters pulled one that was still burning dimly he turned it up it didnt help much but now he could see something more than mere outlines the bedcurtains quivered slightly as someone pushed them aside a crack revealing half a face and a bleary bloodshot eye unnnngh alaire what are you doing here at this ungodly hour alaire turned with the lantern in his hand kai winced away from the light this ungodly hour hap pens to be noon he pointed out do you plan on sleeping the day away the curtains shut but kai kept moving around from the sounds within thats precisely what i had in mind alaire ignored him and began searching the area around the windows for a means to open them the curtains opened again kai had thrown on a pair of breeches from a pile of clothing strewn over the bed no one else seemed to be with him barefoot shirtless kai dangled his legs over the side of the high bed he muttered something inarticulate rubbing his forehead might i suggest having breakfast with me today alaire offered his own stomach was rolling over with hunger he guessed from the boys wan appearance that kais stomach was rolling over for completely dif ferent reasons oh gods no kai replied fervently sticking his tongue out whats breakfast anyway i dont eat breakfast then maybe i could light another lantern or a candle or open a window leave the windows shut please kai said firmly if you must have light you could blow some life into that stove and light a candle a single candle the tiled stove was much like the one in alaires room except it had a bellows built into one side it was a little chilly here but not as much as his own room had been when he awakened he suspected servants came into kais rooms periodically to keep the fire going certainly kai would never have no soon alaire had a roaring fire going again and stoked it with wood from a logholder tiled to match the stove by the time he had carefully lit a candle kai was up rummaging through the room the place was a shambles discarded clothing covered the floor except for a pieshaped area where the door opened kai was poking through the debris as if salvaging usable items from a burned house what are you looking for alaire asked what do you think kai said irritably got to get the day going somehow the reply left alaire completely baffled until kai extracted a wine flask from a heap of clothing oh no not again alaire thought thats the last thing he needs but fortunately the flask was the one kai had car ried with him the night before and was quite empty embarrassed alaire watched as the boy shook the flask out as if he were perishing of thirst despite his best efforts not so much as a drop trickle despondent kai dropped the flask to the floor and stood there staring at nothing he looked ready to cry alaire tried to rally him looks like its empty he said cheerfully come on kai do you really need a drink this early kai ignored him and began to search frantically through the mess damned servants paavo tells them to take my private stock whenever i come in late his face lit up but i have a contingency supply that is unless those twicedamned servants found it he opened a wardrobe next to the bed and ran his hand up and over along the inside ah there it is kai turned around holding a wineskin larger than the flask he had carried the previous night the leather pouch quivered with fullness alaire looked away you dont approve do you kai said alaire thought he heard genuine concern in the boys voice but when he turned back kai was drinking deeply from the skin well why not maybe itll have an effect in a way yes do you ever stop drinking only when i run out kai said a note of defiance in his voice why shouldnt i alaire considered this how to reason with a drunk hed never done so successfully if i dont try he remembered kai mentioning that sir jehan gave him his first drink and that the man had encour aged his consumption the evening before bu jehan was in no way responsible for kais overall con dition that was kais doing and no one elses why do some people drink more than others how can one person have one drink and put it down while the man next to him orders another and again another he never had really thought about it try the obvious well for one thing it will destroy your body and your mind not necessarily in that order kai offered a feeble shrug does that really mat ter im a drunk everybody says so nothing i can do about that he glared at alaire again with that hint of defiance i could stop whenever i wanted to but i just dont want to is all he paused to take another swig and it doesnt matter if im a falling down drunk my father hates me and would rather see me dead than on the throne ah here we go the opening i was looking for he cleared his throat delicately have you ever really wondered why im here and how i was able to meet you the crown prince so many years ago granted it was a peasants holiday but you know not just anyone could get close to the kings son kai was looking at him strangely and sat down crosslegged in a sort of nest of clothing on the floor you know youre right you couldnt have got that close to us unless there was another reason behind that socalled holiday huh youre here now on some sort of diplomatic mission from althea right alaire nodded exactly the dark elf i ambassador sent by king reynard kai seemed to find this amusing right the elf caused quite a stir in our little court heard a little bit about it before supper began last night is your father a diplomat perhaps alaire took a deep breath and told the truth i am the son of king reynard ruler of althea prince kainemonen sucked in his breath suddenly a short exclamation that conveyed the proper surprise good gods are you the prince that got his attention but now that i have his ear he grinned shyly a prince actually one of a horde father sent me here to have a look at diplo macy firsthand how do you really know what your father is thinking i doubt he really hates you at all i used to think the same thing about my father i was so far down the line of succession i didnt think i was really worth much to him but i found out differently a while back kai stared down the line you arent the prince of althea alaire laughed oh no that would be derek my oldest brother the firstborn i get to choose what im going to do with the rest of my life i see kai nodded in a way im glad you cer tainly didnt act like a prince alaire opened his mouth to comment something like and you do but thought better of it instead he continued with the family tree ill take that as a compliment my identity is a secret so i guess my acting must be pretty good he grinned and kai managed a feeble smile in return im the youngest of eight brothers the others had their destinies planned for them grant the next born is a natural fighter and is in training to become lord trevor number three will become ki seneschal given his high intelligence and wit contemplative phyllip was our familys gift to the priesthood and church when father sugg roland start studying to become the court researcher and librarian he nearly had a fit he was so pleased kai stared at him apparently fascinated that reynard had taken such pains to suit his sons desti nies to their talents alaire restrained a smile as the more obvious positions became filled as it were it became a little less obvious what to do with my brothers i rem father once asking mother why she couldnt have had some girls for a change but we coped you know and when drake whos number six turned out to have a temper as fiery as his name father decided that hed better serve under grant and have that temper tamed with military discipline the seventh craig still doesnt know what he wants to do last i h father was just going to leave it up to him he left out the fact that craig was proving something of a black sheep idling his way among the ladies of the court and thinking of little besides clothing wine and women best not give him any ideas and youre number eight kai left the sentence unfinished alaire nodded even as a child i felt like an embar rassment with nowhere to go the extra extra prince i thought father hated me after i heard him mother that bit about daughters kais expression was sour i think my father would prefer a daughter but alaire shook his head dont be so certain when i thought father had given up on me he sur prised me i remember the day clearly i was only six but i remember when he came into the palace nursery and shooed all the nurses away so we could talk just the two of us man to man he said he asked me what i wanted to do that i could be anything i wanted to be at first i didnt know what to say and then kai said he was hanging on every word fascinated by alaires story i told him i wanted to be a bminstrel alaire stuttered sure hope he didnt pick up on that near slip kai laughed a bminstrel is that like a bar min strel paid less seen and heard only in bars alaire chuckled nervously ah no just a garden variety minstrel he asked why and i told him that think quickly alaire that minstrels go every where and see everything and no one notices them they become part of the furnishings and they learn a lot i wanted to do that you see to become dereks eyes and ears and learn the things no one would tell him to his face and i had already chosen an instru ment a harp he realized that he had wasted his frantic thought when kai ignored the long speech and focused on the last words a harp did you bring it with you he shrugged well its back in my room please you must play for me kai urged as excited as a child with a promised treat alaire assented glad to be able to play at long last its been a long few days since ive played anything with bardic magic or not i have to admit it would be a pleasure and if anything it would give me a chance to practice later he promised after weve eaten id be happy to kai seemed pleased all out of proportion to the promise i didnt know you could play an instrument i tried to learn the lute but i just didnt have what it took i guess then his expression fell like every thing else in my life that isnt true alaire responded automatically but couldnt think of any reason why this was so i i knew him better i might be able to get a handle on this know which words to use to lift his spirits but here he is getting all maudlin again father never talked to me that way kai contin ued miserably ive never been more than a nuisance to him at least since i was ten before then we got along just fine but after that well something hap pened its not unusual for fathers and sons to have prob lems though they usually get worked out alaire soothed trying to guess what could have happened when kai was ten a peculiar age for problems like that to start early puberty perhaps but not our problems hed rather see me dead kai took a long drink from the skin licked his lips loudly and burped defiantly it doesnt matter whats the point after all i cant please him so i might as well enjoy myself alaire shrugged i chipped away some of the ice at least for a little while anyway all this im seeing now this drunken fool of child is his only defense against himself and whatever or whoever he views as his enemy well kai asked you game alaire shrugged for what another round of enjoyment what else after all youre useless too he didnt really want to give in and go through another drunken evening this one beginning much earlier at noon but he remembered his promi naitachal be a friend to kai and find out as much as he can well kai certainly needed a friend and this was something he felt he could become given time alaire did not think he would see much useful infor mation out of kai alaire half expected to find kai leading them back to the tavern district much to his surprise how kai took him out for a short walk on the palace grounds the day was unseasonably warm so they needed no coats alaire had no idea of their destina tion however until they reached the vineyards these grapes were he soon learned kais pride and joy i had this strain planted myself kai said proudly before the rows of brown dormant vines even with out the spring foliage it was obvious that these were particularly robust and healthy vines over there is the winery kai said pointing to a rough rock building up against the palace wall alaire sighed it made per fect sense that the prince had his own private winemaking operation given the amount the lad con are we going there today alaire asked hed wanted to grab a bite to eat but kai didnt seem to care about food the hunger pains had subsided somewhat on their own but alaire knew that wouldnt last not the winery i have something else planned for us kai led him through an overgrown garden brown with winter alaire appreciated how these people relied on natural growth to give form to their gardens in althea the gardeners planted and pruned and trimmed the palace garden into a sterile facsimile of neatness which required constant upkeep even in the winter he hoped to see this place in the spring and perhaps bring some of these ideas back home they came upon a large wooden building that alaire no clues to what it contained until they entered it good heavens he thought gazing about at the racks of weapons the open floor this is a fighting practice arena it made sense to have sword practice indoors this far north what he found inside was clearly a training area with a dirt floor on the wall hung several weap ons both of the wooden practice variety and the real lethal thing he recognized fifteen distinct species of sword several spears a cabinet of different knives the place smelled of leather sawdust and sweat and someone was waiting for them young kainemonen a big burly man growled youre late i apologize captain lyam kai said solemnly ive brought a friend a diplomat from althea captain lyam ignored the introduction the man was huge easily as tall as alaires father and it was obvious that all his immense weight was muscle and sinew his huge boots looked like something alaire could row across a lake with room for fishing gear his scarred face looked like someone had ripped it apart and clumsily reassembled it one eye was slightly higher than the other he wore no insignia on the loose shirt or the dark breeches but his stance solid as a boulder and unmoving commanded all the authority that seemed needed kai withered and looked away the captain sniffed the air as i thought drinking already are we kai looked to deny this but instead nodded meekly yes sir he squeaked im sorry oh that you will be lyam assured him in an ominous tone that made the hair on the ba alaires neck stand up that you will be the scene was making alaire uncomfortable and nervous lyam was easily five times the size and weight of kai with longer arms and legs both definite advantages in sword fighting plus kai was hungover horribly hungover a fact which lyam appeared to take great displeasure from kai seemed resigned to his fate as he went over and selected a sword from the wall as lyam did the same by the time they had taken positions in the center of the practice ring that same feral look hed seen the night before returned to kai as if touching the blade had restored the madness that got them into that fight with the sailors they wasted no time they saluted with their blades and immediately plowed into each other a blur of flashing steel that alaire had trouble keeping up with lyam advanced pushing kai backwards yet the boy was holding his own deflecting every o lyams thrusts but he wasnt making any headway with the big man purely defense this time he just didnt seem to have any energy today but lyam did not look like he was making things easy on purpose the captain gave all appearances of delivering everything he had a frightening prospect no matter what kais condition was the swords con tinued to clash but despite lyams best efforts to corner the boy kai expertly sidestepped proceeding to circle backwards leaving his path clear alaire saw that kai had an advantage after all though he was much smaller than lyam this allowed him mobility he could move faster than the hulk he was up against and kai took advantage of this two other men appeared in the ring dressed much like lyam but neither had about him the same air of authority the bearded one had a skin tone that sug gested long years at sea the other was a bit stockier but built like lyam you take over lyam said to the shorter of the men who stepped in and began sparring with kai the boy was sweating profusely now but launched into aggressive swordplay with the other chasing him around the ring the way lyam had been chasing him moments before alaire relaxed once lyam paired kai with a more even opponent the man was only a little taller then the boy and didnt seem to be too enthusiastic about the practice but he was fresh and not suffering from a night of drinking despite the lackluster challenge he was still a viable opponent and the swords they were using were real lethal tools even a novice could kill with as the new man warmed up to his work he began to display a certain sadistic enthusiasm the new man got a few good strikes in slapping kais backside hard with the flat of the blade to get his attention as kai grew wearier he was also using street fencing and underhanded tricks exactly the kind of thing kai could run across in the tavern district his relief on kais behalf was shortlived however he felt a strange uneasiness as if someone was staring at him and turned to see that lyam was regarding him with a hard cold gaze so young kai how good do you think your friend is here lyam said after sizing alaire up gesturing with his swordtip in alaires direction hes passable kai shouted over the clashing swords the brief shrug didnt interfere with his thrusts give him a go if you want me arm yourself young man lyam said grinning alvar see what hes made of the other man took a position in the ring as kai and his opponent continued fighting alaire wasted no time in arming himself selecting a simple wooden practice blade about the size and weight of the one he used at home he saluted alvar and immediately regretted his choice alvars blade was a good two hands longer and the mans reach was longer as well but alvar was not very quick the longer blade made for less mobility all around and alaire quickly touched him in several vulnerable places once crack ing the blade hard against the mans arm delivering a bruise he hadnt intended alvar didnt seem to notice and continued sparring like the trained practice dummy he probably was keeping alaire alert but not inflicting any real damage lyam now rested took over for kais partner alaire noticed was beginning to waver he couldnt figure out where kais energy was coming from he parried and thrust with the same skill alaire had seen the night before but oddly with none of the pleasure this was simple mechanics the skill of the sword but this time lyam seemed determined to make headway lyam drove kai out of the ring and into the wall hard kai ducked under the huge man somersaulted and landed on his feet sword ready alvar took advantage of alaires distraction thrust ing all too close to his torso a controlled lunge that could just as easily gone through his heart if they had been using steel like lyam and kai instead of the blunted wooden blades lyam took over alaires practice setting the other stocky man on kai again he loomed over alaire like a giant but alaire saw that the man was getting tired nevertheless he was a consummate professional and he didnt make mistakes even when weary it took everything alaire had to keep up with the captain even to the point of using some of kais evasive tactics but he didnt make the same mistake he had made with his first opponent his concentration didnt waver lyam looked for an opening but couldnt find one hold lyam boomed and at once all swordplay ceased alaire didnt catch on right away that this meant practice was over and made ready to thrust again a warning look from lyam froze him in mid attack his sword dropped the entire exercise couldnt have taken a quarter of an hour but alaire found himself quite exhausted his practices with the dark elf were nothing like this it was as if they were training for a battle the next day in which only one side would walk away in an odd way alaire felt terribly pleased with him self he hadnt let lyam score on him hed even managed to pick up some new tricks from the cap tain and looked forward to using them with naitachal the next time they sparred kai was breathing heavily his hair and clothes soaked with sweat the boys exhaustion was no real wonder given lyams special attentions and the rota tion of partners he had no doubt sweated out every drop of alcohol hed ingested since the day before well done lyam said and alaire grinned shyly uncertain which of them he meant some unspoken cue had dismissed the two assistants who had disap peared to parts unknown without a comment lyam turned to scowl at kai if you come into practice drunk tomorrow im going to really wear the drink out of you kai bowed slightly but as lyam turned and left the ring kai made an absurdly comical face at his retreat ing back mouthing some mute retort alaire could only guess the content of the ridiculous expression caught alaire at an unguarded moment and he almost laughed out loud he stifled his outburst with a great effort saving it for when lyam was far far away moving a little slower now kai took his blade to another rack althea had a similar arrangement at the palace guardhouse although it was more ornate and the minions were always present to take them person ally for sharpening metal though they were these were practice blades and a lot sharper than alaire felt comfortable with alaire racked his weapon as well suddenly aware of muscles he didnt think he had gods kai alaire said as he lay the sword beside his friends is that typical for a workout the familiar arrogant look returned you didnt think that was hard did you well alaire began unwilling to admit just how soft his own training with naitachal had been in com parison does he usually trade off partners like that kai grinned like a fox all the time its why i can kick the behind of anyone i want whenever i want alaire allowed that this made sense but he didnt like what it implied about kai he hadnt thought the lad was a bully now its time to get cleaned up in the sowna kai said shaking some of the sweat out of his hair the what come on ill show you alaire didnt know what to expect but this wasnt anything he could have imagined for himself kai led him to a part of the palace grounds somewhat con cealed by trees where he found a crystal clear pond fed by a generous freshwater spring near the shore was a short squat building made of timbers built into the side of a small and clearly artificial hill smoke poured out of a chimney its fires apparently stoked by servants prior to their arrival the sweat was chilling on his back and he was looking forward to getting out of the stiff breeze that had suddenly arisen this is the sowna kai explained as they entered the small structure through a narrow door i heard you didnt have these down south shame really theyre really good for getting rid of muscle aches within the sowna were two smaller rooms the first furnished with towels bottled perfume and soaps a large wooden bucket of water and a shelf where someones clothes were drying a strong acrid smell of pine and cedar made him briefly dizzy and cleared his head in the process kai immediately began shedding clothing alaire hesitated but began doing the same won dering if the ritual included females kai sported a lean wiry frame well developed for a seventeenyear old though alaire was two years older he found himself comparing his own larger but less muscular body with kais sucking in a bit of baby fat that had taken residence around his middle he envied kais build but then kai had a torturer for a trainer when kai opened the door to the second room a wave of heat and steam nearly knocked alaire over and he recoiled reflexively you get used to it kai assured him but alaire bent lower where the air wasnt as hot inside were a few wooden stools and mixed with the steam was a strong scent of smoke in one corner a hot bed of coals heated a cluster of pitted round rocks what is this an oven alaire asked sitting on one of the stools he yelped as his backside touched the hot wood he leapt up again and did a little dance around the stools s not funny alaire wailed kai chuckled you could have at least warned me you are new to this arent you kai said hed brought the bucket of water in with them first pour ing some on alaires stool then sprinkling some on the hot rocks the temperature rose sharply its good for you kai said firmly do you hurt anywhere after that match a few places alaire said in truth he had strained several muscles before practice he would normally do several stretching exercises but today he hadnt enjoyed that little luxury also he had unconsciously tensed when he had realized lyam was going to run him through the same meat grinder he had kai and that had added to his injuries this will take care of that sit down relax he did finally breathing the steam in through his nose and exhaling through his mouth as kai demon strated more water went on the coals hissing an angry protest little droplets of sweat ran down his back and face the heat relaxed him and the steam cleared his head see what i mean kai said stretching his arms you should take this idea back with you when you return to althea i just may do that alaire said feeling a little light headed i didnt realize how good you really were kai said offhandedly lyam wasnt holding back when he had at you and those two he had sparring with us those are a couple of his best men who trains you back home the ambassador alaire replied without thinking the dark elf kai offered a low whistle of surprise remind me not to try taking him on hes a good trainer must really know the sword alaire was about to boast about some of naitachals previous conquests with the blade but thought better of it it would be too easy to mention the magic i really have to watch how much i tell he eyed the boy slyly but kai was only working a strain out of shoulder muscle is he fishing for information better be on guard where i come from everybody trains for the sword alaire said casually even farmers you never know when someone might declare war on us if the last remark made any impact on kai the boy didnt show it but you must admit that being a prince does grant you certain privileges best trainers best equipment what you did back there really impressed me and whats one better it impressed lyam he doesnt impress easily alaire didnt know what else to say his pride fully swollen he could easily forget the heat the muscle strains were melting away in it like butter on a skillet what did you want to do this evening kai asked at last first id like to get something to eat he said the hunger had returned after that vicious practice session with a vengeance he cant be suggesting another night on the town could he not again then after that what about going out to the tavern district again kai suggested hopefully youre good company alaire hid his dismay well i dont know id really rather not if you want to know the truth and nai tachal might need me i am his assistant does he do this every night kai made a face but relented the day is yours my friend whatever you like it sounded as if kai might be willing to do without his wine for onc but alaire was already suspecting that kai was going to come up with a way to get drunk anyway no matter what alaire said o chapt naitachal returned to their room to see if alaire was up yet but arrived to find him gone the bard found this surprising since hed had little sleep and often slept past noon at home he must be chumming around with the prince good maybe he can find the answers that i so far have failed to obtain paavos and pikhalas behavior confirmed fo dark elf that a dark sinister conspiracy reached to the highest levels of suinomen royalty but this con spiracy did not seem to include the crown princ odd that they still knew little about kai but alaire had managed to observe pointed to a lack of complicity on the childs behalf if anything the con spiracy targeted the crown prince as well as himself and alaire kai is a black sheep an outcast within the kingdom that by rights he should one day inherit this would make him both an easy and desirable target for anyone seeking to gain power or even to seize the crown alto gether the whole thing was troubling have we stumbled into a coup in progress or are they wh they may be simply laying the groundwork for one and we happened to come along at a most inop portune time he had the feeling that men close to the king were intentionally trying to shield him from foreign visitors while the king himself had no idea that anything of the sort was going on naitachal certainly had the impression at supper that the king intended to receive him all right lets assume that he wanted to talk to me but his minions are keeping me from seeing him if that is true then enemies surround the king and so far that list includes paavo johan pikhalas and per haps this sir jehan that alaire mentioned last night naitachal became suddenly worried for alaire as well as himself and kai we are the first and most likely targets if there is a coup wed be the first to die as the dark elf pondered these ominous thoughts he heard a soft knock on the door though the knock was quiet he started reaching for his blade the knock sounded again and naitachal approached the door sword drawn yes who is it he said ready for a garrison of sol diers to come storming through the door what do you want came to clean your room sir a young male voice replied timidly naitachal relaxed but not completely could still be a trap come in then he said remember no magic just good swordsmanship if this is another assassin the door opened slowly and a young boy of per haps thirteen years came in carrying a featherduster and a rag he wore the simple clothing that the rest of the servants wore a tunic of soft suede and short boots that were little more than slippers his long brown hair fell over his face but his eyes peered through it as he used it as a veil to hide his features when the boy saw the blade in naitachals hand he stopped dead in his tracks no threat here naitachal thought and put the blade away never mind that he said gesturing for the servant to come in just practicing the boy smiled apparently relieved and stepped closer to naitachal he looked up at the dark elf and his hair fell away from his face which was full of won der he stared for several moments speechless almost to the point of being annoying im the first elf this boys ever seen naitachal real ized and softened even more in most circumstances he would not have appreciated this awkward atten tion but because of the treatment so far from the adults of this land a smile even a curious one was a welcomed sight you speak althean the elf observed yes a little the child said shyly they teach it in school im a little keen on it the teachers say its important to speak the southerners tongue since were going to be trading with you more soon do they really naitachal replied a little more dryly than he had intended he had wondered why so many of the natives spoke fluent althean but are they teaching their youth our language to trade with us or to conquer us in either case a grasp of our language would be useful the boy giggled hiding his mouth with a grimy hand naitachal raised an eyebrow at him did i say something amusing your ears they pricked up just then naitachal felt blood rushing to his face a mild but uncontrollable response to an old familiar embarrass ment whenever a human noticed his ears his reaction was always the same perhaps it had some thing to do with growing up in a relatively closed elven culture this time though he was more amused than anything they did that because you said something interest ing to me he told the boy with a conspiratorial grin tell me what do the grownups say about althea naitachal made his ears wiggle the boy giggled again well that its warm and beautiful and seldom snows the child sighed as if that in itself was a won der and we can make lots of gold selling male dieren down there but no female dieren oh no the boy said as if hed uttered something incredibly stupid then you could breed your own naitachal burst into laughter the boy was charm ing the shoes off him the childs eyes widened but in delight not fear this boy can be helpful in many ways he thought his mind turning to the practical side of their mission ironic how the only information weve been able to obtain on this country has been from their youths he grinned and the boy grinned back now su naitachals harmlessness tell me your name lad erik the boy replied proudly son of e house of lieslund and i am naitachal the bard replied with a courtly bow now what does your father do erik hesitated for a moment then replied hes a teacher at the school i wanted to be a teacher too but my father says its a great honor to serve the king even if its only cleaning the rooms for his guests erik looked around the room and shrugged doesnt look like theres much to do here nothing like the other rooms ive seen i recall a late party naitachal replied absently perhaps you can help me the kings liaison has asked me to appear at the swords of the magic association hall i need to be there in an hour i havent the faintest notion where it might be the boys fresh innocence became a mask of horror oh you dont want to go there are they going to punish you for something he started walking back wards towards the door as if proximity to naitachal would somehow taint him its quite all right naitachal said somewhat puz zled by his reaction we have a similar instituti althea they just wanted to show me how their system works you didnt work magic without paying the gold of course not naitachal said crossing his arms and looking away stubbornly i dont look that stupid do i they wanted to explain exactly how the associa tion enforces the laws in my own land i am a kind of lawmaker myself this seemed to make only a slight difference eriks gaze fell to the floor then i guess i can tell you he walked over to the window over here you can see it from here outside the palace walls erik pointed to a short squat building surrounded by barren trees but plainly visible in the winter sun just beyond the palace grounds over there near the south wall dont look like much but its where they keep he was about to say something else but evi dently thought better of it where they keep what naitachal asked casually the prison of souls perhaps i cant say i mean im not supposed to say ive already said too much erik turned and made ready to leave is there anything i can fetch for you clean sheets a blanket well naitachal said wondering if hed finally run out of useful information for the time being this boy is receptive and curious at another time i think he could tell me many things about this palace the adults never would we seem to be a little short on wood but before you leave i just wanted you to know i wont be telling on you what we talked about is a secret if you shouldnt talk about something then i never heard it he gave the boy a wink that he hoped was reassuring oh please dont say anything to paavo the boy pleaded hed have my hide for sure that fool naitachal laughed at the name for good measure i say as little as i can to that he was about to say that human and stopped himself well that fool thats the only word i can think of to describe him erik giggled again reassured he bowed and thank you sir ill be back with your wood soon the boy vanished his light quick footsteps padding down the hall naitachal listened to him leave then closed the door firmly behind him well it looks like ive at least one ally in this godsforsaken place no one challenged naitachal as he passed through the corridors of the main palace though he felt some one was watching him noting his movements he said nothing to paavo as he let himself out through the front doors but he was aware of the mans beady eyes tracking him as he left so be it he thought let them know where im going perhaps theyll arrange my meeting with the king when they realize their childish tactics are not going to douse my curiosity the day was unseasonably warm for what he had come to expect from this land though the trees were barren of leaves the grass brown the vines in dor mancy it felt almost like a spring day for some reason this reminded him of his harp and in particular how little hed practiced it lately the beauty of nature reminded him of music hed had no music at all in his earlier year well hed had little pleasure at all devoting his life to necromancy the only beauty socially allowable was that found in the woodlands until hed met kevin in the days of the famous carlotta conquest he had never realized what a talent hed had for music now his true nature was tugging at him and he resolved to practice later that day without bardic magic of course and he would have to nudge alaire about his own practicing in spite of the court intrigue theyd found themselves involved in the boy couldnt afford to get rusty bardic magic was a weapon of defense but music was an art gods help us if either one of us are ever in a bind serious enough to break these thrice damned la suinomen given the severity of the laws and the enthusiasm this kingdom appeared to have for enforc ing them he doubted even the gods would be able to do much on their behalf all he knew of this so far had come at secondhand from alaire while he didnt doubt what the boy had said he needed to verify some of the things the bardling had told this whole mystery could hinge on what i find in this association hall the uncertainty of how they would receive him put a spring in his step and heightened his awareness in no time at all he found the building erik had pointed out somewhat reluctantly from his bedroom window everywhere but here the buildings stood so close together that there wasnt a handsbreadth of space between them except here there were no other buildings here only a sad tangle of trees and bushes setting it apart from the rest behind it the hill rose steeply too steeply to build upon perhaps to the right was the wall of the palace gardens to the fore the street and to the lef to the left a wide distance full of tangled vegeta tion separated the building from its neighbors as if no one wanted to build too ne there was a thin trail leading to it blown over with leaves that indicated very little foot traffic but there was an odd feeling to the place itself as if something hidden deep below the ground was wrong very wrong twisted to investigate further however he would have to use magic to probe and he had no desire to spend any time in prison this close to the association hall he expected that he would have very little time before the wizards and magicmakers came storming out of the squat building looking for whoever was stupid enough to cast a spell so near the hall had no obvious guards though he sus pected there were probably alarmspells to notify those within that a stranger was approaching but as he came to the entrance its front door badly in need of repair he sensed nothing either they had used no spell at all or they were better at this than he sus pected he came to believe in the former having seen nothing so far during his visit to suggest any excep tional skill in the magical arts they would have had to be quite impressive to surprise me naitachal thought at times he found it easy living with the humans to forget his necromancers past his teachers and his clan of dark elves the elves grasp of magic went back many thousands of years whereas the humans had only recently mastered some of the rudiments yet that was often enough in the hands of novices magic can be quite dangerous he knocked once on the large plank doors noting the worn paint the bare places where the weathered wood showed through a few moments passed before he considered letting himself in presently he heard footsteps advancing towards the door followed by a loud creaking as it opened a small nervous man looked around the door peer naitachal and made ready to shut the door in his face dont be so hasty naitachal said sternly not using a magical controlling voice but with a normal mun dane voice delivered in an authoritative tone ive only come to see what this place is all about dark elf advanced a step what wondrous magic you must work in this place you dont even need fight to work by oh but we do not permit elves here the man said timidly but naitachal ignored him dont be silly i am a visiting diplomat if this place is off limits then no one has bothered to tell me he entered a darkness punc tuated with dim flickering candles some no more than stubs no windows in this place one or two would make all the difference whos in charge here i am a loud booming voice announced why has an elf dared to darken the doorstep of the associa tion hall soren the man who opened the door exclaimed he forced his way in here it wasnt my fault he ran off into the shadows and stopped there gesturing with agitation the second speaker answered him in an impatient voice the little man whined his reply naitachal stood in the darkness listening to them argue as with any elf his eyes adjusted to the gloom quickly an over weight wizard wearing a gaudy tawdry robe glared at him from a spiraling staircase naitachal wondered how the flimsy staircase could hold the mans weight but evidently the wizard had no worries about it at the top of the stairs naitachal saw an opened door naitachal only caught a glimpse of the room beyond but from where he stood it looked like an establishment of dubious repute scantily clad females appeared in the doorway and peered down confirming his suspicions before retreating nervously and closing the door behind them please forgive my intrusion he began evenly i am ambassador naitachal from the kingd althea while i respect your laws and do not wish to violate them i would like to see how precisely he paused glancing up at the nowclosed door the prac tice of magic is sanctioned and administered in your fine land the wizard flushed then blustered forward we do not allow beings such as yourself in the associ hall naitachal raised an eyebrow and why not it is ah forbidden naitachal considered his situation i can either leave or i can turn this into an international incident and then leave but something tells me this is impor tant that i need to see the inner workings of this place or at least as much as i can persuade them to show me perhaps i should leave then naitachal began soren is it he coughed politely i have to admit i am a bit disappointed at what ive seen already althea we have granted our mages homes to equal those of the wealthiest nobles and they engage in the councils of the king as equal to any there i was under the impression that your mages enjoyed equal power and prestige but it appears that i was mistaken per haps there isnt much for me to see here after all the elf turned to leave arranging his face in a mask of disappointment now wait just a minute soren began its not entirely fair to judge our association by just what youve seen here we have power and honor naitachal paused then said casually over his shoul der frankly i have not seen anything yet that would lead me to agree with that statement unless you would like to show me the inner halls of this place the wizard hesitated as if he was tempted to prove to the bard that his words were no boast what could it hurt naitachal added my liaison has never said this was forbidden to me go ahead impress me if you can the wizard stammered unintelligibly naitachal shrugged and started for the door if you would follow me soren sputtered i will escort you to the heart of the association hall the place of our deepest and most powerful magics only if you promise not to wander off by yourself very well naitachal agreed and turned back soren descended the rest of the stair and motioned to him to follow the wizard led him through a short passageway opened a door with a flourish and gestured grandly behold he said proudly the heart of the associa tion this is it naitachal almost said he couldnt believe it all the kingdoms magic is performed in this little place though considerably larger than the great hall of the palace this place left much to be desired at least here some sunlight came in through two narrow windows high at the top of the rafters it was enough light though to show the sheer barrenness of the room the pale wood planks that served as wall and floor the brazier that hung above them the unpainted walls hanging in the air was a nasty aroma reminding him of burning tar so as i understand it all magic must be cast here and only by license he raised an eyebrow to someone from my land this seems somewhat restrictive the king is very generous when he grants licenses to practitioners soren replied defensively he almost never turns anyone down interesting naitachal tried to look as if it was interesting how much does a license cost for say a simple spell of good luck soren beamed oh that would be three thousand crowns more depending on the duration of the spell naitachal wasnt sure what that translated althean currency but it sounded high nothing he saw explained why such things were regulated and nowhere did he see a sign of all the official mages that were supposed to be here all those wizards mat had burst into the audience chamber the day they arrived were nowhere in sight perhaps they resided in the palace on a more or less permanent basis perhaps not perhaps despite the robes and silly hats they hadnt been wizards at all perhaps this whole thing was a facade but if that were the case who was finding the unli censed mages last night and who had cast that spell of magicdetection that had come sweeping over him self and the boy before they ever arrived here the hall wasnt empty at one end sitting outside a circle of what was probably salt crudely drawn inside a pentagram a wizard sat staring at the contents of a jar which was set at the middle of the pentagram he sat crosslegged looking utterly bored as naitachal watched he yawned hes been there all day im not sure what hes up to soren said i hope you didnt have something in mind hes booked the hall for the rest of the day and if i did naitachal asked shrewdly and i had the coin soren shook his head nervously im afraid that simply wouldnt be allowed first of all youre not a citizen the dark elf suspected this was the least of the reasons and the wizard continued youre an elf naitachal chuckled surprising the wizard i know that my parents told me long ago my mirror repeats that information every day what special significance does that have soren frowned looking down at the wood floor i think perhaps it is time for you to leave he started towards the door this way sir naitachal shrugged nothing he had seen here shed any light on his problems and he wasnt happy that not one of his main questions had been answered this is not where they practice the real magic instead this is just the place where they let the ama teurs sit and stare at pentagrams and crystals the answer must be somewhere in the palace in a place i havent seen yet as soren led him to the front door naitachal sensed something beneath the hall deep under ground it was the same ominous darkness hed felt earlier but stronger now and obviously coming from directly beneath him soren seemed oblivious to it which only made sense the dark elf had already decided he was far from being a real magician his magical abilities are probably only a notch or two above those of the poor chap back there staring at the jar but there was an entity down there beneath the hall alive malicious and very very much aware of his presence something is down there something not of earth and its watching me he wanted to probe to see what this thing was but that would mean using magic so tempting perhaps this is exactly what someone has in mind chap after sitting in steam for as long as they could stan kai led alaire out of the sowna and immediately went charging into the small lake just outside he instructed alaire to follow trust me kai shouted alaire shook his head and regarded the lake dubi ously under pretense of making certain of their privacy which was in doubt given the leafless state of the trees separating them from the rest of the palace grounds he hesitated for several long minutes before immersing his bare body in what had to be icecold water then finally after increasingly scathing com ments from kai regarding his masculinity he tested the water by dipping a single toe in the frigid lake aaaarrrrgh alaire shouted leaping back from the waters edge a thin skin of ice was forming around the shore youve got to be kidding kai stood waistdeep in the lake and his expression said clearly the prince considered alaires manhood to be in question after all a gust of chill breeze reminded him that it was win ter above the water as well as below gritting his teeth he forced himself to plunge into the lake if it will impress kai the icy water instantly numbed his body he immediately turned around intending to get out as quickly as he had got in and stepped into a deep depression cold water closed over his head he flailed his arms in panic until his feet gained purchase on higher ground when he lurched up to the surface clutching his sides he tried to scream but his voice wouldnt work thats more like it kai said he was getting out of the water heading back to the sowna where their clothes were where are you going alaire managed to gasp kai grinned back where its warm its cold in there alaire could have strangled him but he figured this would not bode well for any future diplomatic relations with suinomen he followed kai out of the lake hiphopping to the shore hoping to speed up his circulation chagrined he noticed that certain important portions of himself had retreated in terror into his body the sacrifices i make for althea he thought shiver ing his way back to the sowna he had no idea where kai was taking him theyd donned their simple clothes and headed back to the palace without a word said about their destination where are we going alaire asked casually as they entered the warmth of the palace were not going out again are we kai smirked giving his companion the impression he was keeping an amusing secret to himself ive already said we werent besides do you think id be caught dead in public in these clothes alaire shrugged resigned to the fact he would find out where they were going when they got there he had to admit after the steam in the sowna followed by the brisk dip in the icy lake he was very much awake now his strained muscles now felt better alaire mentioned this to kai who replied the heat in the sowna followed by the cold water helps that ill bet you feel it tomorrow though but it wont be nearly as bad i told you there was a good reason for everything alaire grumbled under bis breath about barbarians and torture but the boy pointedly ignored him they strolled through some of the more highly decorated portions of the palace halls covered with murals of rustic revelry intricate scroll work deco rated the trim and moldings or rather appeared to on further examination he saw that this was an illu sion a skilled artist had painted the flat wood surfaces giving the impression of sculpted plaster with cleverly depicted shadows he wondered if this was some obscure comment on suinomen society servants stopped what they were doing and bowed deeply as they passed but kai didnt bask in the atten tion as much as alaire thought he might he doesnt feel like a prince alaire said to himself perhaps he does feel as worthless as he says he is the end of the hallway opened onto a grand com pletely enclosed glassedin balcony which overlooked the bay this portion of the palace perched vertically upon the cliff face as much he reasoned for security as for the sheer beauty of the view boats wallowed at their anchorages in the shallow waves of the harbor below the sight combined with the abundance of sun warming the balcony made him feel slightly drowsy ah helena my sweet kai cooed as a well endowed maiden came flouncing over from a window seat and pecked him on the cheek you ready to marry me yet helena giggled as did three other young women sprawled about on the cushioned benches set below the windows two of them could have been twin sisters when alaire appraised them from a discreet distance he realized they probably were long silky curtains hung on the walls giving the balcony a very feminine atmosphere he started to feel uncomfortable as he tried to assess the kind of situation kai had introduced him to this did not look like his mothers solar but it also did not look like anything else he recognized he was afraid that the young women here might be something other than the kinds of young women he should be associating with the prospect made his stomach quiver alaire was even at the notsotender age of nine teen still a virgin and though naturally desirous of rectifying the situation he knew it would be madness to even dream of doing so here and now assume every friendly female you meet is in the employ of our enemies naitachal had said wise advice alaire reluctantly knew naitachal had often commented that his upbringing had an odd mixture of naivete and street smarts dont get ahead of yourself he thought you dont know whats going on here yet there could be an innocent explanation for all this right these are kais schoolmates and those boats down there are going to take to the air and fly away like a flock of gulls and whos this helena said moving clos alaire he unconsciously took a step backwards a new friend allow me to introduce kai began pausi alaires warning look one of the ambassadors althea meet his lordship alaire reristo alaire meet helena helena bowed slightly offered her hand alaire took it and kissed it gallantly the twins giggled hysterically alaires face burned kai proceeded with the introductions and over there kai gestured grandly towards the twins are in order of appearance heikki and aini he leaned closer to alaire whispered and i think they like you they like to share if you know what i mean alaire fought back a wave of dizziness pleased to meet you he said to no one of them in particular his words came out a full octave higher than usual he leaned over to kai whispered back no i dont know what you mean and the fourth lady kai continued indicating a more modestly dressed lady a bit older than the oth ers is rajanen she will be entertaining us today on the harp on the alaire started glancing around the room what he had first thought was an oddly shaped piece of sculpture was a harp indeed the large non portable kind that remained in music rooms and moved only rarely rajanen smiled politely and stood up gracefully she made her way over to the instrument seated her self on a small stool leaned the huge instrument against her shoulder and began playing it was a soft lilting tune evidently selected to tranquilize or alaires frame of mind calm the jitters perhaps she observed this the prospect made his face burn even more come lets sit kai led them over to the flat couches and clapped his hands three times now we will have that meal youve been begging for since this morning at first he thought kai was referring to something besides food out here in the open better come up with some kind of story something conventional something believable and something that would make me he thought about it a moment got it im engaged back home he blurted out his announcement passed without comment as they sat on the cushioned benches now out in the full sun two servants appeared with trays of food oh the two young men didnt seem to notice the women as they entered they stared straight ahead unblinking they opened small folding tables and set the trays down taking the silvered covers with them kai hardly acknowledged them as they marched back into the palace alaire regarded the food in a mixed mood he was hungry yet his stomach was in knots still the practice had taken a lot out of him and the romp in the royal ice water had put an edge on his hunger pheasant he exclaimed in approval and whats that thats dieren ribs of course you do eat me althea do you not of course we do alaire said picking up one of the ribs he saw no silverware so he assumed this to be proper etiquette but remember we dont have dieren id never even seen a dieren until i got here you hadnt kai asked momentarily perplexed until his attention suddenly shifted back to the fair ones who had joined them and were hanging on his every word intoxicated by rank helena had firmly planted herself next to alaire and proceeded to lightly run her fingers across his thigh he found himself sweating profusely rajanen continued to play her harp oblivious to everything but her music after lunch the servants came in and took the trays and tables away replacing them with an iceddown bucket of bottled ale ah thats more like it kai said reaching for one of the bottles oh dont be such a barbarian helena said play fully youre shoving the cork into the bottle ah but i am a vulgar barbarian kai replied i always shove the cork in the bottle when you tip it over it doesnt drain away as fast unamused alaire pretended to laugh along with the rest its starting all over another day another drunk for prince kainemonen at least this time were safe inside the palace instead of out tavernhopping with the ugly crowd he reconsidered this remem bering naitachals clash with the assassin and all the unanswered questions about the political clima suinomen and frowned perhaps we would be saf the dead dragon inn kai handed him an ale and opened more for the ladies then finally one for himself the prince began a long exaggerated account of their adventures the night before throwing in hordes of drunken sailors mobs of villainous ruffians an elaborate chase through the city streets with the con stables hot on their heels and an encounter with an illegal magician who supposedly performed a spell that set the tavern they were drinking in afire the ladies listened avidly evidently believing every word he said for good measure he threw in a few heroic words for alaire explaining how alaire had kais help of course beheaded four of the sailors with a single sword blow kai drank and fibbed emp tying one bottle of ale after another soon a noticeable flush came over the boy he was almost as drunk as the night before well kai said wrapping his arms around the two sisters please excuse me for a moment ill be right back alarmed alaire watched as kai heikki and aini rose kai winking at him for effect they disappeared down a hallway which led presumably to a bed some where now what alaire thought looking around nerv ously but pointedly not looking at helena helena leaned closer he looked for the harpist to request a tune to break the ominous silence noticing the music had stopped sometime during kais long tale and saw that rajanen had vanished too discreetly he thought she knew what was about to happen he glanced over at helena who somehow moved closer still almost purring her hand stilled during kais story recom menced its work in panic alaire leaped to his feet intending to pace the balcony it was a moment before he realized what his sudden move had done helena sat sprawled on the floor oh gods he thought rushing over to her im so sorry when he helped her up he saw thankfully that she didnt seem angered i dont know what came over me as he offered his hand helena took it running a long fingernail seductively across his palm at the sudden unexpected sensation his hand spasmed helena went sprawling a second time oh no helena i when he saw her face words failed him this time he thought she was going to slap him he wanted to slap himself he offered his hand again but this time she refused his help wisely he thought i think i can manage she said softly but the slight edge to her voice was unmistakable is something wrong alaire sat beside her on the bench his face in his hands he hoped this posture would elicit the right amount of sympathy for him but he doubted it im sorry he said its just that im engaged to be married i didnt see an engagement ring she sniffed i suppose i shouldnt have assumed its a long story he said hoping she wouldnt probe his weak lie any further you are very beaut helena prince kainemonen has good taste attractive friends pleasant company misjudged the circumstance i wasnt expecting a harem this balcony please accept my apologies i meant no insult she smiled this time with visible regret shame she said whimsically getting to her feet she regarded him with a gamin pout alaires stomach quivered again your lady is a fortunate soul she said simply and left the balcony by way of the same exit kai and the twins had taken alaire stared after her for several long moments wishing the whole thing had never happened or at least gone well differently suddenly he was filled with vain regrets and longings lucky she had left when she did now what is kai going to think of me will he believe my story about the fictitious fiance probably though he may wonder why i didnt mention her before then it hit him shes gone to join them three in one afternoon no wonder he wasnt looking for women when we were out last night the whole incident left alaire feeling both embar rassed and depressed a very unpleasant mix of emotions im not a prude am i the tavern wenches of the night before behaved better than these ladies courtiers should act better than this then again perhaps he was assuming too much this isnt althea after all i shouldnt expect their people to have the same social rules we do but they were in the company of the prince and evidently good friends you dont approve do you young ambassador alaire turned violently at the sudden spoken words captain lyam stood in the doorway his arms folded with a wry grin of amusement on his rough face the young man got to his feet feeling and acting like a schoolboy caught at something naughty the captain entered the room casually as if he owned it it might not have been obvious to anyone else but alaire has seen that kind of careful too casual looking around before hes making sure were alone he thought and relaxed it didnt feel like an intrusion it felt instead like a rescue i didnt mean to eavesdrop lyam began sound carries quite well from this particular room and kai made no secret of who was in here and why alaire felt his ears burning again wondering what exactly the captain had heard particularly of the exchange between himself and helena oh gods he bemoaned did this man hear me turn down the direct proposition of a beautiful lady this was no longer a question of his behavior as a visiting ambassador of another nation this was a question of his own mascu linity this is getting personal helena seemed intent on entertaining you young man lyam said strolling over to one of the benches and sitting down as he if owned the place what was the real reason you turned her down alaire successfully stifled a gurgle i he began and stammered he must have seen through the fiance story she was how shall i say it too too brash alaire shrugged forward brazen alaire nodded mutely close enough agree lyam said shes a little well light minded would be the polite term alaire looked up somewhat dazed he was going to call her something else and i bet i know what that something else was some women are worth courting lyam contin ued scratching his bearded chin thoughtfully for a long time months years sometimes and then when the moment is right and you love the woman and she returns it the results that come with that love are appropriate alaire started to relax with this man this was not the same person he had been sparring with earlier that day lyam was more like a concerned father now not a vicious opponent his bump of caution told him he should be a little more wary around this man but his heart was telling him it wouldnt be necessary where did the prince go lyam asked suddenly he must know the answer alaire knew but he humored him anyway he nodded towards the door lyams eyes rolled and he slowly shook his head and you dont approve alaire said the man grimaced i gather you do not either since it was clear to him his masculinity was no longer in doubt he felt free to speak no sir i dont in our kingdom ladies do not behave that way or if they do well they are not ladies and their conduct is not appropriate and sir no prince should have friends of that sort those women are no friends of his lyam nor is sir jehan alaire blurted lyam regarded him with a hard stare alaire instantly regretted the slip what are you saying you fool he screamed at himself you dont know what side hes on the stare softened and lyam nodded in agreement indeed he isnt lyam replied regarding him fur ther with an expression that made alaire think of hidden blades and ambushes in dark places i just dont know what to think of you young bardling you are a careful observer but his eyes told alaire that he had made up his mind alread wait a minute young bardling how does he know that yes how could he know that alaire wondered about his safety then lyam im sitting in the same room unarmed with a master swordsman who could only know i was studying to be a bard if he wer kings spymaster as well as the captain o guar alaire tensed suddenly looking for an escape lyam sat without motion his gaze unwavering i would not speak or move very quickly if i were you came the deep reassuring voice of alaires mas ter from somewhere behind the length of curtains the curtains fluttered and naitachal stepped out from behind them as casually as if hed entered the room under common circumstances lyam did not react nor did he seem surprised his expression remained bland naitachal offered no explanation of his presence and lyam didnt ask for one the dark elfs black cloak fluttered in the breath of air that came in from the hall he paced forward with his flowing graceful walk as smoothly as a cat he stood a few feet away looking as serene as hed ever been how in the world did he get back there alaire wondered he had no idea how his master done so without using magic but still alaire was very grateful to see him there i might live now he could only guess that naitachal knew somehow that he and kai would come to this balcony and had crept behind the curtains unnoticed before they arrived lyam continued to sit very calmly showing no sign of alarm believe me ambassador if i had wanted your protege dead he would be so now using the same tactics your underling employed against me last night naitachal asked smoothly for the first time during the encounter lyam was visibly rattled last night naitachal studied him further saying nothing alaire knew his masters expression well it boded soft speech and clever verbal maneuvering that could pull the words right out of ones mouth and get one to confess to almost anything i sure hope hes not using magic to help him right now ambassador are you claiming you were attacked lyam stared at the dark elf with narrowed eyes why didnt you summon help naitachal shrugged none seemed available at the time and afterwards i doubted it would make any dif ference so you didnt send an assassin to kill me lyam seemed flustered what possible reason would anyone have to do that naitachal frowned i did not think you to be so obtuse captain to trigger a war of course but if you did not i most certainly did not lyam exclaimed i was looking for an ally in your company not a target for assassination silence for a long moment then who could have naitachal asked grimly alaire caught a key word in lyams last statement ally that would imply an inner political struggle of some sort one that this man would want us to take sides on perhaps our guesses werent so far off afte naitachal seated himself on one of the benches folding his hands comfortably and unaggressively on his lap the posture had the desired effect lyam relaxed slightly emphasizing how little hed tensed up naitachal began my researches lead me to trust you sir in fact i came looking for you captain lyam i wish to lay my cards on the table so to speak lyam nodded cautiously i have questions the first and most obvious to me is why are there so few nonhumans in this land this was not the case several years ago though other nonhumans were not plentiful the dwarves who are excellent artificers and makers of weapons and never had much love for magic either were present in great numbers lyam nodded in agreement opened his mouth to say something then apparently thought better of it he let naitachal continue uninterrupted my own people as well as the white elves vi suinomen often enough that most folk knew at least what an elf looked like your own guard employed many orcs upon the northern border but all of this has changed naitachal raised a single eyebrow inquisitively why lyam cleared his throat but alaire could see it was only a stalling tactic designed to give him time to for mulate an answer yes captain of the guard why is that if anyone would know you would well lyam said the nonhumans were at one time more numerous i must admit but about twentyfive or thirty years ago the government encouraged them to leave something happened back then what i do not know but it was decisive and sudden i was a child herding dieren in the hills then i remember nothing except that suddenly the nonhumans were gone and this didnt happen over several years it happened almost overnight and now the government advises those who cross our borders to cross back as soon as their business is complete once they hear about the prison of souls they usually find urgent business elsewhere naitachal nodded sagely was this about the time magic became illegal lyam frowned suinomen has always regulated magic he corrected carefully at that time however it became more difficult to practice thats whe association came into existence and of course prison of souls and the swords of the magicians naitachal per sisted the same they are the enforcement arm o association actually magic isnt illegal it simply requires a permit naitachal snorted let us not spar with words my dear captain semantics is my specialty magic is for all intents illegal in suinomen ive seen the hall and the farce it really is no magicians of any reputation would bother with it and how much is the price license more than most can afford it is a common tactic my friend if you wish to make something dif ficult to obtain without actually making it illegal you put a high price upon it and i am sure if someone like myself actually had the gold to pay for such a license there would be other obstacles to obtaining it than mere money lyam seemed chastened but didnt seem eager to leap to the defense of suinomens magical policy of course the magician in question would have to pass certain criteria he couldnt have a history of non compliance with suinomen law he couldnt have a criminal record naitachal translated ill agree with that what else his political view would have to align wit kings naitachal shrugged and it would be helpful but technically necessary to have a friend within the association that goes without saying naitachal said dryly now assuming one had all those things what would be the price of an unlimited license the kind the mages of the association have lyam sucked in his breath shook his head ten thousand crowns thats outrageous naitachal said echoing alaires thoughts how can anyone much less professional magicians afford such a fee lyam raised his upturned palms in helplessness a strange gesture from a man as strong physically and psychologically as he i dont make the rules ambas sador the answer is they dont because there are no professional magicians in suinomen save for the ones in the kings employ the association in other words naitachal nodded and it goes full circle magic is legal but it isnt and the only magicians who can prac tice their trade are for all intents and purposes dancing to the tune called by the king am i leaving anything out alaire cringed at the last statement his master made if he doesnt watch out hes going to ali captain lyam and we need this man but lyam did not take exception to naitachals evaluation of suinomen if anything he appeared to be in full agreement no i dont believe so he said simply as i said i dont make the policy yes i know another thing naitachal said leading the conversation what gave the king the notion that his son is conspiring against him that lyam didnt seem surprised indicated this was probably a common rumor im not in his majestys confidence however i am the princes friend as well as his swordsmanship tutor and i do not think there is any truth in the idea naitachal cast a questioning glance towards alaire as if to confirm this alaire picked his words carefully captain lyam here is an excellent swordsman and from all i could see he and the prince have a unique friendship i think that the prince needs friends he is nowhere near as ah mature as he would like to appear lyam nodded the boy is raw that is for certain hes like a cornered wildcat if the wrong blades come after him and he wont hesitate to defend himself in a fight but i know for a fact that he has no designs on the throne in fact i think he would rather not have the throne he dreads the day he will have to sit in it because he knows it will be the end of his freedom when he does and i think he fears that day as well because he knows how ill prepared he is to rule i suspect this might be the reason for his hedonis tic lifestyle then naitachal said which because of his extreme youth has yet to affect his health the captain keeps him in shape alaire offered if its not the other way around lyam said hell never believe i said this so i feel confident telling you that young hothead gives me a greater run than he thinks when we spar alaire disagreed what he had seen earlier that day did little to convince him this was true hes belittling his own skill perhaps so we will underestimate him shrewd but not necessarily suspicious this doesnt mean hes an enemy it means only he is not willing to divulge everything yet naitachal gazed off into the distance over lyams shoulder if kai isnt after the throne then who is lyam frowned im not certain thats whats afoot i am not privy to all the information this palace con tains naitachals tone was heavy with irony but surely being the captain of the guard and spymaster alaire added to himself that does not guarantee my complete knowledge of royal affairs lyam replied firmly this may have been true at one time but i suspect that i got this position because i was an outsider that may sound odd to a foreigner but the true power doesnt lie with anyone in a martial appointment naitachal looked faintly surprised where then does it lie it was lyams turn to snort with the magicians of course the palace has a monopoly on the powers of the mages you see powerful wizards who can level the walls of this palace in mere moments with their raised energies naitachal chuckled please what i saw in the hall didnt impress me lyam simply smiled who said they were i hall only the amateurs operate there when you first met the king and his bodyguards and wi came charging out to defend him against an unex pected elf where did they come from naitachal considered this of course from behind the kings throne they reside in the palace lyam got to his feet calling a halt to the discussion weve spoken long enough here he turn alaire i would be grateful if your pupil would con tinue to keep company with the young prince if i cannot keep him from folly i would like to know there was someone at his back that i can trust he started toward the entrance then paused and turned back for a moment oh and another thing avoid magic im not certain diplomatic immunity would protect you and also if you wish to confer later tonight my room is one floor above yours and i think two doors to the north its the corner suite whic king has been gracious enough to provide for me but be discreet it would start tongues wagging if anyone saw you paying me a visit good day master bard master bard alaire thought stunned is there any thing lyam doesnt know about us he and his master watched the large man leave he noticed this time that the captains head barely cleared the doorway as he passed beneath it naitachal stared after him thoughtfully he is or was the kings spymaster naitachal said after a long moment was i think he keeps his network of spies still but it is a small one now and he is no longer in the kings confidence alaire wanted to ask how precisely he knew this but experience had shown the dark elf would not waste his breath and precious time explaining if any thing naitachal would berate him for not figuring it out for himself and in a moment he had figured it out hes friends with the prince but he doesnt know wh king mistrusts his own son and he hasnt been able to do anything about that mistrust that means he isnt close to the king anymore naitachal nodded exactly in fact supportin prince may have been the reason he fell from grace but he doesnt know whos behind the troubles between the prince and his father or his land and ours im certain of it alaire sighed and stood up what do we do now you my young friend must stay with kai nai tachal considered something else then added and i believe i shall seek this sir jehan and pick his brains myself chapt naitachal left alaire on the balcony the first thing he did after leaving the room was to see if anyone was in the hallway who could have overheard them he found no one not even a servant and trusted his con versation with captain lyam had been a private one the talk with the burly swordsman had convinced him that they were both in danger here and he con templated returning to althea for alaires protection they should have sent another ambassador someone whos had experience with this kind of political mess he thought stopping short of using the term expend able this situation is more dangerous than i had ever suspected but to leave now would only humiliate alaire without accomplishing anything for althea and they would be vulnerable on the road out of here he could imagine the ease with which the opposing fac tion could have them both eliminated without witnesses and then be able to blame their demise on hazards of travel natural predators bandits or just simple bad luck in many ways they were safer here in this pit of wolves because any harm that came to them would be most difficult to explain to an enraged king reynard while this didnt grant them any immunity from hazards within the palace it did give them some lever age provided of course suinomen didnt declare an allout war against althea in which case questions of their fate would become moot better to deal with it now he thought resigned to the task ahead of him he found the huge antechamber to the kings suite a grand room nearly the size of the great hall taste fully decorated with ornate upholstered furniture and several heads of dieren and other creatures of the for est mounted on plaques hanging on the pale plastered walls the floor as it was in just about every corner in the palace was light unfinished pine thirty or so individuals of obviously high rank lounged or talked fervently in groups in their native language a raging fire burned in a large fireplace around which most of the courtiers gathered somewhere beyond the double doors at the end of the room was the kings reception hall and the chamber for his private audi ences it was maddening to be so close and yet be unable to pass those doors if he could only have used magic to make himself invisible well he couldnt and that was no one seemed to pay any real attention to him as he entered perhaps these people are too polite to stare he could only hope from the doors at the other end of the room pikhalas emerged there was a graying noble with him and at that moment one of the group by the fire called something out to both of them and naitachal recognized at least one thing in that hail the na sir jehan who was obviously the man pikhalas had just taken to speak with archenomen hmmmm a confidant of the king interesting nai tachal thought very very interesting pikhalas spotted the dark elf immediately naitachal feared he would take sir jehan and flee through the nearest exit the kings aide did the opposite he whispered something to his compan ion who nodded and regarded naitachal evenly they both came over to him without hesitation what remarkable luck naitachal thought or is it ah my dear ambassador pikhalas offered how fortunate we both are he extended his hand and shook naitachals black one warmly allow me to introduce sir jehan he would like to speak to you pikhalas quickly excused himself leaving the elf and human to fend for themselves i think we should go somewhere private sir jehan said glancing fur tively around him this room is full of folk with acute hearing and loose tongues naitachal nodded solemnly following the noble to a smaller adjoining library leading off the antechamber it had a single window also looking over the bay but this side of the palace was colder than the sunny warmth of the balcony on the opposite side next to the window was a large set of wooden doors with golden handles a dying fire threatened to sputter out in a stove and as sir jehan stoked it heat flooded the library naitachal took this opportunity to study the man he was certainly no commoner not if the ermine that trimmed his heavy winter cloak was real and not rabbit made up to resemble that royal fur he dressed in shades of gray and black silk with tall soft black leather boots the toes tipped with silver t alaire had described a rascally sort of man thi jehan seemed the very opposite the gray in his hair and beard gave him a distinguished air which was en tirely at odds with the description alaire had given there is a new chill in the air sir jehan said ami ably turning to the elf im afraid the pleasant weather weve had during your stay is about to come to an abrupt halt i was wondering if this was typical weather nai tachal said cautiously it has been rather enjoyable sir jehan waved at one of two leather chairs please have a seat we have much to discuss naitachal did so finding the padded leather chair unexpectedly comfortable sir jehan took a similar seat leaned forward and studied his hands in spite of his fashionable dress his dignified manner there was something about him that put the dark elf on guard whatever hes hiding hes not going to share it with me naitachal thought at least not now im not certain how to phrase this precisely jehan began slowly so as not to offend you sir i believe we can resolve whatever differences exist between our two kingdoms naitachal readily sup plied that is of course my mission a puzzled look passed briefly over sir jehans face no you misunderstand while i am happy to hear that thats not the situation im referring to i see naitachal replied carefully then what situation are you referring to jehan coughed your assistant alaire i believe his name is oh gods naitachal thought keeping his expression neutral do they know hes the son of the king per haps i should have spirited him away when i had the chance jehans smooth expression gave nothing away it is no secret that since last night when you two arr alaire has become a companion of our dear prince does he suspect something shady about this yes i believe they met shortly after dinner last night p kainemonen invited my secretary out for a night of light entertainment as if you didnt know that first hand or did you think alaire hadnt told me hmmm i think i see what youre getting at such an acquaintance between prince and a visiting diplomat even the diplomats secretary would not seem terribly out of place in althea have we perhaps violated some rule of social order in your fine land oh no sir jehan said blandly on the contrary im grateful to see such informal mingling between people of our two lands your assistant has done no wrong by befriending the prince although i do under stand they ran into a bit of trouble in town i heard through the network of contacts in the tavern district that the prince picked a sword fight with some unruly sailors regrettably the brawl drew your assistant into it im afraid such behavior is quite common with our young rulertobe and i have to admit to some embar rassment over the incident naitachal nodded still wondering what the mans point was alaire may not seem to be very old but he is capable of handling himself suinomen has nothing to apologize for however he went with the prince willingly without my knowledge or consent not that he needed permission from me you understand he is not the envoy i am and as you know young men will have their little excitements i became aware of this last night now sir jehan produced a cool smile and one that did not reach his eyes from what ive heard your secretary is a rather remarkable swordsman sir jehans right eyebrow raised at this but he made no further comment alaires training he continued in a lowered voice i may i would like to speak freely but in confidence just between the two of us and with no diplomatic matters involved my concern is for your secre ambassador our young prince is a bad influence even though your secretary is an adult and can take care of himself this doesnt make him immune to cer tain unsavory influences in our land i was under the impression that they were only out drinking naitachal said in defense of both young men what influences there may be more to it than that sir jehan said and there was a certain sly shading to his words though i cannot be more precise there could be more to kainemonens nightly jaunts than we know he does this drunken tavernhopping regularly in the very worst parts of town no lady of good blood will associate with him even incognito this answered a question that had been gnawing at the dark elf since he spied on kai alaire and their cluster of maidens those women were of a much lower class no higher than servants i should think i should have guessed as much i still think alaire is safe naitachal said he has enough good sense not to become involved with women who may ultimately seek to cause him trouble unless there are other factors you havent mentioned yet if sir jehan took offense at this he didnt show it i do hope that having a friend his own age will settle kai down a bit but im afraid that alaire does not have a strong enough personality to resist kais depravity if i may speak frankly alaire seems to be rather young for a diplomatic mission even as a mere assistant he is here to polish his skills under my tutelage naitachal informed him simply but he is very close very close to the kings heart sir jehan gave him a knowing look as if he under stood all too well that yes alaire was indeed a favorite bastard good his disguise seems to be holding naitachal smiled faintly i agreed to take him as my assistant largely to please king reynard i admit he is a little raw and i had hoped that some of your fine cul ture would rub off on him during this visit hes never been outside of althea please forgive any uncouth behavior you may observe in him but i do assure you his personality is strong and fundamentally good his morals secure sir jehan sighed and shook his head woefully kais debauchery is the root of the troubles between him and his father the boy simply refuses to behave like a civilized adult or even a civilized child and he certainly refuses to behave like a prince naitachal shrugged then why is it critical that kai be the crown prince certainly if he had a younger brother he raised an eyebrow the solution seems a simple one to me sir jehan shook his head sadly kainemonens birth was a most difficult one the queen is unable to be a mother again disgraced she seldom appears in pub lic unlike other kingdoms it is not acceptable fo king to rid himself of her or select a favored byblow it is the way of our land so it is kai who will inherit the throne or nobody naitachal pursed his lips in an imitation of thoughtful ness i think im beginning to see the problem jehan waved that off as not important all that is immaterial to this discussion however my concern is with your assistant his close association with kai could very well discredit your mission here this took naitachal by surprise still there was no hint they knew alaires true identity and why is that he asked making no secret of his surprise the motives of someone who befriends a potential problem in our kingdom are somewhat in question sir jehan replied and he is your assistant what he does will by necessity reflect on you i expect no trouble either for you or for your young man but it looks suspicious for you for your assistant and for your kingdom in general this too naitachal was beginning to get the gist of is this sir jehan a part of the opposing force in suino men politics that captain lyam warned us both about he was not going to let this man intimidate him the direction their discussion was taking was starting to sound like an attempt to threaten the mis sion despite the gentle tone sir jehan was using an old family proverb came to the dark elfs mind never try to frighten a necromancer granted he wasnt a necromancer any more but still am i to understand naitachal returned in an irritated tone that a friend of the prince is not an ally of the king sir jehan shrugged palms upturned a gesture which conveyed very little to naitachal time to show some of my cards and to prove alaire confides more in me than this sir jehan thinks i was under the impression sir that the prince con sidered you one of his friends well sir jehan began sounding like the elf had caught him in a subtle deception i do my best to heal the rift between father and son but there is very l i can do when the boy refuses to reform theres still hope hes still quite young perhaps when kai comes to his senses if ever i can do something about the problem which neither confirmed nor denied sir jehans double role in all this naitachal decided not to pursue that particular question instead he formulated an appropriate cover story that would both pr alaires identity and flush out some bits of inform sir jehan might not otherwise volunteer what can one do naitachal said sadly shaking his head this was not the sort of problem i had planned to deal with on this mission if there is any trouble and i trust alaire enough to doubt that he will become involved in anything he perceives as counter to the interest of either our kingdom or any trouble alaire happens to get into is his own problem he knows this i rely on his good sense it may even be that he can exert the steadying influence that you feel your prince requires naitachal leaned forward as if about to impart a confidence and con tinued my family has a long tradition of magic use are you familiar with the term necromancer a flicker of recognition passed over the neutral mask sir jehan was trying to maintain yes he knows exactly what i am but will he admit it im not familiar with the term sir jehan said his eyes shifting to the side indicating a lie i know that it describes some sort of magician naitachal smiled thinly yes a magician a very powerful magician using magic is as natural to me as breathing air is to you though i would not dare to demonstrate these abilities to you now in this land where it is illegal i could raise a corpse from the dead or force a soul to answer my questions and there are more ways available to me to destroy an adversary than i have time to tell you all of them painful this training began many many centuries ago sir jehan gazed at him thoughtfully without co naitachal continued to smile there are certain ways in which i could use these powers to defend myself ways which given the laws of your kingdom i could easily guarantee a long residence in your prison of souls naitachal watched his eyebrows raise appreciably so you know of this naitachal gave him a look which said plainly what did you think i was deaf blind and a fool as well i do and i would never want to find myself imprisoned in such a place you neednt worry sir jehan assured him our laws apply in fact to the peasants the lower classes not to those like you or me we created the associa tion to police potentially dangerous magic among the peasants so that they couldnt use arcane powers to oppress each other or as tools in a revolt he steepled his hands together and put on a thoughtful expres sion and that i fear again puts you and your assistant into jeopardy though i cannot verify this either way rumor has it that kai has been actively recruiting mages in order to overthrow his father and take the crown now this would be a tragedy of the highest magnitude we must prevent this at any cost you may find our laws regarding magic confining even unfair but i assure you that there are good rea sons for regulating it surely you can see the wisdom in these precautions of course naitachal said evenly i didnt mean to suggest that these precautions were unnecessary i surely would never do anything that would make someone think i was willing to use my powers against your king that would be more than foolishness actually im glad you brought it up sir jehan said standing his smile was crooked as if he could not bring himself to produce a real smile this is one of the things the king wishes to speak to you about he gestured grandly towards the set of double doors this way please when they entered the chamber beyond the dou ble doors naitachal saw king archenomen gazing at the barren winter countryside through a tall bay win dow framed in the pale afternoon sun he seemed extremely worried about something sir jehan cleared his throat sire he announced may i present ambassador naitachal from al envoy of king reynard eyes still fixed on the landscape beyond he thank you jehan sir jehan bowed slightly and quietly left the chambers naitachal stood boldly in the center of the floor wondering what could be so fascinating outside that it would hold the kings attention he didnt know if he should take offense or feel complimented by the complete lack of attention the king was giving him please make yourself comfortable the king said turning would you care for some ale ambassador refusing would be impolite so he nodded and said it would please me indeed your majesty warily he took one of three heavy wood chairs set about in a semicircle the throne faced him squarely a tall velvetupholstered artifact raised on a platform that would put the kings toes about eye level when sitting the king turned and regarded naitachal with some visible apprehension then forced a smile a servant appeared with two large steins of ale offered one to the dark elf than served the other to the king as naitachal took his he suppressed a grimace he did not care for ale and this was a heavy bitter brew still the kings wish was an order naitachal relaxed and tried the ale wondering briefly if it had been poi soned since he had a choice of either of the steins he decided this was unlikely the king drank from his stein and seated himself in one of the other smaller chairs next to naitachal for going the use of the ostentatious throne though he wore yesterdays purple robe his clothing seemed rumpled shadows lurked under his eyes and stubble stood out on his tired face stress lines showed on his forehead either the king is ill or he is worried sick over something naitachal drank his warm ale and tried to look composed i come directly to the point the king said it has come to my attention lately that there is considerable renegade magic going on among the peasants there are suggestions that some of these magicians are con nected somehow with your land oh this was a new accusation and it baffled nai tachal now what he wondered thinking this might be smoke sent out to conceal the real issue whatever it might be if there are magicians practicing magic covert suinomen naitachal began with an even voice i am hardly in a position to know of it though my kind does have a long history of the practice of magec i have carefully avoided this practice since arriving here and you sir have never sent any communica tion to my king making any suggestion that such renegades are troubling your land what exactly is the link to althea you speak of nothing specific the king admitted and i am not accusing you of anything it does raise some issues which i would like to discuss with the understanding that we intend no offense it is most opportune that you are here to negotiate it saves us the trouble and time of sending an ambassador to your land at the mention of the word negotiate naitachals ears stood straight up are we finally going to discuss these war threats the king stirred restlessly this magecraft was once a threat to our kingdom many years ago that is when we created the swords of the magicians and began policing the land of unauthorized magic since then things have been quiet here until lately there hasnt been much in the way of travel between our two kingdoms but in the last half year what little there has been has increased twofold perhaps it is no coincidence that the unauthorized magic using has increased as well naitachal saw the kings point and he didnt like it at all hes trying to blame althea for the failure of his policies for his inability to stifle magic in what is obvi ously a land rich with those who have the abilities if not the training to practice the art but the kings next words took him entirely by sur prise i think it would be a great benefit to both our lands if you recognized the superior policing ability of the association and permit them into your kingdom it is clear to me that your land is the source of this scourge and if you let our association in for the express purpose of dealing with mages we can solve this problem once and for all the king gazed at him hopefully obviously finding nothing wrong with the request naitachal stared at him for a long long time the request appalled him so much that he had to reassess everything hed learned about suinomen and its king did i hear that correctly fearful of magic suspicious of his son influenced by unknown political forces per haps completely misled about althea he thinks we want to clean up magic in our own kingdom badly enough to let a foreign force in from a country whose intentions are in serious question he really believes this is a reasonable request i see naitachal said forcing a most urbane man ner in spite of his desire to demonstrate a little high level bardic magic and wipe the kings mind clean of even the shadow of such an idea of course i am in no position to grant such a request it might be a very good idea after all and i will certainly infor king of your request king archenomens brow furrowed as if he had expected immediate agreement but surely you can understand the need naitachal made a conciliatory gesture of course i see how important this is to you but you must under stand this would mean ridding althea of most nonhumans elves fairies arachnia as well as the human mages im not even certain this is possible the nonhumans occupy much territory within our borders and have established themselves as indis pensable to the commerce and prosperity of our land you see nonhumans simply will not allow humans to regulate magic magic is the core of their existence to take it away would cause serious political problems for our king i would have expected the king of althea to send a stronger soul to discuss matters of state archenomen said looking disappointed it is not a matter of strength naitachal said only of prudence within our government we have many nonhumans in positions of power non humans such as myself oh yes thats right the king replied clearly annoyed and shaking his head as if he simply had not seen the sable skin and pointed ears of the being right in front of him you are a dark elf arent you is he a halfwit or is his mind going this is incredible naitachal schooled his expression to give no hint of his thoughts to impose such rules would be at the very least an insult to many powerful beings but the matter isnt up to me archenomens face brightened thats right its not relay the message to the king if you would please i think we will be sending our own ambassa dors along soon anyway to make certain he gets it the king stood clearly ending the audience you may leave naitachal immediately rose to his feet bowed and backed himself out grateful the discussion was over and proud of himself for not converting the king to a pile of ash naitachal returned to their room hoping to alaire so he could discuss this new and highly dis turbing information with his protege the boy is in more danger than i suspected he admitted to himself guiltily sending him home now would be even more serous dark elf realized as he entered the room that he had got about as far as he was going to get wit king reynard should have sent a human he admitted glumly only a human can make any progress now the monarch of suinomen was far more phobic about magic than hed ever imagined and if archenomen ever learned that he and alaire were bards it could be a catalyst for war it seemed almost certain now that they were looking for an excuse for one anyway that was the only rational explanation for such an outra geous request surely that act the king had put on was only that an act surely he could not be so stupid senile or mad enough to believe king reynard would spend a single second considering such an outrageous idea sending the swords of the magicians into althea no surely no one could be that mad i do believe it is time for us both to find a way to leave this dreadful place naitachal decided if we left now we might take them by surprise yes we will be on the road headed back towards althea tonight alaire naitachal called softly as he closed the door behind him he found only an empty room good gods he muttered picking up a note on the bed your dark i have gone out again with youknowwho i promise to be careful dont worry about me and dont stay up it may be late alaire gazing at the note naitachal began making soft strangling noises chapte while naitachal went off on his diplomatic searc sir jehan alaire returned to their room to catch a few hours of his lost sleep the drink with the princes bevy of beauties had made him sleepy and this seemed as good a time as any to catch up on some rest just before he fell into deep slumber he won dered belatedly if he had remembered to lock the door or no alaire woke to someone shaking him by the shoul ders wake up sluggard kai shouted in his ear weve got to go out hurry were losing time the boy roused him with such intensity in his voice that he struggled out of the tentacles of sleep in a panic wondering what emergency was upon them wha alaire managed feeling about for a weapon kai let go of his shoulders and laughed sardonically at the expression on his face oh relax kai told him if i had known it was so hard to wake you up i would have been in earlier alaire finally focused on kai who sat on the edge of the huge bed he wore a new outfit of court clothing topped with the embroidered red cloak but he still looked like hed thrown his clothes on in a hurry were going into town tonight oh not again alaire started to say but as he sat up he realized that kai was not in a good mood sullen stormy perhaps even angry there was nothing teasing or playful about kai at the moment whats wrong kai he asked completely awake now sir jehan told me i should kai hesitated then shook his head his jaw tensing nothing he finally appended nothing at all im going to go get drunk you can come if you want to he flung himself off the bed and started out the door wait a minute alaire said getting up kai paused and looked back over his shoulder you coming he asked hopefully well i alaire shrugged good kai interrupted bring your harp you can cheer me up with it guess i am alaire finished they took the carriage to the edge of the tavern dis trict under cloudy skies that grew darker by the moment tonights driver seemed sober so the ride into the heart of town wasnt as exciting as the pre vious evenings the tavern they ended up in was a notch or two below the other places theyd gone to it took them a moment to find chairs and a table that hadnt been damaged in a brawl even so the night was still young and according to kai the very best of the establishments stock hadnt run dry yet it appeared that this was the only thing that cheered kai up a steady supply of liquor the prospect of total oblivion all he wants out of life is out alaire thought he wondered if going with kai had been a good idea now he felt as if he were inadvertently aidin prince in his quest for that oblivion this evenings poison was not ale or wine as had been the choice the night before this place deadmans drunk its name burned into a tombstone shaped wooden sign above the door served only the hardest of liquors they distill aakaviit from a tuber that grows wild in the hills kai explained easily as he downed small glasses of the stuff he drank it like water alaire couldnt understand it he stared at his own small glass a single sip had set his mouth and throat on fire he eyed the burning candle between them nervously this is almost pure alcohol he thought now he wished he hadnt brought his harp there had been some heated discussion over taking it along but alaire had finally relented thinking that pe kai wouldnt drink as much if he did the harp was the most important possession he owned and here it was exposed to danger in this wretched place though wrapped in a thick canvas bag and looking like a random sack of possessions it would not fare well in a fight he placed it so a bottle of aakaviit if spilled wouldnt drench it the potent fluid would probably eat right through the finish he had hoped the liquor would loosen kais tongue a bit that cryptic sentence about sir jehan had him wondering just what the man had said to kai and if they would see him out again tonight for additional clues alaire had suggested they go to the tavern sir jehan had been last night seeing them together might yield useful information but kai had insisted that place would be closed so early in the after the deadmans drunk was going to be their destina tion for now and when kai started to get a little testy about it alaire shut up and sat back in the coach kai had confined his discussion to trivial matters the good time he had with the twins this years grape crop which had been poor and the turning weather when they had left the carriage and started wal alaire noticed the air had become considerably colder than he remembered it being last night a biting cold singed his nostrils breath clouded visibly before them snow fell lightly as they reached this place kai predicted it would get worse i love getting drunk when it snows he said any bad weather thunderstorms floods as long as im not in it and snowstorms dont ask me why maybe its the hint of anxiety in the air that makes it exciting snow was not unusual back at fenrich but it rarely fell early it snowed enough to accumulate about a month before midwinter and usually melted off by spring equinox but suinomen was further north and the shift in temperature had been rather drastic this evening how much does it snow up here alaire asked oh i guess it will probably be waisthigh by morn ing kai said casually why what kai laughed finished his glass of aakaviit you act like youve never seen snow before well i have alaire said proudly but not waist high he tried to imagine what it would look like how do the roofs stay up dont they collapse under the weight of the snow which sent kai into another round of laughter whatever gave you that idea what are your roofs made of down there thatch alaire frowned some of them are of course kai said as suddenly subdued as he had been roused to laughter alaire was more concerned with the effect the snow was going to have on the state of the streets well anyway if its really going to snow that deep tonight perhaps we should make it an early evening not a bad idea kai said but his mischievous smirk indicated he didnt take the idea very seriously but it it gets too bad we can always stay at an inn not exactly fit for royalty as his highness sir jehan would say but do i look like i care gods no ive passed out many a night in places far worse than that alaires ears pricked at the mention of the noble mans name yes and he waited for the boy to go on a fight broke out behind them but kai remained oblivious to it alaire watched the two combatants who from the little he understood of the screaming imprecations fought over a bottle of aakaviit kai had ordered another and at that moment the barkeep scurried over and most apologetically explained that the gentlemen behind them were fight ing over the last bottle of aakaviit kai turned to regard the fight now interested in the outcome as the two men struggled with the bo kai reached for the hilt of his sword but didnt draw it the barkeep paled when he noticed the weapon and promptly vanished alaire thought he was going to get sick the sight of the men fighting over the bottle and kai apparently willing to kill for it was a little too much here alaire said have the rest of my glass there was still a half glass left the little alaire drank went right to his head so he had stopped drinking though mildly intoxicated he hoped he still had pos session of his fighting skills one of us needs to stay at least partially sober he worried kais not going to be worth much if he keeps this up hes probably not worth much right now ive never seen anyone drink as much as he can and still walk the fight continued kai watching the two men avidly his tongue licking his lips as if he were hungry suddenly there was a crash signaling the demise of the bottle of aakaviit as it fell to the floor but the fight continued the two men now driven to a rage by the loss of the bottle went directly for each others throats a third man had crawled into the area of the affray and was trying to drink the spilled stuff from the floor alaire wanted out of there badly but how to per suade kai the prince seemed fascinated by the fight by the drunk lapping up liquor from the floo then the fighters knocked over a candle which fell to the floor igniting the aakavitt with an audible woooooopf the stuff was as flammable as alaire had suspected a roaring fire spread across the floor away from them licking the cheap wooden furniture with fiery blue tongues people panicked and ran out of front and rear exits somewhere amid the flames a man screamed the bartender beat at the flames with a rag he only made them spread faster the fire was spreading quickly too quickly soon the flames would block the exits come on kai lets get out of here alaire shouted grabbing kais arm and tugging him upright oh awright kai said sullenly as if alaire was try ing to get him to leave a bit of high entertainment before it was over alaire grabbed the harps canvas bag with one hand and kais arm with the other and led him through the press of bodies to the front exit as they reached the door he glanced behind him to see if anyone else was trapped in there the place was empty except for the two original combatants still locked in struggle sil houetted by the rising flames forget them he thought lets get back to the palace before were snowed in down here he turned and blinked in surprise snow gods kai wasnt joking about the snow a thick white blanket had wrapped itself over the tavern district and huge coin sized flakes dropped in sheets he looked down and saw he was standing ankledeep in the stuff he stumbled out of the doorway still towing kai and took shelter in another doorway across the street from the bar people in the street began to shout now as it became apparent to the passersby that one of the buildings was on fire smoke poured out of the front door the barkeep ran about helplessly slipping in the snow no one seemed to be doing anything about the fire except watching suddenly kai seemed to notice the snow all right the boy whooped running into the thick white ness he promptly made a ball out of the mush and threw it at alaire ignoring the fire licking out of the doorway behind him at that moment a number of men appeared with a purposeful air to them they formed a human chain and began passing buckets of water to throw on the fire it occurred to alaire that maybe they should hel then again maybe that wouldnt be a good idea kai was still whooping and playing in the snow alaire didnt think there was any likelihood of getting him to do something as responsible as putting out a fire no lets get out of here while we have a chance the snow still looks shallow enough for the carriage to make it back to the palace he followed kai who slipped and slid down the street laughing like a fool kai you know maybe we should go back to the palace naw he said over his shoulder and hiccuped still early alaire persisted but getting back while we can dont you think kai muttered something about the next place and started off down the narrow street without him though he walked fairly well it was clear to alaire he was very drunk he started rambling on to himself as if alaire was standing next to him the situation was starting to anger him why should i care if he cares for no one but himself do i really need to go along with him he resisted an urge to start walking back to the palace by himself after taking a few steps in that direction i dont know the way that well and in this snow everything looks dif ferent and its cold maybe id be better off in a tavern somewhere bound to be afire burning that way i can keep warm and keep an eye on kai he groaned knowing he had talked himself into being kais keeper once again alaire scrambled after the prince cursing his foot ing and taking excruciating care not to slip and fall on his harp the sun had set by now and torchlights and lanterns again provided the only illumination foot traffic had diminished and now only a few people braved the snow so where are we going now alaire said irritably he clutched the harp tightly as if holding it closer would shut out some of the cold kais coat was wide open and he wore no warm hat as alaire did evi dently as drunk as he was he didnt feel the cold oh lets try the dead dragon inn again he said matteroffactly they probably wont throw us out the clamor surrounding the fire faded and a new muffled silence fell about them in spite of his annoy ance with kai and with himself and his discomfort the snow fascinated alaire hed never seen this much falling at one time so suddenly and with flakes this large they fell about the two of them in swirls land ing on his face his clothes he stuck his tongue out and caught one the large flake melted instantly in the warmth of his mouth reminding him how thirsty he was for simple plain water maybe at the dragon inn i can get some he thought after all kai drinks enough for both of us he hoped they would reach the place soon the cold was beginning to eat through his clothing he heard something behind them and turned just in time to see a dark figure vanish into a shadow a chill that had nothing to do with the weather ran up his spine and he felt for the hilt of his sword sling ing his harp over his back saying nothing to kai who babbled something to himself in his native language he continued the slow trudge through the snow keep ing his ears open for another telltale noise when it came he knew for certain they were being followed he didnt turn to look this time but as he listened he heard the same footsteps trying to match theirs using the noise they were making as cover maybe its one of sir jehans men keeping tabs on the prince he thought hopefully but the prospect didnt comfort him as much as he thought it id better say something hes still a good fighter even if hes drunk he whispered to kai i think were being fol lowed kai glanced up and shrugged but in spite of the bravado kai acted a little more wary then finally he whispered back how many one at least maybe more was that a second set of footsteps or echoes of our own the effect of snow on sound was maddening two figures jumped out in front of them swords drawn kai hissed as he drew his weapon clumsily and staggered backwards alaires nerves were already keyed up and he was ready his sword out he went after the closest of the two and closed for the attack his opponent seemed surprised at the aggressive tactics figured id be drunk too alaire thought briefly as their swords engaged within moments he knew that these were no aver age cutpurses these are professional killers alaire thought in dismay taking in their black clothing the scarves wrapped about their faces to hide their identi ties why they would be wearing black escaped him they stood out against the snow unless the snow caught them by surprise too swords flashed through the falling snow and alaire was separated from kai and the other assassin alaire heard them somewhere behind them clashing away and didnt like the idea of not being able to see anything but his current opponent and what of the men who had been behind them where were they streetfighting meant streettactics he managed to distract the fighter for a moment his blade lashed out nicking the mans wrist bright rubyred spots appeared on the snow beneath him first blood the assassin snarled an evident curse in a lan guage hed never heard before alaire feinted and parried twice pushing the killer near a torch on a rock wall in the flickering light he saw the mans eyes and the dark olive skin around them his wrist bled brightly into the falling snow and alaire knew his wound must be a great liability to him he didnt change hands as alaire would have done in the same situation evidently his teacher had not been as good as naitachal alaire stepped back saw an opening and lunged metal pierced flesh with more difficulty than expected reminding alaire he hadnt sharpened his blade since the fight in the dead dragon even so his sword found a rich target and as he withdrew his steel blood followed it the assassin groaned dropped his blade and pressed a hand over the wound the stain spread beneath him as the snow captured the fresh blood the man stared at him his eyes hollow in the torchlight then staggered off into the dark and snow in a moment he was lost to sight alaire turned and looked for kai there was nothing to see but snow then around a corner he heard blades clashing he ran to the sound staggered as his foot slipped on the fresh snow and found the two next to another building their arena brightly lit by street torch the tip of kais blade was broken giving the assassin the advantage the boys face was a mask of pure terror he knew he was in serious trouble and alaire was a good twenty feet away he shouted hoping to distract the killer but the man ignored him as alaire rushed at the assassin the man lunged piercing kai in the abdomen the boy screamed in pain and fell back into the snow the killer looked up apparently satisfied with his work then ran off alaire scrambled to kais side he was lying face up in the snow still waving his sword and moaning alaire gently deflected the weapon with his own and took it from his hand he knelt over kai calling his name but the boy just stared blankly his skin now the color of the snow around him a red stain spread over his tunic and shirt but alaire saw no wound he pulled the slick fabric of his shirt up revealing a neat puncture next to kais navel the wound bled a thin pulsing river a gut wound the worst hes going to die kai opened his mouth to speak but he was already too weak to say anything he was going to die unles no his mind screamed without really thinking he began looking for his harp he ran staggering back to where he thought it would be where is it did some one take it he thought just as his eyes fell on the instrument he grabbed the canvas bag and rushed back to kai alaire ripped the bag open with stiff fingers his heart pounding frantically kais eyes glazed the thin plume of breath over his nostrils lessening with every moment hot tears coursed down alaires cheeks he fought the urge to scream curse moan in helplessnes dont think of that dont think of anything just the magic just the power he took a deep breath steadied himself and started to play the strings were out of tune the music sour his fin gers cold and numb but he played anyway ignoring the one broken string he reached for the only song he knew that might work a short tune naitachal had composed when one of their favorite horses had suf fered an attack from a pack of wolves the horse had been near deat like ka bardic magic had healed it had saved its life as alaire played the tune from memory his fingers loosened up and the notes came easier he ran through the song once looked down at kai he remained still even peaceful in the snow then with one spastic motion the boy exhaled a single breath then nothing the magic had failed no alaire screamed tears streamed down his face blurring his vision he felt an empty space form in the center of his chest and as he stared at kais life less face the space grew larger he choked back a sob snow began to collect on kais face instead of melt ing as it had only moments before alaire wept unable to help himself unable to stop he held the harp loosely until it was ready to slip out of his hands then suddenly his masters words ech oed in his the essence of bardic magic is the ability to make and unmake to unmake death and make life he reached deeper into his soul for the power willing his arms and hands to move he began to play the song over a fourth time automatically but this time his mind and heart focused on something else altogether his minds eye followed tendrils of lifesource downwards to the ground here he found vast pools of untapped power seldom used in this land just beneath the surface yearning to be released he imagined kais wound closing itself healing the injury the assassins blade had rendered the tiny folds of tis sue reassembling knitting binding sealing the blood vessels cauterizing them with light then the new blood slowly filling his veins restoring what had been lost at some point he stopped playing naitachals tune and began a new one of his own one that seemed to fit the magic he was weaving that complimented the interplay of power and power when alaire opened his eyes he found himsel kai enveloped in a cloud of bright stars points of light that were pulsating with the harps music the untuned strings played a haunting melody that echoed in the drifts of light of green blue red weaving a spell of life the music stopped interrupted by a shrill rasping cough kai kai inhaled sharply as his eyes widened with fear and his lungs struggled for air he gasped again claw ing at the stained snow with one bloodied hand as the other reached for a sword that wasnt there alaire had a moment to exalt a single moment of joy at his accomplishment then the harp fell from alaires hands as a wave of exhaustion seized him and dragged him down into darkness while stars of a totally different kind clouded his fading vision vaguely aware of someone calling his name he fell into nothingness chapter naitachal flung the note back on the bed why did he have to leave now of all times in the moment it took for the note to sink in his annoyance darkened to fear something was wrong something very wrong he cursed alaire cursed himself cursed their and most of all cursed the prince soon it would be time for supper but if he attended the rituals of dinner would trap him for gods knew how long he had little time to waste now wearied by the situation the dark elf sat down heavily on a chair rubbing his face as he sat ponder ing the circumstances he had a terrible premonition about kai and this latest venture into the tavern dis tric and not about kai alone he sensed that alaire was in danger too to probe this further he would have to invoke powers that were illegal here and he wasnt willing to jeopardize the diplomatic mission or his freedom by bringing the swords of the magicians down on them i must see captain lyam immediately if anyone can help me in this mess he can he might even know where they poking his head out the door he glanced down the hallway palace guests and noblemen filed toward the great dining hall if he left now to look for lyam he might be dragged into a nonsensical conversation before he even got to the stairs no oh no and going somewhere besides the hall in view of everyone would attract unwanted attention then he sighed there is of course another way out of the room besides the door when he opened the window a biting wind ripped into the room reminding him to don some thing a little warmer than his usual black cloak he put on a thick dieren coat and a pair of flexible leather gloves and climbed over the sill to a narrow ledge along the castle wall and closed the window behind him their room was only three floors up but ice had formed on the ledge and the wind was particularly stiff out here he had second thoughts about this rather foolhardy venture but decided to continue wasnt he an elf didnt he have twice the agility and strength of any human born wasnt he a complete idiot two doors north one floor up a corner suite he peered up through the gathering darkness that must be it up there the only room with a light gods i hope hes there he found a section of the ledge above him that had no ice and pulled himself up a move which would be difficult for most humans his muscles complained bitterly at him elven he might well be but he was not accustomed to gallivant ing about on ledges in the middle of snowstorms he swore gritted his teeth and forced himself up and onto the ledg he lay there for a moment panting with effort but that was the worst part in moments he was looking in the window of captain lyams room a warm room with a fire raging in the stove the cap tain was sitting at a desk with his back to the window good thing im not an assassin naitachal thought as he let himself in through the window please close the window behind you ambassador lyam said politely he hadnt bothered to turn around there is a rather stiff chill in the air tonight the dark elf stepped down to the pine floor and closed the windows behind him i hope this is a dis creet enough entrance captain naitachal said lazily impressed despite himself with the captains compo sure and keen senses lyam rose as soon as he stepped into the room and offered him a cup of heated spiced cider naitachal accepted it with a sigh of gratitude and went to stand beside the stove for a m elven or not it had been cold enough out there to freeze the ears off a marble horse but as he took his place beside the fire he saw that what he had thought was lyams calm nonchalance was something of a mask the captain was obviously concerned about something naitachal had a shrewd notion he knew what it was too kai has vanished again the captain said abruptly jehan informed me after kai ran off that he had set a servant to watch him i sent a watcher after the watcher my own man just sent me back word that he found jehans keeper dead with blood spilled in such a pattern as suggests an attack because of the amount of blood we suspect a second person died the prince naitachal asked his mouth going dry with fear he remembered his earlier premonitio lyam shrugged we dont know the swords o association are searching the tavern district now what naitachal stared at the captain wh swords the captain returned the stare and the dark elf had the impression he was looking for signs of deception someone probably an unlicensed mage worked some powerful magic in that area sir jehan dispatched the swords to track the perpetrator down then they discovered traces of that same magic at the scene of the killing the captain shook his head sadly as we speak the entire force is searching for the mage responsible naitachals gaze didnt waver and if they find the source what then they will arrest him or both of them lyam stared at the dark elf broodingly mark you they do not know who the mage is at the moment but if it was your apprentice the traces will still be upon him they will charge kai with treason naitachals knees felt a little weak the dark elf seated himself in a chair opposite lyam captain lyam continued is there anything you would like to share with me naitachal maintained his mask of calm i know nothing of the incident however i returned to our room to find a note left by my secretary appar alaire went with the prince for another night on the town to the tavern district i believe he said lyam nodded this we already know paavo seneschal saw them both getting into a carriage a few hours ago the driver let them off near the district lyam leaned forward his voice lowered this discus sion is in complete confidence naitachal nodded warily i appreciate that but if you suspect that alaire used magic to kill i really must object that is not the sort of training i have given him nor is it something hes sought on his own hes quite capable of defending himself with the sword lyams mouth tensed as i am well aware no i dont think he used magic to kill but someone used a powerful spell after the killing or killings they found only one body naitachal frowned shook his head is there any thing to connect either young man with the killing or the magic use could they be somewhere in a tavern idling time away lyam said warningly the association knows kai and alaire were in the vicinity an agent saw them at the site of a tavern fire tonight the association thinks the prince and his companion were involved naitachal grimaced this is not good perhaps its not as bad as you think lyam replied im the only one who knows youre a bard since i havent shared this information with anyone your secret is safe with me my main concern is how this incident will discredit the prince the king bel kainemonen is raising a secret cadre of mages to take the throne though these are only rumors men close to him are making sure the king believes them naitachal stared off for a moment his eyes fixed on the blazing fire could alaire have performed power ful bardic magic i wouldnt have thought that possible at this stage of his training why would he unless there were no other choice yes lyam said cautiously apparently reading his expression you had a thought i had a talk with sir jehan this afternoon nai tachal replied he seemed convinced kai had designs on the throne using the same means you just described he was very eager for me to believe that anyone who befriended the prince would not be con sidered a friend of the throne i had the feeling that he would have done anything to persuade me to alaire to stay away from the prince of course lyam said dismissively they werent expecting you two to come along and they certainly were not expecting an outsider to befriend kai i jehan is behind this he would use whatever powers of persuasion he had to divert your attention from kai something else was nagging naitachal what about these socalled keepers is this usual alaire never mentioned bodyguards when they went out last night lyam shook his head when i say keeper im only quoting sir jehan more likely they were spies looking for more stories to bring back to the king about kai they probably stayed well out of sight hoping to observe without being observed and if kai discovered their presence would this prompt kai to eliminate them it was a valid ques tion or so naitachal thought could this be why they found only one dead man could kai have wounded one and killed the other that would be better news for alaire and it would point to someone other alaire as the unlicensed mage captain lyam stood towering above naitachal and began pacing back and forth past the window for such a large man he made very little noise in his uni form he was an even more imposing figure than he had been at their first meeting though naitachal felt more protected than threatened he would do no such thing the captain said after apparently giving it some thought first i meant no insult lyam waved the halfapology aside none was taken i appreciate your candor you have been straightforward with me from the beginning and i thank you for that and i admit on the surface and especially to someone whose opinion has been colored by minions like sir jehan that is precisely what it does look like the king is convinced a revolt is at the gates naitachal remembered that supper was being served and stood in view of these new circum stances i think it would be wise of me to attend supper my absence would be missed may even be seen as suspicious though how im to even pretend to eat with my stomach in anxious knot he started for the door before you leave i would like to mention one thing lyam said i believe that this was a trap per haps a trap gone wrong and i think you will eventually be implicated in this mess if you arent already please be careful and remember you were never here naitachal bowed and left the captain to his own anxieties the dark elf arrived at the dining hall in time for supper amid a sea of curious stares some openly hos tile so my reputation precedes me at least the reputation someone wants me to have pikhalas saw him from across the room and scurried over to inter cept him there you are the timid frail man said clutching a small felt hat in both hands nervously twisting it into an unrecognizable lump of fabric weve been look ing all over for you you werent in your room and we were beginning to wonder oh about what is something wrong naitachal inquired innocently a situation has developed pikhalas said reluc tantly the king is having a private supper tonight and he extends his warmest invitation to join him by all means naitachal said cheerfully stretching his mouth in a smile lead the way adjoining the great dining hall was a smaller inti mate dining room with a long marble table in the center king archenomen sat at the head wit jehan sitting on his right a score of others sat to either side with one empty place still at the kings left pik halas showed naitachal to this seat posted at either end of the room was a burly guard as naitachal approached the table a hush fell over the gathering of nobles and all eyes fixed on him as he bowed deeply to the king nodded politely to the rest then seated himself at the table good evening your majesty he said as urbanely as possible was i supposed to bow when i entered as well as just before i sat oh well too late now i understand there is a problem of some kind tonight i trust this will not interfere with the enjoyment of the meal and the conversation what am i supposed to know nothing nothing at all the meal had already begun and once naitachal seated himself everyone resumed eating sir jehan cast surreptitious looks in his direction as he gnawed on a piece of cooked bird its huge skeletal carcass made a grim centerpiece which fit naitachals mood though not the mood of cheer he was attempting to pr as a servant poured him wine the king said after a long pause where is your secretary tonight naitachal didnt even blink i understand he is out with the prince again he said he left me a note to that effect and truly i did not expect to see him here the snow is falling so thickly i fully expected him to urge the prince to take some private rooms in a good inn until the weather clears he blinked as if suddenly realizing that the king and sir jehan were gazing at him as if his words held important secrets good heavens your most effi cient liaison informed me something has come up this situation wouldnt involve the prince and my secretary would it it would sir jehan said suddenly his look was venomous our agents found the princes bodyguard dead this evening the prince is missing and so pre sumably is alaire naitachal froze allowing the appropriate shock and surprise to surface on his dark face he turned t king why your majesty what has happened have you sent the guards to look for them is there any hint of foul play you see the king exclaimed he doesnt know a thing and you were wanting to risk a war he broke off abruptly and returned his attention to singlemindedly devouring his meal good gods nai tachal thought gazing at sir jehan blankly what i walked into here all assembled looked appropriately embarrassed naitachal cleared his throat and their eyes went to him again your majesty if harm has come t prince then what of my secretary he would defend young kai and i confess that now i am growing very anxious and as i gather from alaire kainemonen is a skilled swordsman himself what happened to them we know very little as yet the king said slurping loudly from a goblet showing no concern whatsoever for his son the swords of the association are looking for a mage you see magic is involved signs of it were found with the body i pray that both boys are safe but you see they are in a very disreputable part of town he turned to naitachal again with his face set in an inexpert mask of care it is a testament to my failings as a father that he would choose to seek entertainment in such a place i know that your servant only meant well but this has become a rather difficult situation how may i help naitachal offered now free to display all of his considerable anxiety i am as interested as you are in securing their safety if there was it would be best sir jehan interrupted sti under the circumstances that you remain distant from let the man finish the king shouted im still not convinced that althea is behind this naitachal glanced up at sir jehan who looked away nervously althea the elf said softly that wou an unwise assumption of course i dont think althea is to blame king blustered the wine sloshed over the rim of his goblet and neither does anyone else at this table there are forces behind this this this conspiracy that are still a mystery im afraid youve become involved in a rather nasty civil dispute naitachal spread his hands helplessly i dont mean to pry your majesty but what is the nature of this dispute i know nothing of it and king reynard knows even less we seem to have become implicated only because we are foreigners in your land my main concern is for the safety of the two young men if i may help in some way sir jehan stood suddenly glared at naitachal and stormed out of the dining room the dark elf tried not to stare with little success ignore him the king said sir jehans footsteps thumped loudly down the corridor audible for a sur prising distance we are not blaming you he sees a traitor behind every closed door as perhaps you should naitachal thought privately i didnt warn you when you first arrived king began the prince is an immature youth filled with ambition i believe his ambition grows too great and he has begun to cast envious eyes on the powers and positions he cannot have but he fails to understand just how powerful our mages are i am in no danger but what naitachal saw in his tone and mannerisms told a completely different story king archenomens eyes shifted from side to side his voice quavered his drinking hand shook ever so slightly he seldo naitachals eyes is he afraid of me regarding the other dinner guests with cool detach ment he took in their faces and social rank as indicated by their clothing of those assembled he recognized one as the count he met the first night others had been present in the waiting room when he met sir jehan one was without a doubt a mage masquerading unsuccessfully as a noble all seemed to ignore the interplay betwee king and the dark elf in fact they were listening very carefully while at the same time trying to be as invisible as possible the king shook his head if there is a danger to me which i doubt it would be in the form of going too far to defend against hazards which do not exist sir jehan will calm down when he does then we can settle down to business the dinner proceeded in silence and slowly the other guests excused themselves it seemed all very strange to the dark elf who would have expected at least some show of concern for alaire and the prince naitachal permitted himself to display his worry alaire as he wondered what had really happened in the tavern district after supper adjourned the king took naitachal aside we will keep you informed ambassador king said evidently thinking he had to smooth ruffled feathers im sure theres nothing to worry about by dawn theyll both come staggering home with youth ful tales of wine and women oh and before you leave he added it would probably be best if you remain in your quarters to naitachals accusing look he quickly ame so that we can find you on short notice of course and for your safety naitachal raised an eyebrow i didnt know my safety was in question the king waved the comment away just a precau tion good evening ambassador thank you your majesty naitachal said bowing deeply and good evening as he ascended the stairs to his room he sa jehan standing in the shadows talking with a handful of noblemen he stopped as soon as naitachal came into view and sent the others about their business before turning pointedly to go himself but he man aged to cast a cold calculating look towards the elf complete with nauseating smile before he was out of chapte alaire awakened confused and rather groggy buried to the chin in a pile of hay in a loft above a stable below him he heard horses blowing and stamping dim gray light filtered in through closed shutters at one end of the loft kai was nowhere in sight weakly he struggled to sit up it was very cold and the hay was all that had been keeping him warm he took in his surroundings won dering why he was there and how a single ladder lay against the loft edge within arms reach and it looked like the only way up in his mouth lingered the unpleasant aftertaste of liquor did i get drunk and forget what happened hed heard about blackouts from his brother craig who on numerous occasions had been unable to recall an entire evening of drink ing more than once alaire had helped put him to bed after too much ale after one of his required fam visits to the palace in silver city but this had never happened to him then again hed never tried to keep up with a sot quite like kai before theres a first time for everything did someone carry me up to this loft because i passed out gods what happened to me a single round ventilation grille above him allowed some light in beyond the piles of hay he made out the woodslat floor which creaked as he stirred and the vague outline of his harp in its canvas bag leaning against the wall beside it was his bloodied sword glinting in the weak light blood what i the blood was dull and brown on the blade sud denly he remembered everything oh no he whispered to the chill air the words froze like little clouds before his nose another sort of chill settled into his spine and he suppressed a violent shudder gods l used magic total wakefulness came with the realization though still drained from the ordeal he struggled to his feet a little unsteady but more or less alert to every sound in the stable within moments he was numb with cold from below him came the odor of horse or possibly dieren the beasts made little noise in the stable and alaire guessed it was fairly late now and they were asleep best to let it stay that way he considered the likely prospect that kai had left him here to fend for himself and had returned to the castle alone staying with me would serve no purpose he admitted better that hes gone when the swords of the association come take me away climbing to the top of a mound of hay he peered out between the slats of the small round window and studied the snowcovered street below a thick layer of white covered the entire landscape and dotting the streets of what had to be the edge of the tavern district were the staggering remnants of the evenings revelers he thought he saw the two men whod fought over the bottle of aakaviit but that did not concern him what did matter was that he didnt think he was far from the scene o crime he puzzled over why the swords hadnt picked them up already isnt arrest for magic simultaneous with the spell casting maybe not maybe the mages here werent good enough to catch the perpetrator in time before the arrest of the two magicians the previous night the officers had talked with the barkeep first could this man have been an informant telling them who to arrest maybe he thought with a thin ray of hope the swords rely on snitches to make their arrests giving the impression of omniscience to enhance their authority the man who ran kai through fled when he saw me he was long gone by the time i found the harp if there were no witnesses to the bardic spell then just mayb if he stayed in the stable much longer hed freeze to death any warmth to be had in the place was down there with the beasts and their owner would likely appear at dawn to tend to them if not sooner a door creaked open at the other end of the stable and alaire held his breath his heart was beating so fast he was afraid it would give him away he saw nothing of the level below him but who ever came in didnt stop at the animals the ladder began to rattle as someone climbed it alaire reached for his sword and stood ready with it kais head popped up over the edge and he froze with the tip of alaires sword at his throat the boy stared at him then the blade then ba alaire before saying softly i see youre up how do you feel alaire let his breath out and withdrew the blade better come on up here kai did so with two canvas sacks slung over his shoulder i brought breakfast and clothes we cant go around looking like were highborn anymore kai seemed grim but alert and sober so alaire said dropping his voice in response to the obvious need for quiet the swords are looking for us everybodys looking for us the prince whispered urgently dropping one of the sacks between them although dried blood covered his clothes his recovery seemed to be total if he had any pain from the wound he didnt show it the swords of the associa tion the constables the royal guard you should be asking who isnt looking for us he fixed alaire with an angry look you have a lot to answer for huh alaire replied completely confused i only why didnt you tell me you were a bard kai demanded he opened one canvas bag presenting a banquet of food sausages cheeses bread even a flask of wine the sight of it all made alaires stomach clench with hunger gods im starving he thought forgetting kais wrath they started eating using alaires knife to carve up the food once alaire got some of the food in him his stomach quieted and he felt much better prepared to face whatever came as i was saying kai said sternly gesturing with a sausage why did you have to use magic of all things we had those toughs beaten now weve got everyone in the kingdom looking for us theres a reward for us too ten thousand crowns dead or alive alaire asked carving another hunk of sharp cheese off the enormous round im not joking kai protested filling his mouth with bread and sausage alaire regarded him askance then it fell into place he doesnt remember anything from the time the assassins attacked us to when the spell healed him either from drinking or from the magic i still cant believe i putted that off he looked at die harp sitting behind kai and wondered with awe am i a bard now kai continued to seethe at him plainly thinking alaire had taken a stupid and cowardly way out of the fight for one thing alaire said patiently im bard i am only studying to be one and ive not achieved that status yet we didnt mention that before because we were under instructions fro king my father remember to keep that to ourselves would you have allowed us into your kingdom had you known no he said answering for kai anyway the question is moot i tried the spell that i thought would work because if i hadnt you wouldnt be talk ing to me right now youd be dead you suffered a fatal wound remember kais look made it clear the prince didnt believe him what are you talking about he asked irritably alaire sighed what do you remember kai he thought this over briefly we left the tavern two robbers jumped us you took one and and and what alaire pers kais gaze grew very distant and a strange bleak frightened expression crept over his face i dont remember at least i dont think i remember some thing happened back there something that it must have been the magic alaire looked at him narrowly is that all kai looked ready to fling the cheese round at him what else is there his anger concealed what had to be fear he does know alaire realized he knows what happened and he doesnt want to admit it who can blame him would i want to relive that he decided to take control of the discussion the robbers as you called them were no such thing they were assassins and they were there to kill us not take our purses i know because the same ones or some one just like them tried to kill naitachal my master within the very walls of your palace i got lucky with one i killed him without so much as a scratch to myself that round with captain lyam probably saved my life i learned some things from your teacher that put me at an advantage remind me to thank him hes the best kai said proudly then he frowned in accusation if you got so good at this then why did you have to invoke magic alaire sighed because the assassin you were fight ing killed you or at least he wounded you badly enough that you almost died kai smirked sure he did you dont remember alaire asked annoyed you dont remember when the assassin ran you through or falling you dont remember bleeding all over the snow or me singing over you well i for a moment the arrogance was gone then it returned prove it to me he demanded belligerently humph all right alaire said immediately i will lift your shirt up boldly the prince did without hesitating revealing a flat white belly what are you looking at kai asked with a smirk then looked down when he saw the fresh scar still red and a little puckered he sucked his breath in gods he whis pered how did that happen that wasnt there yesterday that was where the assassin ran you through alaire informed him grimly i came just in time to see him do it too he saw me and i guess he assumed his job was done he turned and fled you were lying in the snow with a gut wound and bleeding enough to fill a lake the revelation and the proof clearly disturbed kai all that blood he said weakly i thought it was the robbers alaire snorted no it was yours i knew you would die if i didnt do something about it so i took my harp and wove a spell i saw my master perform once it brought you back he spread his hands wide i had to he said simply youre my friend kai kai stared at him in disbelief you risked every thing so i would live he said slowly nobodys ever done that before i cant think of anyone who would except maybe captain lyam he looked away wiping his face with a sleeve when he looked back a tear rolled down a cheek i was dead alaire hesitated before nodding something in my magic something i dont understand yet brought you back he didnt know what else to say i guess that was why i passed out he finished at first kai simply sat and stared at him his face grew pale then he began to tremble his stony facade melted and tears began to trickle slowly down his cheeks at first alaire thought he might still be drunk he certainly still reeked of aakaviit hed seen many drunks get weepy this way but then kai collapsed into a ball leaning to alaire sobbing this is different the bardling thought then hes not just drunk hesitantly he patted kais back and offered his shoulder for support kai took it without pride alaire held him closer he broke down completely burying his face in alaires shoulder stifling the sobs in the fabric of his they held each other for a long time in the cold loft alaire listening to kais incoherent grief and the sounds of sleeping livestock he kept silent knowing the value of it as any bard would finally the la kais grief drained from him and kai pulled away he peered at alaire through swollen eyes if i hadnt been drunk you might not have had to do that if i had been sober that assassin wouldnt have stood a chance and you wouldnt be in trouble for saving my life i dont know that alaire lied those two were experts horseturds kai said it finally got the better of me i never thought it would the sword he shook his head no the bottle kai frowned and looked down at the gore stiffening his clothes with growing horror demondogs this is my blood he started shedding the clothes as alaire watched in amusement now he believes me hes willing to freeze his behind to get those bloody clothes off his skin pale skinny and naked kai hopped over to the sec ond bag hed brought with him and pulled out a pair of leather trousers boots a flannel shirt a leather tunic in his already disheveled state and with these new garments he looked like an ordinary peasant boy now tell me alaire said how did you get me up here kai shrugged after that spell i guess it was you got all wonky like you were walking in your sleep i got you as far as this stable and you sort of helped yourself up the ladder flopped over on the hay and passed out i thought you were going to get cold so i covered you with hay alaire managed a smile the spell took a lot out of me i guess im better now and the food helped thanks kai flung clothing at him from the canvas bag youd better change if we dont look like peasants well stand out like peacocks on a chicken farm alaire hesitated before exposing himself to the frigid air then started dressing quickly kais a native here he knows more about this place than i do where are we and where did you get the food the stable is in the care of gallen the own the dead dragon inn and belongs to a count on the eastern border he comes into rozinki twice a year and hes not due back for months the dieren down there belong to traders who come into town for sup plies i chose this place for two reasons one being if any of those traders saw us they would look the other way theyll want nothing to do with the association or the reward i know too many things about them things that they do that arent exactly legal like using unlicensed mages when theyre on the edge of the kingdom they know i know and they know i wouldnt hesitate to turn them in if they turned me in so were pretty safe but not for too long by daybreak this street will be crawling with swords then where will we go and what will you do kai looked thoughtful well gallen is on our side for months ive been bribing him with promises of protection and favors once im king my father taxes these places heavily and ive promised to cut their taxes down to almost nothing and besides i know that half of the liquor he serves there hasnt got a tax stamp i know who smuggles it to him and how which explains why most of these places let him in the door kai looked a little more confident now he has a warm basement where we can hide for days if need be the swords and the constables have already searched there they might go back but i dont think so they believe gallen is loyal to the crown its the best place i can think of alaire considered his options saw that he had very few of them do as the natives do he pulled the last of the clothes on a tunic that was a little too big the boots were better than the ones hed had before since they were fur lined and designed for the cold long threadbare woolen scarfs were wrapped around their heads and necks giving them an undeniable poverty stricken look but kai still hadnt really answered his question kai whats going to happen what are we going t kai finished tucking the scarf into his tunic then said slowly were both wanted for questioning but that really means theyve already convicted us his brow creased with thought i might be able to explain what happened i can say a mage came along that it wasnt you or something as soon as i con father someone tried to assassinate me it might make a difference father has the power to pardon us both kai said nothing about the prison of souls but the omission emphasized it highlighted it drew circles and arrows around it prison of souls he desperately wanted to ask kai more about it but was more afraid of what the answer might be not might would minimum sentence one year they put the bodies in caskets their souls in crystals fuel for magic limbo nothingness or is there pain a slow burning or is it like roasting on a spit aging twenty years for every one no i cant let that happen a lump of fear settled coldly in his stomach which threatened to expel his breakfast but alaire forced his gut to settle and turned his thoughts to other con cerns a lesser but nonetheless important concern was kais going back to the palace this seemed at the best foolhardy would they believe him he won dered could he really convince the king to overlook this little incident is he my only chance kai seemed now to be blithely certain of success as soon as youre secure in the basement im going back to the palace to talk to father gallen will take care of you just cooperate do as he says and every thing should be fine i doubt that alaire said sadly our socalled dip lomatic mission is now a disastrous ruin he looked up suddenly concerned for his master any word on how theyre treating naitachal is he under arrest alaire guessed that his master and friend would not fare well in a suinomen gaol althea would view this as an act of war they stared at each other apparently having the same thought how stupid of me kai said slapping his fore head that was the whole reason for the attack master is an elf and ill bet they figured you had to be some kind of mage too if they didnt kill you would force you to use magic these enemies who ever they are in the palace thought this through completely yes naitachal will probably be arrested would althea go to war over that alaires stomach lurched again maybe but if they imprison one of the kings sons even unwittingly he seized his head in both hands as it threatened to explode from the pain of headache and heartache oh gods i dont know what to do unless i e suinomen and explain whats going on to my father we have no chance of preventing war how had all this turned into such a horrid mess so quickly kai looked grim there are probably watchers and checkpoints at the port and the roads still there are ways if worse comes to worse i can put you on a boat for althea if it comes to that i hope it doesnt he shook his head unhappily some of the exhaustion coming back gods what a mess this is does someone in the pal ace want a war with us that badly to go to so much trouble now kai looked completely baffled i see no possi ble benefit from it for anybody but it sure looks that way i have to convince father of whats going on its the only chance we both have they made ready to leave for gallens kai eyed the harp suspiciously then suggested he keep it with him in case he needed to protect himself alaire slung it over his back on its wide leather carryingstrap to give his arm free movement if he had to use his sword he overestimates my bardic ability alaire thought wryly though it was flattering that the prince would do so but then alaire remembered last night who knows maybe i can raise the power to defend myself against an army yes and pigs will turn to swans when i do so they gathered up all the old clothes and stashed them in one of the bags kai gave instructions to alaire to burn them as soon as possible in the dark of the early morning the two peasant boys crept out of the stable the snow had diminished to a mere dusting though alaire had trouble negotiat ing what had already accumulated you can do better than that someone will notice you kai admonished alaire didnt know what he was talking about if we look like were drunk maybe it wont be so noticeable if you slip and slide a little alaire took the flask of wine out of the bag took a drink and hesitating handed it to kai the boy stared at it for a long moment then wrinkled his nose and re no thanks im not really in the mood for it right now alaire gawked at him never thought id hear that to give the impression hed been drinking all night he dribbled a little on his tunic then splashed so kai as well now they both smelled like a winery a cheap winery he capped the flask and held it in plain sight alaire guessed by the hint of daylight on the hori zon that dawn would arrive soon on the deserted streets i hope ill be safe enough to be able to sleep in this place he thought stifling a yawn im ready to fall over right now he recognized some of the taverns most of them closed as ones theyd been to on kais last carouse a few were still open to greet the dawn now an undeni able brightness on the eastern horizon the burnedout tavern where their misadventure had begun earlier that night was a charred husk still smell ing strongly of smoke as they passed it there was a bit of warmth coming from it still it felt good but they had no time to stop at the end of the street a mounted figure in a uniform appeared and kai stiff ened do what i do kai said quickly the uniformed man saw them and directed his dieren towards them it was quite appallingly surefooted in the snow alaire realized that it would have no trouble overtak ing them and running them down if they tried to flee alaire thought he was going to lose his breakfast again this time from the other end of his body as the man approached he saw that it was a lone member of the swords of the association his throat became dry his knees turned to mush their swords though concealed beneath their thick fur coats were well within reach am i going to kill twice in one day at this point he would do anything short of sacrif kai to avoid the prison of souls dont even think it kai whispered there would be fifty of them on top of us in moments follow me say nothing horrified alaire watched kai run to the soldier kai what are you doing alms kai cried jumping up and down like a little kid holding his hands up to the soldier alms for a poor beggar child who hasnt eaten in three days he held his hand higher and the soldier stopped momentarily confused alaire ran over and held an open palm up looking hungry and desperate the lat ter not requiring much acting oh please kind sir kai wailed pathetically can you spare us a little coin a copper please sir were starving ho get away you little beggars the solder cried the dieren came to a complete stop the beast itself disinterested in the two peasants the soldier sniffed the air youre hungry because youve been too busy drinking wine to spend money on food the soldier shouted look its a wonder youre hungry now the soldier was pointing at alaires wine flask which he still had in his other hand he grinned sheepishly opened it and offered it to the soldier go home and to bed peasants i have criminals to look for he kicked his beast and the dieren trotted off down the street in search of the prince of sumo men and a renegade bard tightwad kai spat watching the retreating sol dier they get paid six hundred crowns a month and yesterday was payday alaire remembered gallen from the night they first went to the dead dragon inn he was one of the bar keeps who tried in vain to prevent kai from taking on the five sailors he seemed too young to be bald alaire guessed him to be around thirty with a large knobby nose and beetred complexion as if perpetu ally embarrassed about something his expression was not exactly welcoming when they reached the rear door of the inn he glanced up and down the alley nervously then hurried them inside so this is your friend who caused all the trouble he said gruffly well cant be helped in for a lamb in for a sheep follow me he took them down steep narrow stairs into a maw of darkness rich odors of wet earth and stale beer and fermenting yeast wafted past them there were no handrails and alaire tiptoed nervously on the uncertain steps once down light bloomed when gal len struck a match and lit a single candle this is where we keep some of the premium ale and its also where we brew the cheap stuff do not disturb any of it or youll interrupt the fermentation come on the place i have for you is back here past the kegs was another even smaller passageway lined with planks it looked like an old mine alaire asked about it gallen confirmed it used to mine crystals down here centuries ago before the crown made magic illegal it doesnt go back very far but ive got a place set up thats not very easy to find there is a single flue connecting with the main chimney above and it will only handle small fires got one going now they entered a hollowedout section that looked as if it might once have been part of a cave with a curved rock wall a stove glowed warmly in the corner a row of bunk beds with hay mattresses lined one wall mac was here after you left gallen informed them your friend the constable thought you might be back here i tell you i dont like it kainemonen this is not a safe place its the only place we have kai admitted sadly i wont be here long anyway im going back to the pal ace tonight last night was an attempted assassination not a robbery my father must know about it gallen seemed resigned if you must whatever you do please dont say anything about this theyll execute me for treason kai nodded an oddly adult expression on his face dont i know it he said alaire will think of some thing for you to tell them something that will get you off the hook thanks kai but better that they got their stories straight now he sup alaire stowed his harp under the bottom bed then sat on the edge the warmth of the room acted like a weight on his eyelids kai i need to know something he said suddenly forcing himself awake how good are the swords in tracking magic users when they captured those two the other night were they led there by a snitch or did they have some way of seeing them and where they were theyre not as good at that as they say gallen said usually someone turns the magic users in if no one saw you then they would have no way of knowing who was responsible they can feel magic being per formed but can only narrow the search down to a particular portion of town if we can keep you under cover long enough the traces of magic still on you from what you did will wear off and theyll never be able to prove you did anything but he turned back to kai and his face showed pure desperation if you would reconsider another part of town on the north side perhaps would be much safer kai set his jaw stubbornly i dont know anybody up there gallen looked just about ready to cry but you prince kai glared at him but all my friends are here in the tavern district i dont know anyone up there and remember the things i know gallen the mans red face paled if you are my friend kai continued then you will help me please take care of alaire protect him feed him conceal him i will be back as soon as i can these last words faded quickly as exhaustion over whelmed him whether or not im in a safe place i cant hold out he thought as he collapsed back on the bed and his eyelids dropped closed chapt in their room naitachal prepared for breakfast in the great hall a knock sounded at the door he reached for his sword but didnt draw it he recalled that the last time someone knocked on his door it had been lit tle erik come to clean the room he relaxed a little it wouldnt do at all for the boy to walk in a second time with a sword pointed towards him and he didnt think the poor child would believe the practice story again come in naitachal said carefully the door opened and a cart pushed by erik came rolling in your breakfast the boy said happily paavo sent me in with it sir the dark elf raised his eyebrows when he saw what theyd sent dieren steak fried eggs a fresh loaf of bread a round of cheese a pot of jam compared to the repast of yesterday this was a veritable feast hmm he thought trying to unweave the tangled web they were spinning before him theyre serving me in my room on the third day of the visit they must want me out of the way so as not to mingle with anyone who might ask me questions about the where abouts of kai and alaire where would you like it the boy asked eager to please at least they had not managed to contam eriks mind anywhere he said the cart became a clever table and he pulled up a chair to make the best of the meal something tells me this is going to be a trying day ill need my energy erik made ready to leave naitachal spoke up you dont have to leave just yet come sit ill be happy to talk with you if you like you had a lot of questions yesterday shyly the boy complied but his hesitancy indicated he either had something else he had to do or paavo had instructed him not to talk to the dark elf naitachal cut a careful piece from the dieren steak and ate it as casually as if he had not a care in the world young as this child was and guileless he could still be used as a source of information so hav prince and my secretary returned to the palace yet thats your secretary theyre looking for too the boy replied clearly shocked naitachal ate a piece of bread evidently he said with careful casualness whats the news well erik began eying the door i uh is someone watching him making sure he returns promptly yes the elf asked theyre both still missing erik said quickly sir jehan threw a flying fit when the swords failed to find them last night he sealed the port permitting no ships to leave or enter without a search i never considered escape by sea naitachal mused gods forbid that ever becomes necessary it may be the only route out of this land he tried some of the cheese it was excellent interesting he said i cant imagine why they think alaire would want to escape his place is with me after all i should think they ought to be looking for whoever has kidnapped him and is trying to create an incident there plant a rumor of my own the boy stared at him why are they keeping you here erik blurted all the servants are talking about it well that didnt make much sense keeping you mean boarding dont you naitachal asked erik made a face i mean why arent they letting you leave the palace why dont you go look for your secretary yourself now it was naitachals turn to look surprised i wasnt aware this was the case they must really im important or perhaps they do think someone has kidnapped alaire and they fear for my safety if i ven ture into town erik glanced at the door again then stood and ill be by later to clean the room are those alaires things over there in the corner alaire was a tidy traveler and was careful to keep his clothing and assorted belongings in one place so as not to get mixed up or get in the way of his masters possessions indeed why do you ask erik was visibly nervous i wanted to make sur i wouldnt disturb them and he was gone puzzling the dark elf thought he is a rich source of information erik would make an excellent spy if he isnt one already after all who would suspect a child except an evil dark elf who would suspect his own mother in this plac still the boy seemed innocent enough but his tongue certainly does wag a lot if hes working fo king in that capacity and if im a captive in this p i must be the last one to know he finished breakfast and was about to ignor kings request that he stay in his room when someone knocked on the door again he had his sword out this time the knock was harder and was higher on the door an adult captain lyam let himself in without invitation he glanced at the sword indifferently not particularly sur prised or offended naitachal returned it to its sheath we have news about the prince lyam said soberly this morning he returned hes in the kings chambers right now naitachal did not bother to hide his elation at least he knew that the boys were still among the living and alaire lyams face was grim he unfortunately has not returned went off on his own in the tavern district according to kai the prince is probably protecting him but so far the story holds water king archeno men urgently requests your presence at once so how else was i supposed to get onto the palace grounds unrecognized kai was shouting shrilly when naitachal entered the kings chambers captain lyam at his side you have half the kingdom out looking for me youve accused me of a crime i didnt commit youve offered a reward for my head and you ask me why i look like a pauper of c im dressed like a peasant maybe you should be ask ing that stupid guard why it was so easy for me to get in father the king looked as if he had a splitting headache one which was getting worse with each passing sec ond captain lyam looked away visibly trying not to look embarrassed he was after all in charge of the guard in question sir jehan was standing to the kings right evidently enjoying the show while attempting to look concerned beside him stood soren the rotund wizard dressed in an even more gaudy robe of bur gundy silk decorated with silver moons stars and symbols of unknown meaning the wizard seemed intimidated by kais brazen insolence while trying without success to exude authority as the kings head magician behind these men against the rear wall of the kings chambers stood ten heavily armed guards some holding shackles and chains at their sides open and ready to use prince kai sat in a heavy wooden chair in the center of the room his feet dangling above the floor glaring at everybody present ah you must be the ambassador of althea kai said as his eyes settled on naitachal alaire has told me much about you im glad youre here i was saving the best for when you arrived naitachal bowed graciously pleased to make your acquaintance kai continued with a certain amount of glee in his voice last night someone sent two assassins to kill me and alaire and they almost succeeded assassins lyam spoke up are you sure despite the surprise the large man was feigning nai tachal knew the man had expected this why else would he be training the boy so hard with the sword captain lyam has anticipated this for months oh dont be silly the king said petulantly you probably got attacked by a couple of pickpock ets what did you expect carousing in such a place were they by chance dressed in black with black wrappings concealing their faces naitachal said loud enough for everyone in the room to hear what are you talking about the king demanded distracted by naitachals question and the sudden odd turn the interrogation had taken yes they were kai said they were profession als wearing black costumes and black scarves about their faces so alaire was right they were like the ones who came after you only one my lord the dark elf corrected but otherwise the same ambassador were you attacked why didnt you say anything about it the king said in a softer dan gerous tone when did this happen the first night we were here naitachal said step ping closer i didnt report it because there were things about your land i did not understand i wanted to find out more first the incident however left me with the feeling this assassin was not trying to kill me but to goad me into using magic against him while this was tempting i remembered in time where i was and refrained the attacker fled and if he were really trying to kill me he would not have abandoned the job now why would someone want to force you to use magic sir jehan said in a oily voice he was stroking his beard casually pretending he was relaxed during these proceedings but a nervous tic at the side of his face gave him away certainly youre not suggesting the king had anything to do with it naitachal made no secret of his contempt for such a suggestion no i am not but whoever it was knew the castle and apparently knew of secret passages the man who attacked me vanished and he went down one of these i suspect the kings eyes narrowed with suspicion i find it very disturbing ambassador that you have chosen to keep this to yourself king archenomen said this raises questions can you prove this did anyone see this there were no witnesses naitachal said save myself and that was precisely why i said nothing for with no way to prove what happened who would ever have believed me he faced the king squarely meet ing him eye to eye i on the other hand find it even more disturbing that someone attacked me a guest of this palace from our conversations i have gathered that you feel there is a conspiracy afoot perhaps ele ments of this conspiracy are responsible for these two attempts at murder one upon me and the other upon my secretary and your prince we are not doubting your word sir jehan said evenly if you had reported the attack when it hap pened we might have been in a position to do something about it but i fear the evidence if there were any would be a little stale by now dont you think his face hardened the time had come for him to make his move no the situation i fear is something other than the prince claims it appears your secretary has broken one of our laws and is hid ing from our justice alaire did no such thing kai shouted at his erst while friend silence the king roared youve had your say naitachal regarded sir jehan with a cold unwaver ing stare those are strong accusations to be making against althea what evidence have you and what law did alaire allegedly break sir jehan met his stare and promptly blinked then looked away when the boys went out last night i had two of our men follow this was only a precaution you see and something i do from time to time anyway our men caught kai trying to recruit magicians in the tavern district and when he saw our men he went after them killing one the other lived to tell about it interesting naitachal replied if true why wasnt this information available last night certainly you must have known at dinner that this alleged inci dent had taken place why did you say nothing king archenomen cleared his throat it would be wise of you my dear ambassador to remember that you are a guest of the palace and not a member of my staff he said sternly there are things to which you are not privy sir jehan please continue our man saw alaire cast the spell sir jehan said smugly and a rather potent one at that it was for show only to impress the prince it would also seem that the ambassadors secretary has been in the proc ess of allying himself with the young traitorous prince while his master is presenting the illusion of althean decency here in the palace he turned to the king his tone silky but full of menace your majesty there can be no mistaking the factions that threaten your land we have seen a clear pattern of deception cloaked with diplomatic propri ety althea has been infiltrating mages into your land to aid the prince in disposing of you and last night my men caught the prince and an althean mage red handed carrying out plans to overthrow you i see no reason for further debate well i do prince kainemonen interjected jehan is a lying traitor there were no keepers as he describes only two ruffians who tried to kill us both without provocation sir jehan sent assassins not guardians please father you must believe me i am your son i am telling you the truthl king archenomen gazed at his son thoughtfully rubbing his temples as if this would make it all go away then he shook his head his voice was sad and heavy but determined son in the past year i have seen you go through some disagreeable changes you have completely ignored your responsibilities here at the palace in favor of carousing with the scum of our society you have consistently shamed suinomen before visiting dignitaries important men of the trades and our own nobles you have shamed the throne and worst of all you have shamed me personally do you have any idea how bad you make me look when you show up too drunk to stand at official gath erings do you know how humiliated i am whenever you arrive at the palace at daybreak reeking of ale with women in tow singing at the top of your lungs your mother wont speak to me she wont even show her face in public because of the monster youve become youve shown no interest in the wellbeing of kingdom unless it happens to coincide with your own selfish needs youre more interested in your grape crop than you are in the farmers wheat sir jehan on the other hand has been a trustworthy confidant of mine since before you were born has consistently per formed his duties with no regard for his own welfare and up until now hes put out every one of the little political fires youve started protected the throne put the kingdoms needs before his every waking moment of his life and you want me to take your word over his how dare you insult my intelligence that way the silence in the room was thick enough to cut nobody moved or breathed the king was on his feet his face a hands width away from his sons and purple with rage why should i believe you the king said his voice dripping with contempt and he turned on his heel and returned to his throne kai didnt answer right away his attitude during his fathers tirade had gone from cocky to neutral to sub missive he spoke softly into that horrible silence that had filled the room because i am telling the truth father nonsense the king spat youve been conspiring against me for a long time now admit it and you thought you had an ally in althea didnt you i thought no such thing father where is this secretary sir jehan demanded if youre not a traitor then why are you protecting him kai shrugged i told you we parted last night check the brothels if i may interject something naitachal said cau tiously if alaire is allegedly guilty of performing magic without a license then why havent the swords of the association picked him up already theyre magicians with a license surely this shouldnt be a problem any althean hedgewizard can track the scent of magic to whoever has performed it one of your association mages should have found alaire long ago if he is guilty all eyes turned to soren who had all but vanished during the exchange it looked to naitachal rather as if he had attempted to slip out the door your majesty he said sweating profusely this is a very powerful mage were talking about here he must have must have cast some sort of concealing spell so that we cant find him the moment he cast the magic the entire association hall trembled with the power and we knew immediately where it came from the tavern district as soon as our staff of magicians began tracing this power source back to the culprit the trail mysteriously vanished naitachal rolled his eyes what a charlatan are we speaking of the same young man he asked mildly a powerful mage at nineteen youve never had this problem before the king said suspiciously why the problem now sweat was pouring down sorens face if we had some personal possession of his it would make it much easier such as naitachal asked politely first alaire is a conspirator now a mage not even a hint that h bard good up to a point an article of clothing jewelry anything will do then perhaps we should escort naitachal back to his room captain lyam suggested where alaires possessions are the dark elfs heart sank he had hoped lyam would be an ally but it looked otherwise perhaps he still is theres enough smoke in this room to smother a horse before you go anywhere the king said yawning arrest kai throw him in the dungeon until further notice no kai shrieked leaping to his feet you cant do that im your son you were my son no longer take him away two of the guards came forward with shackles the boy looked ready to fight but all his energy drained out of him before naitachals eyes once shackled feet and hands he walked out of the kings chamber with a loud rattle his head down sir jehan looked positively gleeful oh and one more thing the king said address ing naitachal any idea why althea would be massing troops near our southern border your majesty are you sure about that certainly there must be a mistake quite i await your response i know nothing of this either naitachal said someone must have lied to him the king smiled that is an unacceptable an ambassador now you were saying soren the wizard trembled i need a relic a possession of the secretarys if i may the king waved at him take what you need jehan you go with them ambassador until we resolve this matter i ask you to place yourself voluntarily under guard of captain lyam if you resist or try to return to althea you will share the dungeon with the former prince kainemonen and a state of war will exist between our two kingdoms it would seem by the actions of your own army that such a state may already exist do you understand the severity of this situa ambassador indeed i do naitachal replied i will assist you any way i can i cannot explain why our forces are gathering on your borders but i doubt they are con sidering an invasion the king only smiled a little more as if he had expected this answer it pleased him your lack of total conviction is disturbing ambassador the only thing we would like you to do now is provide a posses sion of the young mans to soren then confine yourself to your room captain lyam will be person ally responsible for your continued residency here then by all means naitachal said lets go and get what you need the grim procession of four to naitachals room attracted a great deal of unwanted attention it looked for all the world like the group was on its way to an execution and naitachal was the guest of honor sev eral of the palace guests stood and stared at the group the news of the situation and the return of the prince having spread quickly through the halls this treat ment was nothing new to naitachal the natives of this wretched backwards kingdom gawked at him anyway the dark elf knew it wasnt time to direct blame he must remain calm and professional and play along with whatever they wanted they hadnt thrown him in prison ye sir jehan stayed behind them several paces keeping a distance from naitachal the nobleman had made a habit of avoiding his eyes perhaps because he knew what a necromancer was in the old days we killed with a look made all the easier if we made eye contact naitachal thought stormily as they approached the room and i have a very good reason to kill you you are the one behind all of this he berated himself for being so stupid he knew he should have concluded this long ago but had not because it was too obvious naitachal hoped that was not the case but feared it was oversubtlety was a character flaw of his no doubt abo naitachal noted with a kind of reluctant admir in the way that one admires the efficiency of a poi son or the potency of a snakes venom that jehan had conveniently and convincingly accomplished both these deeds over a single evening it would seem that somebody in the kings circle of confidants would take notice but evidently nobody did or else they were all in jehans pocket as well do they know sir jehan patronizes the tavern dis trict too perhaps not the man is shrewd to bring this off as far as he has he planned all this from the beginning my arrival was never more than a slight inconvenience hes planning on my use of magic to save myself and alaire the question is does he think his magicians are better than i am not only has he declared war on althea hes declared war on me he doubted suinomen magicians were much of a challenge at least the ones hed seen already lyam said they dwelled in the palace but only soren had appeared at this little meeting though soren did seem like an incompetent giving him a relic of alaires made naitachal a little uneasy even amateur magi cians can go far with relics when captain lyam opened the door for them he winked at naitachal ever so subtly erik cleaned the room as promised however one thing was not as erik had promised alaires things were gone not a single stitch of fabric remained which belonged to the lad naitachal tried not to look surprised instead he pretended as if nothing was missing it doesnt seem to be much sir jehan noted which are his things ambassador this must be it captain lyam said helpfully picking up a saddlebag the elf didnt recognize inside were garments about alaires size resembling what he had worn before but they were not his naitachal was as sure of that as he was certain of his own name a favorite piece of jewelry would be most benefi cial soren said his chest puffing out importantly does he have any such thing but of course naitachal said he reached for a smaller bag belonging to himself made a pretense of searching and pulled out a shiny silver ring with a human skull a deaths head with tiny rubies for eyes this was one of his most prized possessions charming isnt it soren said sarcastically t jehan holding it up to the light but if it belonged to him it will be most helpful without so much as a thank you sir jeha soren left captain lyam stood with him for several moments listening to their retreating footsteps a moment or two later when it was safe to talk lyam in spected the hallway briefly then closed the door so when did you have time to replace alaires pos sessions with someone elses naitachal asked folding his arms over his chest i wish id known i might have been able to do something useful i didnt little erik did we can trust him hes working for me if i had more time to warn you it wouldnt have been necessary to give him that ring lyam said his face grim as for your predicament i can arrange safe passage on a ship for you and alaire it will have to be tonight because tomorrow will be too late they will have found the justification by then to put you in the dungeon with kai the dark elf frowned i am more concerned with the state of affairs between althea and suinomen if i leave there will be war my mission here was to pre vent it captain lyam shook his head and his expression grew even darker your mission was doomed from the beginning war with althea is inevitable at this p im afraid getting you two home is the only way reynard will know that sir jehan is behind this sad folly naitachal let out his breath in a sigh at least there was one person still in a position of power that wa jehans man do you know where alaire is no but kai does lyam replied confidently hell tell me and if you would like i can recover that ring for you oh dont bother it wasnt alaires naitachal said with a sly grin it belonged to my father i do think the relic of a longdead master necromancer will muck up sorens search spell in very interesting and entertaining ways it will eventually find its way back to me all by itself he leaned back studying captain lyam closely without appearing to can i trust this man he won dered is there something peculiar about his total commitment to returning us to althea when he has everything to lose why are you doing this captain the elf asked at youre wondering why im sacrificing everything lyam dropped his masks for the first time since nai tachal met him he looked old old tired and defeated well actually im sacrificing very little one of sir jehans nephews is about to replace me as cap tain my next post is to be a remote wasteland in the north it stays dark for months at a time and its not a place where anyone would ever go willingly im ready for a career change and a change of climate i would rather return to althea with you on the whole if nec essary i could find work as a mercenary he sighed i cannot save my king or my country i might as well save myself that i can accept the elf said what about this blockade ive heard about from erik will that be a problem the captain shook his head you forget who however temporary my power may be in the late hours when they have the green recruits watching the port i will have no trouble impressing them with my rank we can get through with no trouble and the ship naitachal persisted is one ready to sail there is an arachneanowned ship crewed by humans that is due to leave in the morning a trader loaded with dieren goods lyam seemed to have thought of everything there were few even in this kingdom who would care to interfere with the tra arachneans if you explained who you were perhaps they would leave a little early naitachal smiled grimly that shouldnt be diffi cult given my heritage most traders would probably be ambivalent about the troubles of an ambassador and a prince since most had more loyalty to their trade than to the crown of althea but no one would risk the anger of a dark elf since so many of them were necromancers and those that were not were formidable warriors if they refuse to take us i will be very very angry if you can find out where alaire is and get us as far as the port you have a deal i will get us the rest of the way deal lyam said they shook on it the skies remained overcast but didnt shed any more snow on the already blanketed ground at noon and again at suppertime erik brought meals on the cart bearing no new information to naitachal after dinner lyam put a young recruit a lad of about seven teen on guard duty the captain said that he had been pulling double guard duty and was likely to fall asleep around midnight the captain disappeared around dusk to gain access to the dungeon and have a little talk with kai shortly after midnight erik appeared for the last time to take the food cart away this time you get to ride out inside it he whis pered youre leaving now we know where alaire is guards asleep but capn lyam said to take no chances put a bundle in the bed to look like you im taking you down to the kitchen this way no one sees you inside this naitachal asked regarding the cart doubtfully he sighed and taking only his sword and harp squeezed into the cramped space of the cart a tight fit but manageable erik draped the cloth on either side opened the door and rolled hi the trek was uneventful until just before erik pushed him onto the dumbwaiter naitachal recog nized paavos voice and they chattered in their native language for some time then paavo walked off erik rolled the cart into the tiny elevator and moments later he had descended to the brightness of the kitchen oil lamps illuminated the now cleaned and polished palace kitchen empty of staff at this hour save for erik and captain lyam hurry this way lyam said ushering the elf out the back door to a waiting carriage erik bun dled up in a heavy dieren coat and a fur hat and jumped into the drivers seat while lyam tucked nai tachals weapons under the seat and threw a black cloth over him with any luck they wont see you duck down to the floor when i say lyam said urgently not much going on this time of night the most difficult part was getting to the kitchen did you have any trouble how would i know what was trouble unless it arrested me paavo stopped erik to talk about some thing i dont think he knew what was going on dammit all lyam muttered that might have blown the whole thing he leaned out the window erik lets go now the carriage lurched forward and lyam told the elf to get down best not to take any chances they traveled for a short distance before they stopped presumably at the outer wall naitachal stayed close to the floor flattening himself against it like a cat outside he heard several voices speaking the strange suinomen dialect to which lyam responded then they were moving again that was too easy captain lyam said his tone very uncomfortable im not sure if we should go on what choice do we have naitachal asked from beneath his drapery im already gone were free of the palace is anyone pursuing us he heard lyam shift in his seat it may be difficult to tell a professional is always hard to spot but i sup pose you are right we are past the point of no return naitachal squirmed uncomfortably is it safe to sit up for now lyam said and naitachal got up off the floor and seated himself across from the captain rearranging his black drapery perhaps their guard was down after all the prince is back in the dungeon and the real search is taking place in town we will have to be careful once we get closer to the tavern district trees quickly gave way to brick buildings tile roofs the rock walls of the larger estates all towering over the carriage so where is alaire hiding naitachal asked curi ously wishing there were some way to ease the knot of tension in his back and neck lyam rubbed an old scar nervously a place c the dead dragon inn the owner is hiding him in the basement kai did well putting him there the owner is a good friend and dislikes the crown for the taxes they weigh against the taverns with the swords o association wandering about down there that would be the safest place to hide provided that the reward does not tempt him to regain some of the money gone in taxes naitachal added but only to himself and provided that the owner is not aware that his protector and friend is currently languishing in the kings dungeon chapte alaire emerged slowly from a deep but restless sleep a confused and disturbing dream melted away as he became aware of his surroundings first the lumpy hay mattress then the dank musty odor of the room and finally the warmth and the humidity and the sweat that had beaded on his forehead he opened his eyes and tried to focus the room was dark except for the orange glow of the stove he sat suddenly upright banging his head on the bunk bed above him the sudden pain forced more wakefulness into his stiff body his slow numb mind where am i was his only thought loud tavern sounds filtering down through the ceil ing answered his question im under the dragon inn kai brought me here the room had no windows which added to his confusion uncertain how long hed slept he didnt know if it was day or night what about kai he thought with a sick suspicion that something terrible had happened to him a master naitachal what are you up to right now he felt exhausted despite the long deep sleep the spell right ive never reached that far that deep for the energies before naitachal told me of mages who reached too far even after years of experience and scorched their own minds with energies too powerful for even them to handle his raging headache was a good indication hed done the same thing on a smaller scale what should i expect the spell turned back death it reassembled flesh it restored blood looks like my head is going to pay dearly for it now he must have slept all day and he was tempted to go ahead and sleep another day but something told him it was time to get up that something was afoot the swords of the association are all over the place by now he thought would they ever think to look down here evidently they hadnt yet the sounds overhead the singing the stamping of feet indicated the tavern was open and doing business meaning it had to be night he reached under the bed to make certain his harp was still there it was along with his other posses sions kai must have left as soon as i was asleep he thought gotten must be upstairs working so that left him with one question what am i to do now he remembered that kai had warned him they had to destroy the old clothes as soon as possible and groped under his bed for the bag that held them find ing it by touch alone he tossed the canvas sack with the bloodied garments into the stove then added more wood to it in moments a raging tire burned destroying the evidence the wool clothing stank as it burned but it was something he was going to have to put up with as the stove crackled and popped and the light increased his eyes fell on a crude oak table and the food left for him well they arent taking too bad care of me i guess though his head hurt his stomach was in good shape and complaining bitterly about how little he had been putting into it lately the food theyd left him wasnt bad a plate of meats cheeses and a warm stein of ale there was also a kettle a mug with dried herbs and a rough note scribbled on a piece of parchment he had to hold it up to the light of the nowblazing stove to make it ki sed you wood haf a baad hed wen you wok up so i lef a mug o w g alaire read the note twice before he understood what the barkeep was trying to tell him a remedy for exactly what i have now he thought with gratitude although the remedy sounded a little dubious he set the kettle on the stove to heat up willow bark he said to the mug without much conviction righ id try anything waiting for the water to boil alaire stretched and scratched he felt grungy particularly after sleeping in his clothes a hot bath would be really nice right now but the only hot bath he knew of was at the palace it might as well have been in althea not bloody likely theyd let me get a bath if i went back to the palace now he thought dismally gods a goodlong soak would be heavenly or maybe an hour in that sowna now that was a great bathing invention a loud clatter came from up the staircase followed by voices and footsteps his heart leapt into his throat and every nerve felt afire oh gods theyve found me alaire jumped to his feet and reached for his blade and stood beside the entrance to the small chamber in the shadows a desperate measure but that was all he had left were desperation measures the group of three he guessed by the footsteps approached the chamber without talking his heart was beating so hard he might just as well have been running closer closer he now wished he hadnt thrown more wood on the fire since the flames were climbing within the lit tle stove casting bright light making it impossible to hide he took cover in the little pool of shadow next to the bunk the intruders drew nearer a shadow entered the room no not a shadow the dark elf naitachal alaire said incredulously sword still raised and ready his master had been the last person hed expected to see he relaxed until lyam walked into the room grip ping the hilt of his sword tighter as the huge mans eyes met his lyam is on our side the elf said simply how ever there is a complication oh gods what now alaire asked although he didnt want to hear it ill be goin back up now gallen the third person to come in said you mind that tea it will take care of that headache real quick and ill let you know when those chaps are through snooping around the sooner youre out of here the better for all of us the bar keep trotted back up the stairs and shut the door we wont be leaving right away lyam said taking a seat on the edge of the bunk looking as exhaust alaire felt there are a couple of swords nosing around upstairs more likely theyre looking to cadge a few free drinks but we cant take the chance that they might spot us swords alaire said alarmed here he looked around frantically half expecting the swords to appear at any moment naitachal laughed softly as he motioned to alaire to take a seat and began an examination first checking his eyes and then feeling over his forehead and scalp nasty bump there recent he glanced over at the bunkbed lyam was sitting on didnt know where you were when you woke up you sat up too fast you can tell all that by a bump alaire replied a little sullenly they should have you tell fortunes by bumps at court im sure it would be very amusing naitachal didnt seem annoyed by his attitude nasty mood too you must have a headache given the sort of spellcasting youve been up to it almost sounded like an accusation well if he hadnt done what hed done they wouldnt be in this predicament i dont want to talk about it alaire said kai would have died had i done nothing naitachal shrugged i dont doubt that at all id like you to tell me about it if you would it has a bear ing on your ability after all slowly alaire told him the whole story of the assas sins kais fatal wound and the bardic magic he raised to save his life naitachal listened quietly nodding occasionally as he poured the hot water over the wil low bark well you certainly are a credit to my training naitachal said handing him the steaming mug i would have shown you ways to protect yourself a little better had i known you were that far along as it was you fully exposed your mind to everything you were pulling in and thats the reason for your headache i know exactly what it feels like my head isnt that dif ferent from a humans what you did was right alaire even if it did create problems for the rest of us in a way naitachals reaction made it all worse but i messed things up so badly alaire wailed we were here to try to prevent a war now ive probably started one dont blame yourself alaire lyam said trying to soothe him sir jehan had already made certain there would be a war before you ever arrived you are not to blame you simply became a convenient excuse for what he wanted to do anyway then he explaine jehans machinations but that left alaire with a number of unanswered questions one of which was very important what about kai alaire asked hesitantly theyve got him now dont they what happened when he got to his father captain lyam answered not naitachal his face and voice completely expressionless he tried to explain what happened kais word was against jehans he had little credibility and his father of course didnt believe him they put him in shackles and sent him to the dungeon they charged him with treason with con spiracy involving mages sent by althea to overthrow his father the dungeon alaire said his eyes darting back and forth between his masters and the captains now theyre looking for me its me they want we cant go off and leave kai in prison and what do you propose we do naitachal said softly we barely got out of there ourselves and that was only because captain lyam was my jailer alaire shook his head vehemently i dont care we have to go back kai saved my life when he brought me down here which would make you about even hmm nai tachal said shrewdly you saved his life and put your own in jeopardy by performing magic he saved yours by hiding you the scales balance in my opinion theres nothing we can do alaire lyam said sadly sir jehan is just too powerful right now he had the king eating out of his hands and it would take a miracle to change that if you go back to try to kai and fail do you know what will be waiting for you then yes i know alaire said sadly prison of souls you do not want to go there lyam replied emphatically kais fate wont be nearly as terrible trust me his father will not deliver him to the usual fate of traitors hell probably be disowned and made into a slave under paavo slavery is the usual fate of those traitors who are not considered clever enough to be dangerous he coughed embarrassed jehan will probably urge this very move on the king he would obtain far more enjoyment out of seeing kai shining his boots than swinging at the end of a rope alaire could not imagine this kai will never serve anyone but himself naitachal said ive seen enough of the boy to make that predic tion but youre wrong alaire protested hes changed no really hes not the same when i brought him back he saw how close he was to dying something happened to him im not sure what he groped after the words he needed to describe kais transformation but failed to find them which is all moot at this point naitachal said we cant go back it would be the three of us against the entire royal guard and kings mages an swords we dont have a chance against them alaire slumped and put his head in his hands i guess youre right but how do you plan on getting us out of here alaire downed more of the tea which helped his headache tremendously whats going to happen to you captain i am going with you young man lyam said wea rily ive burned my bridges to get naitachal here theyll be offering a price for my head as soon as they realize im gone and who i took with me he scratched his chin reflecting i hope they dont go too hard on that boy i put in charge of guarding you im more concerned about erik naitachal said they knew he was driving the carriage when we left thats something i havent told you yet lyam said reluctantly hes going with us too you see eriks my son in spite of the tale he spun for you about a teacher and the house of lieslund more like hou lyam he beamed proudly despite his obvious worry right now hes leaving the carriage some where on the other side of the tavern district to throw the swords off and will meet us at the dock alaire looked up surprised were going by ship no other way naitachal said an arachnean trader by the looks of it the problem will be getting to it sir jehan sealed the docks speaking of which shouldnt we be getting out of here lyam said standing with a visible effort if we wait too long my rank isnt going to carry much weight with anyone i wont have a rank or a life gallen came puffing back down the stairs wiping sweat off his forehead looks like the swords are gone gallen said but id be careful they went north towards the palace good lyam said loosening his sword in its sheathe were going dont tell me gallen said holding fingers in both ears i dont want to know now you three youd bet ter get on before someone else comes looking for you my thoughts exactly naitachal said he alaire to his feet are you ready the movement renewed his headache which pounded in both temples and put a tight band of pain across his brow as im going to be he groaned in reply they took the dark and halfhidden secondary alleys instead of the highly visible lamplit streets lyam remained wary leading the way with a drawn dagger checking each shadow for a potential attacker the snow had turned to a thick gray mush in the al leys alaire had gotten a little more accustomed to the slippery stuff in the short time he had been in suino men and naitachal graceful as a cat predictably had no problems with it at all alaire couldnt stop thinking about kai and what was going to happen to him he didnt believe lyams story about slavery despite the elaborate explanation he knew it was nothing more than a story to mak and possibly even lyam himself feel better most likely the king would sentence him to die given the circumstances he doubted lyams motives in helping them theres something in this for him and we dont know what it is yet still naitachal had always been a good judge of character granted that he probably had little choice in the people willing to help him escape from the pal ace alaire didnt think the dark elf would p lyam to join them if he had any doubts abou captains trustworthiness and veracity kai was going back to try to dear me instead they arrested him and will probably execute him and there isnt a thing i can do about it logic told him there was no going back that the only thing left for them to do was to return to althea with what theyd learned but alaire found himself walking a little slower when he thought abou prince and his fate as if the palace was a magnet drawing him back if i explained to naitachal how i felt about this surely i can do something to help him after all im not what they think i am my father is the king of althea now that i think about it nai tachal is technically my underling not the other way around if it actually came to that if i put my foot down pointed out that i was after all althean roy alty would he back down and agree to rescue kai this was not something he really wanted to do and not a course of action he took lightly he watched nai tachal furtively as they passed through the alleys and everything he saw in the elfs face told him he wanted to get home not likely to work alaire thought ive never thrown my weight around like that before and if i did now it would create a rift between us that might never mend if we return to althea i will still have to live with him or else find another bardic master bight bardic masters dont exactly grow on trees and who would take me if i pulled rank on naitachal no one thats who the network of alleys took them out of the tavern district to a small residential district of peasants homes the place was definitely the poor side of town complete with raw sewage in the gutters piles of refuse beside the street and large hungrylooking rats the likes of them strolling through this cesspool raised no eyebrows a young gang of adolescents pre tending to be rough threw some insults in their direction but made no serious attack lyam ignored them then laughed shortly as soon as they were out of earshot that might have been me thirty years ago he said shaking his head reminiscently the smell of the sea became stronger and alaire knew they were closer to the bay lyam held a hand up signaling danger without a word the three of them took cover in the remains of a burnedout house as they crouched behind the remains of a wall ice covered and ready to fall at a breath two mounted dieren trotted down the main street several paces away swords there was no mistaking those uniforms the two swords a larger older one and a younger man perhaps a student pulled their dieren to a halt and looked around naitachal alaire and lyam crouched even lower keeping as still as possible their hiding place was not a good one if the swords looked closely they would probably see someone skulking there lyams left foot began slipping to avoid falling he shifted his weight to the other foot in so doing he inadvertently pulled it free of the mud and slush the sucking sound was terribly loud in the still night air alaire cringed he clutched the wanning hilt of his sword so hard it hurt but the swords just looked around without paying any attention to the sound evidently they expected to hear things like that after several long moments the riders resumed their journey as soon as they were gone lyam motioned alaire and naitachal to come closer they put their heads so closely together the steam of their breath mingled into a single plume were not far from the dock my men are closer to the piers theyre not likely to recognize you but the swords if they happen by again will be ready to hide he checked the street and declared the way clear along the pier were a few noisy taverns catering mainly to sailors not people who would know of the crisis in the palace or care even if they heard until of course whatever the king did up the hill affected them personally perhaps the arachnean sailors are here he thought if i listen maybe ill hear the right accent but this was not the captains destination lyam led them past these taverns to the edge of the pier a long shelf of stone constructed along a rocky shore with tongues of wood sticking out into the bay alaire stiff ened when he saw the three royal guardsmen standing casually at the end of the pier but then he realized that three men were not enough to patrol the area effectively not if they were expected to look for fugitives is this what they call sealing the port alaire wondered he had imag ined legions of royal guardsmen on the alert watching the pier patrolling the side streets in num bers but no there were only the three one of whom seemed to be halfasleep all the better for us alaire thought and for the first time he began to have some confidence in the captains plan of escape lyam led them to the pier boldly as if he was escorting a couple of sightseers on an evening expedi tion when the three guards saw captain lyam approaching all three leaped to attention the drowsy one visibly trying to feign alertness at ease lyam said the three young soldiers were clearly nervous apparently lyam caught them doing something they shouldnt while on duty relaxing any sign of trouble tonight none sir the largest and apparently eldest reported the night has been quiet indeed lyam said thoughtfully chances are it will stay that way the search for the renegade magi cian has concentrated in the tavern district reports of sightings have all come from there nevertheless stay at your post until further notice we are going to inspect the docks yes sir the soldiers said in unison lyam and his party of two proceeded unhindered it was that easy under the full moon alaire saw a long row of dark lifeless ships moored to the wooden piers apparently their crews were down below or in the taverns must be later than i thought erik should already be here lyam said but worry was evident in his voice then from a shadow beside them sprung a small shape erik grinned up at them spirits undampened here i am father he said with his highpitched voice the arachnean ship is at the very end its a schooner with a wooden lady up front his father smiled very well then lyam said shall we proceed gentlemen alaire should have felt exhilarated at this point but something was keeping him from any such emotion partly he thought this was because kai was doome but partly he had a horrible feeling that something was wrong with this escape that lyam had overlooked something the dock seemed impossibly long in the moonlight but the sea was calm with only a mild breeze in the air water lapped lightly against the dock in the bright moonlight he caught a glimpse of nai tachal clutching his harp his expression grim their eyes met briefly and alaire knew that he too felt impending doom alaire reached under his cloak and clutched the hilt of his blade again it was still warm then naitachal stopped walking lyam looked back with a questioning look alaire paused also turn ing to see what if anything was following them whats wrong captain lyam asked did you hear something this isnt right naitachal replied in a whisper what isnt right lyam responded impatiently naitachal shook his head i dont know a missing piece of this picture just a strong sense that some things not quite right lyam frowned glanced down the dock towards the ship then back to naitachal would you like me to go on and hail the ship again the dark elf shook his head no just stand here make no noise the four of them stood on the dock in perfect silence alaire studied the ships all seemingly empty aban captain lyam was impatient i dont hear any thing he said clearly anxious to get going our ship is near i think we should go to it at once there is no sound thats the problem alaire sud denly realized there should be card playing there should be drinking there should be at least a watch but all the decks were empty there was not a sailor in sight even the lamps for the nightwatch were dark no one nothing from one of the ships came a low ominous laugh all three drew their swords on an enemy who hadnt made himself visible yet did you really think you were going to just sail out of here without a problem came the unmistakable voice of sir jehan a moment later jehan stepped out of the shadows onto the deck of the nearest ship alone ah i see youve done me the favor of finding our young magi cian captain lyam decided to turn traitor did you lyam stood firm his face set in a cold mask of anger did you think you were going to maneuve king into a war with althea with no one noticing sir jehan didnt answer right away for a moment he looked doubtful unsure the reply must have sur prised him because it was some time before he regained his composure why war is the last thing i want with althea he replied bowing sardonically to naitachal however we made it clear to the ambassador that we would consider any attempt to leave the kingdom an act of war i suspect this is exactly what the ambassador has in mind right now you do not consider keeping an ambassador pris oner an act of war here naitachal said evenly jehan shrugged that was only a formality until we clarified the situation you made a big mistake by leav ing the palace ambassador by doing so you have implicated yourself in this sad state of affairs its not his fault lyam said i convinced him that he was in danger for my own purposes i assure you alaire blinked surprised at that answer the captain was actually trying to protect them jehan shook his head with mocksadness i wish i believed that i really do clearly you have betrayed the king but the ambassador is responsible for his own actions and as for you lyam you have neither rank nor friends to protect you you will hang for this alaire scanned the dock for sir jehans men no one if we made a run for it now sir jehan continued his tone and posture com pletely casual as if they were discussing some trivial matter over tea i must admit captain that you have done the kingdom a service by rounding up bot ambassador and his criminal servant this will save us a great deal of time now if you would be so kind as to drop your weapons my men will escort you back to the castle i dont think so lyam said whispering something to his son the boy took off running and vanished over the edge of the dock without a sound where are his men lyam whispered alaire was looking too sir jehan wasnt planning to take them alone was he behind them two royal guardsmen surfaced from the ships hold then two more from the shi jehan stood upon you make it difficult for yourselves sir jehan said indifferently addressing his men he waved in their general direction take them he said indifferently but dont kill them the two on lyams end charged and the big cap tain engaged them both handily alaire charged the one that came for him surprising him with his quick defense swords clashed in the moonlight alaire knew he had nothing to lose and took chances he nor mally wouldnt have the man he fought still valued his life and was clearly under orders not to take alaire took full advantage of this situation a strange sort of excitement came over him and he laughed recklessly startling his opponent considerably he thrust once twice leaving himself vulnerable both times in so doing alaire managed to slice the leather armor on his opponents right arm the pieces fell and alaire struck without thinking blood spurted forcing the wounded man to drop his sword his first instinct was to kill the ma no not another death instead he rushed at the wounded guard and pushed him over the docks edge the guard hit the water with a scream and gratifying splash alaire turned only to find that already there were others to replace him dozens more pouring off the ships like hungry ants the narrow dock limited how many came at him at once and he fought each one as they came within reach it was a downhill battle there was no mistaking it and he began to loose some of his energy and reckless abandon should i die now or go to this thrice damned prison of souls the impulse was to die now a clean death and not a slow wasting away trapped by magic he swung wildly with the sword leaving his midsection open then he swung again against three guardsmen who all stepped backwards they collided with each other suddenly leaving a space between two of them he seized the moment by shoving through them screaming a hideous battle cry before he reached the end of the dock four more guardsmen stepped in front of him bearing shields the wild sword swing wouldnt work here behind them were three more aiming at his chest with cross bows in his head a voice spoke urging him wait until the odds are in your favor then try for escape nobody ever won by dying he glanced wildly about looking for an escape there wasnt one abruptly his energy ran out and he gave up deflated he threw his sword down on the dock where it landed with a dull thud from behind him came two sets of arms one wielding a dagger placed near his throat the metal bit into his windpipe a sudden move and it would cut into a major artery for the moment the desire to live overcame his fear of the prison he dropped his arms to his sides and stopped moving thick arms grabbed his wrists pulling them behind his back shackles closed around them and the cluster of guardsmen pushed him back up the dock to naitachal lyam was nowhere in sight four guardsmen had surrounded naitachal with blinding speed the dark elf deflected the blades giving no hint of backing down its useless to continue sir jehan said lazily from his safe haven on the ship look weve captured your secretary give up while he still lives at the far end of the dock a score or more of guardsmen lined up wielding a mixture of swords and crossbows they charged naitachal when the elf saw what was coming for him he raised his hands and closed his eyes the guardsmen saw this and froze confused and afraid they must have known what a dark elf was alaire struggled against the cold metal against his throat a hand closed over his mouth hes going to raise bardic magic alaire thought knowing that naitachal was good enough to do so without needing an instrument it hadnt occurred to him to do the same before they shackled his hands for him it took time and undisturbed concentration to raise any useful power neither of which he had as the guardsmen attacked him the instrument still hung at his back but he had no way of using it the three holding alaire pushed him closer to the elf the knife biting into his neck a sudden sting of pain followed by the warm trickle of blood down his throat these idiots are going to kill me by accident if they dont watch out he wanted to scream what is nai tachal trying to do what sort of spell would get us out of this but he hadnt begun the spell yet hadnt even begun to sing a single note sir jehan seemed to recognize what the elf was about to do however stop what youre doing put your hands on your head or your servant will die right here on this dock eyes closed lost in concentration naitachal stood motionless the air about him began to hum stop it necromancer his eyes fluttered open just long enough t alaire with the knife at his throat the elf paused his black hand barely beginning to glow on second thought sir jehan said smugly go ahead and cast a spell raise the magic break our laws it would give me a reason to throw you i prison of souls along with alaire alaire bit into his captors hand and in the moment it pulled away he screamed no dont do it master the knife cut deeper into his throat more blood trick led down his neck the hand closed over his mouth again the guards surrounded the dark elf with cross bows carefully aimed in his direction he heard a scuffle then rattling shackles they hurried alaire off the dock to a crude wagon bolted to the floor of this was a series of iron rings they made him lie down belly first and his chains rattled as his captors locked his shackles into place he looked up at the sound of a footstep and saw soren the fat wizard holding a little wooden club powerless oaf cant even use a spell to immobilize me he has to use fetters a brief discussion in the suinomen tongue fol lowed soren climbed onto the wagon and stood directly above him then light and agonizing pain exploded at the base of alaires skull and he knew no more chapter stop it necromancer sir jehan screamed a dark elf naitachals instinct was to ignore a command any command especially when trying to concentrate on raising magic why should i he thought torn between complying with the demand and bla sir jehan and his men into the sea with bardic energy but this was suinomen and they were renegades and now both he and alaire were in serious danger he opened his eyes and saw the royal guardsmen holding alaire with a dagger at his throat they had the boy the game was over defeat and despair settled over him as he accepted whatever fate sir jehan had for both of them there was no way to raise enough power even bardic power in time to do any of them any good it looked like theyd even nicked the boy a bit already but he didnt drop the harp he set it down care fully so as not to scratch it and stood solemnly the guardsmen swarmed around him those who did not bring crossbows to bear on him shackled his hands and feet and pushed him towards sir jehan one of them picked up the harp holding it gingerly as if he thought it might come to fife in his hands naitachal stood calmly before sir jehan who remained on the ship he avoided meeting the elfs eyes he threw his men a black cloth blindfold him he said simply he said nothing as they put the cloth over his face its the king who i must speak with again i have not used magic though it is obvious alaire has if theres any chance i am immune diplomatically someho the guardsmen shoved him forward the rattle of a wagon or carriage pulled up in front of him followed by the creaking of a steel door they threw him into the back of whatever had arrived and he landed in a heap on a cold iron floor theres someone in here with me he sensed behind him the door slammed shut followed by the sound of a key turning a lock they started off immediately as the dark elf strug gled to sit up in the lurching wagon strong hands assisted him and when he was sitting against the wall someone pulled the blindfold off his face lyam naitachal whispered even in the darkness of their moving prison he saw the captains outline there were windows on three sides of the iron box which allowed moonlight and cold in they took alaire in another wagon lyam said dismally the swords have him now i think my son got away before the troops moved in i can only hope lyam looked directly at the dark elf his face full of apology im sorry i got you into this i had no ide jehan was this clever nor i naitachal said i admit we are running out of options but as long as i still breathe all is not lost lyams look was of disbelief no he said wearily running a hand through grimy tousled hair his own shackles clanked loudly against his chest what options have we left naitachal glanced out the back of the wagon a hundred or so royal guardsmen were following closely behind on dieren a shifting moving thunder ing shadow blanketing the road i dont suppose picking that lock would be very productive he no lyam admitted i think someone might notice this would be amusing if our deaths werent immi nent it seems odd they would shackle us and then not chain us to something else they know we cant go far with these lyam said had no idea how heavy these were he added lifting the chains with some difficulty you were saying options im still the ambassador of althea naitachal said stubbornly that must count for something lyam stared at him his expression was for a moment unreadable then his face broke into a smile followed by loud bellowing laughter oh are you now lyam said when he paused long enough to speak youve just been taken prisoner youre wear ing chains do you think it matters what your official office is in althea in suinomen youre a prisoner and a nonhuman one at that and what bearing does being nonhuman have on this lyam grew serious these days it means instant death usually elves fairies dwarves arachnids any one who isnt human simply are not taken prisoner they are conveniently killed trying to escape that they havent bothered to eliminate you already is a good sign i suppose naitachal leaned back against the side of the wagon and tried to think so what do you think is going to happen now any ideas well for starters lyam said scratching his chin thoughtfully alaires on his way to the prison of souls no doubt about that hes been tried convicted and sentenced already in his absence and lets see ill probably be executed hanging is the preferred method although given the circumstances sir jehan might arrange something a little more private in the dungeon it will depend on the kings mood a kai i doubt hes still alive hes probably already been executed naitachal was amazed at the offhanded wa captain discussed his impending demise then again this man was no stranger to death and your son the elf asked no one in the palace knows hes my son to them hes just another servant child he turned and naitachal a threatening look and if you tell them he is or it accidentally slips out of those black lips of yours ill personally kill you myself naitachal shrugged deciding not to take offense at the remark what i meant is how can he help us help against the royal guard or the swords lyam uttered a short humorless laugh not im afraid hes only thirteen the place were going to is quite secure but the boy has surprised me before he might again they rode in silence for some time the cold creep ing into the wagon chilling the elf to the bone prison of souls has anyone ever broken the spell before the incarceration spell lyam asked and consid ered it theres no breaking it not before it wears off its been tried believe me by bardic magic naitachal countered lyam considered this carefully before answering to my knowledge that has never been attempted but then bards have never been allowed in suino men theyve always been turned back at the border not this time perhaps we will have that chance to try bardic magic naitachal thought seeing a slight glimmer of hope in the situation no one knows that we are bards they think that i am a necromancer and the boy is my apprentice their spells may not be ready for our power alaire has invoked the magic once already when he brought kai back can he do it again to save his own hide can i under armed escort naitachal and lyam were introduced to their new quarters in the palace dun geon the elf had expected dirt floors but these were lined with stone and mortar and had no furniture in the center of their cell was a large iron loop to which their shackles were padlocked one of the guards adjusted his shackles so that he didnt have free move ment of his hands this was unfortunate since the padlocks were simple and easily picked if his arms hadnt been pulled so tightly behind him i still might be able to do something though the dungeon cells were built in a semicircle fac ing a group of guards stationed at a table naitachal counted four guards with a fifth who went on a walk ing watch shortly after they arrived they put lyam in a cell opposite his chaining him to the floor in the same fashion the elf had hoped they would be close enough to assist each other out of the shackles but this was not to be in the cell directly between the two naitachal saw another prisoner prince lyam exclaimed youre still here kai was crestfallen when he saw who his two pri sonmates were aye im here all right he said his words empty without hope since youre here that must mean alaires captured im afraid so lyam said sir jehan had us followed i suspect something gave us away at any rate he was waiting for us at the docks we didnt have a chance kai turned his gaze on naitachal obviously dread ing the next question is alaire in the pris souls naitachal didnt know how to answer kai clearly cared far more for the bardling than the elf had expected in fact he was surprised the princes own situation was grim yet he was worried about alaire kai moved closer glancing at the table of guards who had brought out flagons of wine and were playing cards they were paying no attention to their prisoners naitachal chose his words carefully i was blind folded so i didnt see what became of him according to lyam the swords took him thats all we really know you dont have to sweeten the answer for me i know whats happened to him and its all my fault tears welled in kais eyes and a drop splashed on the rock floor he did it to save my life yes he told me naitachal said simply but you mustnt blame yourself something like this was likely to happen to us given the situation we walked into id known a fraction of what i have learned abou jehan and his machinations i would have ask king to send someone a little more skilled in difficult diplomatic situations than i or i would have asked him to send a practicing necromancer someone who would not have hesitated for a moment to strike these people dead with a single spell i wish i had acted sooner lyam said sir jehan had this entire plot in motion by the time i decided to do something you knew this was about to happen kai said incredulously then why didnt you tell me i tried a couple of times lyam said softly but you had other things to do you didnt seem too con cerned with the affairs of the kingdom at the time crestfallen kai looked down studying the floor i suppose youre right i had no idea how selfish i was too busy getting drunk and fooling around with women i should have seen it myself how that man played me like a fine instrument the same way hes playing my father if only father would come down if he would listen to me but its too late for all of that lyam looked like he was about to disagree then apparently thought twice about it perhaps it is he conceded his shoulders sagging with d a guard entered the dungeon whispered some thing urgently to the four others at once they gathered up the cards and wine and stashed it all away in a hurry whats going on over there naitachal asked maybe its sir jehan coming down here to gloat or perhaps he wants one last wheedle for informati althea before he executes us all two more guards each wearing an elaborate uni form more suitable for the kings chambers looked around the dungeon carefully before whispering to someone unseen in the outer corridor kai looked up from his sitting position in time to see his father archenomen cautiously enter the dungeon kai leaped to his feet the chains rattling loudly around him the boy opened his mouth to speak but nothing cam naitachal also got to his feet as did lyam no one spoke as the king approached the cells his footsteps echoing loudly in the dungeon there was something peculiar about this visit the guards who were watching them seemed rather disturbed that the king was present while the kings personal guards glanced at them suspiciously did they listen to us are the kings personal guards beginning to notice something wrong are they starting to see what jehan is doing naitachal thought hopefully the king first went to lyams cell sir jehan claimed that you were trying to overthrow me by tak ing control of the guard the king said sounding a little surprised he also denied that he had taken you and the ambassador prisoner he said you were still at large yet here you both are king archenomen turned to look at the ambassa dor naitachal bowed respectfully but said nothing he turned back to lyam what exactly is going on here captain lyam cleared his throat if i may speak freely majesty sir jehan is conspiring to start a war althea i suspect he may be plotting to overthrow you in the confusion that such a war would engender the king shook his head bewildered naitachal was beginning to feel confused himself there seemed to be two archenomens or possibly more one was a simpleminded man who believed every thing jehan told him one was a frightened child cringing at every hint of magic one was a shrewd ruler and one a senile old man who could not remem ber what was happening from day to day archenomen was real all of them or none right now it seemed to be a combination of the simpleton and the child but that makes no s lyam he has everything he could want lyam replied carefully no your majesty he does not he doesnt have the throne kai was quite correct in saying that assassins were sent to kill him and alaire one struck a fatal blow to your son alaire raised magic in order to save his life kai was not trying to raise an army of wizards to defeat you these were all clever stories by sir jehan to appeal to your fears and to turn you against your son i admit kai has been less than responsible in the last several months but he is far from being the traitor sir jehan would have you believe the king went to his sons cell looked through the bars at him naitachal began to hope there was more intelligence in the kings eyes than he had seen in a long time and he began to remember certain drugs that could befuddle even the wisest man had jehan been drugging the king is this true son the king said softly kai swallowed but looked his father in the eye yes father sir jehan is the traitor look at what hes done so far in a single evening hes assured a war althea and discredited me in the process im out of the way now his voice dropped to a whisper and he walked as far to his father as the chains would allow who do you think is next the king looked away visibly disturbed by his sons words kai continued i know that i havent been much of a son i am very sorry that ive humiliated you this is unforgivable i know but please give me another chance i can make you proud of me i know i can the king gazed at his son fondly then gradually his face broke into a broad toothy smile i know you can too this time i think i believe you for one thing you dont reek of ale thats a start the king stepped back from his sons cell and addressed all three captives i dont know tha jehan is a traitor but it seems that you are in prison under less than legitimate pretenses until we resolve this matter i think you should all be set free at last he went to naitachal ambassador i am embarrassed beyond measure by all of this i had no idea you were to be imprisoned here it was sir jehans idea to confine you to the palace not mine i allowed him to persuade me you were plotting a war against us i have just learned that the information regarding the althean forces massing on our border is false and it is beginning to look as if sir jehan fabri cated the whole story as long as i am king there will be no war with your fine kingdom you are free to leave and do as you wish and i will see to it that your secretary is pardoned immediately naitachal bowed graciously watching the kings face yes there definitely was more sense in the mans eyes i believe alaire my secretary has been taken to the prison of souls i suspect they may be in the proc ess of incarcerating him as we speak the kings face flushed crimson with anger and i wasnt notified he turned to the guards milling about by the corridor why wasnt i notified it is sui nomen law no answer came from the guards who stared stu pidly at the king apparently at a complete loss of words release these three immediately the king roared have them escorted to my chambers we have a very great deal to talk about at this fine example of royal rage naitachal expected the guards to leap into action but the guards did nothing averting their eyes one began slithering towards the corridor the king marched over to the largest guard his face directly in front of his the guard looked terr release these men immediately or i will personally skin you alive with a butter knife the man gulped looked down at his boots i would be most happy to your majesty but you see we dont have the key sir jehan does hes lying kai shrieked sir jehan was never down here one of them has the key is this true the king said do you have the key i believe the rules require the attending jailer to have the key to all the cells which one of you has it naitachal had a sinking feeling that they wouldnt be leaving the cells for a while after all what kind of game are they playing with the king now are they that certain sir jehan has complete control of suino men or are they under a spell cast by soren and his incompetents naitachal studied the guards now for the first time indeed they had a glassy sort of dazed look but then so did most of the natives here he couldnt know for certain without closer observ which didnt seem to be forthcoming since the key was still missing ill return with the keys to this horrid place king said i think i know where there are some spares kept he glared at the guards before leaving and you may even live to regret this his two personal guards followed him out of the dungeon into the cor ridor naitachal wondered if they would ever again see the king alive now that he knew what sir jehans intentions probably were he would soon learn who was still loyal and who wasnt whoever had the most men would win shortly after the king left there was a brief hushed conference among the remaining guards afterwards they all left except one a small frail man who stayed at the table eying naitachal and lyam nervously this doesnt look good lyam said from his cell those men have already turned against the king one of them im sure had the keys you know ambassador if you wanted to work some magic to make that pitiful little guard over there come up with a way to let us out i doubt very seriously the king would have you prosecuted good idea naitachal said turning his eye on the remaining guard come over here little man i would like to talk to you the guard yelled youll be working no hellish magic on me and fled the dungeon naitachal heard his running steps fading down the corridor well so much for that lyam said i guess well wait until the king returns or somebody else i dont particularly like the idea of waiting it might not be the king who returns first naitachal thought for a long moment captain are you certain theres no other way out of these cells some kingdoms have secret means of escape should the rulers be imprisoned in their own dungeon by enemies lyam exhaled his breath in a long deep sigh that is a brilliant idea but no im afraid we never devel oped such exits in this dungeon this palace is however over a thousand years old there just might be before captain lyam finished the sentence nai tachal became aware of a new presence in the dungeon lyam stopped speaking evidently noticing the newcomer at the same time you wont be going anywhere traitor sir jehan said as he came closer to their cells soren was close behind him holding a wooden reed of some kind does he know the king was here naitachal thought as kai looked in his direction the dark elf gave him a warning look dont say anything he mouthed hoping the boy understood jehan smiled with one exception that is you kai youll be joining your friend in the association hall now soren stepped forward went over to naitachals cell and as if he was about to play the reed instru ment held it up to his lips the sudden expulsion of breath launched something that pricked naitachal in the leg he looked down and plucked the little dart from his flesh what have you naitachal began to say but the paralysis of the drug the dart delivered was already having an effect he crumpled like a wad of silk his body folding over as if he had no bones left he lay on the dungeon floor spread uncomfortably across a length of chain unable to move i suppose the drug will kill me next he thought with an amazing lack of emotion but in a few moments it became evident that at least for now it would leave him very much alive whatever it was its effect was new to him it seems that jehan and soren are quite the experi menters with drugs this one and one they use on the king if it works the same on humans as it does on me it must wear off periodically as it did just now he tried but found raising magic impossible the drug had paralyzed his ability with complete effective ness even the power of necromancy was lost to him he reached for the energy the dark energies of death that once came so naturally to him but found only a thick wall blocking him in the few moments b soren hit him with the dart he might have been capa ble of shielding himself but a poisoned dart was the last thing hed expected bravo soren he thought in frustration what do you do for an encore naitachal observed the goingson in the dungeon passively completely helpless to intervene ca lyam watched in equal frustration as the four guards entered after sir jehan unlocked and entered kais cell and seized the boy the prince flailed with the chains helplessly as the much larger men pulled him towards the corridor as i expected hes not going to cooperate jehan said soren would you please do the honors without objection soren aimed and fired a da kai which hit him in his right buttock the boy yelped spat back at soren and then collapsed in a fleshy puddle much as naitachal had the drugs effect was total kai lay there eyes open panting like a frightened puppy but clearly unable to move the largest of the guards picked the boy up flung him over a shoulder shackles and all and fol soren and sir jehan out of the dungeon chapter when alaire came to wizards of the association were lifting him out of the wagon and laying him on a small flat cart his first urge was to struggle to try to get away but his arms and legs wouldnt respond in fact he couldnt feel his arms and legs all he could feel was his head pounding he could see and hear just fine but saw only what was in front of his eyes for he could not even move his head as they wheeled him towards the association hall he developed a sinking feeling why he was paralyzed and how it had hap pened theyve immobilized me with magic alaire thought in panic or with a drug first they rapped me on the head so i would stay still long enough for them to perform the spell or whatever they did the ball of fear in his stomach was cold and hard like a ball of ice what are they going to do with me they wheeled him into a great hall brilliantly lit although he couldnt see the light source wizards leaned over him their faces concealed by hoods a half dozen of them picked him up like a sack of roots his head lolled backward and from the skewed and upsidedown perspective he saw what surrounded him the entire hall was filled with wizards each holding a red lit candle another wizard was pouring a circle with white powder perhaps salt around alaire and the group holding him a strange monotonous chant began among the wizards and grew in pitch and vol ume until the entire hall was chanting the st suinomen verse the box they laid him into was of oak shallow and tapered lined and padded with black silk altogether too much like a coffin for his sanity he watched help lessly as they picked up what had to be the lid to the thing unable to scream they dropped the lid over him leaving him in total darkness he couldnt feel anything and the lid cut off sound as well as light he was lost in a formless shape less darkness he couldnt even cry out in terror his fear was beyond anything hed ever felt before there was nothing left to him but fear they were going to rob him of his soul and store his body somewhere they might already have done so he had no way of telling how long would he be in here a year two forever they had no reason to let him go he was not a suinomen citizen only nai tachal knew where he was and they might kil dark elf before he could get word home he could be condemned to an eternity of this darknes blackness became light his body melted away completely as if he were made of wax and held over a flame he had thought he could not feel anything but now he realized there had been a feeling of weight of solidity and of connection now tha gone there was no alaire anymore only a spark floating in the light and light became cold deep chilling cold it was the cold of a thousand winters of being frozen in ice of freezing blood of skin turning blue it was a cold beyond numbness but he could not shiver for his body was elsewhere now he was the ice itself his new body an ice crystal among several other ice crystals he could see after a fashion a revelation that gave him no relief instead to his horror he realized that he was one of a row of crystals lining a shelf with other shelves before him and to either side his vision through the crystal was fogged unclear blurred with tiny cracks and fissures on his surface these were minute imperfections and he was aware of every little flaw and blemish the terror ebbed and as it faded he tried to recall why he had been frightened there was no reason to be frightened was there not in suinomen why am i in suinomen he wondered then im from the south al althe somewhere south somewhere else it didnt matter here mattered and now right distant recollections of a dark elf a bard were somehow important to him in ways he could no longer remember if he could not remember them then they werent important the elf faded in his memory to a dark blur and van father but the thoughts slipped away like swiftly swim ming fish leaving behind only the biting cold and the vague awareness of being in a prison prison of what of where his identity continued to slip away in pieces like falling shards of glass until he could no longer recall his name who am i how did i come to be here what is here what is it was a moment later and an eternity it was both and neither fog shifting within ice freezing over his soul drift ing amid vague fears vaguer longings he no longer knew who he was or what he was captured in crystal the soul sought memories found nothing but ice and fog ice and fog and a fear that hounded him and kept him restlessly searching for someone something while the ice urged him to sleep to let it numb him to everything to make him forget completely he needed help for what he did not know only that he needed it he tried to call for that hel then piercing the stillness a sound a sound so sweet that it cut through the ice surrounding him so pure it could only have come from the mouth of a goddess the goddess called to him from across the ice sounding in his mind from all directions shes singing to me he thought with wonder sud denly recognizing the sound as song thoughts became a little clearer who is she he turned his attention inward away from the room of crystals and into the light the light sur rounded him then broke into a delicate snowfall falling around him with muffled softness the snow cleared parted like the parting of a thin white curtain the goddess stood at the edge of a large lake beside a tree that despite the season bloomed with tiny white flowers she wore a gown of white that flowed over her body in gentle folds like a frozen fountain and she sang a song of sweetness and power calling to the birds and animals gentle commands to do her bidding as she raised her hands the beasts surrounded her ready to obey the birds opened their beaks and joined her song with a hundred songs of their own a shaft of light suddenly illuminated him from above she turned to him smiled and began singing directly to him again this time calling a name alaire my son she sang and he became con fused disori son alaire the light spread from him to her it illuminated her clearly and he saw that this was no goddess but a mortal woman older than h mother she smiled with that identification came other memories and recognition she was performing some kind of magic anxiety for her overcame him she should not do this magic was dangerous is this why im here you see who i am remember who you are she sang remember what you are and sing yourself into being what i am he thought he had a name alair he had a mother he must have had friends com panions the dark elf he was a teacher he helped me become what i am what am i i will help you she continued with music with what brought you here you will use your music to break free of this spell imprisoning you imprisoning me how was he imprisoned he seemed free enough at the moment and yet the dim memories that flitted just out of reach seemed to argue against that i will help you she repeated i will help you remember when you were an infant there was a creek that flowed near our summer cottage in the mountains you used to sing with it gurgling like any baby except that your babysounds were music he saw the cottage a rustic chalet on a ridge of hills surrounded by fields of daisies and lavender he wondered how the woman no my mother was putting these things in his mind and then saw these were memories of things he actually experienced before in another form i wasnt like this then he thought i was a human a baby barely able to walk then when you were six we brought you a lute and then a harp and you began to play in the palace nursery he remembered more as the woman spoke and as she talked to him her story became a song and then she was singing to him about his past his hopes his aspirations and then you met gawaine who told you about the magic that went with the music and you began to learn what that magic could do he held tightly to the memories the clear and per fect slices of his life that now sprang free of the fight and cold that had stolen them with every memory came the hints of more and he used those hints to retrieve others and his life began to take shap his mothers voice faltered and she herself faded until she was gone and her voice was a barely audible murmur echoing in the distance mother no come back remember she sang a mere whisper of sound remember and sing he struggled to retrieve the words and the music and suddenly he did remember singing the song came from within him vibrating against the prison of the crystal surrounding him with light and warmth and millions of memories he sang as loud as he could until the song roared against the walls that held him here cracks appeared and then fissures lancing through the cold light pain lanced through him as well pain such as he had never felt before he knew he was destroying the crystal that held him but he also knew that this was not his body his real body was elsewhere and he sang a song that would make soul and body whole again ignoring the pain singing through it light and lightning vibrated around him vibrated until he was all pain and sound vibrating until his song reached a crescendo that was unbearabl and he shattered in that moment he was aware of each of the mil lions of shards of crystal that scattered through the room their size their shape their velocity it was as if his very soul had fragmented into all those pieces each with a distinct set of eyes and tiny chunks of himself were skittering hither and yon against rock rafters and shelves containing other crystals then darkness darkness and a sense of weight of being of arms and legs of head and torso the scent of wood and musty satin the feeling of cloth beneath his fingertips he opened his eyes on darkness and he knew he was back in the coffin again but now he was no longer paralyzed and he reached up with his hands and pushed the lid of the coffin up the panel slid easily off and clattered on the floor somewhere far beneath him every muscle was stiff and sore but he was per fectly able to sit up he looked around the darkened room seeing the vague outline of what appeared to be other coffins lined up on shelves suddenly the enormity of what he had just done flooded over him he had broken the spell he was free filled with elation he felt all over his body making sure it was real and not some kind of illusion it was real solid and indisputably his he was even wearing the same clothes hed been captured in now what he thought halfdrunk on his joy and half still in terror that he might be cast back into the crystal at any moment now i get out of here he crawled over the edge of the coffin and slowly let himself down to a cold stone floor naitachal lyam called over from his cell can you move yet it had seemed like several candlemarks sorens dart struck his leg paralyzing him the elf had succumbed to sleep for part of that time on the cold dungeon floor a shifting semiwakefulness that came and went but now the drug seemed to be fading after a bit of experimentation as his legs and arms flopped in crude approximations of what he wanted them to do he gained control over himself again slowly he moved from his sprawled position on the floor and just as slowly got to his feet lyam had been spared the dart naitachal sup posed that the purpose of the drug was to prevent him from using magic and not to physically incapacitate him he reached deep for the energies of his magic to create the most rudimentary shield but there was still a strange black wall preventing him from doing anything magical whatever was pre venting him from using his power was not the drug i can move naitachal said but i cant work any magic what was that soren used on me i dont know but i think its the same thing they used on alaire before they hauled him away lyam clutched the bars desperately his knuckles white you cant do anything magically naitachal shook his head not yet but the drugs wearing off if i pretend im still incapacitated by it they may forget to dose me again as long as im able to move i still might be able to do something any idea where they took kai the prison of souls lyam said dismally it sir jehan is incarcerating anyone there who might be a threat to him whether or not theyve used magic no guards stood watch over them now but down the long hallway from somewhere within the palace he could hear the distinct sounds of fighting shout ing screaming the clash of metal and leather the sounds were distant mere echoes down the hallway but unmistakable the coup was in progress jehan could spare no man to watch over them there may be another way something i was going to look into before we were interrupted naitachal said absently trying to get to the cell door but the chain pulled taut stopping him before he could get within arms length of it fine then ill look to that first he examined the padlock that fastened the chain to the floor it seemed deceptively simple but the key hole was curved and narrow nothing like hed seen before though large and bulky the mechanism inside didnt rattle around like the althean locks tichki had taught him to pick fairies you cant rely on them for anything he looked around for something that would work as a pick and realized how much he relied on magic to get himself out of fixes like these but before the search for a pick got too far under way a ruckus at the end of the hallway interrupted him king archenomens voice bellowed out of the darkness at the end of the hall followed by the clank and rattle of chains and shackles how dare you imprison your king roare king ill have you all boiled in oil every last traitor ous one of you ill have you skinned alive ill bury you in wasp nests ill see you wrapped in hot wires until you scream in agony and youre dead dead dead guards shoved king archenomen into the dun geon shackled around the neck and wrists the king struggled as three large guards pulled him along like masters leading a reluctant dog at the end of a leash his face was the color of overripe tomatoes stripped of his royal finery he was now shivering halfnaked in nothing more than a pair of breeches into the cell one of the guards said indifferently king jehan will be down presently the words sent archenomen into a fit of rage king jehan youll die all of you they tossed the former king sputtering and gur gling in incomprehensible monosyllables into the kai had occupied and padlocked him to the floor like the rest of them then they turned and left without a word naitachal favored him with a sardonic smile and despite the gravity of their situation he could not resist getting a dig in hard to find good help these days isnt it your majesty archenomen ignored him he raged at the end of his chain like a maddened lion where is sir jehan where is the traitor is he such a coward that he can no longer face the king he claimed he was willing to die for yesterday naitachal sadly shook his head he still doesnt understand does he the elf thought dismally was he so blinded by jehan that he thinks none of this was planned down the hallway he still heard sounds of fighting although these were a little more subdued now apparently the capture of the king had taken some of the strength out of the battle how many are still loyal how many are willing to keep fighting how loyal are his men how long do we have before were executed naitachal marveled at the expertise with which his magicusing abilities had been neutralized unbeliev able he had never before come across anything spell or drug that could have so thorough an effect lyam looked frantically from the dark elf to his king and back again the guards had left them in a hurry apparently to return to the fighting if only he could use his magic or even pick the lock of his chains archenomen sat dejected in the center of the cell oh what a fine mess this is lyam you were right all along i wouldnt have thought it possible before but that murdering oathbreaking blackguard is out for the crown lyam squirmed over to the bars as close t king as he could manage who does he have how many i cant believe my men have fallen in with him your men are the only ones who are staying loyal archenomen said despondently its the bodyguards the swords of the association and some of the consta bles who are trying to take control the royal guard are the only ones standing between jehan and my throne were naitachal thought dryly now that jehans troops have you archenomen there is nothing stand ing between jehan and the throne but you dont seem to have figured that out yet have they taken prison ers naitachal asked we seem to be the only ones in here archenomen looked over at him with a face full of woe and white as the snow outside the palace the only prisoners ive seen have been taken away t association hall that seems to be their stronghold last i saw the traitors had run the guard out of the palace and cornered them in the guardhouse these arent the only dungeons lyam inf naitachal then turned his attention back to the king tell me your majesty where are they putting the prisoners archenomen shook his head i think theyre going to to the prison of souls if not now then eventually lyam groaned theres a network of catacombs under the hall designed to confuse anyone who is not familiar with the layout that is the prison of s naitachal there are also regular prison cells where they could keep prisoners before actually stealing their souls and putting them in the crystals they would have to be using every last one of their men to keep the royal guard at bay naitachal observed i doubt they have time or peace for any involved spellcasting true i suspect that when the battle is over then they will start imprisoning the souls of those they hold captive lyam shuddered all my men archenomen looked around feverishly as if sud denly noticing his son was gone kainemonen where is he have they taken him away yes your majesty lyam said sadly i think i overheard them say they were taking him to the asso ciation hall no archenomen said they cant be thinking to im afraid they are naitachal said absently his mind busy trying to see some way out of this and wondering if there was anything left of his hapless apprentice alaire what has become of you are you even alive the arrival of more guards in the dungeon inter rupted his thoughts four of them wielding loaded crossbows covered four more who opened the cells entered and started unlocking the chains from the floor i dont suppose this means were going to dinner naitachal inquired innocently silence prisoner one of the guards shouted no talking youre needed elsewhere naitachal already knew where the prison of souls chapte alaire remained crouched on the cold stone floor lis tening for any signs of his captors he groped for a weapon but the mages had been thorough theyd even taken his belt along with his little beltknife he listened with every fiber but heard nothing but his pounding heart and his shallow breathing the room was as frigid as the pond in the garden and his breath fogged before his face in the darkened room a light source at the entrance cast a dim trian gle on the floor hard to tell what it was perhaps an oil lamp or a perhaps a candle flickering light made moving shadows all around him the only movement in the room since hed awakened well whatever is going on they arent going to come back for me right now i guess he relaxed a lit tle and straightened from his crouch well is everything intact have they hamstrung me or any thing i wouldnt put it past them but other than bruises and an aching head and the fact that he was still stiff and cold everything seemed to be in working order his clothing was still intact though he did wish it was black that would have been useful for lurking in the shadows the back of his head had a knot on it his neck had a slight cut on it from the dagger at his throat and there were some other slight injuries he didnt remember taking that were probably from the fight if they had done anything else to him he saw no indications of it the spell they had cast to take his soul however still fogged his mind he felt as if he had awakened from a very deep sleep as if in fact he still was not quite awake he vaguely recalled that his mother grania had reached across the vast distances separating their king doms and had somehow broken the spell that kept his soul locked up in the crystal no he corrected himself she didnt break it she inspired me to break it mother how in the name of heaven did you do that and where are you now he listened for her soft voice waited for her gentle touch on his mind but sensed nothing she was gone now as far away from him now as she had ever been he felt somehow abandoned and terribly alone naitachal kai lyam oh gods what are they doing to you are you dead or have they turned you into crystals too panic and helplessness over came him for a moment bringing him close to tears but tears would not help his friends nor would they save him he could not remain here forever first i need to cover my tracks he thought glanc ing around the dark room at the rows of shelves containing the coffins alaire shuddered at the reminder that a few moments ago he had been in one of them destined to stay in it indefinitely while his soul was suspended in that strange state of numb not being far above on another row of shelves he saw the crystals hundreds of them each one was about the size of his thumb each in its own little wooden cubicle suspended with wire the crystal seemed so much larger when i was in it he thought when he took a few steps his boot crunched on something the floor was covered with broken crystal he took his booted foot and swept the remains of the crystal under one of the shelves there were still some pieces left but he had cleaned up enough to fool the casual observer next he pulled his former coffin off the shelf and dragged it to a corner where he slid it under one of the lower shelves out of the next task was not one he looked forward to he almost decided it wouldnt be necessary but when he saw the big gaping space his coffin had once occu pied he knew that if he didnt put something in its place someone would notice i must have raised enough magic getting out of that damned thing that im surprised nobodys noticed yet then again someone might have and they might even be on their way down right now he paused to listen for approaching footsteps heard only the distant drip of water somewhere and went about his task with tightly controlled fear these people are not dead he reminded himself theyre only sleeping under a the coffin lids were fortunately not nailed on he opened the first one on his right and peered in the man looked like a poor vagrant passed out from too much to drink he wasnt breathing but his skin was a good color and while it was cool to alaires hesitant touch it was not as icy cold as a corpse would be in this place but his soul is gone he said to himself and shud dered he doesnt look anything like me keep going he replaced the lid and began a thorough search for someone who resembled himself he came upon one poor soul who must have been about seventeen with blond hair and a set of clothes that were a cut above poverty level this boy had a much larger nose and even larger ears but other than that he looked vaguely like alaire this one will have to do alaire decided and replaced the lid and then began dragging it towards the vacant space with a great deal of difficulty he managed to lift the boys coffin up to his former space and panting and sweating pushed it into place now ive got to get out of here and find kai for a dreadful moment he thought that his friend might have also been imprisoned here before he remembered the prison of souls was only for magi cians and kai was no magician he must be somewhere else alaire found a key ring with four large keys on it hanging on the wall beside the door one of them opened the door to this very room but he had no idea what the others matched they must go to something he thought might come in handy he wrapped the keys in a scarf to mute any sounds they might make rattling together and stuffed them in his pocket he entered the corridor just outside and found himself at the juncture of three hallways each leading off at odd angles candles flickered from sconces providing dim illumination wish i had a decent weapon those candleholders might be better than nothing but not by much he considered them then rejected the idea no i couldnt even pry them out of the wall since he had no idea of which way to go he picked a corridor at random and headed away from his prisonroom the corridors twisted and turned at odd intervals not really leading anywhere and not revealing any new rooms or chambers it was as if the corridors were an end unto themselves a laby rinth with no clear entrances or exits dust on the floor indicated no foot traffic had come this way for quite a while the footprints he left behind concerned him briefly but he could see no other way short of levitation of avoiding them and naitachal hasnt bothered to teach me that ye the first indication that he had made any progress out of the labyrinth was when he scented the most vile stench hed had the misfortune to encounter his first impression was that this was a decomposing corpse laid to rest down here and forgotten but there were other odors besides the stench some of old food and stale wine some of fresh food and some he could not even identify dead yet alive he was afraid to find out what this thing was questioned whether or not he really needed to investigate it what can this smell possibly have to do with my escape from this place on the other hand where else could he go everything else so far had been a dead end as he moved forward he heard voices from up ahead the stench worsened and his stomach churned the voices became louder clearer and he was able to make out a few words among the echoes and he recognized one of them sir jehan he stopped tried to determine where exactly the voices were coming from finally he got down on hands and knees and crept closer peered carefully around the corner saw that the corridor ended at a large cavernous room candles and an occasional torch illuminated the area there were boxes and crates bags and barrels piled everywhere shadowshrouded shapes hinted at furni ture stacked amid the confusion there were plenty of places for concealment and he took advantage of that he found a niche between two large wooden crates in an area that appeared to be a staging area for supplies and crawled in working his way towards the sound of the voices eventually he found himself peering out between two more crates at a thoroughly bizarre scene taking place in the center of the huge room sir jehan stood several paces away from some thing whatever it was it was not like any cre alaire had ever seen before shapeless and bloblike jehans posture was one of deference and alaire guessed that jehan was serving it in some way interesting he had never see jehan act this way around the king if anything the man had acted as if he were the royal equal of king archenomen an atti tude the king had never corrected while alaire was around but here jehan was clearly the inferior when he spoke his voice was pitched much higher than nor mal showing not only deference but fear alaire turned his attention to the creature jehan was talking to to call this a human or even human oid would have taken a great leap of the imagination the large doughy blob of flesh sat directly on the floor with a vague outline of legs at the bottom there were stubby blobs that could have been arms near the top waving and gesturing as it spoke a large dr or maybe a tent had been hacked up to provide some modest clothing covered it more or less though the drapery still left great flaps of bloated dis eased flesh exposed and it looked diseased whatever had infected the creature had spread all over it great raw pustules cov ered the body oozing a thin clear fluid that dripped down its sides and onto the floor a pair of wings dis torted and bent sat on its back and oddly they reminded alaire of fairys wings but fairies never looked like this could this have been a fairy at one time alaire wondered transfixed by the creature fascinated in spite of his repulsion what could have caused all this to happen the longer he looked at it the more he began to feel that this probably had been a fairy once a fairy gone horribly wron the wings were what decided him they were of that peculiar insectoid shape common among the fairyfolk who could fly about like mosquitoes with little assistance from magic fairies were also shape and sizechangers and could change their size from a handsbreadth to human height in the blink of an eye but whatever had caused this to happen must have made this size and appearance permanent who or what could ever choose to stay this way jehan and his master were clearly arguing about something and the words reached alaires ears slightly distorted by echoes but mostly under standable would have thought that by now you would have had things under control the bloated thing said after all these years of planning this i expected it to go smoothly and quickly but no youre still fighting the kings men even though you have the king in cus tody why are they resisting what makes them think they can win answer me sir jehan shifted from foot to foot uneasily wring ing his hands timidly holding a single finger up as if to silence the creature the king the ambassador captain of the guard are all on their way over here as we speak that twicedamned magician secretary of theirs is in the prison of souls now his companion the prince will soon join him prince kainemonen is chained up in the extra cells on this level awaiting incarceration in the matrix these things take queen carlotta soon they will all be in the pris souls and the magical power there will be twice what it is now the mention of the things name took alaire aback did sir jehan call it carlotta where have i heard that name before i know its important but i just cant quite plac if the young magician is incarcerated there now then why cant i feel any increase in power the bloated thing hissed it attempted to fold its arms resolutely but the clumsy attempt was more comical than regal it lost its precarious balance and nearly tee tered over in fact i felt a decrease a moment ago are you sure you know what youre doing were you certain this was a magician certain and soren swears he is a bard too the creature hissed again turning several different colors with rage a bard i hate bards a bard is responsible for doing this to me then it fell into place this is carlotta the sist king amber naitachal was part of the group that thwarted her plan to take the throne from her brother a long time ago long before king reynard kevin the bardling and naitachals student performed the spell that unmade her human form and returned her to her fairy status but that unmaking didnt do this to her there must be more to it than that yes i know sir jehan said solemnly there is a surprise ive been saving for you perhaps it will please you to know that the ambassador from althea is none other than the necromancer dark elf naitachal soon he will be here and you will be able to do with him what you will the blob was silent for several long moments then obscene cackling laughter poured from the things mouth you jest carlotta said naitachal cap tured here yes he is sir jehan said quickly i knew youd be pleased indeed carlotta said but why didnt you tell me that before seven hells bedamned youve withheld information from me again oh but it was only meant to be a little surprise sir jehan said quickly in a panic certainly there was no harm perhaps not carlotta said unable to keep the glee from her voice when will they be here i must know momentarily sir jehan said i sent my men over some time ago carlotta let loose another peal of obscene laughter and rocked back and forth on the enormous buttocks waving her hands cackling like some kind of disgust ing perversion of a nursery toy apparently this substituted for jumping about for joy the sight alaires stomach churn but he was too fascinated to look away ever since his bardling student kevin unma ive wanted to get even she said in a selfsatisfied tone they turned me back into a fairy and all i could do was flee they spoiled the very plan that would have made me queen of althea centuries ago and ever since ive had to hide here id almost forg naitachal would still be alive he would be the only survivor of that pathetic little group and hes coming here to see me how wonderful sir jehan was smiling and nodding nervously glanc ing around himself as if looking for unseen intruders alaire crouched still further into the shadows praying that he wouldnt be seen the blob continued you know your grandf was not as stupid as you are he knew a good deal when he saw it he had the vision to form the magi cians association as soon as i suggested it to him but perhaps that is only to be expected he was after all a mage and you have nothing in the way of magical abilities you dont even know if youve really impris oned a bard in the matrix jehan grimaced of course hes a bard soren guaranteed it carlotta snorted it was not pretty what does that fat magician know about bards anyway hes never even seen one suinomen hasnt seen one since i had your grandfather prohibit them from entering the kingdom how did this one get in anyway he was in disguise acting as naitachals secretary and careful not to reveal his true nature soren has assured me he is indeed a bard jehan folded his arms across his chest and tried to look impressive he failed carlotta snarled at him you should certainly hope so you and your little dog soren too mistakes are intolerable without my plan you would be herding dieren and this entire kingdom would be just the same backward barbarian bastion it was when i arrived and a cunning plan it is my queen sir jehan said ingratiatingly when grandfather eliminated all the mages except the ones in the association you proved that we could manipulate the throne as we pleased with your knowledge of drugs we managed to archenomens mind enough to make him turn against his own son now we are only a halfstep from gaining his crown and dont forget what this cunning plan was all about carlotta said interrupting him i dont plan on looking like this forever soren knows what hes doing sire jehan soothed once we capture the soul of naitachal after what ever torture you have in mind of course we will incarcerate him the king the captain and every other prisoner we have taken in the matrix even though they are not mages you will still have a wealth of power to draw from we can break the unmaking spell this time i promise carlotta seemed to swell she towered over jehan and alaire saw then why jehan was so terrified of her she might be hideous she might be rooted to one place physically but it was obvious that her power could reach any corner of this kingdom well you had better if i get any fatter or uglier as a result of these efforts it will be your soul that pays each time that soren cooks up a cure for this condition of mine it backfires if it backfires again it wont sir jehan squeaked cowering before her clearly frightened out of his wits i promise now where have i heard that before carlotta replied sardonically but she shrank back down t normal size with a sigh but now with all the pow ers of the necromancer and bard i think even that fraud soren will be able to break the spell so that i can resume my human form and powers secular and magical jehan stroked his beard nervously only a step ping stone my dear only a stepping stone a war althea is all but guaranteed now that king archeno men is out of the way we can blam disappearance on altheas ambassador naitachal and implicate king reynard thats all the justification we could ever need for a war and when we conquer that southern land i havent forgotten our deal carlotta said slyly you will be made king of althea then we will share the spoils but thats only if all and i mean all goes according to plan something about the way she had said that al alaire she doesnt mean to keep her bargain he thought not surprising she always was treacher ous your wish sir jehan replied bowing flamboy antly is my command alaire remained perfectly still in the shadows as the full implications of what he had just heard came home to him this is worse than i could have ever imagined theyre out for althea and it doesnt look like theyll stop until they have it jehan and carlotta did not seem to be finished with their conversation but alaire had heard all he needed to he carefully withdrew from his hiding place and crept back to the corridor in search of kai kais got to be somewhere back here he thought as he made his way down one of the halls they said he was on this same level where would they put prison cells after a brief search through the labyrinth alaire found kai the corridor turned into a secondfloor balcony overlooking a line of ironbarred prison cells kai was chained to the floor of one of these while four guards stood watch two of the guards seemed ready to fall asleep on their feet even so the odds werent very good alaire had no weapons and even with a sword two of these men would be too many to fight especially if they trained under captain lyam look ing down on the guards from his shadowy hiding place alaire considered ways to distract them ive got to get them away from kai maybe one of these keys will let me into his cell he peered at the chains binding kai to the floor saw the sturdy padlock there good so long as they didnt weld him to the spot i might be able to free him kai sat sullenly near the front of the cell the chains draped around him he stared at his captors the hate and anger on his face there for anyone to read clearly undefeated still in the game and fighting good im going to need him to get both of us out of there alaire thought if i could create a diversion to lead some of those guards away i might be able to get him out just as he thought that the noise of fighting erupted down a corridor alaire couldnt tell if the ech oes were contributing to the ruckus but sounded as if hundreds of men were clashing down there the guards started kai looked up snarling two of the guards ran off heading for the conflict the other two stayed but they were clearly distracted they conferred for a moment then before his amazed eyes one of them opened kais cell while his partner stood nervously outside watching back in the direction the noise was coming from alaire had no idea what the man thought he was about perhaps he meant to move kai to someplace more secure it didnt matter kai was ready to snatch any opportunity and he wasnt about to let this one pass he waited until the guard was within his reach then leapt he flung a loop of his chain around the guards neck and pulled it tight the guard outside had been looking down the corridor for that single vital second before he could come to his companions re alaire had already made his move he leapt down from his perch on the balcony aim ing for the guards back but knowing he was probably too far out of reach he was he hit the floor far short of the guard and rolled coming up in a crouch barehanded of course facing a man with a sword dagger and armor still he had gotten the second guards attention all right that gave kai a fighting chance with his bluff fool he doesnt know you arent some kind of barehanded assassin he stretched his mouth in a rictusgrin that he hoped was frightening and beckoned to the bewil dered guard come on fool come dance with me i love to dance kai had a good hold on the other guard and was clinging to his back like a monkey the guard thrashed about flailing wildly with his sword but he was unable to reach kai and he couldnt go beyond the chain wrapped around his neck the second guard glanced over his shoulder alaire made an abortive movement to get the mans attention back on him come on you lilylivered bas tard he snarled gesturing with his hands whats the matter you scared of a little boy he was dancing a fine line and he knew it he had to keep his man distracted but if the guard decided to attack hi there was a clatter a sword fell to the floor inside the cell alaire had a heartbeat to make a decision and he opted for the chance to get his hands on a weapon he dove past his man with his hands outstretched flying just under the startled mans blade he grabbed for the hilt of the fallen sword caught it and rolled then came up against the wall of the cell with a grunt of surprise a moment later he was up with the sword in his hands twoonone was unsportsmanlike but this was not a sporting event as the first guard spun around finally knocking kai off his back alaire swun but not for the chest he swung for the legs the man went down with a scream kai leapt on him and grabbed the hilt of the dagger at the guards belt alaire ran for the door of the cell and was met there by the second guard kai would have to deal with his man himself this time it was an even match sword against sword even except that this man was older and stronger than alaire and a trained fighter even except that alaire was not going to fight fair he feinted for the eyes before the man had a chance to settle himself the guard automatically winced back and alaire took a step toward him clear ing the door swinging again at the mans legs then feinting up at his eyes again he gained another step now he was completely outside the cell behind him he heard thrashing but he dared not look back to see how kai was doing kai would have to win or lose his battle on his own the second guard made a rush at him and they closed they struggled handtohand and bladeto blade for a moment then alaire let his legs collapse and dropped into a backsomersault catching the guard in the gut with his feet and flipping him over backwards trying to roll his adversary into the bars and not into the open cell door the guard slammed into the bars alaire drove both feet into the mans belly as hard as he could the guards eyes bulged out and his cheeks puffed with the impact alaire rolled to the side and came up on his feet the guard was still down but alaire did not hesitate he stabbed down even though at the back of his mind a tiny portion of himself was stuffing hands into his mouth horrified at what he was doing as he looked up from his bloody work he saw kai had won his battle as well the boy was rising from the guards body hand and knife dripping blood face white as snow they exchanged a wordless quick hug then alaire bent to the padlock holding kais chains to the floor the four keys still in alaires pocket did not unlock that padlock and alaire was forced to rifle the two bodies looking for more keys the sounds of fighting came nearer finally he found the key carelessly thrust into a pocket he fumbled with the padlock and the blood slick key and finally heard the welcome click of the mechanism opening he freed kai of the chains on his ankles and right wrist but left a single chain dangling from his left it made a good weapon and was one that could not be knocked from his hand kai snatched up the dead guards sword and the two of them turned toward the sound of the fighting they exchanged a questioning glance and alaire finally spoke whatevers bad for the association is probably good for us he said and kai nodded they started for the entrance to the hallwa when the sounds of fighting faded and turned to cheers and whatevers good for the association is bad for us kai replied lets get out of here do you know the way out alaire asked kai nod ded and pointed glumly towards the hallway alaire cursed and glanced around there was a stairway to the balcony he had leapt from and he grabbed kais elbow and dragged him towards it come on he hissed i know a place to hide at least back to carlotta anything that happened would be reported directly to her and anyone looking for kai would be looking in the opposite direction of car lottas lair right now hiding somewhere near her would probably be the safest place in the prison if there is any safe place here for any of us chapt just before they reached the lair alaire took a moment to pull kai toward him and whisper some cautions into his ear whatever happens whatever you see and hear dont move or make a sound unless i do he said cast ing nervous glances up and down the hall were going to hide out in a special room down here where the real power behind the association and jehan lives shes pretty awful but shes kind of a a cripple she cant move much and even though shes a really nasty mage she cant do anything to us unless she knows were there got that i guess so kai whispered his face mirroring his confusion where she is thats the last place anyone would look for us right right alaire took the lead again halfrunning his heart pounding and expecting at any moment to encounter a guard or one of the association mages but they made it to the room without incident and as alaire made a quieting motion to kai and wormed his way into the maze of boxes it dawned on him why carlotta had chosen to live in a storage roo because it wasnt a storage room at all it was a room full of the tangible relics of her power loot in other words valuable tilings she had probably had confiscated and brought to her and like a dragon she had piled up her treasures here where she could look at them and gloat over them every day certainly there was no other way she could enjoy her power except by having people brought down here to be killed she could not move from this place there was only so much food even a gross lump like carlotta could eat in a day and as for enjoying the kind of life and lovers she had enjoyed before the backlash of her attempts to break her unmaking spell alaire doubted that there was anything in the universe that could be induced to find carlottas hulk tolerable much less desirable alaire found a place under a low couch where he and kai could get a good view of the center of the lair without being seen kai started a little when he real ized that the thing in the middle of the room was alive and not some land of grotesque and obscene statue or a pile of garbage but he made no sound they had not been in place for very long when noises from another hallway indicated that the guards were bringing in prisoners of some kind alaire thought he was prepared for almost anything but his heart stopped when he realized the three battered individuals being hauled before carlotta were nai tachal lyam and the king that was too much for kai he gasped and started to squirm out alaire had to grab him and haul him back covering his mouth with one hand and whispering urgently that all kai could do at the moment would be to get himself killed finally kai stopped struggling and nodded and alaire took his hand away fortunately the noise the prisoners and their guards had made more than covered the noises kai had produced by the time the two of them had settled once again the prisoners were all arranged before the obscene bulk of the former halffairy well your majesty carlotta said her relatively pleasant voice something of a shock coming out of her hideous body how kind of you to finally pay me a visit i have been looking forward to this for some time tell me how did you enjoy my little gifts to you the king shook his head puzzled ggifts he fal tered who are you what gifts carlottas slit of a mouth stretched in what must have been a smile why my little cordial she replied pleasantly and my little tonic you remember the cordial you shared every night with sir jehan and the tonic you drank every morning on the advice of soren they were both so beneficial to you she attempted to cock her head to one side a grotesque reflection of a flirtatious movement she must have used decades ago of course your son didnt find the results so pleasant but you became so much more malleable to jehan and sorens suggestions after a while you wouldnt even listen to anyone else i found that so useful especially after trying to deal with that tiresome father of yours he wouldnt accept anything of mine she pouted another expression that must have looked very pretty on the carlotta of aforetime and looked so horrible on this monster that alaire shud dered the king was turning purple with suppressed anger and kai had gone quite white lyam only looked resigned as if he had expected something of the sort there was no visible effect of this revelation on naitachal but then the dark elf had always been difficult to naitachal had been bound tightly and gagged car lotta was taking no chances on his even humming anything alaire suspected and naitachal the creature said in a parody of sweetness how very pleasant to see you here i confess this was a benefit i had not even thought of much less hoped for i thought that i would have to seek you and tichki out all by myself once my conquest of suinomen and althea was complete of course it is a pity that you two are the last of my enemies still alive although i suppose i can take a kind of belated revenge on my brother amber by destroying his descendants that dratted kevin died childless mores the pity although in a way you are both his child and the child of his master she regarded him thoughtfully so you became a bard and renounced your former magics the more fool you naitachal you should know that the powers will always overcome the light to give up the greater power for the sake of the lesser is the act of an idiot she laughed and now i have stopped your lips and removed your puny bardic power from you you are helpless naitachal think on that for a moment but naitachal didnt give anything up alaire thought puzzled he must have told me a hundred times that you cant give up necromancy you can only stop practicing it the knowledge and the power stay with you whether you like it or no but carlotta had turned her attention to lyam ignoring naitachal for the moment and lyam good honest lyam you thought your spies were good ones did the king know you still kept your network of informers after he made jehan his spymaster no why how remiss of you not to tell him she laughed but your spies never told you about me did they so perhaps alaire never had a chance to find out what perhaps was all about for at that mo naitachal called upon the powers he had not used in a hundred years powers that did not require the use of voice or hands the guard holding him gasped once in a single instant of time the mans hair faded from black to white his skin wrinkled and sagged and he collapsed falling even as alaire watched in numb horror into ancient dust and naitachals eldritch eyes blazed not blue bu the bonds holding him parted with a crack he pulled the gag from his mouth with one hand and ges tured with the other and a sword suddenly appeared in it a sword as black as night that swal lowed up all the light and which as naitachal sliced into the torso of the guard behind him laughed softly when it touched the mans flesh naitachal did not deliver more than a scratch and yet the guard collapsed in the boneless way of a man struck dead on the spot gods a death sword alaire had only that single moment of realization because all seven hells were breaking loose at once carlotta shrieked and raised her stubby arms the rest of the guards recognized the sorcerous origin and power of naitachals weapon and backed away frantically lyam and the king took advantage of their fear and confusion lyam bent over and butted the nearest of his captors in the stomach with his head and the king slammed his considerable weight down on his jailers foot then cracked him in the jaw with a quickly raised knee when he bent over in moments they were free and armed and squaring off against opponents carlotta began lashing the crowd impartially with bolts of power until naitachal banished his sword and stepped between her and her intended victims his own hands upraised and black energy pouring from them and forming a shield between car lotta and the rest of her lair hes using his necromantic powers to save us al powers alaire knew naitachal had hoped never to use again powers that could claim him for their own and this time with no turning back the powers of darkness were jealous masters and both naitachal and his bardling knew how narrow his escape from them had been invoking them now could mean an end to his cherished life as a bard but there was no time to think about that kai was already halfway out of their hiding place trying to get to his fathers side to aid him and alaire could do nothing else but follow with naitachal involved in holding off carlotta and thus effectively out of the fight the guards had regained their courage and were trying to retake their prisoners alaire and kai arrived none too soon king and lyam fought backtoback surrounded on all sides by enemies jehan had singled out lyam for his own target and was proving to be no mean adver sary kai fought to get to his father with a singleminded ferocity that frightened alaire and a bloodthirstiness that astounded him all alaire could think to do was to protect nai tachals back from any of the guards who might think to come at him while his attention was on carlotta so he cut his way across the room and stood defending his master doing his best to ignore the flying bolts of power the dark smokes and the licking flames of the magic raging between them then just as he fended off yet another atta carlotta sent a lance of power not at naitachal but at archenomen and in deflecting that unexpected sideattack nai tachals own defenses slipped quick as a striking snake carlotta let off another bolt of power that penetrated his shields and struck him squarely in the chest naitachal fell without a sound alaire then did the bravest thing he had ever done in his life he stepped between carlotta and his fallen master heart in his mouth fear screaming along every nerve ready to defend the dark elf with his life carlotta took one look at him and laughed she made a single brushing motion as if shooing away a fly alaire found himself sailing across the room slamming into the wall so hard he saw stars and every bit of breath was driven from his body he slid down the wall helpless gasping for breath tears of anger and frustration springing from his eyes oh naitachal carlotta laughed her shrill voice clearly audible over the clash of swords you com plete fool you have been away from the dark powers for too long i am the master here i shall slay you just as i will slay your friends just as i slew that cretin that ohsoholy eversonoble vaporbrained white elf eli athanis only alaire saw what happened then naitachal had been broken defeated until the moment carlotta spoke the name of the white elf who had been his friend and in that moment naitachal became unrecognizable his eyes blazed up again and went from fiery red to lightless black he rose up his face a mask alaire shrunk back from in terror and before carlotta could react he crossed the room in a single boun and with a terrible backhanded blow to her face knocked her over backwards she lay on her back tiny arms and legs flailing in the air in what would have been a funny sight if nai tachals unhuman expression had not sucked any touch of humor from the entire situation and while carlotta lay at his feet in stunned and helpless shock he took a step backward and began to sing but alaire knew from the first note that this was no ordinary working of bardic magic in fact no bard in the history of the world could have produced this bloodchilling melody for this was an unholy melding of bardic and necromantic magics a so unmaking that was so terrible and so powerful alaire cringed against the wall and stopped his ears with his fingers weeping at the despair and fear it engendered in him nor was he alone no one else could stand against that song several of the guards gave up completely and fled the scene before they were overcome lyam had just enough time to knock jehan to the floor unconscious before he too had to back away with his hands over his ears kai and his father clung together tears streaming down their cheeks with the pain the song invoked in them and carlotta began to scream horribly naitachal took that scream and incorpo rated it into his song alaire hid his face unable to look once the scream ing began it sounded as if every pain carlotta had ever inflicted was being delivered back to her three fold he hoped he would never be able to remember this moment this eternity it was worse than the spell that held his soul in the crystal infinitely worse all he could do was to remember the song that his mother grania had sung to him and the song he had made of it he clung to that song while the other went on and o and finally c he looked up in the sudden silence there was no sign of carlotta and no sign that she had ever been there except for the tentlike garment that had cov ered her now lying limply on the floor naitachal turned he gestured and the death sword was in his hand again and the inhuman expression on his face had not changed he doesnt know us alaire thought fear forcing him to his feet again he doesnt remember us dark powers have taken him for their own again just as he feared hes going to kill us all he had thought that stepping between carlott naitachal was the bravest thing he would ever do in his life he discovered that there was one thing braver he stepped between naitachal and the rest of the room and as the dark elfs eyes focused on him and the hand holding the death sword rose he began to sing he started with the song of himself but this time he concentrated on all the things that naitachal had meant to him how much the elf had taught him all the moments they had shared laughter and sadness defeat and achievement as naitachals song had been one of unmaking this was a song of making naitachal paused his eyes changed going from black to a sullen red alaire continued pouring his soul into the song now calling on his memory for everything he had ever heard or read of naitachals life as a bard kevins time to gawaines to this very moment reminding him how important life and light were to him and how trivial death and darkness were in the face of light and life he sang friendship he sang hope he sang joy and then greatly daring he sang of eliathanis whose sac rifice had saved naitachal so long ago whose name had roused naitachal to his deadly rage he sang of all that the white elves believed in and he told nai tachal with his music that eliathanis would have perished in vain if naitachal returned now t dark he had rejected slowly the man that alaire knew and respected came back to naitachals face and the eyes faded from red to deep and vital blue again but as naitachal blinked and looked down at the sword in his hand his expression turned soulsick and filled with repugnance for what he had done with an oath he cast the death sword from him and it disin tegrated in midair time froze for an instant lyam the king and kai stared at the dark elf with fear and horror in their eyes those few guards that remained tried to crawl away alaire did not consciously decide what to do at that moment he saw only the agony in his friends eyes and he acted on it with sure and certain instinct he walked across the room to naitachal looked up into his masters eyes and placed one hand trustingly on his arm master he said calmly and simply you yourself have taught me that there is a time for making and unmaking there was no other choice the fear faded from lyams eyes and kais captain sheathed his sword the movement dr naitachals gaze to where he stood the captain nodded then said gruffly some times the only weapon you have is one you hope you never have to use it happens you move on and try to make up for whatever you did using that weapon naitachal regarded him gravely for a moment then slowly nodded i cannot bring back those i slew he said but at least she will no longer be working her will on the unsuspecting he turned to the king and bowed gravely the power that moved against you is no more majesty and the back of the revolt has been broken what is your will archenomen blinked as if astonished that this crea ture of power should ask him for his will then he drew himself up to his full height put one arm around his son and took on a dignity and power that alaire had never seen him possess before and only then did he realize how much of a shell the archenomen he and naitachal had seen had been i think archenomen said weighing his words carefully that we all must go and rebuild what jehan and his mistress have tried to destroy naitachal sank down into a chair feeling bone weary and sick to his soul the last of the association mages had been brought to him for disposition him as if he was any less guilty than they they had been only too happy to tell their stories of corruption under jehans leadership the tale of their duplicity was more than enough to finish the association and all it stood for there would be no more association regu lating mages in suinomen and no swords to enforce their will there had been a single moment of mild amuse ment when the kings guards had brought soren before him the chief of the kings mages had been blubbering with fear and not because of naitachal no he had been holding the ring he had taken at arms length terrified of it and yet more afraid to put it down when he had seen naitachal he had been incoherent with gratitude and had pulled free of the grip of his captors to fall at naitachals feet please please take this bbblasted ring back he had sobbed in the name of the gods please it ive naitachal never did learn what it was that the ring had done to soren but the man had practically been incontinent with fear of it he had plucked it o sorens nerveless fingers while the man babbled grati tude and pledged to reveal anything naitachal wanted revealed now he turned the ring over and over in his hands his fathers ring the ring of a necromancer like me like me how could he live with himself now more impor tantly how could he ever trust himself again and if he could not trust himself how could anyone trust him he stared into the ruby eyes of the skull they seemed to wink at him with sardonic amusement see they seemed to say your father was right all along naitachal the familiar voice broke into his despondent mus ings and he looked up alaire stood beside him harp in hand naitachals harp tucked under his arm master the boy said with grave formality would you come with me for a moment i really need your help with something more mages cowering under their bunks most naitachal thought glumly but it was something to do something constructive not destructive he followed alaire listlessly out of the associ hall and back down into the labyrinth below it odd he thought as wooden walls gave way to rock and the air grew chill i thought wed rooted all the mages out of these tunnels and there werent that many down here to begin wit but alaire led him deeper and deeper into the maze until at last they came to a place where he had not yet been alaire opened a door and icy air rolled out to greet them something else rolled out to greet them a wave of power the likes of which he had never felt before he stepped inside and naitachal followed all his senses suddenly on the the room was lit only by the lantern outside the door and the dim white glow of the hexagonal crys tals that ringed the upper part of it row after row of them ensconced in little niches and below the crys tals row after row of coffins he realized at that moment where they were and what this was the prison of souls he whis these were the stolen souls of all the hapless vic tims the association had taken master alaire said softly we have all tried to break the spell holding these people prisoner everyone from soren on down singly and all together carlotta was the only one who knew how to break it i could free myself because i knew myself but i cant free them he moved so that he could look directly and challengingly into naitachals eyes you master bard he said forthrightly you have all the power and experience that we dont you will have to help me and them it was not a request it was a demand and a rightful demand he had already pledged this in a sense what carlotta had done he must take a certain responsibility for he opened himself to the power of the room and sensed the pain of all the imprisoned souls there but instead of being excited by it as any good necromancer would have bee as my father would have bee it brought tears real tears to his eyes all the despair all the lost hope the tears he so seldom shed burned down his cheeks and as alaire told him quickly and concisely how the boy had freed himself he listened then reached eagerly for the harp he had thought he was not worthy to touch again alaire put it into his hands and he sat down on a stone bench resting it against his chest like a lover and it felt right there not heavy and unnatural a death sword had felt but warm and welcoming yes yes he considered his options reached for his and began a song combining both making restoring those held prisoner to what they had been and unmaking melting away the crystals that held them prisoner he lost himself in the song this time the unmaking blended in a bittersweet harmony with the power of making he sang until he grew hoarse and his hands exhausted faltered on the strings but then a younger stronger voice joined his alaires smaller harp took up the melody supporting the notes of his instrument and together at last they broke the spell the icy crystals melted away leaving only the bare walls he opened his eyes and saw that while they had been singing here the room had filled with people men and women of all ranks and classes and as those people ran to the opening coffins and began to help those who had been imprisoned within the boxes to their feet he realized that these must be the friends and relatives of all those who had been brought to this terrible place they crowded the room taking a moment to touch his hand in gratitude to smile tremulously or to drop a word of thanks there was as much joy in this room now as there had been despai no there is more the room warmed with it until it seemed to be no longer a prison but a pair of warm hands cupping them all the joy filled him and he closed his eyes again opening himself to it letting it wash away his sickness of heart finally they were alone again but the joy was not gone it remained with him still filling the bleak place where his necromantic power had lived and festered for so long you see master alaire said as he opened his eyes on the empty room you arent what you were youre more than the old necromancer now then the boy grinned impudently and i even think youre more than naitachal the bard who was afraid to make use of half his power naitachal had to smile still suffused with the joy he had found and he cuffed his former apprentice play fully and who made you so wise of a sudden alaire oh i just alaire did a doubletake that was so comic that naitachal laughed aloud bard alaire he exclaimed astonishment choking off his voice naitachal clapped him on the shoulder anyone who can face me down in a killing rage and remind me of what i am is more than worthy to be called bard he said and i will say that to anyones face as alaire beamed in delight naitachal looked around feeling a lightness of spirit that he had not expected ever to have again i think we have both been changed profoundly by this place young friend alaire shrugged shyly youre still a master and still my master no matter what but you know i would really like to go home now naitachal sighed happily thinking of his house his garden the view of the stars from his little tower yes he said with content home what a good sound that word has musical musical alaire grinned widely why naitachal do i hear a song coming on another dear gods boy will you have me play my fingers to the bone naitachal exclaimed and made to cuff him again alaire ducked and laughed i think it can wait oh noble master the boy said standing up and taking both their instruments like the apprentice he was no longer but there are a lot of people who would like to thank you properly then you can make your song after we are home indeed naitachal replied with serene happiness all things in their time that is a properly elven atti tude i think i might have taught you something after all and together they left the prison to greet the newly freed mages
