christian cameron poseidons spear prologue so here we are again last night i told you of marathon truly the greatest of days for a warrior the day that every man who was present great or small remembers as his finest but even marathon the great victory of athens and plataea against the might of persia did not end the long war in fact thugater an honest man might say that the battle of marathon started the long war until marathon there was the failed revolt of the ionians and any sane man would have said they had lost that the greeks had lost in faroff sardis in persepolis capital of the persian empire they barely knew that athens existed or sparta and i will wager not a one of the goldwearing bastards had heard of plataea i was born in plataea of course and my father raised me to be a smith but my tutor calchus saw the man of blood inside me and made me a warrior as well and even that isnt really fair my pater was a fine warrior the polemarch of our city and he led us out to war with sparta and corinth in the week of three battles and fought like a lion and died murdered stabbed in the back while he fought by his own cousin simon and may the vultures tear his liver in eternal torment simon sold me as a slave i had fallen wounded across my paters corpse and simon took me from the battlefield and sold me why didnt he kill me it might have helped him but often evil men beget their own destruction with their own acts that is how the gods behave in the world of men i grew to full manhood as a slave in ionia the slave of hipponax and his son archilogos and to be honest i loved them and seldom resented being a slave but archilogos had a sister briseis and she is helen reborn so that even at thirteen and fourteen men competed for her favours grown men i loved her and still do not that that love brought me much joy and i received the education of an aristocrat by attending lessons with my young master so that i was taught the wisdom of heraclitus whom many worship as a god to this very day when i was seventeen or so events shattered our household betrayal adultery and civil war ive already told that story but in the end the ionians all the greeks of asia and the islands left the allegiance of persia and went to war in my own house i was freed and became archilogoss friend and warcompanion but in my hubris i lay with briseis and was banned from the house and sent to wander the world a world suddenly at war i marched and fought through the first campaign from the victory at sardis to black defeat on the plains by ephesus the city of my slavery and then i fled with the athenians i served as a mercenary on crete and found myself with my own black ship at amathus the first naval battle in the ionian revolt we won at sea but we lost on land and again i was on the run in a captured ship with a bad crew eventually i found a new home with the athenian lord miltiades as a pirate lets not mince words friends we killed men and took their ships and that made us pirates whatever we may now claim but miltiades was instrumental in keeping the ionian revolt alive as ive told on other nights we fought and fought and eventually we drove the medes from the parts of the xhersonese theyd seized and used it as a base to wreck them until they sent armies to clear us from the peninsula i did as miltiades bade me killed stole and my name gained renown after a year of fighting we were losing but we caught a persian squadron far from its base in thrace and we destroyed them and in the fighting i murdered briseis useless husband again ive told this story already ask someone who was here i thought that now briseis was free to marry me she would i was wrong she went back east to marry someone older wiser and more powerful so i went back to plataea i worked my fathers farm and tried to be a bronzesmith but a man died at the shrine on the hill and his death sent me to athens and before long i was back at sea killing men and taking their goods hard to explain in a sentence or two my daughter but thats what i did and so i was back to fighting the persians i served miltiades i ran cargoes into miletus the greatest city of ionia besieged by the persians and we saved them and then the east greeks formed a mighty fleet and we went to save miletus and we failed we fought the battle of lade and the samians betrayed us and most of my friends died miletus fell and in the wake of that defeat ionia was conquered and the east greeks ceased to be free men the men of some islands were all killed and the women sold into slavery its odd thugater because i loved the persians their truthtelling and their brilliant society they were good men and honourable and yet war brought the worst of them to the fore and they behaved like animals like men inevitably do in war they raped ionia and aetolia and we the survivors scuttled into exile i ran home after briseis spurned me again so i went back to the smithy in plataea i began in fact to learn to be a fine smith but i had famous friends and a famous name i had occasion to save miltiades of athens from a treason charge heh ill tell that story again for an obol and as a consequence my sister got me a beautiful wife listen do you doubt me she was beautiful and had i not saved miltiades at any rate i married euphoria and a summer later when she was full of my seed i led the plataean phalanx over the mountains to attica to help save athens this time when the persians forced us to battle we had no traitors in our ranks and we were not found wanting this time the gods stood by us this time apollo and zeus and ares and athena lent us aid and we beat the persians at marathon but i told that story last night and when i came home my beautiful euphoria was dead in childbirth her newborn child i never saw it lay in swaddling with a slave i assumed it dead my sister still blames herself for that error but i have never blamed her yet to understand my tale you must understand i thought my child had died so i picked my beloved wife up took her to my farm and burned it and her with every piece of jewellery and every scrap of cloth shed ever worn or woven and then i took a horse and rode away that ought to have been the end but it was of course another beginning because thats how the gods make men you need to understand this after marathon nothing was the same no one was the same life did not taste sweet indeed most of us felt that our greatest deed and days were behind us and there was not much left for us to do and i had lost wife and child i had nothing to live for and no life to which to return part i sicily i see a greek ship on the beach and sailors who ply the oar coming to this cave with one who must be their commander about their necks they carry empty vessels since it is food they need and pails for water o unlucky strangers who can they be they know not what our master polyphemus is like nor that this ground they stand on is no friend to guests and that they have arrived with wretched bad luck at the maneating jaws of the cyclops but hold your peace so that we may learn where they have come from to sicilian aetnas crag euripides cyclops i was off my head i rode south past the shrine in a thunder of hooves so that idomeneus came out with a spear in his hand but i did not want his bloodmad comfort i rode past him up the mountain up the cithaeron to the altar of my family the old altar of ash and ancient stone where the corvaxae have worshipped the mountain since leitos left for troy and before i had nothing to sacrifice and it had begun to rain the rain fell and fell and i stood at the ash altar watching the rains wash it watching the water rush down the hillside and my life was like those ashes so useless it was fit only to be washed away lightning flashed in the sky the thunderbolts of zeus struck the earth and i stood by the altar and prayed that zeus would take me what a grand way to go i stood straight and with every crash i expected but the lightning passed me by it is odd i decided to slay myself and only then realized that i had neither sword nor spear looking back it is almost comic i was exhausted i had fought at marathon only a week before and i hadnt recovered and the cold rain soaked me my sword and spear were back on the plains below me at my sisters house where even now they would be looking for me and looking for euphoria to bury her i wasnt going back cithaeron is not a mountain with a crag from which a man can easily hurl himself the whole thing has an aura of dark comedy arimnestos the great hero seeks to slay himself like ajax but hes too damned tired before darkness fell i started down the mountain headed west over the seaward shoulder intending nothing intending i think to jump from the very first promontory that i came to or perhaps intending nothing at all may you never be so tired and so utterly godcursed that you seek only oblivion my daughter may your days be filled with light and never see that darkness where all you want is an end to pain but that was me i walked and walked and it grew dark and i fell and then i slept or rather i passed out of this world i woke in the morning to the cold the rain deep mist and to the knowledge that there was nothing awaiting me it came to me immediately my first thought on waking was of her death and i rose and wandered the woods and i remember calling her name aloud more a groan than a greeting on and on i walked always down and east and south i slept again and rose the third day with no food no water endless rain and cold i wept and the rain carried my tears to the earth i prayed and the skies answered me i thought of how on the eve of marathon i had dreamed of briseis and not of euphoria and i knew in my heart that i had killed her with my betrayal i was an animal fit only to kill other animals and i was not a worthy man death was what i deserved it may seem impossible my friends that one of the victors of marathon should feel this way a week after the greatest victory in all the annals of men but if you know any warriors you know the revulsion and the fatigue that comes with killing truly we were greater than human at marathon but the cost was high i could see the faces of the men id killed back and back and back to the first helot id put down with a spear cast at oinoe i thought of the slave girl id sworn to protect and then abandoned i thought of the beautiful boy id killed on the battlefield by ephesus while he lay screaming in pain and of the woman i had left pregnant on crete and of euphoria with whom i had often fought and seldom enough praised i went down the mountain looking for a cliff face eventually i found one the rain stopped when i reached the top of the cliff i couldnt see the base it was hidden in fog but the sun was about to burst through the clouds and even as i stood there it did a single arm of helioss might reached through a tiny gap to shine on the ground before my feet and dispel the cloud of fog below the cliff well apollo pointed the way he has never been my friend that god and i might have ignored his summons but i wanted only extinction i said a prayer i said her name out loud i jumped i hit water how the gods must laugh at men i had jumped into the ocean it was a long fall and i struck badly it knocked the wind out of me and then i became the butt of the laughter of the gods because instead of letting the cold water close over my head and drowning i had after all intended to die i began to fight to live my arms moved my legs kicked and my lungs starved for precious air until my head burst from under the waves and my mouth drank air like precious wine against my own desire i began to swim i was just a few horselengths off a rocky coast it was deep water or id have been dead but with nowhere to land oh how the gods laughed because now suddenly i was filled with a desire to live and my arms swam powerfully and yet there was nowhere to go but onto rocks the sea struck the rocks sharply three days of rain had raised a swell i turned my head out to sea in the fog and began to swim the change from suicide to struggle for life was so swift that i never questioned it i merely moved my arms as strong as any mans arms and yet weak from four days of no food and from the incredible effort that was marathon i was not going to last long but i swam drank mouthfuls of air and swam more and eventually long after i think i should have been dead i turned the headland and saw a beach at the base of the next cove a beach with a small fire on it the smell of the burning spruce came to me like a message from the gods and i swam like a porpoise twenty strokes fifty strokes my toes brushed sand i was swimming in an armsspan of water i dragged myself up the beach i lay with my legs in the water and my elbows in the sea wrack and kelp and strong arms came and lifted me clear they dragged me up the beach i didnt know their language but they rolled me over and they had serious hairy faces skin the colour of old wood and black beards i stammered my thanks and went down into the darkness that was probably for the best because when i awoke we were at sea and i was chained to an oar bench remember i had been a slave before this was worse far far worse but having been a slave before saved me i knew all the petty degradations i knew the perils and i knew the penalties i was chained in the very depths of a trireme as a thranite the very lowest tier of oarsmen air came to me through my oarport which was mostly covered in leather and leaked air and water in equal profusion when the men above me relieved themselves the piss and shit fell on me oh yes thats the way in the lower decks of a slavedriven trireme i lay quietly for as long as i possibly could because i knew that as soon as they noticed me i would be made to row but a man can only stand so much piss in his hair and beard i moved my arm and the oarmaster was on me he struck me several times with a stick grinning with delight and put an oar in my hands it took time for him to bring it from amidships he seemed to speak a little greek and i barely understood him but the man above me in the second deck leaned down hes a killer mate he said obey or hell gut you for a moment i thought he was talking about me rather than to me i thought perhaps he was telling the oarmaster that i was a killer hah pride goes first when you are a slave the oarmaster grinned at me took a knife from under his arm and poked it into my groin smiled more broadly tell him i know how to pull an oar i shouted instant surrender the oarmaster laughed and hit me im sure you are waiting to hear my friends how i recovered my wits rose from my bench and slaughtered my enemies well you havent been a slave have you any of you in a week i was used to it i was strong enough and there was food badly cooked fish barley bread sour beer i ate i no longer wanted to die or rather i only wanted to live to kill the oarmaster whom i hated and i hated him with a pure searing hate but i was a slave and he laughed at my hate he was big and very strong fully muscled like a pankrationist he enjoyed inflicting pain on us the slaves but he even enjoyed inflicting petty verbal hurst on his subordinates and the helmsmen and the deck crew i was ridden like a horse for the first week i rowed in the depths of the ship with water and shit over my ankles the smell enough to stop a man from work but even exhausted and injured i was strong compared to other men and that crew had seen better days after a long pull i have no idea when or where we landed i was promoted to the top deck of rowers the elite i who had commanded my own ship who could steer and make sail and fight the top deck was not an improvement except for the clean ocean air here i was constantly under the eye of the oarmaster and his minions the six men he used to impose his authority the ship carried no marines or just possibly these men were the marines a surly churlish lot they proved their manhood by tormenting the rowers it is a thing i have often noted how the stamp of a leader imprints itself on his followers hasdrubal the captain was a beaknosed phoenician from faroff carthage he was tall he was strong and he was a vicious bully he never gave a direct order rather he wheedled and manipulated when strength would have done better and then turned into a right tyrant when some persuasion might have served the trick he was handsome in a burly way and had the pointiest heaviest most perfumed beard id ever seen on a man well a man at sea anyway id seen such things on thebans but his bad command skills transmitted themselves to this captains officers as effectively as miltiades were transmitted to his the oarmaster was a torturing tyrant the sailingmaster was a weak man with a drink problem who knuckled under to the oarmaster in every situation and hated him for it and the helmsmen a pair of them both carthaginians learning the trade were young silent morose and bitter my guess from the yawning chasm that separated us you cant imagine i ever talked to these bastards was that the two helmsmen were better men just trying to survive under the regime of a bully and a madman for dagon the oarmaster was mad mad with power mad with rage mad with the cunning plotting madness of a longtime drunkard or a man who enjoys the pain of others it was days before i truly felt his displeasure i know now that we were somewhere on the coast of dalmatia rowing north i had gathered from talk on deck slaves were forbidden to speak unless spoken to that we had a cargo of athenian hides and pottery and some cyprian copper and that we were going to bump our way up the coast until we found someone to sell us iron and tin i was rowing when you are in peak physical condition it is possible to row for a long time while your mind is elsewhere despite despair and wounds and struggle i was sound enough to row all day without pain but my head was in a dark place considering my life my life with briseis my life with euphoria my life as a hero and my life as a smith i wasnt despairing it takes longer than three days to drive me to despair but i had started pretty far down and being enslaved certainly hadnt helped the stick hit me a glancing blow on the left shoulder off the beat the oarmaster roared his spittle raining on my left ear like fuck i said before id thought about it in fact i was dead on the beat my stroke was perfect the next blow hit my head and i gave a halfscream and sort of fell across my oar and then he hit me again five or six blows to the head and neck my nose broke and blood showered across me silence scum he roared at me do not even scream i grunted he hit me again it was an oak stick i must have made some noise or maybe not silence he said in the kind of voice a man uses to a lover and hit me again my oar caught in the backwash of another mans oar jumped and slammed into my chest cracking ribs i grunted he hit me again silence slave i tried to gain control of the oar tears were pouring down my face and blood he laughed you need to learn what you are you are a sack full of pain and i will let it out when i want to for anything until you die cursing me he moved around until he was in my sight line i am dagon lord of pain he laughed just then the trierarch came up i knew his voice already that needs to be said because i could barely see and you have to imagine i was trying to manage an eighteenfoot oar while he hit me in the back you are off the stroke he said teasingly and hit me on my left shoulder he was expert he hit me so hard i could barely manage the pain but he didnt break a bone i guess i whimpered dagon laughed again silence he said and hit me again the trierarch laughed new slaves are useless arent they he said the oarmaster tapped his stick on the deck he cant get the rhythm the oarmaster said a lie you lie i spat the blow that struck me put me out when i awoke i was the stern oar of the thranites the lowest of the low and since most triremes row a little down by the stern all of the piss and shit of the whole slave ship was around my ankles and calves the moment i groaned and shook one of the oarmasters minions threw seawater over me and put an oar in my hands feeding it through the oarport it was of course a short and difficult oar because of the curve of the ship rowing here was always a punishment even on my ships i threw up on myself of course and started rowing time lost meaning i rowed and hurt and rowed and hurt men came and hit me with sticks and i rowed and hurt we landed for a night somewhere north of corcyra and i was left chained to my bench while other men went ashore kritias a greek one of the oarmasters bullyboys came to me with stale bread dipped it in the stinking brown water by my ankles and put it in my lap i have five obols on this he said that youll eat it he got his five obols then i was sick sick with one of apollos arrows in me and shit poured from me into the water at my feet and i vomited over and over and i rowed the sun beat down and men above me died i was hardly the only victim indeed so ill was that ship that men died every second or third day so that after some more time i have no idea how much time but we were somewhere on the coast of illyria we landed and even i was allowed ashore we ate pig the slaves got crap but it was delicious and we ate everything that was the night i realized we were in illyria a party of nobles came down to the ship and i had the energy to pay attention there were two men and two women on horseback and they rode straight down the beach they gave hasdrubal the signs of peace and dismounted warily he offered them bread and salt and wine the two women were young and pretty tough the way all illyrians are as blond as the sun tanned like old leather in fine wool with gold bracelets the men were taller and older with beards and more gold jewellery their servants had tin we could see it in ingots brought by donkey from somewhere even farther north illyrians are a strange lot they have nothing but lords and slaves and the lords are at war with each other all the time they look greek they sometimes speak greek worship our gods too many of them know the iliad and the odyssey but they are not greek or rather sometimes i think that they are hellenes who never found the rule of law but i was not thinking such rational and philosophical thoughts that night i was too far away to hear any of the conversation but the style of their pins and their clothes their horsefurniture and a thousand other little details all made it plain where we were well while theres life theres hope or so it is said illyrians are the worst pirates in the middle sea and suddenly it occurred to me that if hasdrubal would just keep sailing up the coast an illyrian coaster was bound to attack us and the gods knew that we wouldnt have lasted a moment in a sea fight a twothirds crew of sick slaves and bullyboys as marines it has to say something for my state that being taken by illyrians who enslaved all captives regardless of social status was my hope we were tied together with rope while ashore and put in a stockade more like a pen with two armed men as guards when we were ashore this was my first time ashore since my first day on board it was impossible to keep us from talking yet to my utter puzzlement none of the other oarslaves would speak not even a word it was the lowest part of the whole experience i had never seen slaves who would not mutter who would not rebel in a thousand little ways even if they were too cowed to rebel in the ways that mattered the slaves sat silent every one of them with their eyes closed i moved from man to man whispering until a guard came into the pen i froze but hed seen me and he struck me with his spear shaft heavy ash he almost broke my arm he hit me so hard ill just say this as an aside that he raised a black bruise on the side of the arm opposite to the blow and it covered the arm it made a nice counterpoint to the ache in my ribs i didnt even whimper id learned better he laughed beg me not to hit you again pais beg me offer to suck my dick sometimes having been a slave before saved my life this was one of those times a man whod always been free might have had to knuckle under and been broken or might have had to resist and been killed i held my head and looked dumb he hit me lightly you know what i said he grunted i held my head met his eye and then cocked my head to one side he sneered not even your wits left eh outside there were shouts rage a scream he ran out of the pen and slammed the rickety gate closed the palisade was hastily built badly cut palings rammed into the sand and held together with a heavy rope woven in and out of the palings i could see my arm hurt but i got myself to an edge two other slaves came to look the rest just lay still with their eyes closed our guards were running full tilt for the central fire of the camp one of the illyrian servants was making for the wood line another was face down and experience told me he wasnt ever getting up youre an idiot said the thracian at my elbow make trouble uh said the other a greek never fucking talk when they can hear sorry i muttered skethes said the thracian arimnestos i said nestor said the greek he looked to be fifty years old and as hard as an old oak tree something was happening at the fire a woman was screaming we couldnt see anything because it was too dark but we didnt have to there was the unmistakable sound of a man being beaten with spear shafts blows falling like hail on a tent the hollow sound of a mans head and chest taking them and the women screaming they were being raped one by one many of the slaves went to sleep i couldnt i lay there and hated towards morning two more guards opened the pen and threw in the body it was a man and he was alive i didnt have to be a philosopher to figure out that he was one of the illyrian men although his face was a swollen pulp and he was covered in weals and blood and shit his own all the slaves woke when he was tossed into the pen he lay there bleeding for a long time too damned long finally i couldnt stand it i guess i wasnt broken again my experience as a slave helped me because i wasnt shocked and i was learning the rules sick as they were so i stripped my loincloth off my groin dipped it in our drinking water well might you flinch young woman and started to wash the man i gave him some water when his eyes opened they were just slits he punched me as hard as he could in the nose my recently broken nose he roared some sort of war cry and skethes pinned his shoulders and nestor rammed my loincloth into his mouth the guards watching through the palisade laughed fuck them i thought i had found a way to rebel i went back to washing the brutalized man the three of us got him cleaner and we dripped some water into him and when the sun rose above the rim of the world we fed bread to him too by then he knew where he was he didnt speak he was in fact in shock as soon as the light was strong we could see the bodies six of them the two girls the other illyrian nobleman two illyrian servants or slaves and one of the oarmasters bullyboys all dead in the sand with a lot of blood around them the oarmaster woke the slaves with cold water and ordered us to bury the bodies you useless fucks he went on to his guards can watch them and you can think about how im going to take the price of two blond slave girls out of your pay he hit a guard the guard flinched useless coward the oarmaster said and one of them escaped so we wont get all their tin and their war party will come your fault he screamed he looked at kritias if my contact here is killed ill sell the lot of you as slaves really you have to wonder that someone didnt kill him but i caught that im still proud i did neither hate nor shock nor the will of the gods plugged my ears dagon had a contact among the illyrians i must have seemed to be listening too closely he struck out with his stick and hit me i didnt make a sound the guards stood over us and prodded us with their spear points while we dug in the sand planting corpses in sand is useless an offence to gods and men an invitation to scavengers but he didnt care and the trierarch was silent and withdrawn we were down into the gravel layer under the sand and making heavy work of it we were digging with bare hands and no shovels when the trierarch came up stroking his beard a little hasty attacking guests he said his voice trembled he was speaking to the oarmaster but since no one on the beach was making a noise his voice carried he spoke in greek accented but clear enough you think so said the oarmaster he sneered dont be weak we need slaves thats what we are here for and now we dont have to pay for the tin he looked at the wood line besides you know as well as i my lord that his uncle offered us the trierarch spat we are here for iron he said primly not tribal feuds bullshit im here for slaves and tin the oarmaster smiled and well get more the same way epidavros has promised we let them approach as guests the trierarch said dont be weak the oarmaster said we need epidavros there was a long pause i had to assume that epidavros was the oarmasters contact why were the women killed hasdrubal asked the oarmaster shrugged my people got carried away he said it wont happen again see that it doesnt now i want out of here hasdrubal gestured at the ship theyre too weak to dig gravel with their hands leave the bodies lets be gone he paused his fear showing even in the way his right foot moved on the sand one escaped they will attack us the oarmaster shrugged his infuriating shrug i could tell that he not the trierarch was actually in command and the name epidavros stuck in my head theres a town of that name on lesbos i met briseis there once at any rate he smiled insolently epidavros wont attack us he said even if he wanted to itll be days before hes finished off their relatives the carthaginian trierarch turned and looked at those of us digging i want the men who killed those women to pay he said those women were worth the value of the rest of our cargo the guard next to me kicked me work faster motherfucker he spat he knew his turn was coming so like a good flunky he passed his anxiety straight on to a slave hasdrubal pushed us back onto the ship he switched any slave who was slow getting aboard and he ordered the oarmaster in a voice suddenly as strong as bronze to flog the last man on his bench and when that order was given we went like a tide up the side and almost swamped the ship the illyrian man could barely walk the oarmaster ordered me to carry him thus guaranteeing i would be the last man up the side and i was i was naked my loincloth lost in the night and he shoved me over a bench and caned me his stick making that dry meaty sound as he struck me then he put his head close to mine i can read your thoughts pais you take good care of the illyrian slave show me what you are made of the more you care for him the longer hell live for me he smiled and let me up he called me a coward do you know that pais so ill keep him alive a long time and show him what a man is somehow i got the illyrian onto a bench the starboardstern thranites bench that had been mine lekythos the biggest guard pointed at it and then put me in the bench above now i noticed that a third of the benches were empty the mad fucks were killing oarsmen and not replacing them all we needed was an illyrian pirate at worst hed kill the lot of us i really didnt care time passed i cared for the illyrian a little not really that much i had to survive myself id like to say the thracians and the greek helped but i never heard a word from them they were somewhere else funny that in a hull only as long as a dozen horses end to end i had no idea where they were they werent among the twenty men i could see when i rowed and the others around me were silent and utterly broken in fact one died he just expired and his oar came up and slammed his head and he didnt cry out because he was dead i managed to get to the illyrian in the evening when the oarsmen were rested and in the morning before we began to row we were off the coast of illyria now and we stayed at sea and every islet on that coast seen out of the oarport of the man in front of me seemed like a potential ship but our pace never varied and we rowed on and on we never raised our boatsail the small sail in the bow and we seemed perpetually in motion and we never landed after a week the food failed suddenly there was no more barley much less pig or thin wine the guards complained and hit us more often my illyrian awoke from whatever torpor had seized him and was given an oar we continued north i assumed it was north i could seldom see the waves the illyrian didnt know a word of greek i tried to teach him in grunts and whispered bits but he wasnt listening he didnt care and after a while i gave up the oarmaster came to him every day stood over him and laughed and called him a boy and a coward and told him that he would be sold in athens to a brothel but the illyrian was too far gone and spoke no greek so he endured the abuse another day he was told he was rowing out of time and beaten and then beaten for crying out you know that feeling you get in the gut when another man gets what should be yours that feeling you have when you hear a good man abused the feeling between your shoulders when a woman screams for help when you are a slave all that happens for a while but by taking away from you your ability to respond to these they take your honour after a while a man can be beaten to death an armslength away and you dont even clench your stomach muscles on and on we rowed we rowed all the way up the coast of illyria and dalmatia and men continued to die and we rowed without food for a while as i say its hard to tell this not just because its all so low and disgusting but because theres nothing on which to seize abuse was routine pain was routine men hit us and we rowed our muscles ached and we rowed sometimes we slept and that was as good as our lives ever were we came to an archipelago of islets and they had small villages on them finally we landed none of us was allowed ashore and all i can say is that after a time a dozen slaves and some food came onto the ship and some copper was unloaded and then it all happened again my illyrian was moved out of the sternpost rowing station and i was moved back to the upper deck and we rowed there was food that seemed good we rowed we made another landfall and were beached again this place had a readybuilt palisade for slaves and we could see it was full from our benches with forty or fifty male slaves waiting to be sold our illyrian looked at the beach and wept we were pushed ashore roped together and put in the palisade by luck i was roped to the greek nestor after darkness fell and the guards went off to fuck the female slaves in another pen i call these things by their proper names children and may you never know what slavery is we lay side by side and whispered very quietly still alive brother he said yes i said he nodded in the dark so close i could feel it more than see it good he said i was thinking he went on arimnestos is an odd name where you from where was i from may i tell you the truth friends i hadnt thought of home of anything for weeks plataea i said and it was as if a dam opened in my head and thoughts poured in my forge my wife the night she died the fire the pyrrhiche and how we danced it the feel of a spear in my hand you are arimnestos of plataea he asked by the gods he muttered im a man whos been a slave his whole life but you a gent ive been a slave before i said ahh he said and nodded again ahh thats why you are alive we ate better after that port we were also a lighter ship by the weight of our cyprian copper and we had forty more rowers fresher men who hadnt been abused indeed there were too many for the oarmaster to ruin them all at once and we had easier lives for a week we rowed not one man died that week thats all i can say we made one more port call none of us was allowed on the beach and we picked up women twenty women all keltoi with tattoos they were filthy holloweyed and the first night at sea the oarmaster discovered one was pregnant and he killed her on the deck and threw her corpse over the side i dont know why even now the bullyboys forced the slave women every night sometimes these acts happened a few feet over my head the despair the sheer horror that those women experienced was somehow worse than any of the blows i had received because it was all so casual they were used like like old cloaks to keep off rain and none of us could do a thing or perhaps what is worse is that we could have done something if we had been willing to die die without revenge die nameless achieving nothing our bodies dumped in the sea that would have taken a special courage i didnt have but it took yet more of my honour i was a slave then we turned south i was moved to a stern oar on the top deck and i who feared no man in war was terrified to be so close to the oarmaster indeed i was just a few steps from him at all times luckily he was mad so mad hed forgotten me and the illyrian both he hated women all women far more than he hated us so while i had to witness his brutal degradation of the slave women i was merely beaten occasionally as an afterthought tapped with his heavy stick when he was bored after some time by zeus the saviour i have no idea how far south wed come the oarmaster cut the throats of a pair of the women in a sacrifice he did it in the bow and i never knew exactly what happened but after that the other women stopped being alive that is to say they were still warm and breathing but they were dead inside a few days later they started to die the trierarch simply let it happen sometimes he reacted in anger and hit a slave but mostly he just fingered his beard and watched the heavens his two helmsmen said little from their stilted conversations i gathered that we were on our way home and that home was carthage and i began to learn other things i was a good navigator my best helmsman and friends had taught me well enough but the phoenicians have secrets about navigation and they hold them close they use stars and the sun all of us do but they do it with far more accuracy than we greeks now since marathon weve taken enough of their ships to enslave a generation of their navigators and we have all their secrets but back then there were still tricks we didnt know the aiming stick for taking the height of a star or the secrets of the pleiades and the little bear ah i see that the lad from halicarnassus knows whereof i speak but the helmsmen and the trierarch were careless they took their sun sights and their star sights a few feet from my silent back and they discussed their sightings hamilcar the younger helmsman was obviously under instruction and very slow i think i will never know that he was so deeply unhappy with the life he was living that his brain had shut down and hasdrubal the trierarch used him as his scapegoat every wrong answer was punished with a blow his every thought and opinion was ridiculed another week at sea and the new slaves began to be broken our rations were cut i cant even remember why just the satisfied voice of the oarmaster telling us that we deserved it we rowed another week but the navigational lessons at my back had begun to keep me alive they gave my brain something on which to seize and hamilcars obstinate ignorance became my closest friend because my understanding of the phoenician tongue bad to start with became more proficient and because hamilcar needed everything repeated two or three times three days in a row bless him one night the sea grew rougher and the wind came from all directions and after a while rowing grew dangerous a new slave below me lost the stroke got his oarhandle in the teeth and died his oar went mad and other men were injured none of us was very strong and the sea was against us and suddenly the bullyboys were afraid and they showed their fear by beating us with sticks and spear butts the wind steadied down from the north but it grew stronger and stronger we got our stern into the wind by more luck than skill and suddenly we had to row or die do you want to die you scum roared the oarmaster he laughed and laughed if you die i die too he shouted heres your chance rebel and we all go down to hades together you as slaves and me as your master the trierarch and the two helmsmen had three shouted conferences on the sprayblown deck that convinced me we were close to the coast of africa too damned close to be running before a north wind but the oarsmen were badly trained and brutalized and the officers were shit pardon me ladies and the trierarch didnt have the balls to try anything so on we rushed the oars just touching the water to keep our stern into the wind after some time it was dark cold and wet and all i knew was the fire in my arms one of the keltoi women stepped over me and jumped over the side i saw her face in a flash of lightning she was medea come to life to me that face is printed for ever on my thoughts the way a man writes on papyrus or carves in stone it was set with purpose hate determination agony and even a tiny element of joy she was gone before my heart beat again sucked under by poseidon to a kinder place i hope but something passed from her to me her courage i think right there in the storm i swore an oath to the gods and we rowed we took a lot of water but we werent lucky enough to sink about a third of our oarsmen drowned or died under their oars and yet somehow we made it the bullyboys threw the corpses over the side and cut the oars free too and on we went the morning dawned blue and gold and we were alive after that there was no food and only about eighty whole men to row and we were on the deep blue we rowed and we rowed and we rowed i should have been dead or nearly dead but the keltoi slave woman had told me something with her eyes i can hardly put this into words that resistance was worthy perhaps that i could always restore my dignity with death either way i was coming to my senses and of course my brain was engaged too i had taken to listening to the men at the steering oars and now i was interested hasdrubal talked about the trade about how the tin was no longer coming in from northern illyria in the old amounts and how the greeks were trying to cut into the trade from alba and that interested me he talked about new sources of copper down the coast of africa and up the coast of iberia outside the gates of herakles and i discovered from listening to him that africa was much bigger than i had imagined i had no crossstaff with which to try calculations but i used my fingers star lessons happened at night just a horselength at my back i was careful but i tried their sightings as i got the hang of their method it worked mind you it wasnt that id ever needed to do such esoteric navigation and if hasdrubal hadnt been such a poor sailor neither would he he was a fine navigator but a dreadful sailor we always knew where we were but we never seemed to be able to move from where we were to where we needed to be and a big trireme even a twentyoared boat cant hold enough food to feed its oarsmen for even a few days and nights this is why all ships coast they go from beach to beach buying food from locals whether they are a tubby merchantman with four oarsmen and a dozen sailors to a fleet of warships with two hundred oarsmen apiece the ironclad rules of logistika are the same either way but i digress after some more time i have no idea how long we came to carthage ill tell you about carthage in good time but when i first rowed that ship in between the fortress and the mole i saw nothing i was not really alive i was a human machine that pulled an oar silent unthinking at least by day the hull bumped the wharf the trierarch had the gangplank rigged and then he his two helmsmen and the oarmaster walked off the ship an hour later after wed grilled in the african sun twenty soldiers poieni which is their word for citizen infantry like our hoplites came to the ship and ordered us off many of us could not walk the phylarch shook his head useless fuck these men are ruined he spat came and looked at me he pointed at my legs my oncemighty legs were like sticks look at this one he said goodsize man filthy lice and hasnt been allowed exercise he shook his head hasdrubal is a useless fool sell this lot to anyone who will take them and with that he took the surviving women and marched them away that left another man in charge and he averted his eyes and his nose and ordered those of us who could walk to carry the rest i ended up carrying the illyrian i have been back to that spot we only walked about fifty horselengths less than a stade i remember it as being more like fifty stades it went on for ever oddly they never struck us and one of the poieni asked us why we were so silent no one spoke we were put in stone slave pens with a roof and shade there was water in which to bathe drinking water and a shithole i saw men break there men who had been free and were now slaves but for us fresh from hasdrubals grim trireme it was like the elysian fields we had barley porridge for dinner and again at breakfast and red wine so thin it was like water it made me drunk so i laughed and sang the paean of apollo i was the first to give way to sound after a second helping of that awful wine a dozen men were grunting at my song or my attempt at song we passed out but in the morning i found that the illyrian was curled tight against me and the greek nestor was lying against the wall with the thracian nestor looked me in the eye we lived he said quietly the thracian grunted now i said we need to get free both men nodded and the illyrian stiffened eleuthera he said freedom free thats what we thought my illyrians name was neoptolymos he considered himself a direct descendant of achilles and he was willing to kill every man who had even seen him enslaved his humiliation had almost broken him but after two days in carthage he joined me for my morning prayer to apollo in awful greek and we began to talk we were allowed to talk in carthage talk and eat they fattened us up for about a week we got cheap pork sausage with bread in it and green stuff i still hate cheap pork sausage they gave it to us three times a day and took us out in a tiny yard for exercise where we had to leap and jump and do foolish antics stupid stuff that any gymnasium would have frowned on i knew how to condition myself so i did proper exercises whenever i could and taught them to my companions the guards didnt care a little at a time i put some of the moves of pankration into my callisthenics they gave me weights i boxed with my shadow the guards took an interest but not much of one and it was a small rebellion the kind that means a great deal to the morale of a slave and that was a good thing because eight days after we landed dagon came into our exercise yard and ordered us to be marched to a ship it still seems incredible to me that we could have gotten him again perhaps his deep well ill call it a sickness for lack of a better word though i think he was cursed by the gods for something at any rate his sickness drove him to want to torment us again its the only rational explanation why he an officer wanted the same broken men hed just brought in we were marched through the streets surrounded by guards dagon took all eighty of the survivors and we were added to a hundred fresh slaves sikels recently taken in war who spoke little greek and had never pulled an oar as we walked through the darkened streets of carthage dagon walked by me he didnt say anything at all he just smiled at me and rubbed the butt of his thonged whip against my thighs and arse like a caress still makes me shudder and then he hit me with the whip the butt not the thongs across the temple and when i kept pace and didnt scream he laughed i think the sikels saved my life because they were so bloody awful that dagon never had a chance at me those first two weeks at sea he beat them raw and they still couldnt and wouldnt row he killed a pair who he said were fomenting mutiny and they killed one of his bullyboys in the dark we were ten days out somewhere on the deep blue north of africa and south of sicily and the sun was a relentless foe an aspis of fire slamming into our heads and backs the ship stank of excrement and sweat and fear the masts were stowed there wasnt a breath of wind and sweat ran straight down my chest and into my groin to drip onto the man below i say below because after eight days at sea i was a topdeck oar we all knew that kritias was dead and over the side slain in the dark and the sikels were waiting to see what dagon would do as luck would have it i was across the bench from neoptolymos who was on the port side while i was on the starboard skethes and nestor both by the standards of our new ship the baal shamra expert oarsmen sat several benches behind us but together id managed to exchange a long look with skethes slaves can communicate a great deal in a look and wed learned to tap on the wood of our benches we had a few rhythms nothing like communication but it could convey simple messages my look said im alert and ready his said me too my taps said be ready watch your slaves sometime honey they have many ways to communicate we pulled the rowers were tired but not exhausted and we hadnt been fed i had a feeling that the bullies were arming in the stern behind me although i couldnt see them and then dagon was standing beside me he was in bronze a good breastplate a heavy helmet he put the point of a spear at my back it was very sharp i dont want you to die easily lover he said with his usual smile but if you move i kill you suddenly there were screams the sikels rose off their benches and died seven men in armour were more than a match for seventy naked tired men without even the shafts of their oars i know ive done it myself the sikels fought hard for a few minutes while we on the upper tier sat silently dagon was behind me and above me on the catwalk there was no combination of moves that would allow me to rise off my bench and trip him i considered it anyway if the sikels failed i knew my life would become much much worse because dagon would have no distraction from me and because eighty of us his survivors would have to row the pig of the ship laden with african iron ore about the time the sikels began to give way to despair i decided that my life wasnt worth an obol i thought of the keltoi woman there just comes a point where either you submit and become an object not a person or you break and go mad or you fight or die or both i gave a great shout sometimes sound can throw a man off and i turned trying to get an arm behind me to block his thrust warned by my shout neoptolymos came off his bench and went for dagons ankles as slave attacks went it was a fine attempt but dagon foiled it by the simple expedient of stepping back then he whirled ignoring us and stabbed skethes his point in and out of the thracians eye socket in a heartbeat the thracian fell forward dead his blood running out of his eye in a steady stream like wine from a wineskin nestor didnt rise off his bench instead he kicked it was a remarkable kick i was around by then fouled by the two useless slaves behind me who were cowering instead of helping but the kick caught dagon in the arse and he stumbled and i was on him i was in bad shape tired arms weak far from my conditioning as a smith or a warrior and he was in armour and as soon as i had one of his arms i found out just how skilled he was he broke my armlock and countered it in three beats of my heart he had my left arm in a lock and had begun to dislocate my left shoulder the daimon of combat flew to my aid i put the crown of my head into his jutting jaw he had a helmet on but the cheek plates didnt break the force of my blow where a mans head moves his body follows and i moved him off his feet and nestor sank his teeth into the hated mans thigh but he wriggled like a worm caught me a blow to my head with his right elbow slammed the shaft of his spear into nestor and he was away from us back three steps if even one oarsman had aided us but none did he grinned i knew youd try lover he said in phoenician id have thought less of you if you hadnt and then only then did we all notice that another ship was coming alongside up from our stern she was a beautiful low trireme her hull black with new pitch with a long line of woadblue painted down her side along the upperdeck oarports and eyes over her ram her oars were beautifully handled the oars came in all together even as we watched i backed up two steps looking for anything to use as a weapon a boarding pike a staff for poling off another ship a stick what i got was a bucket a wooden bucket and the other ship was boarding us her marines came at us ten men in bronze with aspides and fighting spears and greaves they leaped onto our catwalk and our stern like experts and i retreated to the bow looking for a place to hide i didnt want to die at the hands of greeks i didnt know what they intended but i assumed they were greek pirates men of my own kind who would at least take me as a slave their lord it was obvious from the rope of lapis and gold beads at his throat to the solidgold hilt on his sword shouted at dagon and dagon nodded and grinned my slaves he shouted they rose against me thank the gods lord for your rescue the greek lord i now knew he was greek by the long hair emerging from under his helmet to the shape of his feet laughed i hate you phoenicians like i hate poverty and fear he said but we are at peace he grinned wolfishly turned to his marines and pointed his spear clear away the riffraff he said nestor grabbed his knees were greek he said master this man the greek put his sword into nestor tell them in carthage of the service i do for you he said and his men set about killing the sikels two men chased me into the bows where i turned at bay i put the bucket into the helmet of the first to reach me swinging it at the end of its rope handle and he fell without a sound the other man stepped back and yelled for help just for a moment i felt as if i were arimnestos i stepped forward and he stepped back and then dagon came up he had an aspis on his shoulder and his spear licked out and caught me in the meat of the thigh quick as thought ares that wound hurt and i stumbled he stepped back laughed and spiked my other thigh i fell to my knees as fast as i can tell it he put his fine spear point through both of my hands so that i dropped the bucket and waited for death he laughed you think im going to kill you he asked he didnt kill me obviously what he did do was to help the greeks kill all of the sikels on board then he bartered half his cargo of iron ore for twenty of the greeks rowers men of a race i didnt know at all i wasnt paying very close attention by then because he had me crucified on the foremast and spar my arms and legs lashed far apart the pain of my wounds was enough to make me puke unfortunately it was still early morning and the sun rose higher and higher as the slaves rowed us towards the shore from my new vantage point i could see the land a low smudge to the north sicily we rowed or rather i bled and burned naked in the sun and the men beneath me rowed and the corpses of the sikels stank dagon wouldnt let the slaves throw them over the side he insisted on leaving the dead men at their benches he trod the catwalk muttering and laughing and from time to time he would come up behind me remember i was crucified and couldnt see him and hed strike me with his staff or place the butt of it against my back or my stomach and just rub it up and down we will have such fun he said he used a pleasant tone as a man might talk to his wife and it made my skin crawl even in exhausted despair his tone made me afraid but the sun was worse than the mad oarmaster the sun scorched me i had never been exposed without water to the sun all day and it stripped me of everything except the desire for water and that was only the first day night fell and i awoke i hadnt been aware that i had passed out who is but i came to hanging from my wrists and the pressure on my abdomen and lungs was uncomfortable and the sunburn on my stomach and groin was painful and the wounds in my thighs and hands ares it all hurt we were riding at anchor in a great bay under a vast mountain aetna i know now even in the state i was in i looked long at aetna in the full moon and it was beautiful and i prayed to the gods that someone would avenge me i managed to pray for nestor and skethes good companions who had died trying to be free i had no idea what had happened to neoptolymos the greek ship was ten horselengths astern of ours i didnt see it for a long time until the tide moved us at our anchor and i caught a glimpse of her i began to pass in and out of life i cannot describe it any other way my life unrolled before me as if i were facing a jury of gods except that there were no voices no figures but merely the strongest feeling every time i surfaced to pain and the real world that i had been judged and then it was morning dagon came and stood in the bows and another voice called orders as the rowers awoke to the stink of the corpses seabirds came and tried the corpses a great gull ripping at a dead mans face can interfere with anyones rowing the bullyboys used their canes freely the ship moved and we went inshore there was a breakwater well to the west along the great bay and we pointed our bow at it the sun crested the horizon and my torment began in earnest now the weight of my body was on my abdomen my feet couldnt really support my weight any longer and breathing started to become difficult not really difficult but painful there was another body pressing against mine at my back it took me hours to realize that neoptolymos was crucified against me they say that if you survive three days dagon said your chest and back are so ruined you can never be a man again dagon raised his face and looked at me and then i can sell you to a brothel you wont even be able to fight a brutal client isnt that what you deserve eh i could feel it happening that was the worst of it i could feel my muscles dying the strain was gradual but the result was brutal and the sun by noon we were up with the breakwater and our charnelhouse ship entered the harbour and very very slowly docked at the pier a wellbuilt stone pier the greek ship came and anchored close in almost across our stern i could no longer speak i may well have done some screaming in there somewhere but by this point i couldnt even thrash in my bonds and from time to time id make an effort and raise myself on my ankle ropes just to get the pressure off my wrists and my lungs and for a few brief moments i would have some clarity and then gradually i would collapse again i assumed neoptolymos was dead one time brassos one of the bullies watched me raise myself and then slammed his spear shaft into my groin i collapsed onto my bonds and choked dagon struck the man he could die of your carelessness dagon said when i had the ability to use my head i prayed to apollo to herakles my ancestor and to poseidon for release just after the sun reached his awful height men came and began to unload the iron ore from the ship then the slaves were taken out of their benches with twenty guards watching them and they were put ashore three at a time and tied with heavy ropes inside a palisade after some time i cannot remember any of it i was cut down the relief was indescribable the first moments off the great x of the mast and its yard were like water for a parched man like the release of sex they tied me to a log and left me in the shade of a linen sail and after some time dagon came he had nestor nestor was still alive dagon had the wounded mans litter left under my awning and he had slaves fill a bronze cauldron with water they left it next to nestor who was in such pain from a mortal wound in the guts that all he did was writhe and scream enjoy your time together dagon said and giggled he put a hand on my shoulder while nestor gurgled i would love to spend the evening with you he said but i have some foolish greeks to fleece and then when i have made a fortune from their idiocy i will have time for you he giggled again and his touch burned me and then he went away i would have slept but nestor was in pain and dying horribly id like to say we talked or resolved to die together but he was already gone with pain and he simply lay and moaned and screamed and i watched him die i even slept a little in the night he breathed in hard his throat closed he coughed and he was dead just before the sun rose there were screams the sound of them scarcely registered with me had i understood them i would have despaired hah as if i had not already despaired dagon had invited the greeks to dinner and murdered them that was the way he thanked them for saving him dawn rose and the bullyboys were carrying corpses down the beach throwing them into the waves i recognized the greek lord from his long blond hair his throat was slit his genitals cut away a while later a pair of men came and dragged me down the wharf to the ship and tied me to the foremast again the sun began to rise as overseers drove the slaves back onto the ship a hundred men to row a trireme the greek ships oarsmen had spent the night aboard and my first hint of what had happened was that dagon and seven of his men were rowing a small boat out to the greek ship which was greek no more screams curses blows and spearthrusts the music of dagon how they must have cursed to find him their master many of the greek rowers would have been free men up until then we had brassos as both trierarch and oarmaster he had most of the old deck crew as marines in the looted armour of the dead greeks and he had a whip in an hour we were out of the harbour and our bow was pointed towards carthage the swift trireme ran ahead of us out to the horizon and stayed there a notch on the edge of my world my eyes grew sundazzled and i lost the ability to see or to make sense of the world around me the slaves who had tied me to the mast were lazy they had left me a great deal more slack for my body so that i could writhe and change positions in subtle ways had it been the first day of crucifixion it might have saved me as it was it prolonged the agony and they tied neoptolymos behind me but his bands were slack too by noon i cannot pretend i was any longer an observer i was there but i was unaware of anything that happened and then out of a clear hot day a storm struck us it caught our ship utterly unprepared so ill assume it was what sailors call a white squall a small vicious burst of wind and rain usually confined to a few stades and often so pale in colour that on a hot day its virtually invisible until it hits you i awoke to the rain and i was moving back and forth through wild swings because i was well up the foremast and every pitch of the ship beneath me moved my body through fifty degrees of an arc at the ends of the pitch my bonds took enormous strain but in the middle i got a rest the odd pitching motion taking all the weight off my hands and feet it was a miracle i swear that poseidon sent it to me rain lashed me as hard as i have ever known and it flowed into my mouth so fast i might have drowned and i drank it all and the pitching ship delivered me from pain here and there and then hope the strain on my bonds was loosening the hastily tied ropes they began to grow looser with every pitch and roll of the ship beneath me i was going to fall into the sea and drown i realize that what i am about to say will strain your credulity my friends but i didnt fear drowning poseidon had so palpably sent the storm to save me that i had to assume that falling into the sea was the very best thing for me and i confess that i thought of the keltoi woman jumping into the storm and i thought that it might not be the worst way to die my body would at any rate be safe from insult the storm reached a pitch of frenzy like the dance of the bacchae and the wind screamed through the ships standing rigging and the boatsail mast whipped through its arc i could feel the ties on my ankles going and to my horror they went first and suddenly i was hanging from my wrists pain flooded me then the ropes gave way not on my ankles but the cross of ropes that kept the yard on the mast the yard fell to the deck but the deck was heeled well over and while one end of the spar struck the bow the other fell across the ram and suddenly neoptolymos and i were catapulted into the raging sea we went deep my arms were still tied to the spar and i writhed in agony as the salt water hit my wounds and that burst ripped one arm my right free of my bonds then the yard shot to the surface the light wood all but leaping clear of the water the water was deep and cold the pain of my saltwashed wounds was almost pleasant i fought the storm for dear life using my wounded left arm to push myself above the spar and drink air out of the spume at the waves top even that fight became routine it went on and on and my left shoulder began to fail and i assumed i would die but neoptolymos had more left in him than i and he pinned my shoulder to the spar in a clamp of iron he saved me and then the storm abated sailing by as quickly as it had overtaken us the tone of the roar went down the rhythm of the waves changed and the sky lightened the thunder strokes came slower and slower i had time to think that it was like the end of a fight or a battle when men come apart out of the rage of ares and the sound of spear on shield comes less and less frequently i know it well before i could think another thought or pray to poseidon we were alone on the great blue our hands linked to a wooden spar the sun pounded us and the sea calmed and we were alone we were only a few stades from the coast indeed as soon as the clouds blew past i could see aetna the beach and trees to the south i think i might have swum to shore but it was not to be a coaster a small ship with one mast and a few oarsmen came out of the storm throwing a fine bow wave she was well handled cutting slantwise across the wind tacking back and forth in the straits a lookout must have spotted us i was facing the other way and missed all this neoptolymos grunted once or twice but i dont think he was fully alive at that point and both of us were parched perhaps i baked for fifteen minutes in the sun and then i was shocked to hear a hail and the coaster was a stade away it was as if a sea monster had surfaced by my side the boat dropped its scrap of sail the breeze was still stiff and four oarsmen pulled towards me almost into the eye of the wind moving the little ship i paddled weakly towards them they pulled me aboard they spoke greek in a way more like trade lingo i assumed they were sikels and i was right the leader trierarch seems too grand a term for a fortyfivefoot trading boat ran his hands over my injuries gave me a hard smile and nodded to another younger man who had to be his younger brother then he turned to neoptolymos after the sort of examination a man gives to a ram hes buying in the agora the two sikels spoke to each other the older mans name was hektor even here among barbarians the poets work lived that gave me a ray of hope the ray of hope lasted until we found ourselves assigned to oars the shackles were more figurative than real but it was clear that i was rowing for my food at least since i could barely speak with any of the men on board i assumed i was a slave again i was with two men with heavy hooked noses and deepset eyes and two men who were as black as any men id ever seen and neoptolymos on a positive note we were not forbidden to talk and as soon as wed rowed the ship around the headland the work of an hour the nearer african smiled at me doola he said i took it for his name arimnestos i said i tapped my chest ari doola asked close enough i nodded the younger african tapped his chest seckla he said sharply ari i said again you get the picture the other two men were not phoenicians although they looked the part nor were they sikels or hebrews or anything i knew they didnt speak much but within a few hours i knew that the ruddyhaired man was gaius and the darkhaired one was daud and that they didnt really share a language either they just looked as if they did in fact ill save time and say that gaius was etruscan and daud was all keltoi from northern gallia and spoke a few words of greek and a few more of sikel and no other tongue but his own it is amazing how much information you can convey without many words and it is perhaps a comment on my former servitude how happy i was on that boat the food was good mostly grilled fish we had wine every night the sikels treated us as well more as employees than slaves and i never was entirely sure as to my status we moved from small port to small port really just a stone house and some wattle huts on a headland with a beach we rowed past the greek towns and their temples and familiar smells we sailed past the carthaginian towns and well out to sea and it occurred to me that my new hosts feared the carthaginians far more than they feared the greeks the italiotes or the etruscans mostly we loaded dry fish and sold metal every town had a small forge and a bronzesmith and our ingots of copper and tin were their lifes blood i was shocked when i finally understood the price of tin it was absurdly high and i thought of my time as a smith on crete about as far from the tin mines of northern illyria as a man can be and still be in the world and wondered what had happened tin hadnt ever been that high you cannot make bronze without tin and the tin has to be high quality you dont need to add much tin to the copper to make bronze a little more than one to twenty but without tin all you have is soft copper whether you are making cook pots or helmets so an increase in the price of tin affected everyone neoptolymos was the only man to whom i could really talk as i recovered a little so did he and i went back to work on his greek he was sullen and it was only then that i began to understand the depth of his betrayal the man i had heard mentioned on the beach epidavros was his uncle neoptolymos didnt need me to tell him who had sold him to the carthaginians he already knew he chewed on his desire for revenge every minute illyrians are good haters and in this case i think his need for revenge kept him alive mind you i thought of dagon constantly i hated him i wanted to torture him to death and i knew in my heart that i was afraid of him this had not happened to me before and the sensation was like the ache of a tooth i had to probe it with my tongue a week passed and another we were not shackled or roped at night i began to prowl the encampment when the boat was beached testing the boundaries we were well along the west coast of sicily i have no notion greater than that in a town that had several stone houses with tile roofs and i had been a rower for perhaps three weeks when i walked boldly down the beach away from the encampment and into the streets of the town i made it to their very small agora just before dark and there was the younger brother sitting on a blanket with various ingots of cyprian copper and a few knucklebones of tin clearly not illyrian tin let me add because that comes in plainer ingots hektors brother rose from his blanket walked over to me and put a hand on my arm but there wasnt any threat i shrugged i want to see the town i said in greek he shrugged and let go my arm i walked about in truth they were subsistence farmers with no temple and very little to see a pair of stone statues that were really just phallic pillars a bronze brooch was the towns chief adornment for a woman and only one man wore a sword and it was more like a dagger in the days of my lordship id have walked past them all like a king as a semislave rower i found the town fascinating or rather a welcome break in a very few minutes i was back in the small agora and hektors brother met me led me to the blanket and offered me a cup of wine so i sat with him drank his wine and with a smile got up and walked back down to the boat i still didnt know his name because his brother never used it it may seem odd to you thugater but i was not unhappy my body was healing and no one was unfriendly doola and i were becoming comrades i learned some of his words i still remember that nitaka means i want he learned more of mine enough words that when i came back from my wander he had been sleeping he rose threw a chiton over his nudity and sat with me was it good he asked let me just say that there were grunts gestures and incomprehensible words interspersed with our very small shared vocabulary ill leave that out not bad i said and shrugged hektors brother gave me wine hes not bad doola agreed we sat in companionable silence until hektor himself joined us he lay down he was a very big man a head taller than me and handsome he had a small amphora and a mastos cup and he poured a libation doola and i both raised our hands in the universal sign of prayer to the gods and he grinned he said some words then he drank from the cup and passed it after a while a small boy i think hektors son came and brought small fish fried in olive oil neoptolymos joined us and ate the fish with the closest thing to a smile id seen from him we ate them got greasy drank the wine one by one the other rowers came and then the rest of hektors deck crew all relatives i guess i still think they had made a profit it was a good little party so the next morning when the boat rowed away i was at my bench i was happy enough thats the best evening i remember i cant say exactly how long i rowed for the sikels at least a month and perhaps longer but sometime after that on a clear day we saw a trireme hull up to the north and the sikels spoke in agitated tones and we turned south and ran downwind the two brothers argued and i will assume that the younger was in favour of maintaining our course to the west and appearing unfazed while the older was in favor of running immediately and gaining sea room we ran south across a darkening sea and as the wind grew less and less we went to the oars and pulled hektor began to cheat the helm more and more west of south but the black trireme was on us i rowed looking over my shoulder id been the hunter a hundred times id snapped up coasters just like this one sometimes three and four at a time i knew in an hour that the trireme had us so did hektor he gathered his family in the stern i couldnt hear them or understand them but they didnt shout and they took weapons they had a look about them that i know too well they werent planning to resist because they believed they could win they were resisting so they would die with honour the youngest boy smiled and kissed his father and uncles and brothers and then jumped into the sea just before the trireme came alongside and drowned just like that hektor was a giant a fine figure of a man but he was no fighter and the marines from the black hull knew their business he inflicted no wounds they spitted him on a spear he screamed a few times until one of the marines hit him with the hilt of his kopis the way a fisherman whacks a fish to kill it hektor died the other sikels fought but they didnt fight well two were wounded but hektors brother and the rest were taken they looted the boat and then they took us aboard in less time than it takes to tell it i was a slave rower again on a carthaginian military trireme i know you think i should have risen from my bench with doola and perhaps seckla and killed all the marines but my body was far from healed healed for fighting i mean and i had neither weapon nor armour and they had everything i considered fighting i wondered almost idly if i had learned cowardice at last doola and i certainly exchanged a look in the last few moments before the marines came aboard neoptolymos grunted once in real agitation he wanted to fight but he looked for my lead well id led once before and failed if hektor had armed us id be dead so there poseidon frowned and smiled too i went to a bench and i had doola and seckla at arms length and hektors brother below me neoptolymos a dozen benches ahead of us the trireme was called the sea sister in phoenician i didnt know a man aboard but in an hour i knew that the trierarch was a capable man with an expert set of officers nor were the rowers slaves this was a military ship run for a profit by means of piracy we preyed on the sikels and the etruscans too as well as the greeks of magna greca in my first week aboard we took six ships none much larger than the coaster on which id served ours was the only one that resisted and for several weeks they treated us with care keeping us at arms length when we were fed wine was rare and meant we were in for a fight but at the end of the fifth week we pulled into laroussa a carthaginian port on sicily and the rowers were marched down the wharf from the ship to a barracks and paid i almost expired from shock i had assumed i was a slave the sea sister was run in phoenician of course and i spoke a little and understood more and most of the officers spoke enough greek to be understood none had bothered to suggest to me that i was not a slave but in the barracks i was shown a bed and handed a little less than sixty drachmas doola and i had managed to expand our shared vocabulary although to be honest we spoke neither greek nor numidian but our own language now that we were in barracks though i found that there were a dozen more greeks in our crew and they knew the town and the drill were not slaves said an athenian guttersnipe named aristocles but we have very limited rights you can go to the whorehouses or the agora or the wine shops you cannot leave town you cannot refuse to row he shrugged it is like being a slave with some privileges he grinned showing me all ten of his teeth you look like a gent he said want to share a ride he meant share a porne at the brothel and i didnt really fancy that but i bought a pitcher of wine and fruit juice on ice extravagant aristocrat that i was and a dozen of us drank it in a taverna that smelled like old octopus then we ate a huge meal the whores came around when the serious drinking started they didnt want sex the ideal customer paid and passed out but i hadnt even talked to a woman in months and my body felt better the soreness in my side and my shoulders was a little less every morning and the wounds from dagons spear were healed i wanted one of them so i talked chatted flirted for my pains i ended up riding one of the older women she seemed quite old to me a nearhag of thirty she had beautiful hair and some teeth and a deep tan and a ready laugh and she was the only one of the porne who had much of a smile we drank wine afterwards and she sat with me a hand on my arm for the rest of the evening and we had another ride after dark of course i paid porne dont ride for free and men who say so lie but she liked me well enough and i her her name was lin or enough she was a sikel i went from mourning euphoria to riding an old prostitute yes i was alive we were on shore a little less than a week the sea sister was provisioned for sea again and an officer came and fetched us we each got a few coins for signing on not that we had any choice and in an hour the shore was a dream and lins body was a mirage and i was rowing this time we went north along the coast of sardinia and the sea was empty the officers were cautious about our landing beaches then we turned east into the setting sun and sailed on the oceans wind on the second day we picked up a small coaster the crew fought two of our marines were killed and the crew of the coaster all suicided the survivors diving in armour into the sea carthage had a terrible reputation in those days a lot of what happened came from the way they treated slaves the sea sister was an exception but our victims had no way of knowing that most carthaginians sea officers or lubbers treated slaves as an expendable resource always more where this one came from whether this one was a skilled rower or a fine mosaicist or an ignorant yokel but i digress later that afternoon we found out why the coaster had fought so hard out of the afternoon haze came her consort a heavy etruscan trireme she was ready to fight and so were we and our trierarch turned into the wind dropped his boatsail and we took the oars in our hands the trierarchs gave us a short speech my phoenician was up to it so i could tell that he promised all the rowers a share if we won i passed that on to seckla and doola and neoptolymos and hektors brother i was on the top deck and i knew the business we went for a straight headtohead ram the helmsman watching the enemy ship like a cat watches a mouses hole oars in he shouted when we were half a stadion from our enemy the two ships hurtling together with the speed of two galloping horses all our oars came in on the top deck it was easy but the lower decks needed time to get the oars across at the bow and stern the rowers had to cooperate putting the blades out through the opposite oarport but we were a good crew so were the etruscans we hit not ram to ram but cathead to cathead and our forwardrow gallery took the blow of theirs and both splintered and men screamed as their bodies were ground to bloody pulp between the uncaring masses of the two ships all the momentum came off both ships and we coasted to a near stop broadside to broadside the height of a tall man apart our archers began to shoot into their command deck and their archers did the same and then the grapnels flew indeed both sides had decided to fight it out men are foolish animals no one needed to die i dont think there was a man on either ship who stood to gain much from victory this wasnt a struggle for freedom or domination except at the lowest level this wasnt lade or marathon this was more like two travellers wrestling at a crossroads with no spectators but there was no less ferocity for all that their marines came at us first they wore full panoply and they were men who knew their business and i thought as a spectator that they were better men than ours and we were short by two men of our complement and when each side has only a dozen armoured warriors the loss of two is sufficient to swing a contest it was odd to sit and watch a deadly fight one etruscan went down immediately a lucky shot from a boarding pike sent him over the side where he sank without a trace but our captain took his death wound in the very next fight a moments inattention a mistake by the man at his side and he was spouting blood they dragged his bleeding body clear of the fight and dropped him near the stern and then the melee grew desperate the carthaginians knew that they were losing and the etruscans knew they were close to winning the etruscans pushed our marines relentlessly down the central gangway a catwalk that was at the height of our heads and open to the weather our ship wasnt covered with a solid deck as some of the newest ships are today so we could watch the whole fight the helmsman led a counterattack from the stern and his spear put down an etruscan marine who fell across the catwalk about even with doolas bench one forward from mine his spear snapped and he plucked an axe from behind his shield and spiked a second etruscan in the temple one of the carthaginians at his side took a spear in the thigh at the same moment and the two men fell in a tangle right onto my bench and the fight locked up the catwalk could just fit two men wide and there they were like two teams pushing against each other at an athletic contest the dying etruscan was in my lap bleeding on me and shitting on me as well his sword clattered at my feet out of his dead hand and lay in a pool of his own blood on the boards where i rested my feet to row i had the strangest thoughts and a great deal of time seemed to pass while i had them all between one drip of blood from the corpse and another just for a few beats of my heart i think that i saw the world as heraclitus saw it it seemed to me and it still does as one of the pivotal moments of my life the sword lay at my feet beckoning me indeed it all but called out to me i looked at it but i didnt take it because i had a thousand conflicting thoughts in an instant it seemed to me that i was four feet lower than any opponent and that after i cut the ankles of one or two men id be skewered shieldless like a dog in a pit it seemed to me that i owed carthage nothing i looked at the carthaginian marines fighting literally at my head and i felt no kinship no brotherhood they paid and i rowed and i was not free to leave had hektor been captain had the crew been sikels i might have felt a bond and the man lying across my lap looked greek he smelled of coriander his skin was brown and tanned and his eyes were like my eyes and his armour a handsome bronze thorax a beautiful corinthian helmet with plumes and a crest of red horsehair was greek armour i didnt feel the least inclination to risk my skin to help the barbarian carthaginians fight and win against the barbarian etruscans who at least looked greek and yet another voice urged me to take up the sword because with it in my hand i was a different man a free man the master of my own destiny and then came a moment of superb crystalline clarity it was absurd i a slave or near enough held the key to the fight if i rose from my bench sword in hand the side i backed would triumph i saw this as if it were written in carved letters on stone i an unarmed slave held the fate of twenty armoured men and four hundred rowers in my sword hand not because i was a great fighter not because i was arimnestos of plataea but because i was in the right place at the right moment of time and a sword had fallen at my feet and i thought this is how all the world is in every minute in every heartbeat in which every human makes any decision this is the river into which heraclitus said we could not twice dip our toes this was the moment and from this moment every other moment would flow i picked up the sword the river flowed on or rather a dozen rivers flowed away from that moment alive dead slave free all flowed away from that moment the helmsman swung over an etruscan marines shield and cut the fingers off the mans sword hand i caught doolas eye he too had a knife in his hand so did hektors brother i had never spoken a word to him since he poured me wine in the market of some tiny town in sicily but now he watched me i decided i swear that in that moment i saw the future that the stream came together in a mighty river and time flowed i once joked to doola that we won the battle of mycale in that moment he and i fifteen years before the persians beached there and we landed our marines and fought it out for the supremacy of the world every stream flowed from there i rose on my bench dumping the dead etruscan into the benches below me but wrestling the corpse for his aspis the round shield on his left arm it was a perfect fit and that meant it would not come off cleanly my moment was passing i gave up on the shield the kopis whirled up over my head and i cut and severed the helmsmans foot at the ankle he screamed and fell to the deck and i cut his throat doola was off his bench and onto mine crawling aft with hektors brother and seckla right behind him seckla stripped the helmsman of his dagger and sword as he passed and hektors brother had his spear all as smoothly as if wed planned this a hundred times perhaps we had in truth i think that the fates were there immanent at our shoulders and then the four of us burst off the benches into the rear files of the carthaginians i got my hands on one mans shoulders and pulled him down and seckla cut a mans hamstrings and hektors brother rammed his spear deep into the side of a third marine under his fine bronze corselet in three heartbeats every topdeck rower was up the last marines and officers died in a paroxysm of blood and then i had time to get the aspis on my arm and face the etruscans the lead etruscan stepped back and raised his helmet grinned the two ships rose and fell on the swell speak greek i asked he looked at the man behind him he had a magnificent octopus on his shield and his helmet he had ruddy blond hair and didnt look a bit like a greek he was as handsome as paris he raised his helmet and nodded a little he said i dont know about the rest of these men i said slowly and carefully but ive had enough of being a rower and a slave if youll give your word to the gods that youll free us ashore and give us a share of the value of this ship why well row her to port for you otherwise i tapped my sword against my shield rim the other oarsmen made a lot of noise ten marines can cow two hundred oarsmen but not under these conditions not when we were already up off our benches with many of us armed the greekspeaker nodded to me and called to the other ship i didnt understand a word but gaius appeared at my hip he was a lowerdeck rower he shouted with joy and clambered past me then looked back at me he embraced an etruscan and they spoke quickly and then he came back and took my hand message received thats his cousin said the greekspeaker he gave me a grin well see you right i swear by the daimon of hospitality and the god of the sea we shook and men cheered and the river flowed on it took me months to learn enough etruscan to get a cup of wine it sounds like the language petty kingdoms of northern syria speak and while i recognized the sounds i didnt understand a word gaius left us immediately and many of the rowers like men of their kind were rowing etruscan hulls for pay before the week was out collecting small wages tupping different porne and drinking better wine but living the same life i collected what i thought of as my people and gaius got us a fair price for our share of the trireme sea sister a year had passed since i found euphoria dead or more i was drinking wine with strangers in a place so foreign theyd never heard of the fight at marathon where keltoi were thicker on the ground than hellenes i had no urge to go home but i was sick of being a chattel and whatever had been broken was healing i wanted to live and i wanted to be a lord and not a slave i thought often of the keltoi woman stepping over the side i thought often of the moment when the sword fell at my feet from the gods i thought of dagon neoptolymos wanted to go to illyria and kill his uncle but his plans were adolescent we didnt have enough money to buy a ship but the etruscan cities in the north were fighting a war with the keltoi and i thought that my little oikia might earn money there one evening as the money was running short it came to a head in a taverna i threw a few obols on the table for wine i say we go north and see what we can pick up i said i looked at doola who shrugged wrong way for me he said he grinned his huge grin home is that way he pointed a thumb over his shoulder sos carthage demetrios said he was hektors brother by then i knew his name but he shrugged and sicily seckla looked interested in going north to fight not daud he shrugged my home he said pointing north even though he and gaius looked like brothers he was a kelt come to sicily demetrios said suddenly we can work the passage and save our money keep our arms we had all kept the weapons of the carthaginians what we were allowed to keep i had the dead etruscans sword listen my people are always fighting the greeks no offence brother or the carthaginians he spat well earn some money buy a ship be partners daud hugged us all ill go home he said where is home demetrios asked him my brother always wanted to ask you daud nodded north and north and north over the mountains and up the great river over a range of hills by the big forts and then down the river of fish to the northern sea he smiled i was a great fool to leave home but im grownup now where the tin comes from demetrios asked suddenly eagerly greedily perhaps daud shook his head yes and no it comes through our town but its from across the seariver on alba or so the traders say he shrugged im not of the veneti they know all about the tin and they dont tell hektor dreamed of taking a ship to alba demetrios said we were going to take on a cargo of tin and die rich men why does insane adventure appeal to me thats the way im made i remember leaning forward like that young man who has just become interested in my tale eh slavery is dull but alba is exotic eh just so how far is alba i asked demetrios shrugged no one knows the phoenicians have an absolute monopoly outside the pillars of heracles greek merchants used to go overland from massalia but those were gentler times doola shook his head a dream he said is an important thing but a cup of wine is better the tin of alba is legendary but with a little luck we could buy a small ship and have a good life dont you want to go home i asked doola and seckla exchanged a look no doola said sometimes he sounded like a spartan i waved at the wine slave for more wine i for one would like to go to alba daud leaned over if you are going to alba ill stay he said doola grinned insane he said we dont even have a ship seckla complained doola looked at me you can navigate i nodded demetrios looked offended i can navigate doola grinned his big grin this one has been a trierarch i can see it on a big ship yes i nodded doola and seckla exchanged a long look lets swear doola said suddenly so we swore out a pact it took some time to argue the details but we swore to be brothers to split shares evenly to save and buy a ship sail her to alba take on a cargo of tin and bring it home we were as drunk as lords by the time we put our right fists together and swore by zeus and four other gods with other men it would have been a drunkards oath something we talked about while we traded for bits of amber and salt fish but i was not the only man there under the hand of the fates and when the seven of us were together it seemed that there was nothing we could not do so we swore and in the morning we took ship for sicily now i had been to sicily several times by then but never as a free man with a few obols and a sword and it tasted better this time we landed on the beach by syracusa the greatest greek city on the richest island in the ocean and we gaped like country hicks syracusa is a magnificent city the rival of athens by all rights we ought to have squandered our hardearned drachma in brothels and gone back to sea as oarsmen or at best marines but thats not how it fell out because as i say the gods were close on landing we went together up to the big temple of poseidon on the headland and spent good money on a ram i sacrificed him myself and his blood poured across the altar and even as a junior priest collected his blood a senior priest was dividing the meat it was everyday work for both of them but a few routine questions they were courteous men those priests established that we were sailors looking for a boat and that the junior priests brother had a small boat to sell twenty days of daylabour and that boat was ours it was scarcely forty feet long and just about wide enough to walk the length when the mast was down but it could carry cargo i guarded temples and carried sacks on the waterfront for a week and then i found skilled work at a forge and suddenly we had the silver to buy the boat it was odd and perhaps sad that i made more in a day as an underpaid journeyman bronzesmith than all five of us earned doing the sort of dayjobs slaves usually did but access to the shop allowed me to repair our war gear and to make us all some small things cloak pins clothes pins buckles my new master liked my work a great deal he was mostly a caster not a forger and he paid me well enough so the other four went to sea with a cargo of salt fish for the cities of magna greca and i stayed in syracusa making cheap cloak clasps in bulk because truth to tell i was making more cash than the boat it may seem funny after a life as a pirate and a lord that i took pride in keeping a tiny tenement apartment in syracusa clean and neat in earning a good wage smithing bronze nor did i ever think theyd sail away and leave me in some way that i still cannot define we were bonded as deeply as i was bonded with aristides andwell now that i think of it most of the friends of my boyhood died at lades and i had never really replaced them hermogenes idomeneus both were fine men but more followers than friends too many men saw me as a hero as distinct as above those six doola seckla daud gaius demetrios and neoptolymos it was a different thing and i find ive been a bad poet i havent sung you what they were like doola was big without being tall and always at the edge of fat without being fat he had no hair on top of his head and once we were free he grew a thick beard he had heavy slabs of muscle but a sensitive intelligent face he was quick to anger and quick to forgive seckla was tall and thin almost feminine in his face and hands anything but feminine in his temperament eager to resent a slight eager for revenge he never forgave his dark skin was stretched tight over fine features and his hands were long and thin despite his combative nature he was really a craftsman and his hands were never still making nets wrapping rope ends making thole pins fit their holes better he never stopped moving about the boat and on land he never stopped fussing with food daud was all keltoi tall heavily built a fearsome sight in armour he drank too much and was quick to anger and as quick to weep he tried so hard to hide his emotions and failed so badly heres to him thugater he had redblond hair that was just starting to darken eyes the colour of a new morning and skin so pale that it never tanned properly and he often wore a chiton when the rest of us were naked just to save himself from burning im pale and my paleness was nothing next to his we used to mock him about it and he would join in agreeing that there was no sun where he came from he could ride anything and he was a trained warrior where seckla and doola were really not very good when i met them demetrios was a sikel small swarthy dour he laughed easily but seldom showed his thoughts unlike daud who sought to hide his thoughts but inevitably failed at least back then his skin was dark his nose was prominent and he hated to fight not from cowardice but from genuine aversion he was slow to trust and quick to worry he was in many ways a countryman among cosmopolitans but he was a sure hand at sea and on land he knew how to fish in any waters and his boathandling and seamanship were infinitely better than my own indeed working with him quickly showed me how little a pirate chief actually knows about handling a boat his navigation was weak he preferred to coast everywhere even in dangerous waters he worried constantly and he often reminded me of a pet rat i had as a boy snout quivering hands rubbing together yet he would have died for any one of us if hed had to neoptolymos was as i have said illyrian he had muddyblond hair and watery blue eyes and he drank constantly he was easily angered and to be honest never a very pleasant companion he felt that he had forfeited his honour when his sister was raped to death he seldom smiled he was harsh with others and himself yet buried under the broken unhappiness of youth was a man who had the manners of a gentleman and the easy habits of a rich man his purse was always open to his friends his knife was always ready to defend us his code was barbarous but noble he could also play any musical instrument he was given after a few hours of mucking about and finally there was gaius he left us for a while but he was one of us nonetheless he was etruscan but that is like saying he is greek because every etruscan city is at odds with every other and they rarely unite he too had redblond hair and pale skin when i first met the two of them i thought he and daud were brothers when in fact they werent even from the same people and both were a little annoyed at my assumption we had divisions four of us were warriors and three were not three of us were at least nominally aristocratic and three were working men slavery can erase arrogance but it cannot erase habits of mind and body so daud neoptolymos gaius and i would work on our bodies and practise with weapons which the other three looked on as an affectation or a foolish waste of money we tended to spend freely daud especially could empty his purse for a beggar even if the gesture meant that he was instantly a beggar himself i would buy the best wine and the best cloak i could afford and the three men born to labour would roll their eyes and pray to hermes for deliverance from the spendthrift i remember this happening in the agora of syracusa and i laughed and told them that they reminded me of my aristocratic wife and then i suddenly burst into tears i tell this now because truth to tell what they looked like and how they acted was well to put it bluntly it was muted unimportant while we rowed for our lives as slaves slavery made the bond but once we had survived we had to know each other my daughter is smiling i have digressed too long but those were good times the boat returned from its first voyage and we had just about broken even a small boat carries a limited cargo and even if the skipper picks his cargo well he has to sell all of it at a good price over and over to cover the cost of four men eating drinking wine their clothes ruined at sea their oars broken on rocks the overheads of a sea voyage are to be blunt enormous for poor men our little tub had four oars a big central mast that could be unshipped and room for about two tons of cargo which is nothing in wine or grain less than nothing for metal on the positive side we were not in debt to the vicious moneylenders of sicily they were notorious and for good reason and they had amazing networks of informants so that by the second afternoon after our little boat was pulled up on the back a pair of men came down to her one sat on her gunwale and the other stood with his arms crossed they were quite large men you need more money to make a profit off a boat this size said the man sitting on our gunwale we were all there scrubbing black slime out of the bilge and weed and crap off the hull demetrios had brought in a cargo of italian wine and made what should have been a handsome profit but about a third of the amphorae had either broken or slipped some seawater so that his profits just about covered losses with a little left over before this gets monotonous let me add that had we not been ambitious to buy bigger ships and go farther this would have been a good life the boat covered expenses and then some and i was starting even after six weeks to make a steady wage it was only the scope of our ambition that rendered the pace slow im digressing again i dont feel that i have your attention gents said the man on the gunwale his partner picked up a large piece of wood and came over to the boat he struck the hull hard just where the strake met the bow none of the oak pins came loose but no one likes to see a stranger hit his boat i see i have your attention now said the man on our gunwale daud and i walked down either side of the boat and we must have looked like trouble the man on the bow stood up dusting his hands i dont think you know me gents but if you touch me you are all dead men he laughed im a little surprised you dont know me hurt even but youre all strangers foreigners so i will let it go this time especially as ive come to offer you money demetrios shrugged we dont need money he said really said the man by the bow let me introduce myself im anarchos and if i wish to loan you money then you need to take it please understand this gents i own you as surely as your former owner owned you your slavery is written in the sky dont pretend you are free men i know escaped slaves when i see them and i can sell you into slavery or kill you and no one in this city will even shrug you arent citizens you arent even registered metics you are poor men and you have no friends he smiled and the hardness left his voice but i am a reasonable man and an easy master you split your profits with me and i loan you money when you fail i am your patron and you are my workers and all is well i will help you in the courts and in the assembly if it comes to that he looked around no one in syracusa will say anarchos is a bad patron daud was ready to fight i could see it in his posture i was calculating this was new to me even though i prided myself in being more like odysseus than achilles if the man spoke the truth even a wicked cockedup version of the truth attacking him would serve little purpose nor did we plan to stay in syracusa no local crime lord could possibly imagine what we had in mind i put a hand on dauds shoulder my friend is a gaul i said and prone to violence i smiled at the hired muscle the man was big i know a little about violence myself i added but we dont want any trouble anarchos nodded youre the smart boy then i resented his tone and his use of the word boy but i was not a great lord with fifty hoplites at my back i was an exslave with six friends i think my hands trembled but i smiled we had a good voyage i had another knucklebone to roll and i cast it slyly and of course i make a fair wage as a bronzesmith he nodded pursed his lips i had scored a hit not a hit that would win the fight but a real score nonetheless bronzesmiths were a closeknit clan with their own rules and laws and status and men like anarchos however powerful didnt cross the smiths ill check on that he said the bronzesmiths wouldnt like an exslave making a claim that wasnt true i reached into the boat and took out my leather satchel made by seckla from it holding it up so that the hired muscle could see me i took a bronze eatingknife with a pretty bone handle the bone dyed green with verdigris there were fine silver tacks in the handle for decoration it was in a sheath of secklas make with a long bronze pick my work i said handing it to the moneylender he nodded keep it i said a token of my esteem his head shot up fuck you slave he said no one talks to me like that i crossed my arms youre off your mark here im a craftsman these men are my friends i have other friends we dont want trouble he got up rubbed his chin and then his face changed ill keep this he said holding my eatingknife and ill make some enquiries and ill be back he looked around i expect youll need my money and ill expect you to be civil understand by civil he meant subservient again you might expect that id just kill him and be a local hero but it doesnt really work like that some time much later daud told me that we could have saved a year of our lives by killing him then and there and maybe we could have but heraclitus was reaching me across the years i had to learn other ways of solving my problems so i bowed my head of course patron he nodded seriously and strode off full of selfimportance his sellsword by his side daud turned on me are you a coward he asked and stomped off i didnt see him for a day i must have turned red because doola came and put his arm around my shoulders well done he said i dont feel that it was well done i admitted now that the man had walked away i felt craven we didnt fight and we didnt take his money demetrios said nice job my brother was good with these vultures but ii fear them so we went back to scraping the boat clean and afterwards we returned to our two rooms under the thatch where we counted our money the taverna on our corner had taken all the wine that wasnt tinged with seawater at a good price and all the tinged wine at one half that price after demetrios paid off our debts mostly food rope and wood we had about sixty drachma i had made another twentyfour drachma profit after my own food wine and clothes eightyfour drachma for six men daud shook his head well never get a twentyoared ship at this rate we had decided that if we were going to try the tin run to alba we needed at least a twentyoared galley with a good mast it was a common enough type of boat in the trade and we needed a dozen slaves we couldnt afford to pay rowers and sailors and build the boat we estimated that building the boat would cost us three hundred drachmas but demetrios was altogether more sanguine he put the money in a sack and put the sack into the thatch not bad he said he shrugged not bad ari is pulling more than his fair share and without him well never get it done i didnt really want to hear that because while i liked working in the shop i wanted to be at sea and my status if you could call it that as leader was suffering all of them looked to demetrios not to me he had become the skipper i wasnt there at sea they told me stories of the storm that hit them in the straits off sybarus and how demetrios stayed at the helm all day and all night you get the idea i might have been bitter but i wasnt sometimes a dream was bigger than any reality sailing to alba was a big dream an heroic deed a worthy thing i was willing to sacrifice we all were we were brothers what about illyria i asked neoptolymos raised his head and smiled and then frowned and drank more wine i will never go back until my sister is avenged he said i looked at them theres still tin coming through illyria i pointed out and neoptolymos knows where to get it he shook his head my cousins will have the keep now and the river i would be killed i will return with a hundred warriors with my friends he smiled at me and for a moment we were brothers he knew i would back him i knew that if we lived someday we would go there after we put dagon down we never talked about it but neoptolymos and i knew many debts the money went into the thatch and the boat went back to sea they tried fishing for a few weeks and made about six drachma over expenses they accepted a cargo of artworks for the etruscan coast and sailed off leaving me to worry about the consequences of failure but i didnt worry much im not much of a worrier in that way i went to work each morning as the sun rose at the height of the sun in the sky i would walk out of my master nikephoruss shop and go two streets to a waterfront wine shop where id buy a skewer of somewhat questionable meat after that meal id walk back to nikephoruss shop and work until late afternoon when id go to the gymnasium pay my foreigners fee and exercise with much richer men id lift weights throw the discus and run on the track after some weeks other men spoke to me i was clearly a foreigner despite its size syracusa had only about six thousand citizen males and they all knew each other they were like any greek gentlemen well spoken talkative friendly but only with each other but hospitality overcame diffidence after some time and eventually one of the richer men i knew who he was even if he had no idea who i was came and asked me if i liked to box his name was theodorus and his family owned stone quarries we exchanged blows for some time he wasnt very good and it wasnt my best sport but a few minutes of contest taught each of us that the other was a solid opponent he laughed so you are a gentleman the gatekeeper has hmm questioned your right to exercise here i nodded im a bronzesmith i said from plataea in boeotia his face hardened i fought in the front rank at marathon i added i didnt like the way it sounded a plain brag ahh he said and took my hand things are a little different here i doubt theres another bronzesmith in our gymnasium he led me over to a group of men just emerging from the dressing rooms they were in their thirties and forties and they all wore the chlamys the way much younger men would wear them in athens but their bodies were hard and they all seemed to smile at the same time ari fought at marathon he said by way of introduction by nike said one man with greying black hair and a thick beard thats something they all gathered around me and one slapped my back tell us what it was like said theodorus i started to tell the story just as i have told you and the tall bearded man grinned and plucked my arm let the poor man get dressed and well buy him some wine talking is thirsty work they were clearly surprised to see my plain chlamys and short linen chitoniskos i looked like a servant with them and i resolved to buy a better chlamys to wear to the gymnasium we sat in a wine shop where a cup of wine cost an afternoons wage for a skilled bronzesmith and where women not men waited at the tables lovely women slaves i assumed i told my story and the men with me responded well theodorus nodded at the end ive been in a ship fight and some cattle raids he admitted but nothing like that if carthage keeps preying on our shipping well see it here another added what do you think ari i shrugged i know nothing of the politics here gentlemen i have no love for the carthaginians however they all looked at me they enslaved me i said from their looks i might as well have said and sold me in a brothel every face closed you are a slave theodorus asked i shook my head but i already knew we were done i had seen this attitude in athens i am not a slave was not born a slave and was only made a slave by force i said theodorus got up his hip had been against mine sitting for wine and he moved away as one would from a leper no slave can take exercise in our gymnasium he said they all looked at me with marked distaste i got up im sorry to have intruded gentlemen i said i drained my cup the wine was excellent i appreciate your hospitality even if you do not desire my company may the gods be kind to you i collected my chlamys and made what exit i could i could feel their stares until i got to the door of the wine shop where one of the serving girls suddenly went up on tiptoe and brushed a kiss on my beard i hate them she said aphrodite that little brush of a kiss went to the very roots of my being and took much of the sting out of my humiliation the next morning i told my master nikephorus the entire story we were polishing a nasty job and one usually done by slaves but nikephorus liked to see things gleam every day so we often started the days polishing id polished all day for my first week until he had time to test me and of course i knew the grips and handshakes of a master they were different for syracusa but not so different at any rate we polished for a while and then he sat back on the bench and admired our work i dont exercise as much as i should he said but the crafts have a gymnasium with a bath you should have asked he smiled his slow smile and his eyes twinkled he was grey without seeming old bent and strong like hephaestos himself his wife let me add was much younger and they fought often and made up in the traditional way and were equally loud in both pastimes i liked his wife too julia she was and she had a neat orderly mind that catalogued everything that came her way the heroes of the iliad the ships in the harbour the wares in the shop which was odd as her house was the messiest ive ever seen she never put anything away and her slaves were just like her but she was kind to apprentices and journeymen she gave us food from her larder and juice from her store wine was always free and she had a great store of scrolls to read like a rich woman which i think she was i first read a good copy of pythagoras on mathematics at her house my daughter is making that face that means im rattling on so nikephorus said id have loved to see those rich fucks when they found out you had been a slave like youd poured shit on them he laughed aloud well well after work today well go and exercise he groaned but it may kill me we went through the streets at twilight through parts of the city i hadnt yet seen i discovered that the textiles id bought down by the harbour were a pale shadow of what was available in the weavers street where women hung recently completed items in the doors of their shops weaving is a womans craft and the women of syracusa were at least as dexterous as those of athens or plataea i saw wine shops better than the ones i frequented and a street of ironsmiths where we stopped to drop off a whole leatherwrapped bundle of bronze fittings i saw good swords and bad fine spears and cheap spears good eatingknives and dull eatingknives the craftsmens gymnasium was small but quite pleasant it didnt have its own track but it did host three professional trainers paid by the guilds and it had good equipment a matched set of lifting stones with handles for instance i was introduced around and men watched me lift and other men watched me box and there was a curious device i hadnt seen elsewhere a room with a bright lamp with a lens focused on a whitewashed wall on the bench was a single heavy wooden sword shadowfighting friend said one of the trainers he lit the lamp and shone it on the wall and then fought his shadow for a few blows it was good training and selfexplanatory and i set to the trainer a freedman names polimarchos grinned at me had a sword in your hand before i take it i smiled care to have a try with padded swords he asked this was different from boeotia where we used wooden swords and hurt each other the swords were padded with wool and leather and he had small shields with central grips id never used such a shield and i pursed my lips not much like an aspis is it i asked teaches the same lessons though polimarchos said the small shield teaches the larger punch with your hand deflect your opponents blade before his blow is fully developed right youre a fighter we call it the shield bash here but ive heard it called a dozen names and try keeping your sword inside the shield let the shield cover your sword hand i had been fighting most of my life id had a good teacher as a boy but i hadnt ever given much thought to the theory of swordplay until that moment we picked up the padded weapons the padded sword was badly balanced and felt like a dead thing in my hand the shield was odd but i set myself in my fighting position with my sword high behind me and my left leg forward and polimarchos looked at me for a moment and shook his head he stepped forward and we began to circle he managed our distance expertly keeping me a little farther away than i would have liked so i pushed him and he struck his right leg shooting forward across his left and his padded blade slamming down towards my shield i raised the shield slightly and he rolled the blade off my little shield and cut into my thigh dont rely on the shield he said act with it the third time he cut down at my thigh i cut at his wrist and scored he winced too hard ari he said i have hit you twice and not left a mark eh his point was a fair one but pain didnt make him flinch and we went back at it he could not hit me at will but he could hit me often i could hit him occasionally he was twenty years older than i and a freedman after an hour i could scarcely breathe and darkness was falling train me i asked him he nodded you are a good fighter a trained man i can tell but the etruscans and the latins and the syracusans train in these things techniques that you dont know i can tell the way you stand your legs are too far apart you crouch forward slightly surely your first trainer told you to keep your back straight and theres other moves cuts worth knowing i get a drachma for an hour of my time i nodded and spearfighting i asked polimarchos had a pleasant face he was shorter a little heavy at the waist like many trainers and his arms and legs had the defined muscles of the professional athlete he was bald on top and his surviving hair was no colour at all and neither were his eyes he smiled a lot especially when he hit me he grinned i know some things about spearfighting he said we walked out of the gymnasium i paid my fee a month there cost the same for a smith as a day at the city gymnasium for a foreigner but a drachma to the trainer was painful nonetheless i took him out for a cup of wine we came to an agreement he was eager to teach a swordsman i could tell rather than pushing tradesmen to do a little exercise which was his daytoday fare the craft gymnasium added to my social life as i met other men of my own age and received some invitations which reminded me that men my age with incomes assured were married i had been married i forgot for days even weeks at a time i forgot i was married and forgot she was dead i never forgot briseis though after seven or eight weeks this life became my life plataea was far away and the pirate lord was dead and buried i made my first helmet and my master clapped his hands to see it done and sold it for a handsome price he gave me almost half of the profit by the standards of the day this was very generous a journeyman like me could be kept on for wages and food my share was twenty drachmas that covered lessons at the gymnasium where i had begun to question how id ever killed a single man in combat so much of my posture and technique was being restructured by polimarchos i paid my teacher and he was truly grateful a week later i produced another helmet this one with repousse work at the brow it had been ordered and i had fretted about the fit indeed it was a fraction too small and i was embarrassed to have to open the brow slightly in front of the client alternately dishing and raising a few points to expand the metal all the while hoping that i would not have to replanish the whole shape but my customer an etruscan trierarch on business loved my work i think he loved more than just my work he smiled a lot and seemed to hang on my every word but this time i received twentyfive drachmas a small thing happened at that time one of many incidents a boy came to our shop really a young man a gifted apprentice called anaxsikles son of dionysus dionysus was the master smith of the street he himself was i gather a very gifted man but i never saw anything he made rather he managed a smithing empire he had twentyfour sheds with both slave and free smiths working iron and bronze he was chief of the guild and his voice was the voice that decided most things on the street and yet in as much as i knew him he seemed fair and very intelligent he was the sort of tekne every city values prosperous rich even and yet not above his origins at any rate he sent us his son this sort of temporary fosterage binds the guilds together and is good for all it is the chief reason why cities and not workshops develop a style fosterage creates an equality of knowledge but i digress dont look at me like that honey i know you want the story teaching anaxsikles was a joy he had a kind of aptitude for the work that transcends jealousy and competition he was a godsent talent he never needed to be shown anything more than once if i have a skill in working bronze that is better than other mens it is in the construction of armour and i think it is simply that i have used so much of it that i understand it from the inside in a way that other smiths dont but anaxsikles would drink in my views on how to fabricate a corinthian helmet for instance where to move the metal to stiffen the brow ridge or the way i made them to leave a heavy plate over the brow he took it all in he seemed to feel it in his bones so anaxsikles worked with me on the helmets he was delighted with the result and my work improved again i only worked with him for two months but he made me a better smith he my student at any rate nikephorus had a small party in celebration of the final sale the priest of hephaestos came and gave me the seal of syracusa as a master smith and nikephoruss daughter lydia came and sang she was a pretty girl fourteen years old all legs and hips and small breasts and shyness and i liked her i didnt get to see many women and she was lovely but i was a fool so after dinner when id had too much wine and was enjoying the sight of lydia dancing nikephorus leaned over shell make you fine babies he said julia never lost a one how about it none of us cares you were a slave marry lydia and youll have the shop when im a little older this struck me from a clear blue sky although in retrospect i was as i say a fool not to have seen it coming lydia was beautiful in her transparent ionian chiton of aegyptian linen probably her best garment with a flowing light himation falling in folds from her shoulders very fashionable and most likely her own work id proven my work id made the master some serious money and he had no son how had i failed to be prepared did i say he was a fine man when i looked stunned he laughed well every man thinks his own daughter the most beautiful since helen perhaps the idea sticks in your craw will you think on it he asked i nodded he leaned over im going to leave the two of you alone a little he said if you touch her he shrugged i nodded it is a funny thing a human thing i could have killed him any time he was no fighter but i feared him far more than he feared me he was the master smith he was a master too for all id just been raised to his level he seemed every day to know a thousand things i didnt know within an hour lydia was seated on the kline beside mine to sit on mine would have led to other pastimes with her arms around her knees she asked me questions slow questions about my past so i answered them after an hour julia came in and sat on lydias couch time for bed sweet she said she smiled easily at me have you bragged and bragged young man i nodded sheepishly i didnt want to marry lydia and be a bronzesmith i wanted to go to alba kill dagon and then go back and and what in that heartbeat it occurred to me that marrying lydia and being the best smith in mighty syracusa might be a golden future the shop offered me a challenge every day i could see a life where i made things with anaxsikles or competed against him to be the best there is as much arete in craft as in war standing in the haze of ares was like another life making marvellous things under nikephoruss guiding hand sleeping with lydia who even now gave me a look that made both of us blush i blushed and stammered julia laughed and i found myself in the darkness with my cheap chlamys around my shoulders and the first kiss of autumn weather in the air so that the city smell of cat piss and coriander was mixed with burning pine the night seemed a marvellous place i went and had a cup of wine at my new favourite wine shop and went back to my two rooms and there they all were faces beaming even neoptolymos was beaming theyd made almost two hundred drachmas theyd taken their cargo swiftly and safely earned a bonus and come home laden to the gunwales with etruscan olive oil and a small cargo of perfumes that had sold at a stiff profit before theyd even unloaded i added in fortyfive drachmas on my own account we all looked at each other and then we whooped like men giving the war cry so that our upstairs neighbours thumped their floor and our downstairs neighbour a prosperous whore thumped her ceiling now we need three hundred and fifty more said demetrios who could calculate on an abacus and write slowly with a stylus on a wax tablet i wrote better so i took over the scribes job slaves i asked cargo demetrios said and slaves and ropes and pitch for the hull even at that we really need five hundred more and we dont actually have three hundred drachmas daud said morosely i glared at him count it again then its about to be winter he said no sailing we have to eat even if we live off your smithing doola said we will only stay even and well all feel like kept men he laughed demetrios nodded its worse than that he said anarchos will know tomorrow what we made and hell be here for a cut ill cut him said daud im with you said neoptolymos were not bending over for him this time i fingered my beard it was odd for me to side with demetrios but i could see he was prepared to hand over something some facesaving amount of our profits and i agreed by the gods i agreed twenty drachma i said and another twenty to the temple of poseidon as first fruits we saw gaius daud said out of nowhere he grinned he wants to come to alba with us hes as poor as we are and he has to pretend to be rich his family werent altogether pleased when he came back doola said were sending him a letter to come down with another load of perfumes i nodded can we get one more load in before winter demetrios fingered his chin chancy but we knew we had to try the next morning i took ten drachma of my own money and went and bought myself a fine chlamys it wasnt as fine as some men wore but it was a beautiful redbrown with a fine blackpurple stripe and a field of embroidered stars i had admired it for two weeks and it gave me real pleasure to buy it from the maker for her full price i didnt haggle she grinned at me youre the new smith she said as she took my money going to marry our lydia are you boy news travels fast then i went to the silversmiths ghetto and traded six of my good bronze pins for one heavy silver cloak pin the smith came out and dealt with me in person i knew him from the gymnasium he fingered the chlamys i know that work he said its good to see a young man do well see that you stay among us dressed in my finery i went to the great temple of poseidon by the harbour and there i counted twenty drachma into the bronze urn by the entrance watched at a distance by one of anarchoss runners i knew most of them by now as i was in the city all the time a daypriest one of the citizens came and clasped my hand first fruits of a trading voyage i said he nodded but you are surely the new smith the one who fought at marathon he asked i shrugged i am also sometimes a trader a sailor he laughed any hellene serves the sea the god thanks you we do too we need a new roof from the temple with my cloak on pinned with fine silver i walked down to the waterfront where anarchos sat with his friends he had two big friends who stood behind him i stood at the edge of the terrace until a slave deigned to notice me and then one of the big men came and led me to the great mans presence he looked me up and down slowly and then gestured with his stick at the stool closest to him sit he said wine was brought you have something for me and you have brought it with a proper humility he said loudly because this being a patron of the lower orders was a performance art i nodded took a purse from a fold of my cloak and put it in his hands we put our first fruits in the temple i said so you have our second fruits he glanced in the bag and if he was disappointed he hid it well very proper he said with a firm nod he leaned forward nice cloak he said i may be courting i said he nodded so i hear although other things come to my ears you tried to mix with the citizens that was foolish i shrugged and smiled just for a moment i threw back my cloak and looked him in the eye lydia in a similar flash of the eye could convey i am a virgin and yet i burn with a fire so hot that you would flinch from it i could learn from a fourteenyearold girl in one flash of the eye i said i fought in the front rank at marathon and ive buried more enemies than youll ever have you may have the upper hand here but you do not want a fight then i dropped my eyes smiled and went back to my wine which was good wine he nodded leaned forward and put a hand on my shoulder he was not afraid of me that by itself was interesting i wish you luck smith your friends they are lucky to have you i think we understand each other i will continue to value your friendship when i own a shop i said he took a breath i let one go we both smiled i rose shook his hand as lesser man to greater and walked away a few paces on he called out are you really arimnestos of plataea i turned back yes i called he nodded when i got home doola was sitting by the door with a cudgel and neoptolymos and daud were in their leather armour i shook my head i told you so daud said to doola he fingered my cloak there goes all our profits demetrios raised an eyebrow it is done i said daud looked at me you are the brains here but i swear ari youll wish wed killed the bastard neoptolymos agreed we can take his whole gang and the citizens of the city and the courts demetrios nodded to me how much i bought the cloak from my own money i said a little defensively twenty for anarchos and twenty for poseidon daud shrugged and neoptolymos stared at the floor but doola clapped me on the back and now brothers i have a plan i looked around are we still going to alba a chorus of cheers erupted damn it makes me want to weep even now we had the dream the best dream men ever dreamed we were going to be heroes that dream bound us as thoroughly as iron manacles but better by far listen then i said anarchos wants to own us he wants to loan us money when we cant pay it hell own our boat and our lives and get his claws into a smith i shrugged ive been offered the bronzesmiths daughter friends you can imagine what response met this ill leave you to picture it friends because many of you are too young to hear the expressions that men use to each other heh heh listen you sexstarved oarsmen anarchos has every reason to want a piece of us i smiled so we risk it all we make another voyage to italy for perfume if we make it we make a good profit and then we go to anarchos to borrow money for a larger ship i looked around at them he wont loan us enough for us to succeed but he wont know how much we already have demetrios got it immediately we could never come back here again he said just thinking about it made him breathe heavily doola got it too so we take the great mans money and we just sail away apparently to etrusca for perfumes he laughed his great laugh daud joined the laughter and seckla and finally so did neoptolymos one of my better plans the next morning i realized that my plan had two painful flaws one was that i had to pretend that i was going to marry lydia or at least that i hadnt decided herein lies the complexity of the human heart my young friends when i was in nikephoruss shop i wanted to marry her i wanted that life when i was in my two rooms staring at the place amid the thatch where the money rested all i wanted was alba i was both men both men lied both told the truth and so though i had intended to make the dangerous winter crossing to italy with the boat i couldnt go if i had anarchos would have seen in a moment that i wasnt staying so i had to sit at home while they took the risks or sit in the andron of nikephoruss house with lydia playing the lyre or singing we were left together more and more lydia was quite sure we were to wed and she was quite prepared to move on quite aggressively prepared really she was perfectly modest she didnt grab my shoulders and push her tongue down my throat pardon me ladies but ive known it done but autumn turned to winter it grew colder and wetter outside and lydia wore less and less to our chaperoned evenings her mother either took no notice or cooperated actively things were said i remember one evening she finished a song and said in a matter of fact voice my best friend kissed her husband for months before they were wed she smiled and went back to playing the lyre when she danced her hips took on a life of their own when she handed me wine her fingers brushed mine listen my young friends a woman has natural defences against the assault of a man a woman is like a citadel im hardly the first to draw this analogy women are trained from birth to walk a fine line between desirability and availability whether a woman is a queen or a whore she knows how to draw that line men know nothing we only want it is not our place to refuse when a man is hunted by a woman he has no weapons no city wall no place of refuge refusal appears very like cowardice oh im just saying i taught anaxsikles in the shop and then we worked together i was learning from my master and teaching my apprentice i had very little to teach him but i recall we were making a pair of greaves and like all sicilian smiths he put a pair of intertwined snakes onto the front fancy and very beautiful his repousse was better than mine already perhaps his superiority made me petulant but his snakes had come to dominate the whole front of the greave and when he brought them to me for my approval i looked at them for a long time formulating my criticism it is hard to be an honest critic i was a little jealous of his skill the snakes themselves were beautiful yet in my heart i knew that i wouldnt have worn them why and was i just jealous so many grownup thoughts finally i put them down your repousse is superb i said he beamed better than mine i said he made noises of negation but i could see that he too thought his work was better and yet he wanted my admiration and my approval but with the snakes so deep look a spear point can catch here and punch right through into a mans leg the snakes stood so high out of the metal that their sinuous lines made a continuous catchment if i were fighting a man wearing them odd thought as i hadnt fought anyone in a long time he shrugged obviously uninterested in my criticism you dont believe me i said he shrugged with all the easy arrogance of the very young his shrug said you are a little jealous and thus liable to lie i know my repousse is without compare he didnt quite smile you dont believe me theres no spearman in the world who can place his point into so small a target he said i wanted to vanquish his youths ignorant arrogance put them on i said he was close enough to his customers size to clip them on his legs i fetched the masters spear from over the door effortlessly i flicked it at him and caught the incurve of the snake each time nicking the greave and making marks that would have to be polished out he shrugged i dont have a spear or an aspis he said i found both for him we squared off in the street i realized as we came on guard that lydia was watching out of her window on the exedra well ready i said my voice must have carried something anaxsikles paused and lowered his aspis you really can do it cant you he said yes i said grimly but he changed his mind settled his shield and laughed show me he said and his spear lashed out at my face i nudged his spear aside and put the point of my spear into the snakes curves anaxsikles screamed and fell my spear had gone right through a flaw and an inch into his shin no real ill came of it i helped him inside bandaged him and spent the next two weeks making a new greave to replace the one id ruined he put snakes on it less than one half the height of the last pair we drank a cup of wine together most nights and the little fight became quite famous in the smiths quarte not as a feat of arms but as an example of how seriously we took our business i might have been punished but instead like most things in those days it rebounded to make both of us appear serious in our work and lydia told me that i looked like a god well my friends had been gone eight weeks double their last trip i was walking home one evening from my gymnasium and a big man appeared at a corner i knew him immediately he was one of anarchoss men he jutted his chin at me i smiled and kept walking he ran after me his heavy footfalls loud on the street people turned to look and then studiously looked away the street was only twice the width of a mans shoulders but grown men managed to make it wider to avoid anarchoss men hey you he shouted i turned he stopped you heard me he shouted spittle flying he wanted a fight i didnt so i nodded i didnt understand i said anarchos wants you he said come so i followed him as it happened i had been training with polimarchos and i had my beautiful etruscan kopis under my arm but i felt no need to use it i had indeed changed i thought of the two thugs in athens id killed we walked in a light rain down to the waterfront the taverna was closed up tight and inside fifty lamp wicks gave the place the light of a temple and too much heat a central hearth fire burned and fishermen slave and free jostled for wine but around anarchoss table there was a clear space as wide as a mans hips he bade me sit as if we were old friends he got me a fine cup of wine you must be worried about your friends he said i nodded he looked concerned i could sell you information about them he said but i would be a poor patron if i did so here it is for free they are well they made the coast of etrusca well enough and bought their cargo but then they were plagued with trouble lost the boat bought another and have been penned in sybarus by adverse winds he shrugged they will make a little off this voyage but not enough to give poseidon twenty drachmas or me he said he shrugged again thanks i said with genuine feeling he looked at me again you are an odd fellow he said you truly value these men i stood yes like brothers he clasped my hand very well be at ease damn him he was so much easier to hate when he was being a moneygrubbing bastard and since i was going to swindle him i wanted to hate him the world it turns out is a very complicated place no man is the villain in his own tale every man has his reasons no matter how selfish or evil i went home more weeks passed i went with nikephorus and anaxsikles to the great winter religious festival they have in syracusa lydia carried a garland in the craftsmens part of the procession men commented on her two young aristocrats wrote her poems i was jealous so i wrote a poem for her myself oh the foolishness of men i am a fair poet better than my poetry is sapphos which i knew by heart and alcaeuss and anacreons and hipponaxs it is easy to write a good love poem when you know all the classics by heart i went home from the feast of the kore with rage and jealousy in my heart and i took wax and stylus and wrote a poem naming the parts of her body i adored each in turn adorned them with verse and crowned my technical achievement by starting each verse with a letter of her name i wrote it fair the next time i was served dinner by my master i put it in her hand she didnt react at all she scarcely noticed me in fact she made lovely small talk asked after my friends and then went on to talk of her new friends since the festival young women of the upper classes who had condescended to her before but now sought her out indeed nikephorus confessed to me that hed had new clients the last few days a gang of rich boys who wanted armour my daughter is the talk of the town he said happily and julia gave me a look as expressive in her way as any of lydias i took the bait and swallowed it whole several days passed i worked very hard and i exercised even harder but her eyes seemed to be everywhere for the first time in many years i didnt imagine briseis i didnt pine for my dead euphoria i didnt ever stop thinking about euphoria precisely but it was not her body i pictured in my arms the young sprigs came to be fitted for armour i fitted them and they were young emptyheaded and rich so they were easy to hate i guess they assumed i was a slave they wagered on which among them would have her first anaxsikles looked at me as if he expected me to kill one on the spot since our very short duel he saw me as achilles come to life funny if you think about it she appeared from time to time dressed to please in a carefully pleated chiton and blue himation and served wine ive never thought of bronze this way before said one sprig so ruddy said the second so hard said the third they thought they were the wits of the world they sailed out of the shop like triremes in a stiff breeze in that moment seeing her watch them with something like adoration i hated those three boys more than dagon and anarchos and my cousin simon all put together in one awful husk but they were gone i kept working and she went back to her rooms her father came in looked at the three roughedout helmets id done and the pairs of greaves anaxsikles had nearly finished and gave my arm a gentle squeeze well all weather this he said and be the richer and better for it he straightened up and admired a nearly complete sword hilt i had on the table id made a trade with a cutler so that i could have new swords for my friends im going out to meet friends he said lock up one by one the slaves and apprentices looked to me for permission to withdraw already in most minds i was the young master i remember anaxsikles kept polishing at a greave until he put it down in disgust i made a planishing error he said i cant polish that out go home i said look at it again in the morning he laughed grabbed his chiton and vanished then julia appeared in the shop with a cup of lukewarm wine housekeeping was never her strong point i need you to watch the house she said my mother needs me for an hour i went back to my work it was getting dark too fast for anything but general work and finally i missed a simple blow shook my head in disgust and frowned at the apprentice boy go home i said youre a good lad but i cant see to work he flushed at the praise and was out of the door before id washed my hands i went and drank julias warmed wine it was warm in the shop but cold outside and id left the wine far longer than i should have it was cold and had a fine layer of shop dust on the surface a bronze smithy is never clean i drank it off anyway i remember that taste so well i took the cup a fine piece of bronzework of course up the steps to julias kitchen i gave the cup to a kitchen slave a sikel she grinned you staying for dinner master she asked i shook my head not invited lass i said oh said the serving girl cook he aint staying cook a big italiote woman who never seemed to understand that she was a slave came out of the kitchen missy says you are staying to dinner young master and the mistress said so too said shed be home by now added the cook with a significant sniff well ill give you a nice bowl of hot water and a towel eh said cook is it true you was a slave said the girl i nodded twice she sighed id like to be free i washed my hands and face i had a lesson i was going to miss it and i wasnt sure why no thats a lie i knew exactly why i was missing it i was letting down my teacher i was distracting myself from my exercise and i was quite possibly about to betray my masters trust while deflowering his daughter thats why i stayed to dinner mens reasons are complex animals my young friends i told myself many things but here with you in the firelight of my own hearth i know i know that i wanted her and despite guest oaths and friendship and trust and even love i was willing to have her body not even for the sweet desirability of it but because other men wanted it and i could not stop myself from this contest bah fill my cup i disgust myself and i do not want to tell this part of the story lydia came down to dinner dressed like a goddess in a play like artemis as the patron of young women or athena as parthenos the virgin she had on a chiton of syrian linen dyed the colour of a stormy sea that must have cost as much as five of my helmets my critical eye saw that her pins had already ripped a line of very small holes in the cloth along the contrasting linentape edges of pure white over the chiton which fell to the floor she wore a himation of wool that was almost transparent and fell in frilly folds to the floor just off white with a stripe of pure tyrian purple in her hair was a fillet of white linen tape and on her feet lydia had the most beautiful feet on her feet she wore sandals of gold in fact they were leather with gold leaf laid carefully over the sandals and again i could see where she had now worn them enough that the gold had come away from the very top of the arch of leather over her foot noticing these things is not the same as caring she was as beautiful as a goddess her face was radiant and her carriage was proud and erect every line of her body showed through the fabric she had muscles on her legs and arms that enhanced her posture the girl with the golden sandals has shot me with the dart of love i said i knew my poets a man of twentysix has every advantage with a girl of fifteen compared to any other possible suitor i was better i was better and i should have known better as well i led her to the table i clapped my hands for the slaves and when they came i pointed at lydia does she not look like a goddess i asked cook gave her a hug and the two girl slaves curtsied and we sat to dine if we had been aristocrats id have reclined i suppose ive honestly only eaten by myself about a dozen times in my life shed have sat in a chair or even fed herself in the kitchen but this had developed a sense of occasion and so i sat in a chair men did you know back then and cook served us herself we had chicken with a lovely herb sauce thickened with barley and thick bread with olive tapenade and some other opson that was made with tuna and highly spiced at every remove we expected julia home one of the slaves brought us honeyed almonds which were a special treat as we knew cook didnt really like the mess the slave girl had obviously sticky fingers and a lot of honey around her mouth and lydia and i both saw it our eyes met and we laughed aloud and her foot rubbed up along the length of the inside of my leg and she looked at me an openly curious look it said i surprised myself there but now that ive done it what do we think we drank wine it wasnt great wine nikephorus didnt drink great wine he bought good darkred local stuff and he liked it but it was good wine and we had two cups each and then we shared a cup this is where i went over the edge when i went to the cupboard and took down the kantharos cup with two handles i knew exactly what i was doing but i had crossed over her eyes were huge as she drank and our hands touched a great deal we sat for a long time just looking at each other our now bare feet busy in my head i was screaming at myself to get up and walk away i was going to sail to alba lydia was not coming i eventually got up to wash my hands almonds in honey are sticky as i rose i saw that lydias chiton had come a long way above her knee the sight inflamed me i have so many excuses i walked to the kitchen cook was smiling as i washed my hands if i didnt know you was pledged to each other she said she frowned then grinned lasciviously but i do never a word will be spoken eh i gave her a silver drachma there was a knock at the slave door and a willowy boy stuck his head in and was instantly abashed since he had to assume i was the master what do you want boy i asked just he said witlessly cook made a cooing noise hes the maters boy she said what do you want petrio he made a sort of sketchy bow only my mistress says she is sick and could you send fennel and mistress julia says shell be another hour at least and please do not tell the young people he looked at me and thats all she said i smiled cook frowned you aint supposed to have heard that she said petrio ran for it i shrugged and went back to the andron lydia was standing by the door to the portico her back was to the steps to the exedra and i assumed she was about to go i stepped up to her i have no idea we kissed who started it who stopped why no idea we were in a patch of absolute shadow and we were fools and my hands roved her body and hers began hesitantly and then with increasing knowledge to roam mine cook walked right up behind us and dropped a plate the crack of the plate was like a dose of cold salt water cook glared at me i had lydias chiton around her hips a hand deeply inside her himation and all the pins off her right shoulder she blushed shook her clothes into place and bolted up into the exedra i had very little to repair so i was left with cook who stood with her arms crossed glaring at me dont tell the young people cook said that means she didnt want you necking in the portico thats what i heard i nodded and bowed you had better marry her cook said she shook her head the weary motion women make when men are involved youll understand me better if you know that while i was repentant all i could think of as i walked home was the perfect smoothness of her skin the hard tip of her nipple under my hand the softness well girls you can giggle all you like im helping you understand the enemy because men need only the touch of a breast to turn from lovers to predators sometimes less than that and what do you get a man gets an hours pleasure and a woman gets if shes unlucky pregnancy and death but your bodies are built to tell you otherwise and when a mans hand is on a womans thigh does she think of childbirth of artemis coming for her spirit as the baby wails no nor does the man i can tell you even with a porne the smart ones are careful gathering seed in a sponge or using other ways im making you all blush ill stop but listen girls the joy is the same for both its the price thats different the next day i went to the shop and worked at lunch for the first time i can remember lydia came down into the shop with a chunk of bread and some excellent cheese and a cup of wine when she put the wine into my hand her whole hand wrapped around mine she smiled up into my eyes and then slipped away with grace i wanted her all the time that afternoon without any connivance the two of us came together in the corridor behind the kitchen and there wasnt another person in sight slave or free before we could breathe we were in each others arms drinking deep her hand was under my chiton on my hip and mine we had perhaps ten heartbeats and we almost managed to make love luckily we heard movement and we broke it was all just a matter of time and in between these trysts i cursed myself for a fool and a coward and a liar leading her on and i swore not to have her the problem is you see that it no longer mattered men make much of the act of sex but it is the act of possession and love that makes the bond i didnt need to ride her she had given herself we hadnt made a baby but we had made a pact and i knew i wasnt going to keep it liar betrayer i thought that i could play her along until i was ready to leave and let her down easily but i never even tried i wanted her body and soul but not enough youll note to change my plans or take her with me the next day was the same but i had begun to hedge my bets i kissed her when i knew that cook was close by and would end it see theres no way to tell this to make myself good and i still wanted her every minute when i saw her all my friends vanished the boat was a chimera and i was willing to be a smith in syracusa for life and then at the whim of the gods our boat came back they had a better boat as soon as she was pulled up on the shingle i could see she had almost double the cargo space and she was better built the tongues of wood that held the planks together were tightly placed and beautifully pegged the steering oars rather than grey with age were shining golden wood new and very handsome they had perfumes and some etruscan tin the etruscan mines are small and stingy and the etruscans dont let much out of the country but gaius had arranged the sale and the tin gave us an entry into the trade it was a step two steps as we drank that night in a wine shop doola pointed proudly at our new boat we call her amphitrite he said she rides the waves like a girl riding a man with passion he lifted his cup and we all drank and seckla put wine on the floor for luck so doola was hesitant and they all looked at me we want to change the plan a little seckla said all in a rush his hands moved as he spoke we want to get into the tin trade first by selling the load we have down the coast in the sikel communities where demetrios has friends and then demetrios couldnt take it any more amphitrite can take a longer voyage he said we take her to massalia in gaul we load tin there and we see if we can get someone to tell us about the north then when weve sold some cargoes how long i asked doola was the only one to meet my eyes two years he said maybe three until weve got secure trade connections in massalia and etrusca and latinium etrusca is rich brother theres no reason for us to be here sicily is not the hub etrusca is i laughed shook my head hows gaius i asked hes going to come back to us with a small ship of his own neoptolymos said we visited his city its a dung heap compared to syracusa daud said he shrugged and everything they have is taken from my people but they are rich and they buy tin all ten cities eleven cities however many they pack more cities into the plains of tusca than we have cities in all of gaul i shook my head ive got myself into trouble i admitted if i stay here two years ill be a married shopowner with a pot belly and four kids and no mistake their faces fell for the very first time it occurred to me that we might part ways somewhere in another world off to the east i had a ship a family some wealth and the burnedout remains of a prosperous farm i could always make a go of it there i could marry lydia and take her to plataea i could go and find briseis by aphrodite friends i never ever forgot briseis for more than ten heartbeats even then heh if we do as you suggest i said to doola we work our way up to the alba run gradually i see the value in it but it is my observation i hear the gossip here that the carthaginians have all but closed the gates of heracles i dont know of any ship greek or etruscan that trades with iberia or alba they carry it all and they sink anyone who tries to run the gauntlet am i right neoptolymos took a swig of wine while keeping me in the corner of his eye and he gave a hard grin that sounds like a fight doola nodded biting his lip its true gaius is a trader and hes filled your heads with trade im a bronzesmith but im also a warrior if we go to alba even if we only go to the north coast of iberia we will have to fight and sail and sneak and fight again if we must and if we spend two or three years learning the trade the bastards will see us coming we need to take them by surprise a crew of nobodies a ship they dont know two ships demetrios said with a shrug amphitrite goes too we can fill her full of stores and take a rowed ship for speed when we need it two ships double the profit and make it more likely one gets home i shrugged right back at him ten ships a couple of triremes seckla punched me in the arm when i touch our patron for money hes not going to want to let us sail away i said not without security i shrugged again if we do it we cant ever come back here in fact i knew i wasnt coming back anyway oh the gods must have laughed well i had their attention listen i said we can build our second ship right now we must have five hundred drachmas i have more due to me at the shop you have more in the tin lets get the hull under way when its finished we hire rowers to get us to wherever slaves are cheap and we buy them and train them ourselves now doola said i gave another shrug or we give up the whole enterprise look it is insane were six former slaves and were going to take on the carthaginian trade empire and sail across the outer sea to alba i agree we can stay home make money take wives and be fat doola smiled bitterly i knew my plan would founder on the rock of your desire for heroism i shook my head no it doesnt have to be like that if we all say so were absolved of our oaths and we can walk away but they all shook their heads thats how fate works we knew we wanted something impossible but we werent willing to give it up the next day doola demetrios and i hired horses and rode along the coast to marissilia a little port full of fishing boats around the corner from syracusa it was sixty stades from the taverna where anarchos sat and ruled the waterfront i knew it wasnt far enough but i had a master to serve and work to do and my time and funds were limited we walked from boatbuilder to boatbuilder the two largest were scarcely interested in our triakonter and the smaller didnt have the labour to build her the triakonter or thirtyoared ship was the backbone of most small military expeditions and was also the most useful size for a rowed merchant ship the day was lost lydia vanished into the womens quarters with her courses and i was able to work without interruption to meet my masters eye and to ask for another day off and receive it as well as a purse with sixty drachma my share of five helmets all completed the greaves and breastplates were now on my part of the shop floor i went and trained boxed sparred with the wooden swords and polimarchos put bruises into my side thats for standing me up you ingrate whoreson he growled i hope she was worth it your trainer always knows i was having trouble with my life i kept different parts in different jars i was a smith i was an athlete i was a sailor i was looking for a shipbuilder but i couldnt ask nikephorus to help me because that would lead very quickly to some shocking admissions that meant i couldnt ask polymarchos anything either or it would be known throughout the guild in a matter of days on one of those evenings as the cold winter rain fell and the masseur worked my muscles i remember two middleaged men both smiths coming and sitting on my bench they were goodnatured but firm youre cutting into our business you scamp one said he was diodorus a master armourer who worked in a different street i knew him well the other i didnt know as well charge more for your damned helmets the younger man said or make them worse they both laughed but i took their point immediately and when i went back to nikephorus he nodded ive heard the same well raise our price and refuse a few commissions im sorry lad but i dont want diodorus to decide to go back to casting brooches he used to and he gave it up so that i could have that part of the business he tugged his beard and looked at me under his bushy eyebrows dont take it personally but you have to work with people that meant i was going to make a great deal less money on the other hand i was lucky my master had shared the money with me from the start im making some pieces for trade and the panoplies for lydias suitors i said with a smile that was false after that ill stick to stock for a while he ruffled my hair i felt the traitor i was lydia misses you he said and grinned whens the wedding i shook my head put my eyes down and tried to hide not discussed yet he nodded best discuss it he said and rose to his feet soon i left work and walked down to the port where neoptolymos and i watched a dancer while drinking decent wine she was good but i remember thinking at her every gyration that lydias hips were more expressive when she rose from her seat than this golden girl was as she moved ah lust eros we gave her the tips she expected from a couple of men and finished our amphora of wine and then we wandered the waterfront peering into boats ill need a trireme to get my place back neoptolymos said out of the darkness ill find us one when its time i said this will sound foolish but i own a trireme if she still swims above the waves ill put her at your service he was sitting on the dogs head that held the mooring lines for a pair of smugglers owned by anarchos pretty little twentyoared boats with lines like racehorses he laughed youre an odd one you own a trireme you fought at marathon yet you are living in a tenement in syracusa with a pack of former slaves trying to sail around the world he punched me why in hades dont we take your poseidonforsaken trireme to gades and alba eh i shook my head it was hard to explain and i didnt really want to but if i go back i have to go back i said lamely political power my farm my family war athens i realized that i sounded angry i was angry what was i angry at what happened neoptolymos asked he leaned forward and put a hand on my arm its none of my business we all trust you but you have things none of us has none of us but bloody gaius its funny that youre the one pressing us to move faster as you are the one who has somewhere else to go ill never take back my little kingdom even if i do ill never make it right my sister told me to be careful of pirates and i left her to her death a horrible death he stared at the stars and wept i hugged him dont be an arse brother you did not rape your sister you did not kill her you are not responsible or rather i thought of heraclitus rather yes you made an error and you can atone for it by finding dagon and putting a spear up his arse at my crudity he raised his face you are a good hater he said i have imagined killing him twenty thousand times i said killing who asked a gruff voice anarchos came out of the darkness with a halfdozen of his minions he owned the boats he wasnt the one out of place a phoenician named dagon i said with perfect honesty anarchos frowned whether in real interest or simulated i could not tell but then he shrugged i hear you are looking to build a boat he asked his flunkeys stood around him trying to look tough which is difficult in the dark one of them had a torch and it didnt throw enough light for anyone yes i said a triakonter big enough for the tin trade a little truth goes a long way you have a regular source with the etruscans anarchos asked he was really interested we all knew this could lead to big money i shrugged anarchos stepped up close to me so i could smell the onion on his breath you have a problem my young friend everyone i know is waiting for you to marry the bronzesmiths daughter some say shes already baking your bread in her oven eh and yet other people tell me you are looking to get a ship built he eyed me his head a little to one side like a curious dog and i say to myself i say it what if hes playing her for a fool shit anarchos was that smart and that was going to make it nearly impossible to take him for money and i wondered does the old smith know his new young master is building a ship anarchos was very close and very quiet not that id tell him unless i had reason i am after all a reasonable man and your patron he took a step back i have six shipyards under my thumb arimnestos of plataea i think you know this so i have to wonder why you dont come to me and then i have to find you in the dark and ask you all this and it seems to me that your slave friends have just made a fine profit on a voyage but not an obol has found its way to me i wonder if we dont need a little reminder of how this ought to work eh its hard to glare at a man by torchlight i will apologize for our oversight i said slowly and bring you our contribution in the morning and you must understand patron that i might be a little shy about using your boatyards i dont wish to say any more about it but i have two yards that need work and can build your ship by giving this work to either one i am more important and my patronage is secure and you would deny me this he laughed as a man will when explaining a sticky problem to an infant i shrugged in the darkness we are not rich men i said but i will try your yards ah you sound as if you are doing me a favour and perhaps you are you are an odd duck plataean you demand to be treated differently from all the rest of my clients and i do treat you differently you think im a fool ive held this waterfront for thirty years i know what kind of man you are dont treat me as a fool and we will continue as friends come and drink wine with me tomorrow patron he laughed you know what is funny plataean you think you are a better man than i you dont want to drink wine with a crime lord eh you have aristocrat embroidered on your forehead and yet i like you and i let you do things that i would kill other men for doing like refusing to drink with me and ill go further ill bet that youve killed men and taken their gold without a qualm just like me and you have friends and allies who depend on you like i do you keep your word so do i he pointed at me and the torchlight caught the grey in his hair and made it flare i give you my word that if you come and drink with me you will not regret it and neither will your friends he turned on his heel and walked up the wet stones to his house leaving me with neoptolymos and a body full of the daimon of combat i had been so sure he was going to attack us the next evening i appeared at his house wearing a good ionian chiton of my own and over it a decent himation id bought secondhand of my friends only doola wanted to come and i wasnt sure that an african however dignified was going to win anarchos over slaves took my stick and my himation and i went into his andron which was beautifully appointed more like that of a very rich merchant than a street fixer he had a pair of marble amphorae on columns they must have been a thousand years old his kline were all ionian work like the ones on which briseis and i made love with wicker mats on a fruitwood frame i sank onto mine a slave took my sandals and i was given a cup of red wine he was on the other kline and he raised his head over the arm rest so you came he said im surprised after all my ranting last night ill have to kill a rival to convince my bullies im still tough i laughed i wanted to hate him but in truth i liked him for all the reasons he named we had a great deal in common tell me about your boat he said i have our contribution i said he shook his head thats business bring it to me in public this is private no witnesses no attribution ill take no revenge for what you say here so speak the truth or keep your breath in the fence of your teeth the six of us had debated all day what we should do daud and neoptolymos were for instant flight over the sea to etrusca doola and demetrios and i were for looking at what the crime lord had to offer he can sell us to the phoenicians seckla said he certainly had anarchos sized up not if hes in love with ari doola said he gave me a wicked smile daud looked away you two make me uncomfortable he said the keltoi dont take the love of men for men with the ease that greeks do and etruscans and aegyptians and everyone else for that matter barbarians not if he sees real profit doola said we represent a long shot at a lot of money friends lets not undersell our own possibilities i am not saying we should share the whole truth with the whoreson just that if he really can get our boat built he might be an ally an untrustworthy ally but an ally doola he put everything so well so i was allowed to bargain with anarchos i leaned on the arm of my own kline and smiled we want to enter the tin trade i admitted we have the skills we have the ability to do things few other men understand i know what tin looks like at every stage i can buy at the side of the stream or at the mine head we can navigate and sail theres tin at massalia in gaul and it comes from upcountry theres tin in the mountains behind the tuscan plain and theres tin in illyria we have an illyrian a gaul and an etruscan i shrugged i cant be plainer than that anarchos drank his wine and his slaves bustled to refill the cup another oddity he didnt have the terrified slaves of a bad master he had the sort of slaves we all want to have they were mostly silent but when anarchos made a witticism they smiled or even laughed interesting and you can do all this with a triakonter he asked well yes and the ship we have now i shrugged and ten more when we get into the trade and who protects you from the phoenicians he asked their triremes are cruising for you even now he shook his head i made enquiries about this dagon he is quite famous infamous a slaver he fingered his beard a typical fucking carthaginian he looked at me seriously ari may i call you that listen in syracusa we all hate them its the unifying force that binds the commons and the lords together and sooner or later they will get their forces together and come for us iberians keltoi their own poieni infantry their crack cavalry force theyll load them on ships and try and finish us off they mean to control all the trade in the eastern sea and we are in the way he drank is this about revenge on this dagon i dont finance revenge and when dealing with carthage anyone who sails from syracusa does so under a death sentence why should i wager on you no reason at all i said you invited me and told me to speak my mind ive always wanted to fit out a couple of big privateers for cruising against carthage he said i laughed listen anarchos last night you did me the honour of telling me a thing or two and now ill tell you straight back ive been a pirate with miltiades know the name of course so yes ive killed men and taken their gold taken their ships and pushed them men into the sea taken the women and given them to my men i leaned over to him i never meant to be that man but thats the man i was for a while its not a bad life if you stay drunk and dont think too much i nodded theres men who can live like that all the time im not one of them something tells me you arent really either the captains youd need to run a couple of corsairs they wouldnt be men you could hope to control and in a year less if they were successful the assembly would have to have you executed with five triremes miltiades virtually strangled the whole trade of aegypt dyou get me he nodded i wasnt even lying if we go for some tin and succeed well its no ones business but ours eh if we go to sea to take the ships of carthage its only a matter of time i shrugged and lay back and a slave refilled my cup the odds against you he said the odds are balanced by the payoff if we succeed what are a thousand talents of tin worth i remember waving my hands in the air he laughed what is my silence with your jilted lover worth he asked i sat up relax ari i really mean no harm but it is clear to me that you are never going to be a settled bronzesmith try as you will you arent going to marry that girl youre going to go sailing off to massalia or alba he laughed damn him albas too hard i said knowing that hed guessed it all hmm he said glad you know that i know a dozen men who claim theyve been there youll find more in massalia but no two of them tell the same tale and im not sure that alba isnt a myth that carthage uses to hide the source of all that white tin i shrugged he might have been right except that daud knew where alba was it was an edge other rivals wouldnt have had were close to war with carthage even now that war is going to collapse our economy how much money do i have to put in my bet with you and whats my profit he sat up too i drank almost a cup of wine trying to find a path through all the lies the subterfuge the desires of my friends the needs of the group sticking men with a spear is much much simpler your friend miltiades is leading an expedition against paros anarchos added well that didnt tempt me he was now the great man hed always wanted to be i lay back im done with all that i said he leaned in and i realized this was what he wanted to talk about more than the trade why tell me why plataean you have a name you survived slavery and now you are here if you really are who you say you are for a few months i told myself that the bronzesmiths daughter held you why not shes a beauty but now i see that you are using her you really are a man like me arent you he leered and yet if you are why not go back to miltiades hes living high now hell be tyrant of athens if he takes paros or greater hes building an empire in the east i remember sighing i said im done with all that i remember responding i sat up on my couch listen i came as close to death as a man can come i want a life a real life but not a wife and a home he shot back i am what i am i said he shook his head we lay in silence i remember listening to slaves in the kitchen bickering about whether to serve the next course or not what do you need he asked we need to build our ship and we need thirty good oarsmen in a perfect world theyd be slaves willing to work through to freedom for shares i shrugged slave oarsmen arent what you want in a tight spot i have reason to know he chuckled you have no doubt encountered the local attitude about slavery he said oh yes i said he shook his head in a year war with carthage may change everyones tune he said id want five to one for every silver mina i put in three to one five to one five to one and i do you the justice that its a straight business deal in which im a member that is i make sure the yard deals straight i help find the oarsmen and i dont play the patron about control in exchange you give me your word your absolute word that you will bring your tin here and sell it through me and give me my share first if you make it i blinked five to one of course we could sail away and never come back and another thing he said youre going to spurn despoina lydia so how can i believe youll come back my word my oath to the gods didnt you give her the same he said that stung and like most comments that enrage you it was true so you marry her he said and tell old nikephorus the truth then ill know you plan to come back marry her and sail away i said isnt that better than not marrying her and sailing away he asked let me ask you oh bold veteran of marathon when she kills herself how will you feel something cold gripped the bottom of my stomach and my heart he laughed you know the hard men to touch are the dead ones who feel nothing men like you you are easy you care i could make you do a great many things simply by seizing on your own notions of right and wrong and twisting he put his wine cup down but i wont heres my price marry the girl and give me five to one ill put up a couple of mina in silver ill coax the shipwrights and youll start with a wellfound ship no one loses in fact i think im actually doing a good deed and if you make it back everyone will benefit he raised his cup i raised mine we drank let me say this a local thug is a dangerous nuisance a crime lord is often a much more complex animal anarchos was a man who under other circumstances would have ruled a city ive seldom known anyone so intelligent so attuned so terrifying it took me ten days to face nikephorus i actually started several times in a small voice so small he walked past and called out to an apprentice and the day moved on finally the day before the spring feast of demeter i caught him writing at his work table we need to talk i said he looked at me we certainly do he said my daughter is very unhappy i nodded i want to marry her i said but i have a problem and i want to admit it to you he nodded you are already married i shook my head she died i loved her very much that is not what this is about he nodded i could tell he was gritting his teeth i wasnt doing well i want to take an expedition to massalia to buy tin i said it may be more than that i held up my hand silencing his protest for a moment i am not what you think master i am a smith but i am also a warrior and sometimes a sea captain i tried to read his expression i wish to ask her to marry me but i wish you to know that if i die at sea i have nothing to leave her i think you want a son to manage the shop and i am not that man he sat back and polished a bronze cup on his writing table absently but thoroughly he was angry i could see the anger in the red blotches on his face and in his posture finally he got up leave this house he said my curse on you you have lied and your lies have hurt us all my daughter loves you my wife loves you i love you and this is what you give us that you wish to run away to sea he shook his head slowly have i treated you badly that this is what you repay me with i opened my mouth i was shocked i had expected well i had expected it would all be fine i wanted lydia at this point i was aware that julia was keeping the girl from me for our mutual protection so to speak and in my worst nightmares i hadnt imagined that nikephorus would send me from the door i walked to the door in a haze dont go to the gymnasium you will never work in this town again he said i stopped in the doorway all youth and bluster why i asked i love her i mean i paused i never meant to hurt any of you really he asked and closed the door i walked slowly towards our tenement before id gone a hundred steps i heard a woman shriek it was the sound men made when they knew a wound was mortal the sound women made when childbirth became too much to be borne i prayed to poseidon to heracles to apollo and to aphrodite they ignored me because i had done this myself and of course to her anarchos sent me word by a thug that our deal was off the thug said it in just that way the patron says the deal is off but he says no hard feelings eh the bruiser shrugged i shrugged too we understood each other perfectly the bruiser the crime lord and i i drank too much for the first time in my life that is i drank too much quite regularly for several days doola found me drinking in the morning of the third day and collected me and my bad temper and led me home were putting to sea he said its winter i answered none of them ever questioned me about the failure of my plan or the loss of my work or anything they stood by the hull of our boat just about the same length as four horses and together we pushed her down into the water on rollers we warped her around to the pier that small merchants and smugglers used and we loaded salt fish in bales the bilge was already full of small amphorae even in my mood of abject selfhatred i was curious whats in those wine i asked seckla they didnt look like wine amphorae unless it was a very fine vintage seckla shrugged doola got a deal he said doola grinned fish oil from the euxine he helped me hoist a bale of dried fish the importer died and i bid at his estate auction it may be worthless but i paid about the value of the jars well everyone else was pulling his weight even if i had failed we got to sea with a favourable breeze i hadnt sailed in months i didnt know the boat and i was miserable and temperamental i objected to everything disliked the way the sails were stowed disliked the placement of the helmsmans bench on and on everyone stayed out of my way and of course i saw that i was not in command demetrios was in command since my first slavery i have always been a leader often the leader to see how well demetrios commanded them in fact he didnt command at all he merely indicated what needed to be done and it was done he did it with smiles and shrugs it made perfect sense hed been running the boat for months without me but it was another blow luckily for me we had a storm i dont remember the storm very well it came up slowly and i remember that we had time to tie everything down to run cables to the masthead to brail up the sail until it was just a scrap of heavy weather canvas time for each man to prepare himself a nest against the gunwales where he could be warm and dry well thats a lie but miserable in as much comfort as he could manage we were well north of sicily in the etruscan sea and we had plenty of sea room so we set the helm and sailed with the wind and waves under the windward quarter our boat climbed each wave bobbing like a cork and seemed to skid along the crest with an odd bumping motion until we slid down towards the next trough it wasnt the biggest sea id ever seen and the sky never took on the purpleblack colour i associate with the worst weather but it took me outside myself focused me on survival and teamwork the storm took three days to blow itself out and on the morning of the fourth we were scudding along in a stiff winter breeze in bright sunshine the sea was a deep blue the whitecaps were a startling white and the mainland of italy was visible on the horizon and i felt better we made landfall none of us knew where we were but after a day tacking north we saw a cluster of rocks that doola and demetrios recognized and then we were in the estuary of the po one of the larger rivers on the etruscan plain we entered the mouth of the river got our mast down and landed in the mud and grassy fields of italy it had been a remarkable passage with a fine landing and in midwinter such a passage was worth a trip to the temple and the sacrifice of a young ram we were the only foreign boat in the river mouth after a meal on the fruits of our sacrifice we slept and headed upriver the wind and current were against us and we had to row all the way even a small boat is a heavy burden with four rowers and we had to row near our peak effort to make any headway at all we rowed for about half a day and gave it up and spent another night in the estuary ostia thats what the village is called i remember that the wine was good we were windbound for four days and despite the rain on the fifth we were stircrazy and we set out again with rested muscles and a gentle breeze at our backs we got the sail up and between the fitful breeze and our new strength we got upriver at a walking pace all day that night we slept on the boat a tangle of arms and legs in a gentle but sprayfilled wind my cloak soaked through and my spare on the third day out we made rome despite dauds carping rome was and is a fine town with handsome buildings the core town is not much bigger than plataea and i could see real similarities they call plataea green plataea for the contrast between our tilled fields and the desert that is most of greece italy is fertile but romes surrounding plains are astonishingly fertile the farms are larger than anything at home with twostory houses roofed in thatch built around central courtyards there was a fine temple visible from the water it was painted in bright colours with an impressive colonnade we arrived on a sunny afternoon and the red tile roof seemed like the welcoming hand of zeus extended to us the town itself was unwalled and seemed to have both planned and unplanned elements hundreds of small houses built like peasant huts in greece shacks really and then a cluster of public buildings and larger houses the waterfront and the ford over the river seemed the focal points but perhaps that is merely a sailors perspective we beached on mud below the ford the bank had been so completely cleared of trees as to make it very difficult to moor our boat after i had stood for what seemed like a long time searching the bank for an old stump a small boy appeared he spoke in a foreign tongue and held out his hand i had no idea what he was saying he wasnt speaking etruscan after several sallies i understood that he wanted six coppers the words were enough like greek to make them out especially when he ticked them off on his fingers doola jumped ashore it was the same last time hell find a place to moor us doola laughed and paid the boy in sicilian obols the boy looked at them squinted at doola and then nodded sharply two other boys came out with a heavy stake and a maul drove the stake into the bank and moored us bow and stern romans can make money out of anything doola remarked seckla ran off on his long legs to find gaius and we set to unloading the boat there was a pier but the charges were exorbitant and the bank was firm enough to get our bales of dry fish over the side and onto our tarpaulins with relative ease before the tenth bale was ashore a dozen men had appeared to sneer at our fish and before the twentieth bale was ashore doola was bargaining furiously gaius appeared in the midst of this embraced every one of us handed round a flask of wine and then issued a set of rapidfire orders in the local tongue he ordered four bales of fish set aside for his own use he changed the bid price in the ongoing dickering and he asked me to fetch him one of the jars of fish oil i had in effect been demoted to the level of holding mooring lines and fetching fish oil and i was fine with that i wanted to work to be useful he broke the seal on the first amphora and a smell hit us that was like raw human sewage it was incredible he grinned and dipped the tip of a finger into the stuff well no one likes the smell they say you can smell the factories in the euxine from a hundred stades away he tasted it and grinned in greek he said four for me the rest ill find a proper buyer for those he had a donkey which he left with us and he walked away he was wearing a good himation and carried a stick like a gentleman and he appeared unhurried but when i got the next armload of the heavy little amphorae ashore gaius was gone he came back with a trio of slaves and a wagon doola and demetrios had sold ten of the amphorae at a healthy two silver coins apiece a wild profit and we had covered the costs of the voyage on the salt fish sailing in winter is dangerous but the profits are excellent if you live in the dead of winter a spot of fish stew a cup of good wine a taste of fine fish sauce these mean more in fact by the time gaius returned daud and neoptolymos werent unloading any more they were standing guard with spears over the bales of fish no one threatened violence and there was no outandout theft but no one thought the two warriors were slacking either we made a good profit the fish oil was not all good in fact about one amphora in three was ruined or too old but what was good was very good doola had performed his usual miracle and we cleared almost fifty drachmas or their local latin equivalent we climbed up the capitoline hill and made sacrifice at the temple of jupiter optimus maximus they like the etruscans had the same gods as hellenes but with different names some interesting and some barbaric minerva for athena jupiter for zeus and so on jupiter optimus maximus is zeus greatest and best and was worshipped in much the same way as our zeus sator poseidon neptune in rome was not much worshipped but we gave him our sheep to the puzzlement of the two priests both of whom were prominent local aristocrats just as they are at home gaius introduced us to everyone as his companions in slavery which didnt seem to have anything of the same stigma in roma that it had in syracusa the town was too small to hold our interest long and had no shipbuilding i saw some fine metalwork most of it done by slaves and i was very impressed by the etruscanstyle painting on plaster which seemed to me much better than that which i had seen in boeotia and as good as the painting in attica we picked up a cargo of tanned hides rich creamy leather from mature cattle we got over two hundred hides at a good price not a great price but a good one and a hundred big amphorae of local wine and gaius handed his share of the cash to his wife and came aboard none of us asked him about it and he didnt say much but he was happy to be at sea and to be working im guessing but i think that the life of a penniless etruscan aristocrat in rome didnt agree with him he had obligations he could barely fulfil and he was a drain on his family he never said so but i saw how happy his wife was to receive ten good athenian drachmas it can be hard being an aristocrat if you work people make fun of you you have to figure out a cunning way to make some money without appearing to get your hands dirty unless you own a lot of land gaius didnt own a lot of land but he wasnt afraid to work once we were safely at sea and so we did it again winter can be a cruel mistress but we were blessed again and we made sardinia in two days and then did what demetrios was best at we coasted along until we found a town that wanted our hides some of the men of the town were sikels and demetrios did most of the work and we sold our hides at a profit sold some of our wine took on another cargo including copper and sailed for marsala marsala is a greek town for all that the phoenicians established it it is mostly phocaeans and when we made landfall it made me homesick at least for greece marsala looks like greece the harbour is magnificent and the two beaches are fine white sand we beached stern first and ran the boat up above the tide line with the help of a dozen locals for a few coppers then we propped the hull to keep it sound and began unloading hawknosed phoenicians came down to look at our wares and tattooed keltoi tanned greeks and even a couple of blond iberians everyone expressed a unified contempt for our sour roman wine and our ugly hides and our poorquality sardinian copper and then one of the phoenicians offered us a handsome profit for a single sale the whole cargo he was a big man with a nose bigger than some mens faces and he thumped his stick at doola everything he said one hundred and fifty drachma take it or leave it and no shillyshally other men began to shout doola nodded no he said the phoenician shrugged turned on his heel and walked off attended by two slaves a cold wind blew along the bay and the islands off the coast were showing spray off their sandbars but as if his offer had changed the mood the other potential buyers began to bid they were like sharks on the corpse of a whale as soon as one made a buy two more would go after doola as if he was the enemy id never seen it like this rome for example had been much calmer i went to his shoulder with some notion of supporting him but demetrios pulled me back this is his element he said let him swim the frenzy lasted less than an hour but by the end of it doolas clay pot held more than two hundred drachma and we had four damaged hides a dozen amphorae of wine and one single ingot of copper doola looked at the young gaul standing there ill give you whats left for two silvers he said the copper alones worth twice that the man beamed with gratitude doola took his cash and we had an empty hull he gave me the clay pot full of silver it doesnt pay to be too greedy he said we were lucky the only cargo on the beach i shrugged under the weight of the pot this is going to sound foolish i said but why did you refuse the first offer he met your price doola rocked back and laughed his laugh did he i couldnt work it all out so i assumed he was under my price he shook his head demetrios laughed too you made almost twice that neoptolymos was carrying our belongings there was nothing in the boat to guard but the oars and we paid a local gallic boy to handle that are we there yet he asked we sat in a very greek taverna with two pretty slave girls ten big wooden benchtables and nets hanging from the rafters we might have been in piraeus he poured the takings out on the table and added the sicilian money from a leather wallet he wore all the time we had a lot of money so much money that the innkeeper came down from his perch and leaned into our group sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings gents but theres no watch here and some hard men just sent runners for help thats too much money to show in here he stepped back and raised his hands i dont want trouble and i dont want corpses doola shook his head in disgust i should have known demetrios looked around the taverna was empty i felt like a fool i was a hard man and i tended to watch these things for the rest of them but after two months black depression i was rising to the surface and the money and the feeling of victory had excited me too much my eyes met those of neoptolymos and then we were arming gaius didnt have all his war gear but he had a good sword and a heavy himation neoptolymos and i had all our gear daud had the gear id made him a plain bronze boeotian cap and the sword id traded for seckla laced my leather spola while doola did the same for neoptolymos i really dont want any trouble said the innkeeper doola grinned at him then send a runner out there and tell them that it would be a mistake for them to attack us send another to the archon for the guard and well be out of your hair in no time the innkeeper spread his hands again if only doolas grin took on a certain air i got it hes in on it i said doola nodded he had neoptolymos in his harness and he fetched a bow i pointed at the gleaming pile of coins seckla you stay right here no matter what and watch the money i handed him my long knife it wasnt a fine weapon but it would do the job it cut twine well and meat and men the innkeeper backed across the room but gaius had him in a headlock before he could get out the door by the gods youve got this all wrong he whimpered doola shook his head hes probably not important enough to the gang to bargain with he said he looked at demetrios i really fucked this up brothers too much money i wont surprise you if i say that with armour on my back and an aspis leaning against the wall i was a different man i wanted the fight and i could see that neoptolymos did too i hadnt fought in a year more than a year in fact standing in a wretched waterfront tavern in marsala i realized i hadnt really fought since marathon i laughed aloud daud looked at me you arent one of those madmen who love the fight are you he asked i shook my head no or maybe yes i laughed again i sounded wild even in my own ears listen brothers my last fight was at marathon for all the things men find worthy and now im going to fight to the death for some coins in a tavern gaius was at the door we had a simple building a tavern with a portico full of tables outside a single door and two windows facing the beach i realized my brothers were readying themselves to die suddenly i was in charge this is easy i insisted they can only come at us a few at a time daud make sure the kitchen is clear behind us and theres no back door i went to the entrance and looked out onto the seafront and the failing light there were a dozen or more men they saw me i stood in the doorway after a long minute i made the universal sign that men make that means give me your best shot they hesitated can i make you laugh i seriously thought of charging them i wanted that fight doola loosed an arrow it went over their heads just over their heads into the hull of an upturned boat and just like that they folded and crept away i turned and glared at doola and he was unconcerned an hour later we were drinking wine daud was on watch our only fear was that they might set fire to our boat in sheer peevishness we let the innkeeper go he served us himself he was modestly obsequious and by full dark it was obvious that no one was going to attack us about the same time a dozen spearmen appeared out of the darkness fully armed and carrying aspides daud whistled we all took our places and demetrios of phocaea of all men came out of the darkness behind them id last seen him sailing out of the wreck of the ionian centre at lades waving his thanks hed been the navarch or as close as it made no matter he was the archon basileus or something like that and he had come with his guard to restore order householders had complained we embraced like old friends we hadnt been close as hed thought i was an impudent young pup and id thought he was an arrogant old man but we slept that night around his hearth and in the morning everything was different he didnt ask any hard questions but he was happy to show us to the shipyards and when none of them wanted our work he offered to pressure them we shook our heads who wants a boat built unwillingly after another day or two we rode north around the coast a full day to tarsilla a smaller port not a city but a prosperous town carthage burned it later but it was a fine place with a terraced town and a beautiful twobeach port even in winter the trees were fresh and green there were three shipyards all two and threeman operations and demetrios knew all the shipwrights his own trading trireme had come from tarsilla vasileos was the lead shipwright of the town and his yard had the best wood he took our job immediately he liked the size of the project for the time of year because a larger ship needed more men to work on it and was usually built in spring or summer right by the sea but a smaller ship like a triakonter could be built well up the beach by just three men he wasnt a tall man and he had something of the phoenician look about him hawknosed bighanded with a thin frame and broad shoulders and when he swung his adze it cut with the accuracy that a trained spearman treasures after some negotiation we bought a small house in tarsilla and moved our sparse goods there doola seckla and demetrios brought our little amphitrite around the coast to the town laden with bronze fittings for the ship gaius neoptolymos and i went upcountry with doola looking for a crew that may sound foolish but i had a notion shared by demetrios that wed have to fight and that we wanted a free crew if we could get one fighters rather than slaves like the ancient men in homer and daud thought that young men searching for adventure sounded like the cheapest labour there are mountains behind the coast in places cliffs come right to the sea edge and nowhere are the mountains far from the beach we went up into the mountains where the local folk live more like sikels than like keltoi for all that they speak gallic and wear armbands and tattoos they were hospitable and we got a dozen potential oarsmen out of the little hill villages we got another dozen from among the fishermen themselves though their parents resented us but doola with his exotic looks and neoptolymos with his lyre made us sound like the argonauts and there was a tacit understanding never quite spoken that if we fought wed be going to fight phoenicians im not saying that they are bad men im just saying that they seem to have a lot of enemies demetrios of phocaea provided the rest of my spearcarrying oarsmen from his own tail i visited every time the business of building the boat took me to marsala we had to count every obol that winter and spring the easiest way for the metalwork to get done was for me to rent shop space in marsala where charcoal and copper were available and to smelt and forge the metal gear myself so i did i traded bronzework for a pair of iron anchors better than anything id used at home but men said that beyond the pillars of heracles the anchor stones didnt work so well i forged bronze thole pins and i cast lead counterweights for the oars i forged sixty bronze rings for the sail while the women of marsala wove and sewed the hemp for a full set of sails for each boat i made some chain chains heavy and expensive but it is better than rope and i made war gear caps for every oarsman and simple circular plates for their chest and back id seen these in etrusca and again in rome and they made sense to me a disc of heavy bronze that covers a mans heart gives him confidence and will protect him from many blows i bought or traded for knives all spanish blades that i hilted in bronze and the last of our damaged hides went into making scabbards and belts it was a little like arming plataea it made me happy enough vasileos finished our ship before the spring feast of demeter we made a rich sacrifice to her and to poseidon i put a decent helmet on the altar of heracles and a good bronze lamp on the altar of hephaestos and another on the altar of apollo i confess that i felt my skills had diminished i had betrayed nikephorus and his daughter and the smithgod withheld his hand from my shoulder i marred my work often with stray blows my helmets were not as neat as i expected them to be and every one of them seemed to have its flaw when i made gaius a pair of greaves i marred the work with a foolish error in the planishing that i could see every time he wore them i thought of lydia a great deal i wished very hard that she had suitors and another husband and i wished other conflicting things my friends stood by me doola would sit in the rented shop and pump the bellows silently for me seckla ran errands and bent metal demetrios sat with me when i was in the depths neoptolymos made me play the lyre and i grew almost proficient gaius and i boxed despite which i lay every night and counted the people id betrayed the way id done it the reasons listen it may seem a small thing to you trifling with a girl i have mounted quite a few of them and without regret when i was a pirate i killed men took their chattels and was accounted a hero that is the life i led then but when you are a pirate you think like a pirate and you are judged by other pirates when you are a bronzesmith in a polis you are judged by a different standard and im enough of a pupil of heraclitus to know that all of us are to some extent a reflection of the lives we lead and the men we trust and listen to lydia wouldnt even have been a bump on my road the summer of lades but i had become a different man or rather i was striving to become a different man and failing i thought of standing at the door of the taverna in marsala longing for the clash knowing that i could probably take the whole pack of petty thieves eager for the spark and id sigh and the whole thing would play again in the theatre of my mind my last dinner with lydia her foot on mine my hand on her hip her breasts her father and the look of bewildered anger and all the other men and women dead abandoned my son somewhere on crete euphoria dead in my arms briseis it was a long winter and a longer spring and then the ship was finished at thirty oars she was probably the smallest ship i ever commanded but no one ever questioned that i would command her demetrios was going to take amphitrite and he would have doola seckla and gaius plus two of our fishermen giorgos the oddest name for a fisherman and kosta i had neoptolymos and daud an older fisherman eager to make a fortune named megakles and the shipwright himself vasileos couldnt resist he was a fine helmsman and a superb resource the kind of man who could repair anything that nature or error destroyed he added a great deal to our crew he was older steady and had a knack i have a bit of it and doola too of saying something and being obeyed without ever sounding as if an order had been given with me it is reputation im the hero with him it was age and also reputation he was perhaps the most renowned sailor on that coast and the young men obeyed even the shift of his eyebrows i decided to emulate his extremely laconic manner as for my crew i had as i say a dozen local lads a dozen shepherds from the hills and six trained greek oarsmen they had been at lades they worshipped me and every one of them felt he owed me his life which is a secure foundation for leadership we spent a week building a set of oar benches on the beach and then we practised every day while the farm boys and the shepherds ate us out of our wallets the hill boys acted as if theyd never seen food before or wine i expected fights and there were fights but the boys all the locals didnt quarrel with the men demetrioss oarsmen i didnt break up the first fights but after two evenings of it i handed them all shields in the dawn of our third day together and made them run five stades most of them were puking by the third stade and so it went ive trained crews before and ive told you all about it these were in the main better men than i usually had eager young and intelligent the local fathers locked away their daughters and we worked them hard and in a week we had something like a crew our amphitrite didnt waste the time she ran up to marsala and back twice gathering cargo and then down the etruscan coast for hides wine and all the etruscan tin that gaius could arrange albeit in small quantities i continued to train my oarsmen now at sea we pulled up and down the beach for two weeks and my store of silver dwindled and the locals began to jack up their prices as my demands increased thats the way of the world amphitrite came back from veii and the etruscan coast she sold her cargo loaded some alban tin that had come over the passes from high gaul and sailed for sardinia the margin on tin was very small the phoenicians got most of the profit by sailing to iberia and their price made the price of the tin brought over the mountains on donkeys precious little but doola was finding buyers in sardinia sicily and etrusca from both ends of the trade and he knew his business and besides our dealings in marsala netted us sittonax he was dauds age and spoke another dialect of keltoi they couldnt really understand each other and mostly they spoke greek even though both of them could understand each others poetry he came over the mountains with the tin as a guard someone gave him the mistaken impression that we could sail him back to alba he was the first kelt id met who refused to adopt greek dress and wore trousers and all his barbaric finery all the time daud had been broken to our ways by years of slavery but sittonax made him wear trousers and how we mocked him they got along like lovers which is to say they fought often and made up swiftly and they were brothers in all but name and sittonax knew a great deal about tin and where it came from he was my thirtyfirst oarsman i dont think he ever pulled an oar in the whole voyage he was the laziest man ive ever seen and yet he seemed to get things done he could tell lies without turning a hair yet we all accepted him as an honourable man my forge time went to trade goods about which sittonax and daud advised me with conflicting and sometimes boastful advice and my ram i had decided to put a bronze sheath on the projection that on small ships like a triakonter was usually left bare i wanted it light but with enough punch to crack a hull i had seen a number of rams and id seen the flaws sharp rams cut the water nicely but got stuck in the prey round rams made for uncertain steering i designed a different shape a series of heavy plates held apart by spacers like an empty packing crate with partitions for amphorae but no amphorae i asked around for weights and got a great many answers even alloying the metal myself the tin and copper came to a great amount almost fifty mina and i wondered if i was up to the work and if i was wasting money and bronze i had help from six other smiths when i cast the ram in sand in my rented shop yard the neighbours complained i was going to burn the neighbourhood down my mould cracked and the molten metal ran all over the yard and it was only by the will of hephaestos that no one was injured i tried again fewer men came to help me the second time i had real trouble moving the gate the piece of iron that kept the molten bronze out of the mould and when it moved it cracked and the white bronze flowed awry i went to the shrine of hephaestos and prayed i spent a night on the mud floor in front of the terra cotta statue i dedicated two rams and a good helmet doola and seckla and neoptolymos came to help the third time they were already making coasting trips in amphitrite by this time but they were in and they were friends the local bronzesmiths were distant men i heated the bronze for longer id made a huge wax model of the thing and built the mould carefully with wood and iron strapping and sand either the third time was the charm or the god had forgiven me i like to think it was the latter but either way the ram came shining from the mould vasileos shook his head and said the shape was all wrong he wanted it to be sharp and he said it would bite the water badly but a week later we mounted it on the hull and it went on like a porpax on a mans arm perfectly of course in and out of all this we were training our oarsmen after four weeks of training most of my shepherds were passable and my fishermen were bored and threatening to go back to their fathers boats and it was time to take my ship to sea so i paid for a priest to come from marsala with my last funds and we sacrificed a sheep and feasted and in the morning before their hangovers were clear i had them all aboard and we were running down the coast headed east to italy part ii alba after this he proceeds to determine the breadth of the habitable earth he tells us that measuring from the meridian of meroe to alexandria there are stadia from thence to the hellespont about again from thence to the dnieper and thence to the parallel of thule which pytheas says is six days sail north from britain and near the frozen sea other to which if we add stadia above meroe in order to include the island of the egyptians the cinnamon country and taprobane there will be in all stadia strabo geography im a poor sailor and a mediocre bronzesmith but im an expert pirate we coasted east and south camping in sandy bays on the south coast of gallia and eating deer and sheep stolen sheep somewhere in the etruscan sea we found a phoenician coaster struggling against a west wind headed for sardinia it was sheer luck i had not intended to prey on anyone but we pulled at her from the eye of the wind and she ran and there is something to the old saying that the bleating of the lamb excites the lion i really didnt intend to take her until i saw her run and then she had a crew of five four slaves and a phoenician skipper from carthage i kept his slaves and enslaved him took his ship and sold it still fully laden at marsala one of his countrymen ransomed him he hadnt done much work and the two mina in silver i charged for him seemed fair to everyone and the phoenicians in marsala marked me demetrios came to visit me on the beach at tarsilla you cant do that again he said without preamble i laughed i didnt intend to do it that time i said they were just there that quickly i had made the change from merchant to pirate i put him on the kline of honour fed him wine and sent him home in the morning with a hard head two days later before midsummer amphitrite swept in past the headland and unloaded her cargo this time doola had done his very best we had roman helmets etruscan amphorae of wine finished and dyed aegyptian cloth bags of local salt and even a small leather envelope of raw lapis from persia we had cyprian copper and some dyes tyrian and aegyptian mostly we had wine i had about thirty minas in worked bronze brooches and scabbard fittings because sittonax said they would sell and mirrors we had two bales of ostrich feathers i had taken off the coaster no idea how he came to have them but carthage gets the best goods out of africa doola looked at them heard the tale of the piracy and shook his head i wish you hadnt done that ari he said but then he shrugged and went back to his lists and we had two great tusks of ivory provided by gaius we spent four days loading working our boys to a frazzle the triakonter was too stiff and had an odd lie under sail and demetrios after watching us row ordered the stern to be pushed down in the water ballast amphorae we were literally ballasted in wine were shifted the stern went down a strake or two and the steering oars bit deeper im guessing now that im a better shipwright and a better captain that my ram which bit the sea beautifully although we hadnt tested it for its real purpose had pulled the bow too deep and made her hard to steer that ram bow could cut the waves but if used badly or in heavy seas could try to lead the ship to plunge too deep i was lucky and i had vasileos who supervised the reloading when it was all done we ate a feast of fish and lobster on the beach men with partners bid them farewell men without made do or didnt i didnt i had chosen celibacy hah i make myself laugh i hadnt chosen it at all id failed to find a partner and done nothing much to find one i was twentyseven by my own reckoning too old for the young girls unless i wanted marriage just right for paying prostitutes more wine here it was two weeks to midsummer night and the moon was waxing we slipped away in the dawn two small ships against all the might of the ocean it was a beautiful day and we had a fair wind for the west and all day we watched the water run down the sides of our heavily laden ship not a man touched an oar save the steersmen three more days and poseidon gave us a west wind at night we sheltered on sandy beaches or heavy pebbles under cliffs and we bartered for supplies or ate wild sheep and goats those are the days when life at sea is a fine thing we had new rigging new sails and fresh hulls on both boats and we raced along west and south on the fourth day we saw the coast of iberia rising before us and we put the helms over and started more south than west and still we had the gods own wind in our sails by the end of the week we had had some rowing by the end of the second week it was as if this was the only life wed ever known we sailed all day rowing when the wind was calm or against us amphitrite could stay much closer to the wind but couldnt row in anything like a breeze lydia for so i called my new ship could row in anything but a gale so fine was her entry and her designs and vasileos beamed with pride as our oarsmen powered us into a heavy wind as if they were racing small boats on a beach but lydia was never a good ship for sailing with the wind anywhere but her stern quarter nor did i expect much more this resulted in a great many tortoiseandhare days where wed crawl under oars following a straight course across a bay and amphitrite would sail away sometimes seemingly in the very opposite course to the one we were rowing only to appear near close of day on the same beach we began to rotate our crews men on amphitrite learned a great deal more about sailing than men on lydia and our shepherds were taken off their benches three days at a time and sent to make sail so all my friends came to lydia from time to time and i too took a trick on the sailing vessel and left command to vasileos who i suspect did it better than i another week and we came to the headland where iberia juts the farthest into the middle sea to port we saw the balearics we could have traded there for their famous wine and their fine wool but we had wine and we had wool and we were under way on our great adventure that night we had a talk at a great roaring fire on a pebble beach with the sound of regular waves playing like a monotonous and lowtuned lyre in the background the sky was full of stars and our lads were singing the songs theyd sung to sheep and goats at home we lay on our cloaks sipping wine every sip was that much less we had to deliver to our destination we were getting thrifty or perhaps greedy we fell silent listening to the sea and demetrios picked up a stick from the fire and pointed south not a one of us has ever been through the pillars of heracles he said he looked around the rumours are that there is a heavy current flowing out and a brutal wind well that shut us up doola was picking his teeth i remember that because he spat and then laughed his great laugh we should quit and go home then he said and we all laughed with him sounds as if it will be worse coming home than going out neoptolymos said demetrios shook his head i really dont know he said and that scares me i want to run south with this fine wind and coast along africa going west rather than stay on the iberian shore more chance of a carthaginian i said demetrios nodded i know but this coast gets rockier and rockier eventually well have no landing places and theres gades i dont know its exact location but its a major port according to men in marsala and it has a fleet a carthaginian fleet he looked around at all of us in the firelight south is the coast of libya mostly desert down to the sea ive never heard that it was thickly populated none of the rest of us knew either really we were shockingly unprepared we had asked every sailor we could find about the route but the carthaginians wouldnt talk or didnt know and the greeks were cagey we knew that africa had odd winds that could carry a lot of sand and we knew that the coast of iberia could be kind and could be harsh wed just experienced three weeks of pure sweet sailing and wed found her soft but from here the rest of the way was rumour and legend id met five men whod claimed to have sailed past the pillars of heracles none of them gave me the same description i assume that if id used my brief stay in carthage better id have learned more even as it was i worked the calculations id learned while a slave and i was none the wiser because navigation by the heavens is relative and i didnt have any fixed points from which to calculate but i had a notion that heracles wouldnt spurn me and that the pillars would be in his realm not poseidons and that if i took a precise bearing there on the heavens id have something to go by its a little like a drunkard going out of his farmhouse for a piss in the middle of the night he doesnt take his bearings in his bedroom or in the kitchen but at the garden gate so none of us gainsaid demetrios and the next morning we left the land and ran due south for africa africa was low compared to iberia the coast rises slowly and if it wasnt for the cloud banks and the wind we might have run on her in the dark the gods know that thousands of other sailors have drowned on that coast but we were fortunate having found the coast of africa we turned west into the setting sun and sailed we had a good wind for it and our only trouble was water the coast of africa didnt seem to have much of it and what there was someone owned after passing three harbours all obviously owned by the carthaginians we lay alongside one another and agreed that we had to go into the next small port they were numidians there they werent doolas people but they were black like him and thin like seckla and while there were phoenician merchants we avoided them filled with water from the stream and paid a small toll we also bought bread and meat and grain all outlay we sold some wine before we left the beach doola had purchased two hundredweight of dates dried dates who knew what ignorant barbarians might pay for delicious dates they couldnt get them into the hull of the amphitrite so we had to put them under tarpaulins between the benches of the lydia we put to sea as soon as we could and counted on our fingers the prices were ruinous and despite that we knew wed been absurdly lucky to find a port that wasnt dominated directly by carthage but we were young and foolish and we sailed on two days farther west and we had serious doubts the land was rising on either hand we could see the coast of iberia and the current was palpable the sea was beginning to flow like a river out into the outer sea if you have never been a sailor this may not sound terrifying worst of all was the wind the wind was at our backs and it grew stronger by the hour a firm westerly that pushed our ships along at a breakneck pace turning back was no longer an option the current wasnt so very strong but it denied us the opportunity to consider the wind rose stronger and stronger the great rock of the northern pillar is much greater than the smaller rock at the southern side and it is obvious once you start to pass the straits that this is not the hand of the gods any more that everything else in the universe is the wind is funnelled by the rising land the sea wind and what is merely a breeze elsewhere is virtually a gale between the pillars add to that the current we were moving very fast indeed and beyond we could see the great sea the outer sea what some men call the atlantic the ocean on which atlantis once lay faster and faster gades is a mighty port city in iberia sheltered behind the rock of the northern pillar i prayed to heracles my ancestor the port was visible now and full of ships the heavy construction of the big phoenicians made more sense to me as i eyed the heavy rollers of the outer sea the waves were twice as high we hit them in the rip the confusing water between the oceans just at the base of the pillars and before my crew had our sail down wed been turned all the way around and flung ten shiplengths by a series of waves luck the will of poseidon and some expert shiphandling by vasileos saved us but it was terrifying in a rowed ship our fishermens sons were the other vehicle of our salvation for they saw the threat and without orders got to benches any benches and put oars in the water and we managed not to swamp completely but we took a great deal of water in those first few moments and that was on a sunny day with a fine breeze the phoenicians are fine sailors and i had made a number of mistakes demetrios did no better the rip took him by surprise as well and a flaw in the current took him away from us on the outflow as a pair of boys may be swept apart when they attempt to swim in a strong river i couldnt watch i was busy saving my own ship when all our rowers were rowing we ought to have been safe but wed shipped too much water and the ship was a slug and the big swells of the atlantic threatened her low sides with every wave i had to make ten decisions a minute about who should row and who should bail sittonax bailed one of the few times i watched him work like a working man he bailed with his helmet until someone put a bucket in his hands doola shipped the pump a simple wooden contraption that fitted over gunwale and he and i worked it as hard as we could lifting a steady stream of water over the side a dozen other men all the shepherds bailed as fast as they could but it wasnt a onesided fight a wave a little higher than the others caught us not quite broadside thank the gods but on our forward quarter and suddenly we were taking water amidships all our gains were lost and more besides men began to look around and at me the fishermen could swim the herdsmen couldnt bail friends i called no one can swim in this and we bailed vasileos had the steering oars and i could tell from his actions that he was not having a good time of it that we didnt really have enough way on us the obvious solution was to get the boatsail up that meant taking five good men off bailing i thought about it for as long as a man sings a prayer to the gods it still seemed incredible to me that on a beautiful day i was about to die at the mercy of the elements nonetheless i made the decision without steerage way we were doomed and it was just a matter of time boatsail i called that took five of my best very best men off the benches and the bailing too for a long minute we were in the balance the ship was to all intents sinking wed taken on a great deal of water the wind wasnt going to save us but the wind gave a bite to the steering oars and the steering oars allowed vasileos to put the stern to the wind and the bow to the waves and then we were all bailing and bailing and bailing an hour became another hour and the crisis seemed just as acute every rogue wave every spill of wind that shipped a little water started the struggle again in earnest and such is the nature of men that the deadly became routine and still we bailed there was no choice as the wind aided us more and more men came off the rowing benches to bail that got us a little more at some point the balance changed in the ship we were lighter the bilges still swirled with water but we were afloat and running before the wind due west into the atlantic demetrios had made a different choice because of his rig hed had his sails up all along and the vicious current had driven him inshore the water closer in was calmer and in fact as any sailor who knows the pillars learns there was a countercurrent close in to the shore just as there is in the bosporus if id only had the wit to think demetrios and amphitrite had weathered the current and the rip better than we had and now lay astern about two stades that might have been the end of our despair except that for three hours we had had no lookout because all hands were needed on the ship when i sent doola who was grey with fatigue to rest in the bow he turned warships he called how the bastard carthaginians must have laughed there we were wallowing like pigs in a trough because we didnt know the tide change for the atlantic and we had chosen a stupid moment to pass the straits nor did we know where to lie to where to wait we knew nothing and they lay safe in gades and watched and when it became obvious that we were going to live they came out like hawks on their prey like any predator they liked us the better that we were tired three heavy triremes came out of gades and all with just one thought to take us listen thugater and my lilyhanded ladies you are not sailors and i imagine that to you one body of water is much like another i cannot express to you the fear gutchurning and senseless of the atlantic it is not right the water feels different it tastes different i swear to you that lydia handled differently in the outer ocean those three warhawks leaped out of gades in our wakes and they were gaining on us before they had their lower oarports open a hundred and eighty rowers will always beat thirty rowers even if the thirty are all argonauts and have heracles himself at an oar i went aft to where vasileos was between the oars well he asked he was tired i had the sense not to talk i looked aft i wont be a slave he said i had all the time in the world to see how this was in the main my fault of course we knew that the carthaginians had a squadron in gades i thought about it for fifty beats of my heart the equation looked like this if we ran west on the wind and raised the mainsail and we were lucky we would stay ahead of the big warships they couldnt possibly have such heavy crews and still have supplies but we would have to go out of sight of land and spend the night a storm would kill us a heavy west wind would kill us and we had little water and no food beyond raw grain that we couldnt cook because we didnt have a beach if we cheated north the triremes would have us and if we stood on under boatsail alone the triremes would have us mainmast i said i pretended to calm unhurried command laconic like vasileos men sprang to obey and our mainmast went up and was belayed stays i said four four stays were the equivalent of preparing for a major storm the stays went up too seckla raced aloft his superb gymnastics acted out for our lives and he slipped the noose of every stay over the masthead while the deck crew belayed the miracle is that the men didnt panic i seemed calm so they obeyed i was anything but calm i wasnt even resigned inwardly all i could do was curse my incredible hubris in thinking that we could pass the pillars and my lack of scouting lack of preparation i seldom feel a complete fool but i did then for the whole of these preparations the warships gained hand over fist i know vasileos thought the preventerstays were a waste of time but he said nothing and i knew that if i didnt get them up immediately theyd never go on later in darkness on a dirty night and my sense of the weather was that it was getting worse as soon as the mainsail fell free the ships motion changed the bow took far more punishment than in the inner sea as the pace of the rollers was very different but we were going faster much faster demetrios raised amphitrite s mainsail and let the corners of the lateen go and the little ship sprang forward for an hour as the sun began to set i thought wed make it but amphitrite was falling behind it was slower at first but we were not on her best point of sailing so i put my helm up a few points and demetrios matched our new course and then she seemed to hold her own i went back to bailing she wasnt holding her own and the three carthaginians werent letting go at one remove it didnt matter a damn whether they had the food and water to give chase because i had done what could be done i didnt have any other brilliant stratagems but when vasileos summoned me to the steering platform and i saw how badly amphitrite was sagging i knew the triremes were going to catch us i swear i just stood and watched for as long as it took the sun to go a fingers width across the sky armour i called the word tasted good in my mouth i turned to vasileos i wont be a slave either but its going to cost us i shrugged and i wont let them die i pointed to amphitrite vasileos nodded all i could do was turn and dash back if i went between two of the warships anything might happen i might lure them away i might kill a helmsman with a lucky arrow shot i might lure a foolish ship into an oarrake even my little triakonter could make trouble with the oars of a big lineofbattle ship i might but these were the best sailors in the world and i wasnt likely to surprise them when i went about they would have at this rate half an hour to see me coming that meant i needed to surprise them which was nigh on impossible but worth an effort spill the wind i called to seckla he let fly the lower corners of the sail our motion changed and we slowed men were standing about staring at me into your armour i shouted we had just one advantage every man in our crew had a shield a spear and a helmet many had more in effect we had thirty marines with luck even a little luck the carthaginians would have their usual mixed crew of professionals and slaves or if not slaves men with nothing to gain by victory i was an old hand at this and i didnt think that was enough advantage to even consider turning and fighting but i confess that i found it appealing the wolf in me wanted to fight it was the tavern all over again the sun sank towards the sea ahead of us turning from yellow to red the land was gone behind us spill more wind i told seckla we slowed more and amphitrite began to overtake us everything depended on timing i wanted amphitrite to overtake us exactly as the lead of the three warships closed into archery range of amphitrite as i considered my options i imagined the carthaginian skippers leaning over their bows and watching me my twentieth mistake of the day had been showing all my speed and then slowing if they were veterans they would know that i was cheating the wind to lose seaway in fact the northernmost warship began to put a little northing into his westerly helm widening the gap between his ship and his next consort it might be coincidence but my feeling was that he was on to my clever plan and still we raced west the three warships were confident and well handled rowing two banks and using their boatsails to ease the rowers it told me a great deal about them and all of it bad for my friends our sail crackled and i looked up at it vasileos nodded wind change he said and shrugged as if to say that he a man of marsala could not be expected to predict these things on the outer ocean they were close to fetching our wakes the entire chase had been with us sailing due west and they slanting down from the northeast i could imagine that on the lead ship the master archer was probably pulling his horn bow from its case certainly doola had his out although hed strung it and then wrapped the bow in a cloak to keep the spray off the string i pulled on my beard a dozen times trying to find anything to do i had my spola on my shoulders and someone had put my aspis against the bulkhead with two spears so i walked down the waist of lydia and clasped hands with all of them shepherds and herdsmen fishermen and coasters and my friends last of all i gathered them in the waist on my word we lower the mainmast well turn to port on oars like lightning pass between the two southernmost ships and try for their oars i shrugged after that its any mans game i sounded sane enough i suppose men smiled the sails crackled again i walked aft trying to appear calm want me to take the steering oars i asked vasileos shook his head i think the wind will veer north he said suddenly i looked at the sea and it told me nothing but a north wind two of the warships were now to the south of us by several stades closing off our escape while the northernmost one caught us up they had made a mistake and further it seemed to me that vasileos had to be right because otherwise we wouldnt be moving north at all so close i ran back along the waist leaping benches listen i shouted we will not take down the mast drop the sail and be ready to put it up again ready it will tangle the oars shouted vasileos an arrow leaped from a distant bow and fell into the water about a horselength astern too damned close doola loosed he arrow rose and fell three came at us in return and he loosed again his whole chest thrown into the curve of the bow one of the arrows struck the curved wood over the helmsmans bench ready at the oars i called mainsail down the mainsail came down at a rush the deck crew all four of them caught the great sheets as they came down hauling them inboard in heaps of hemp again sittonax lent a hand priceless time went by heartbeat after heartbeat there was no point in giving an order before the sail was clear of the oarsmen and then it was arrows were falling around us by then a dozen every minute or more and a single hit might have been the end of us but suddenly the wind was failing changing give way i roared hard to starboard we had lots of speed and the oars bit the steering oars added their fulcrum and we heeled into the turn heeled dangerously but every spare man went to the outside rail demetrios was ready he turned with us his sails already down you fool i said i wanted him to live not to follow us we shot under his stern and continued our curve north and then east an arrow struck my aspis and went a hands breadth through it i hadnt remembered putting it on my arm i put it up over vasileoss head and three more arrows struck it the second passing right through the face and stopping only on the bronze arm guard inside the shield punching deep into it so that my arm took a wound i dropped my arm but the arrow was wedged in pinning my arm to the porpax doola loosed i followed his arrow and was stunned to find that we were going bow to bow with the northernmost warship which would crush us like a water flea astern demetrios had the amphitrite around and under oars six oars didnt move her very fast but he had his boatsail up and it was full it was full that meant the wind had veered an arrow whanged off my helmet putting a crease all along the brow ridge oars in i called seckla took another in the hip and fell onto the sails the wind change staggered the bigger ship who had his boatsail set like the hand of poseidon moving his bow off course by several points it caught our bare pole too and moved us we struck them just aft of their cathead and glanced down the side their archers were unfazed by the collision leaning out over the side to loose i saw it happen the oar loom taken by surprise the glancing blow from our little ship and an archer was caught in the broken oars and beaten down another leaped for his life and doola shot him like a hunter taking a bird on the rise and we were past our mad rush had turned the big warship but it was demetrios with his cool hand at the helm and deep experience of the sea that really hurt them he had his oars in easy in a slabsided tub with only six oarports he was under sail alone and his bluff bow struck the starboard rowers stations on the opposite side from our very small strike crushing a dozen oars and oarsmen and then poling off his lightning strike took away momentum in him and in a bigger fight hed have been dead but the enemy had no second line and the trireme carried forward all his topdeck rowers in disarray we caught the new north wind and sailed north we had barely stung our three mighty opponents i doubt if we killed a dozen men and crushed twenty oars but that northernmost trireme lost way and wallowed in the swell in our wakes her consorts turned north and passed her offering no assistance bent on renewing the pursuit the sun in the west became a red ball on the horizon and the seahawks werent going to have us before darkness fell as soon as it was full dark i passed amphitrite and hailed her demetrios came to the starboard side we should turn west i said as soon as we can before moonrise demetrios spat over the side west he repeated in his shouted tone i heard it all doubt and more doubt but he followed my lead we turned west slanting across the wind as it began to veer again and by midnight we were again in a full westerly and i was cursing because the wind change meant that the enemy would have every reason to follow in our wake i snatched sleep when i could as did all of us the oarsmen were fresh so far but doola sent them to their benches to sleep still any man who went to the ram to relieve himself was questioned when he went back to his bench the first grey light came and we could see amphitrite on the same tack but well off to the north of us men cheered the sky was increasingly red at our backs over iberia and i didnt like that but the wind was steady and in the wrong direction to turn and we sailed along as the sun rose red as blood off the land and into the sky i saw three nicks like the fins of sharks on the eastern horizon and my heart sank vasileos went off to take breakfast such as it was unmilled barley and wine from our cargo i took the oars and began to cheat the helm north a triakonter doesnt sail many points off the wind but it will sail a few and i was going for all i could get an hour later it was obvious that the triremes were gaining doola and vasileos came aft after doola had looked at secklas wound the young man was lucky the arrow had struck the hip without severing the artery and glanced along the bone deeply painful but one of the lightest wounds a man can take if one must be wounded only a matter of time i said doola looked at the sails on the horizon vasileos smiled made it through yesterday he said he looked at the sky i pointed at the red dawn over iberia if i were at sea in the ionian i said that would mean trouble vasileos took a deep breath and shook his head smells like lightning he said make all fast i ordered i made my way aft catching each mans eye it wasnt an order for the sake of shouting i wanted to make sure everyone understood heavy weather was not necessarily our friend but was in many ways a deadlier enemy as they put heavy linen tarpaulins across the standing cargo and rigged the big tarps that could cover the bilges the wind began to veer first north then south then all around we had the mainsail down in no time and the boatsail up the wind veered again and suddenly the sky began to cloud over feed them the dates i said dates were the only food we had aboard by then it was money lost or not if we lived and if we didnt live i laughed we ate twenty drachmas worth of dates we hadnt had a good meal in two days and we inhaled the dates an hour later i had to order the mainmast down or cut it away it was close and now the bigger ships were gaining theres a belief among nonsailors that small ships are faster than big ships this is far from true small ships are nimbler than large ships and often shallower in draught and have other useful qualities but the longer and heavier a ship is the less it fights the motion of the sea an old shipwright on crete my first sons grandfather if you like explained it to me when i was a complete lubber by saying that if a small boat rode the waves she travelled farther with all the ups and downs than the bigger boat that cut the waves im not altogether sure thats the answer either but bigger boats are faster and in heavy weather they are faster still demetrios pulled alongside im going to part company he shouted let me add that i could barely hear him he waved west of course in this heavy wind his tubby merchant hull could carry more sail heel farther and manage a point or two closer to the wind than my triakonter or our pursuers it meant going due west away from land in a storm go i shouted back we both waved our deviation was slow at first and then very rapid as his mainsail filled and he found his point of sailing my oarsmen were still eating dates it was like something out of aristophanes thirty men pushing dates down their gullets as fast as they could sittonax looked like a drowned blond cat sitting on someone elses bench with both hands full brasidas the eldest of the herdsmen was stripped naked despite the cold and rain hed just helped with the mainmast and he too looked like a dog worrying fresh meat his cheeks were smeared with dates aye we were hungry the boatsail kept our head up and our stern to the rollers but we didnt have much headway and as the storm mounted behind us the waves grew steeper this didnt happen immediately in fact i could tell this whole story as a transition from worry about our pursuers with little concern for the weather to worry about the weather with little concern for our pursuers about midday the storm had risen to a point where the wind which was now steadily westerly was shrieking in the rigging and the waves were so big that the little boatsail mast was only in the wind when our bow was going up the increasingly steep sides of the waves we were all but becalmed in the trough at first that was hard on us but merely annoying then the effect grew and the moment where the wind caught the boatsail became increasingly perilous the boatsail snapped and strained at its ropes and the motion of the ship between my hands became alien our two pursuers were close too damned close and with the wind behind them their archers could loose at us and we couldnt hope to reply luckily the wind was so strong that archery was not very effective the next change was to the steering the ship began to accelerate down the steep wave sides the waves were now as tall as the mast of a small ship and as we went over the crest the ship would slide on the far side all this while rain crashed down like a torrent of persian arrows and the wind howled like the spirits of all the titans sent to tartarus it wasnt that any particular moment was perilous the storm was not the worst id ever seen it was the combination of all the factors a single wrong decision a moments inattention at the helm and wed be dead im a fine man in a fight none better but fights only last so long the sea is always there and i am not the best sailor sailing like smithing requires patience both of our enemies were away to the south coming up on a very slight tack amphitrite was gone in the spume perhaps already over the distant horizon i couldnt even glimpse her when i could count the guy ropes on the bow of the nearest trireme i cheated my own helm to the north at the top of a massive wave and we rode down that cliff of water like a boy surfing with his body in the fresh waves of a summer storm on the beach i kept us slant on to the wave as much as i dared it worked after three or four waves i was on a northwest tack and the odd onandoff action of the heavy wind on my sail seemed to drive us well enough at some point the lead trireme slackened sail by lifting the hem of his boatsail his lowest row of oarports was now exposed to the storm and im guessing he was shipping water ten more minutes and he had turned west putting his high prow to the rollers id like to say that i planned it all or guessed it but my turn was merely to put more water between us in another hour we could scarcely see them even at the top of the rise and i had half my oarsmen pulling on the down slope of the wave it took careful calculation but it kept our course straight and give me some credit here it gave the oarsmen something to do by dark we had a sky full of lightning the land was gone the wind had risen again and now i brailed up the boatsail to a scrap half an hour later with no order from me doola and vasileos brailed it again climbing out on the bow and wrapping the whipping vicious cloth with sodden slippery rope but they triumphed and we lived rowing became more important too as we needed a continuing impetus to stay stern on to the waves perhaps they didnt grow larger with the dark but they were far more terrifying at least to me i could just see the rising swell of the things at my shoulder when a lightning flash came i was always shocked at how high they were how white with spume but i couldnt stop looking the waves were terrible like the pain of a wound that a warrior must keep testing perhaps in the hope that it will diminish thats my memory of that night the constant exhausting shock of the size of the waves eventually as it always does night ended it didnt end cleanly or evenly with anything like a dawn in fact i remember doubting the evidence of my own eyes as i began to be able to see the white spray hell of the water to the west that is if we were running west i had no stars and no sun i was in an alien ocean i was cold wet through of course and vasileos stood at one shoulder and doola at my other in the night theyd placed themselves with me in the steering rig it took all three of us to hold the ship steady if one of the steering oars broke if the boatsail mast gave way if the rowers missed their stroke in the trough by midday a meaningless name for a meaningless time as we had no idea how much daylight had passed i began to succumb to hopeless doubt what if the whole outer ocean were like this men said it was a circle of storms girding the earth men at marsala had said no ship could survive i thought that they were fools after all carthage came here but this was now the worst storm id ever seen darkness fell again it is possible that doola and i shouted to each other or perhaps vasileos roared in my ear but there was nothing to say the rowers the fishermen mostly kept time by nothing but habit bless them and they rowed on the second night we lost a fishermans son overboard he went to the cathead to defecate and he was out there when a rogue wave buried the cutwater bow the ram bit too deep and just for a moment at the steering oar i thought we would simply plunge to the bottom it wasnt until wed bailed until daylight that we knew aristos was gone and bethes one of the herdsmen had gone mad he shrieked and swore and leaped about until vasileos led a party to trap him in the bow and tie him down were all going to die he screamed die make it stop his screams were largely covered by the wind the second day of the storm dawned if you could call it that some time after the pale light showed us the roaring chaos of waves vasileos put a big arm around my shoulders sky is lighter he bellowed a tiny watery ray of hope penetrated my head more time passed someone cut the madmans throat i saw it happen his screams were the stuff of nightmare and someone else couldnt stand it shipmate or no remember that the herdsmen and the shepherds were different men from the fishermen later someone threw the corpse over the side the wind began to abate the fullthroated shriek of the wind in the boatsail masts stays remitted until it was just a scream poseidons grip on my steering oars became a mere punch in the guts at the top of every wave our boatsail mast had not given way our boatsail had not blown clear of its ropes but wed been rowing for two nights and two days on a meal of dates and the rowers were so far beyond done that our rowing was more symbolic than real i handed the steering oars to vasileos a process fraught with peril that revealed that my arms would not function properly and my legs were exhausted but i struggled forward on a rope tied the length of the ship at each bench i stopped two more hours were going to make it thats the whole of the speech i shouted at them two more hours look at the light listen to the wind i shouted these words over and over men at one oar bench couldnt hear me on the next hope is the most intoxicating drug better than wine or opium hope can make an exhausted man row two more hours can cause a swordsmans arm to function for a few more cuts those are the moments when the daimons that make a mans spirit prove themselves or fail when everything is gone from you but that ray of hope a few failed most didnt we rowed and the wind abated the waves began to come in a regular cycle and they grew less steep then suddenly it was noon on a blue sea with a stiff breeze and no land in sight in any direction other better officers doola and vasileos had collected rainwater we drank it i served out wine from the cargo and we consumed the last of the dates with handfuls of grain and then the food was gone despite our hunger and thirst we threw a heavy handful of dates and a full cup of neat wine over the side to poseidon i let us wallow on the waves until i was sure sure which direction was east despite the breeze and the sun i knew that we were right on the edge of death still i didnt think we could survive two more nights at sea i needed to find the land find a beach and get my hull on it when the movement of the sun gave me east my heart soared and i prayed to apollo helios lord of the sun with a fervour i hadnt shown in many years apollo is not really a friend of our house but that day the track of the golden chariot across the sky revealed that the wind on my cheek was a gentle westerly and our course was north and west vasileos and doola and i had held our course all night im sure that we went due west at times the wind was west since then sailors on the outer sea have told me that westerlies are the gentlest storms beyond the pillars of heracles let me never face an easterly then be that as it may in the afternoon we took down the boatsail and we rowed north and east it was backbreaking not because of hard winds but because we had a fully laden ship and we were exhausted after the briefest consultation with doola and vasileos we began to jettison cargo four men were bailing all the time and two more sought out the heaviest cargo with minimum value and threw it over the side sodden hides from sheep and oxen went all the dyes ruined in the storm so that mens legs were dyed a vivid purpleblack for days we drank the wine and threw the amphorae over the side we had a deep tier of amphorae and copper and that we left virtually everything else went and still we laboured against a gentle headwind and our own fatigue in our wake a tragic trail of sinking cargo evening came with no sign of land i slept the sleep of the exhausted and woke to find that vasileos needed me to take the steering oars i slept between them im ashamed of that but i did us no harm and awoke fitfully and finally rose to consciousness with the dawn and the rise of an east wind we had rowed all night now the sky was darkening in the west and the wind was coming from the west we raised the boatsail and then the mainmast and lay about the ship sleeping and talking fitfully men looked at the mass of clouds to the west from time to time and then went back to whatever they were doing dice appeared as darkness fell a party moved about the ship checking the tiedowns and making all fast for another storm in fact i knew that if the storm caught us wed die no one had any strength left and to be fair most of us were drunk not mutinously angrily drunk just drunk on fatigue and a little wine i roused myself i wasnt any better than the rest around nightfall and went about the ship ordering men into watches so that we wouldnt run on the land i had to believe there was land on our right hand the starboard side somewhere out there is it close i asked vasileos he shook his head his smiles were gone and the lines in his face made him look forty years older even doola had lines on his face vasileos looked east under his hand and shook his head no seabirds he said he shrugged and took another hit of wine in the morning we can cast the lead he ventured more quietly he said we ran west for two days and nights we ran as if poseidon himself pushed our hull he shrugged i would guess in all this alien sea who could know he shook his head again five more days he asked we wont make five days i said doola rubbed his beard we might he said the next morning was clear and bright and the wind blew strong from the west and we ran north and west i served out the lowest tier of amphorae the best wine men drank it we served out the rest of the grain and men chewed on leather should have saved the dead man joked kalimachos one of the herdsmen men paused as if a collective shudder went through them all i thumped the side of the boat with my sighting staff not on my ship i said everyone breathed and we ran on and on after noon when i took a sight on the height of the sun as the phoenicians do and learned little from it except that i could calculate when noon passed exactly i worked my way to the stern and stood with doola shall we turn the ship due east i asked looking past my friend at the shipwright vasileos was between the oars he shrugged who knows doola looked forward i followed his look the whole crew was watching us stay on course i said a little louder vasileos met my eye and his eye said it doesnt matter either way we ran on along towards evening a pair of gulls attached themselves to our sternpost they took fish out of our wake for a while and then just sat there defecating i took in the mainsail at full dark and we ran on far more sedately and when i took my trick at the helm i turned the ship until the wind was stern on due east in the morning everyone was sober and sullen thirsty and very hungry indeed there was no more wine to serve that is to say i knew there were twentyfour more big amphorae stowed forward and id broach them rather than die but we had a steady stream of seabirds now and i was sure we were up with the land in fact it looked oddly as if the land was to our south as well as our east an hour after dawn when two men in the bow were demanding that we have a ships meeting porpoises appeared off the bow they leaped and leaped and the ship fell silent men fell to their knees praying for poseidons favour we ran on another hour i got the mainsail up aided only by three hands while doola and vasileos steered the rest either wouldnt help or couldnt while i was taking the sight for noon a group of the herdsmen gathered in the bow i heard them saw them knew their intent their frightened ignorance was driving them they thought to be honest they werent thinking they came forwards over the benches with swords and spears and clubs turn the ship around called the leader he was the oldest of the herdsmen and should have known better theophrastos a good enough man turn the fucking ship around he said again and some of his fear leaked through his voice i came to the edge of the small aft deck and stood over them back to your benches i said youre all idiots do you think you know anything about sailing there arent any sheep here to herd we survived the triremes and we survived the storm and in a few hours well be on a beach we are going the wrong way shouted one of the boys i can feel it i looked at him and almost died theophrastos stabbed at me with his spear i had not reckoned on their deadly intent and i almost missed the blow almost even as it was his spear point caught me behind the ear and cut my scalp without thinking i got my right hand on his spear haft and jumped onto him from my higher vantage point i stripped the spear from his hands and knocked him to the bilges the others stepped back one of the fishermen tripped the youngest herdsman and put his arms around him in a bear hug i looked around the others were indecisive not cowed but unsure if they were willing to step up to violence i thought too we were hours from land or so i thought but i didnt have the strength to fight a mutiny and and as horrible as it sounds these were herdsmen not my finest rowers theophrastos bellowing with rage rose from the bilge i drew my xiphos and killed him i deceived his reaching hands with a flick of my point and then cut back hard the full force of my right arm into his neck just above the collarbone i didnt quite behead him but close and his blood fountained over his comrades they flinched i pointed my sword at them he was a fool and he died for it get back to your stations or die with him well be eating mutton tonight or you can eat black air in hades that was the end of the mutiny if it was a mutiny it was really the rush of some panicked men and i think now that killing theophrastos was too much i could just as easily have kicked him in the head but i was tired and afraid myself thats how it is at sea my guilt for killing him increased all day as little signs a floating log a wren told us that we were coming up with the land after midday we saw land a mountain range to the south and then we saw the land to the east people cheered i felt empty and foolish i had earned their thanks and then i had killed one of them they all moved shy of me even doola the sun was just starting to sink when we came up with the land and we coasted north looking for a beach we had to row and that was difficult as the men were weak and scared scared of me now but the closer we got to the land and the more we could smell it the more our hearts rose by sunset we were within bowshot of land a low and difficult coast but just before full dark robbed our eyes doola saw a break in the coast and we turned west under sail and passed over the bar of a river and we saw huts beautiful huts with stone foundations and big roofs of thatch on the south bank and two heavily built open boats riding a few ships lengths out from a muddy beach i took down the sail in the last of the light and we got the oars out with a slovenly motion that would have disgraced an allslave crew on a carthaginian and we pulled badly i say we because i was on a bench we caught crabs and some men seemed incapable of effort we crawled the last hundred paces across the calm water of the estuary backing water to land sternfirst seemed impossible but we managed in a laborious and inefficient manner we floundered the ship around and backed water like boys rowing for the first time and the stern grounded with a soft thump wed lived i know i wept many others did too i lay over my oar and i cried landing sternfirst means that the rowers are facing away from the land so i was one of the last to notice that armed men were forming on the greensward by the river it was doola who alerted me fifty men with spears ares i remember thinking that if they came to enslave me id just lie down and take it but i rose and moved perhaps by my killing of the morning i seized not my spear but my staff and i leaped off the stern to the riverbank and walked slowly the land moving under me towards the spearmen it was just the last edge of a summer evening the sky was still pink but night was close i fell to my knees and clutched the earth and kissed the grass then i hobbled like a drunkard towards the spearmen they watched me they looked utterly foreign many most were heavily tattooed they had big ugly bodies with fat bellies and hollow backs men who didnt exercise properly but they had big muscles heavy thighs trousers in checks and violent stripes their hair was all the colours of the rainbow even in the fading light sittonax came up next to me and he had a spear he grinned at me he shouted at them and two men shouted back both wore fine gear it was as if he cast a spell or broke one as soon as sittonax called to them their disciplined silence broke and most of them simply walked away a few stayed to look at the ship and one man in a magnificent helmet with bronze wings and a gold torque around his neck stood warily to the side after a pause he came and spoke to sittonax and when the two were done they embraced like old friends and the man grinned at me and stood by your people i asked sittonax he gave me a look of pure annoyance in return if we landed in a part of sicily where they spoke greek would you be home he asked which for him was a long speech you speak to them well enough i commented he shrugged these are tarbelli their aristocrats speak a good form of my language i can understand them he nodded at two spearmen who were looking at our ship i cant understand a word from those two oh i said or something equally intelligent you seemed to be talking ten to the dozen they thought we were coming to attack sittonax said he shrugged now they think were here to trade i had to explain that we arent phoenicians i nodded tell him were here to trade i agreed and that we need food and water or men will die tell them weve been at sea eight days in a galley he nodded he spoke to the man in the excellent war gear who made noises in return he blew a horn and the keltoi moved quickly my oarsmen stumbled ashore its amazing how unstable a man can be on dry land and a local man showed doola where we could set up tents we had two big tents built to rig on the hull of the ship we had one up before the roast pig was brought down to us and then no man could raise a finger for anything they might have enslaved the lot of us in a matter of minutes just for some pig i dont really remember much more of that evening i ate and ate i went to the ship and vasileos and i managed to get one of our heavy amphorae out of the bilge and we broached it and served it to our hosts and then i went to sleep real sleep for the first time in ten days i awoke to a rainy day and heavy swell out in the estuary and to the thought that i had sailed out of the pillars of heracles onto the great sea and lived youd think id have been worried for amphitrite and all my friends aboard let me tell you something about the life i led honey you had to trust your comrades and the gods if they were dead well they were dead the first thing i did after rising was to pour a long libation and say a prayer aloud to poseidon for their deliverance then i went to find the tin there wasnt any tin at oiasso we sat with the lord of the town the next day exchanging pleasantries while his steward looked over our selection of wine and copper neither seemed to hold the least interest for the locals and after some discussion i found that they had excellent copper down the coast in iberia and that while they enjoyed our wine they had excellent wines of their own the amphitrite had all of our other trade goods i didnt have pepper i didnt have silphium or anything else except for my own bronze wares some helmets a bronze aspis some cooking pots and a bundle of swords i wont say that they turned up their noses at my work ill just say that they smiled and moved on to look at other items i had time to examine the chieftains war gear his bronze helmet with the wings was unlike anything id ever seen almost like a chaldicean helmet with hinged cheekpieces and a low bronze bowl but very different in appearance and marvellously well fashioned it was decorated over almost the entire surface with beautiful repousse the work was very fine even though the figures were to me amateurish it took time for me to develop an eye for keltoi work to be honest i still think they need some help with their figures every man likes the art of his home doesnt he thats not really the point the point is that by the time the sun was high in the sky i knew that id made an arrogant assumption about the north they werent ignorant savages ready to be impressed with the marvellous goods of our civilization they were in fact impressed only by our pottery they didnt really want our wines but they wanted all the amphorae and the empty one from the night before became our first guest gift the second thing we discovered was that the customs of the inner sea didnt hold here or rather it was like stepping back in time to the century before my fathers time or even farther to the world of the iliad and the odyssey the tarbelli aristocrat didnt trade he hosted us and gave us gifts then he waited patiently for us to give him gifts and the steward prompted us through sittonax who rolled his eyes this is oldfashioned he admitted but southerners are oldfashioned it made me smile because for once i was in my element it was just like crete and id lived there so i put myself in the role of the aristocratic captain and i disdained matters of trade and doola became my steward and by dinner on the second evening tertikles thats the best i can do with the local lords name and i were guest friends wed hit each other with swords wed raced horses on the dunes and id given him my second best helmet which was if no better than his own no worse he liked it tertikles and sittonax spoke together a great deal and i left them to it when i wasnt required seeing to the emptying of the ship shed stood nine days at sea and she needed everything we stripped her to the wood scrubbed the bilge recaulked the seams and vasileos wandered around her hull on the beach with a heavy mallet driving pegs back into the hull and examining every inch with a professional eye i brought him a cup of wine good ship i said he beamed she is isnt she he said by the morning of the third day sittonax had his bearings and he drew me a chart in the sand while the oarsmen scrubbed the hull clean we came through the pillars of heracles he said an eyebrow raised as you call them here i nodded he drew a box iberia as i understand it from tertikles i shrugged no one at marsala had ever been able to draw us even the vaguest chart of the world outside the pillars were in this deep bay he said drawing me the point where the northwestern edge of the box intersected a long line hed drawn with his stick that ran north to south somehow we ran all the way down this bay he shrugged not a sailor i knew exactly how it had happened i just kept sailing east expecting to find the coast of iberia and it kept escaping us those mountains he pointed to the long line in the south are northern iberia we sailed all the way round iberia i asked im a scientific sailor but sometimes you just have to believe that poseidon sends you where he wants you to go he shrugged again tertikles says that there is a phoenician trading post south and west four days rowing i grunted you think we could just sail in and trade for tin i asked sittonax shrugged no idea but tertikles wants to know if youd like to join him in attacking it attacking it i must have looked foolish now lets remember my young friends i had been a pirate but by this time id lived for years years on my own work and my own production and trade it makes me smile but at the time i believe i thought myself too mature to engage in such foolishness oh i dont recommend it but he insisted i ask you the kelt said for my part the venetiae are farther up this coast maybe six days rowing theyll have tin are they your people i asked he rolled his eyes no he said do you know them i asked we trade with them everyone does they have the ships they go to alba they control all the tin he looked the way a man does trapped in an argument with a small child will they want our copper or our wine i asked sittonax shrugged how would i know he answered that night we sat down to dinner in the lords hall i met his sister who was a year or two older than he perhaps thirty she was not beautiful but rather strongfeatured a long horsey face strong teeth a marvellous laugh she had heavy bones like an athlete and she was as tall as i am and perhaps as strong too id never seen a greek woman who looked like her and yet i find i do her injustice she was slimwaisted and widehipped and had deep breasts just in a larger stronger way than greek women she didnt have an ounce of fat on her and her face looked ungentle when she laughed which was often she laughed with the abandon with which men laugh but the longer i watched her and the other keltoi the more i saw how different their women were by the second night their boldness had become proverbial with my crew both for their straightforward propositions and for forceful management when displeased thugater thats a nice way of saying that when a kelt woman didnt like the way you treated her she had a way of punching you in the head and the gentlewomen the aristocrats all wore knives they used them to eat but they were not eating knives or so it appeared to me at any rate her name was tara or close enough she was far from beautiful i suppose but i wanted her the moment my eyes fell on her and i suspected that the feeling was mutual but she was the lords sister and that meant i needed to be careful still i taught her to play knucklebones our way which was rather different from theirs and she caught me peering down her marvellous cleavage and she laughed a greek girl might have blushed might have simpered might have met my eyes for a moment and glanced away might have fled the room or gone stony cold too but she met my eye and roared when her brother came and sat with us and sittonax joined us we could converse a little i have no idea what we talked about but sittonax became bored very quickly who wants to interpret for someone elses flirting i mean really tertikles leaned in then and spoke vehemently so strongly that i thought i was getting the this is my sister lecture but she looked at me licked her lips and nodded enthusiastically so i met her eye she had wonderful lively expressive eyes she was a person for whom the world was a fine place sittonax looked at me the lord just made a speech and ill say that he proposes formally and with a vow that we go and attack the trading post sittonax sat back hes very serious id had all day to think about it i knew that doola would be against it but the rest of my people would probably go along with it especially the six marines id picked up from demetrios of phocaea and we had nothing to show for our adventures so far but bruises and welts nor were we wellfound enough to trade id learned that it was a bitter lesson what do they have in the way of defences i asked sittonax raised an eyebrow at me again i have to note that none of these people except my marines knew me as arimnestos killer of men they knew me as arimnestos sometime merchantcaptain and bronzesmith tertikles grinned he made a short speech his arms moving dramatically sittonax looked at me he says that nothing will stand before his sword about that time tara punched her brother in the arm they glared at each other i cleared my throat tell him that id be happy to join him but im a greasy wily greek and i require things like scouting surprise and a plan as well as an agreement on division of the spoils before id think of risking my ship and what ship does he have after some further discussion sittonax sat back disgusted he thought we could all ride in our ship he said he said many interesting things the phoenicians have raided this place twice in the last ten years for slaves their father died fighting the phoenicians so he has every reason i nodded i was looking at the crowd of my men and the locals who were eating communally all intermixed i was trying to catch doolas eye but he was gazing into the eyes of a blond kelt woman and didnt seem to know i existed seckla watched him with undisguised jealousy well other people have complex lives too tertikles spoke again waving his arms tara watched him when he spoke and then went back to watching me how many warriors does he have i asked sittonax nodded he asked after a heated conversation sittonax turned back to me his face flushed he claims a thousand he shrugged i think a hundred would be more like it hes a hothead this from you i remember thinking sittonax had never had a practical thought in his life he lived to eat drink fight and make love i caught vasileoss eye and he came up to the head of the hall he looked embarrassed its funny what you remember i never found out why who knows what the kelt girl asked him or did hah they were forward and i saw them do things that id put weals on your back for thugater no i wont tell you fine ill tell you one kelt girls would ahem measure a man with a stick and then giggle no you have to guess the rest for yourself im just an old man leave me alone at any rate vasileos came to join us blushing like a virgin at a betrothal party he sat beside me could we build a ship here i asked he shrugged id have to see the timber in the hills he said but if the pines up there are as fine as the two outside the fort id say yes i have my tools how long to build two more like lydia i asked he shrugged a month i assume i will get all the help i need sittonax was shaking his head you cant be meaning to stay here a month id like to give amphitrite time to catch us up i said and if hell trade two ships for a months food and then some well we can go raiding with him sittonax shook his head i want to get home he said want to get home rich i asked he kept shaking his head you dont know my people well enough to do this arimnestos he said next week tertikles could be in love with a neighbours daughter or a horse and your project will be forgotten he looked at tara and there are other complications hes offering you his sister in marriage but its not that simple i need to tell you some things about the keltoi hes not her lord shes more like his queen just like that i asked were impulsive he admitted tell her yes i looked at her and winked and that as they say was that marriage at least handfast marriage between mature adults was a fairly informal affair among the southern keltoi about a week later we put our hands together over a copper cauldron of water and her brother stirred honey into a poultice with a dagger of bronze that looked ancient we both agreed rather like farmers haggling over a cow to certain conditions about how to raise any children and under what conditions wed part it was not a permanent union in fact it was more like a trade bond or an amphictyony as we call it a league and covenant between neighbours an alliance and by the time her brother had said the words there was a stack of big spruce trees by the beach and vasileos had the lower strakes split twenty slaves and a dozen keltoi craftsmen worked with him and sittonax sat on a log translating bored out of his head and resentful our wedding night was great fun the keltoi are great ones for feasting their notion of a symposium would recommend itself to the very richest athenians and our wedding feast was far more heroic than the ceremony itself we drank and drank and then my bride placed a hand on my thigh very high on my thigh and said in beautifully accented greek stop drinking i almost spat out my wine she roared with laughter men when they drink too much she said and made a motion with her finger that i shant repeat sittonax sat by me to translate ive tried to teach her some greek he admitted you speak well i said to her not many things she said she knew some greek before sittonax added ah i said from traders slaves she said and shrugged sittonax leaned forward you know shes been married before he said so i said so have i theyve all died he mentioned in battle all of them how many i asked six he said she met my eyes and smiled you are a great warrior she said shes practised that phrase a lot sittonax said ive been married before i said she smiled my wife died in childbirth i said suddenly i was crying she wrapped me in her arms bad she said she was warm and kind i hadnt cried in someones arms in a long time and while some of my crewmen looked askance none of the keltoi so much as noticed theyre a more hotblooded race than greeks and they show their emotions later we were alone i wont bore you with details hah maybe i will later a week later and tara and i knew each other better i had never known a woman like her and while im not sure i loved her i liked her very well indeed when she wanted to make love shed make love anywhere in a field in among the timbers of the new ships on the mountainside where we cut the spruce logs on our great bed in her brothers hall but i swiftly found that it was her decision not mine and there are tremendous advantages when you dont really share a language we never argued we didnt have enough words and lack of language focuses you i paid strict attention to her and she to me so i knew when she was annoyed when she was delighted when she was frustrated she was a good companion the more so as she was just as good a companion when we went up in the hills to cut more spruce as she was when we were using axes to cut when we gathered firewood when we swam when we cooked its not that she was manly it took me months in her company to put a name to it she was free but ill talk more about that later i like to tell these stories in order and so ill say that after wed filled the beach with spruce trees stacked like kindling hauled by heavy horses unlike anything id seen in greece we took council with tertikles and his steward with doola who was besotted with a kelt girl and scarcely able to think straight and with sittonax who wore a permanent scowl it was a disjointed spiritless meeting only tertikles tara and i were interested in the end i decided to take lydia south and west looking for the phoenician port tara decided to come with me i had a notion too that i might come across demetrios and the rest of my friends if they were alive they were probably well to the south that seemed fine sittonax elected to come with us as well and doola stayed with vasileos seckla came with me and off we went into the great blue its funny what you dont think of a day up the coast from oiasso and we hit a twoday storm i had no vasileos to rely on its an interesting facet of command the ways you take the load off i knew that i wasnt the best sea officer and that i relied on vasileos to take care of some of the routine shiphandling but when i planned a fourday scout to the south it didnt seem that important that he wasnt coming we didnt have lydia off the beach before i missed him and the ships name lydia what had possessed me married to tara and a day at sea and she asked me between bouts of vicious seasickness what the ships name meant liedya she said what is it sittonax grinned mirthlessly shes a woman i abandoned without marrying in my last port of call i thought its a womans name i said tara spat over the side what woman she asked i made some noises a woman i knew i said it sounded weak even as the words left the fence of my teeth wife she asked in a matteroffact voice no i said ah she said i let it go and counted myself lucky i was still young and i didnt know much taras seasickness went on and on after a twoday blow that nearly killed us its not much of a story and i dont wish to bore you we found the coast again sailed south for two days and landed at oiasso how tertikles laughed we took on more water more smoked pork and sailed again this time we sailed due east for a day with a perfect breeze and made camp on an empty beach within an hour my marines were calling out and a dozen locals approached carefully to sell us lobster and fish they werent keltoi and they werent greeks and we didnt have anyone who could speak to them they had an odd language with grunts and clicks or so it sounded to me the men had heavy heads and muscles and the women seemed about the same to be honest tara eyed them warily bask she said she spoke rapidly to sittonax she says they are all witches and we should be wary he said we were wary we kept a good guard but we ate their fish and paid in copper and sailed away uninjured the next day there was no wind to speak of and we rowed tara seemed disappointed when i rowed but then she stripped off her linen shirt and took the oar across from mine the oarsmen whooped tara grinned ill tell you short of having heracles and orpheus in your crew a goodlooking woman rowing with breasts bared does a great deal for morale im not sure it wasnt the fastest rowing ive ever seen it tired the men but then none of them would admit he was tired which was useful in itself i rowed for a long time i wanted my people to see i was with them not just commanding them theyd put up with two weeks of my aping the manners of the keltoi aristocracy i felt they needed proof i could still row and i wanted proof i was getting my body back damn dagon he had nearly broken me and a year more of exercise rowing sword practice and boxing had still not restored me to the level id been at when i fought at marathon damn him indeed so i rowed and the next day i rowed again tara rowed every time i rowed well as i say that had positive benefits but i realized that she would not stop until i stopped and her arms and shoulders were strong but not as strong as mine the second day when we put our clothes back on it was high summer and i rowed naked tara pulled me by the arm did she row as well as i she asked row i asked who lydia she spat did she row uhoh fourth day at sea and the coast of iberia which had been like the broken teeth of an old man to our south suddenly vanished i turned from easterly to full south and found the coast again after two panicked hours of raising and lowering sail we landed at a headland and spent a fruitless day prowling what proved to be a deep bay but eventually we were rewarded with an iberian fishing port which had three things we needed men who spoke keltoi fresh water and hatred for the phoenicians who were it turned out just across the bay at elvina a days row away the phoenicians and their local iberian allies preyed relentlessly on centrona as our new friends called their village we got water we traded copper for silver they mined silver in the hills and we got expert sailing advice from the local fishermen who offered to show us the phoenician port i took two locals aboard who spoke keltoi and we rowed at their direction coming up on the phoenician post with the sun behind us so we were invisible or so we hoped if it was a trade post it was a very small one there was what had to be a warehouse the largest building all heavy wooden piles and bark walls and a slave pen i knew what that was twenty huts a single stone tower and a lighthouse and a warship drawn up on the beach sittonax was tired of interpreting and i was beginning to get the hang of the local keltoi tongue and tara was even better so i talked to the fishermen through her how many soldiers i asked lets just say it took us some time to define what i meant by soldier in the end we agreed that i meant armed men twenty he answered and more come in the ships we crept north and west to stay out of sight and then went ashore on the opposite side of the headland from the lighthouse in case it was manned and made our way up a long ridge that dominated the settlement it was a long time since id done all these things but let me tell you friends it came back like the feel of a good sword in your hand we spent the day high on the ridge with a woven screen of brush in front of us me tara sittonax and two fishermen as well as aeneas and alexandros my two most reliable marines the warship on the beach was being repaired i was pretty sure she was the trireme wed damaged off the pillars of heracles because her starboard cathead was a mess and there were injured men in the slave pen and the rowers were either slaves or men treated as slaves we can take them now i insisted to sittonax he shrugged fine he said but despite his bored face he quivered with excitement taras eyes sparkled send to the ship and get everyone and have them arm i said tara made a moue what do you need them for she asked go and challenge their leader to single combat keltoi i grinned i have my own ways i said we struck when the sun set but the sky was still light working people would have been in bed i went straight for the tower i had the marines and sittonax and tara who had weapons and seemed to know how to use them the eight of us would i hoped be enough seckla led the oarsmen to open the slave pens and cow its occupants seckla had been a slave i reckoned hed be able to tell who might make a good ally among them dogs barked and men shouted and then i was up the ladder and in through the secondstorey door to the stone tower there was a man inside i killed him it had been some time but the motions werent unfamiliar and neither were the smells i held the door for about twenty heartbeats and then alexandros was next to me and then we were among them i expect about half of them got to weapons before the real killing started but they had neither armour nor shields and their bedmates helped us a great deal girls and boys pinned the ankles of men or trapped their hands or simply kicked them from behind all told it didnt take long we slaughtered the guards and stormed the tower there was a family living on the top floor the only actual phoenicians in the whole complex im proud to say that we took them prisoner the keltoi dont rape by and large and tara whose right arm was covered in blood to the elbow took the women and turned towards seckla who grinned and saluted her and that was that the curlybearded overseers life wouldnt have been worth a brass obol had i let go of him but he knew the mathematika of his situation the moment i took him and he babbled out where the ships crew was and his store of silver six marines and the triremes deck crew i shouted to my men follow me but sometimes the gods smile id missed them sneaking in theyd been quartered in a barn beyond the slave pens and the triremes helmsman had a house by the huts but when seckla freed the slaves well they tore the helmsman limb from limb which wasnt what id have wanted a man who really knew these waters would have been a priceless asset otherwise it was all easy i sent seckla to fetch lydia around the point wed exterminated the opposition and we didnt have to hurry we examined the stores of the little post they were ample the phoenicians collected taxes from the whole district even while taking their people as slaves i suspect wed have been quite popular if wed stayed but on the other hand it was always possible the locals would see us as more of the same which of course we were slaves african slaves told seckla that another ship had come in with the trireme on the beach and then sailed away thats the only reason we missed a huge consignment of silver you cant waste curses on these things wed stormed the place with a boats crew and the worst injury was giannis the youngest of my herdsmen who managed to lose the chape from his scabbard in the attack the point of his long knife rammed through the top of his thighs as he ran opening truly horriblelooking wounds no im not making this up we all teased him about it and he took our teasing the way young men who want to be heroes react good fun really my crew were blooded theres no other way to put it they killed together and they were victorious together and we had a small stack of silver bars and some tin that they all knew theyd share together it all came back to me so easily kill the men take the women sell the cargo build morale in the crew train them to fight kill and dont be killed hardly worth the telling really at any rate we burned the slave pens and cooked pigs in the embers the slaves liked that taras admiration was candid i liked that in the morning i looked over the trireme her starboard cathead was smashed to splinters and needed professional help i remember standing there with two of my fishermen and alexandros and seckla seckla was a craftsman the kind of man whos never happy unless hes working he pushed and pulled and shook his head i agreed i wanted that ship but she was too damaged to use so i turned to my friends the fishermen tell me about the weather the next four days they prevaricated but eventually the older one admitted that it was unusually fine even for summer seckla glared at me you cant be thinking we can tow this thing many things in my life have represented gifts from the gods briseis despite the many ugly turns she did me she drove me to heroism like a farmer drives an ox to work my fathers decision to send me to the old priest calchus for training four days west wind i asked the former slaves for volunteers and lets be frank what choice did they have stay and be enslaved by the iberians by the time the smoke of the slave pens was in the sky there were already iberian warriors prowling the ridges above the little warehouse town before wed been at sea an hour they set fire to the lighthouse my phoenician factor was a cringing coward i might be too if a savage pirate and his tattooed mistress had my wife and children but he was a fount of information as we sailed east on a perfect wind we have no defences he admitted he almost bragged it it is fifty years since any of the interior tribes attacked us he looked at the sea how did you make it past the squadron at gades then he looked at me you you were the small ship that dadalos was pursuing i smiled nastily but we took that ship he quailed at his own words i was older calmer more mature so i didnt grab him by the throat what ship i asked i thought my tone was mild he grew very red in the face like a maiden blushing i took his hand and pressed my thumb and forefinger to a certain spot it was scarcely necessary he shrieked days ago helitkon of tartessos took a small sailing ship no more than a fishing boat laden with goods from the inner sea he writhed in my hands where helitkon brought him in to me i supplied him he sailed south wheres the ship the crew i asked he took them to sell he was screaming it is sickening ill admit his daughters looked at me with naked hate that transcended fear they hated me more than they feared rape and death which all things considered suggests they were brave and they obviously loved him which meant that however much i wanted to see him as the enemy as a piece of shit who dealt in human lives and stole and killed he was a good father of course i knew that i dealt in human lives too time makes things difficult maturity unless you are simply a killer a thug robs you of certainty i let go his hand and i felt ashamed tara watched me she looked at me the way a cat looks at something it doesnt know a cat is asking is this prey or predator yes well i looked up at my mainsail drawing well i looked back at the long curve of the tow rope i wished for the hundredth time that i had vasileos but i sang a prayer to poseidon that night after i made love to my wife on the beach with the ancient pines the coast of iberia had been phoenicias cash cow for seventy years and it was naked before me old thoughts boiled to the surface i had enough silver from the one raid to make the trip a success but but there could be more oiasso welcomed us as victors which we were tertikles was enraged at first that wed stormed centrona without him doola hugged me on the beach and introduced me to his wife one trick of leadership that i learned young was never to question a mans taste in bedpartners no faster way to lose his faith his loyalty his courage that said though id always known that doola and seckla were together it wasnt a spoken thing it just was and then one fine day we landed at oiasso doola fell for a kelt girl and the next i knew he was wed doola was my friend practically my brother it was not my place to even ask i hugged him kissed her and bade them every fortune but seckla stood on the beach with death in his eyes he was younger tough strong tall and thin and his love went to hate all at once i think hed assumed that doola would wake up one morning and be done with the woman instead he married her and seckla was also my friend seckla was touchier more full of fire perhaps less useful sometimes but not on this last raid seckla looked at doola and i looked at seckla command leadership a neverending labyrinth of difficult decisions tara got it all in one glance or maybe knew it from gossip either way she was quick they were lovers she asked actually she asked something cruder her greek was barbaric yes i was moving cautiously towards seckla i was afraid hed kill his former friend right there she laughed ill find him someone she said she laughed again men vasileos had finished both vessels they were a little longer than lydia with beautiful lines a slightly narrower entry rather bluffer bows the ram bow rose just a little at the tip so that in heavy water the cutwater would perhaps push the bow up not down or so vasileos theorized we sat down to our welcome feast with tertikles looking just about as happy as seckla he was easy tara told him that i planned to raid to the south all along the coast and he brightened a blackhaired girl with a narrow face and huge eyes went to seckla and hesitantly sat down with him tara winked at me seckla ignored her more fool he but i had vasileos watch him and then i ordered alexandros to watch him alexandros like many other young men i have met and known had discovered that he liked to be trusted liked to be responsible he was rising to command i felt old id done all this before none of it was new what do we do with the prisoners doola asked me id like to ransom them i said we left it there summer was slipping away by the time we got the cathead repaired on the trireme and my nearly two hundred former oarslaves created a certain chaos in the town just feeding them strained tertikles to the maximum so all the silver and the tin from the raid went to paying for grain from other lords i gave up on trade and armed them with the helmets id made and we used the rest of the hides to make plain spolas with yokes over the shoulders you might think that id be away south after demetrios gaius and the rest but i knew i was up against at least a pair of triremes with expert crews and my prisoner told me that most of the slaves who went to the south were used in the silver mines above olisipo on the tagus a river to the south of centrona with a broad estuary a dangerous bar and silver and gold in the mountains behind it he was very talkative i promised to release him with his wife and daughters on the coast south of olisipo after my raid he didnt seem to mind men can be stupid the grain was ripe in the fields and the apples were nearly ripe on the trees and all four of my ships were ready for sea id rowed my new warship up and down and id roared myself hoarse in three languages trying to make the keltoi obey something at which to be honest they werent very good keltoi dont obey they discuss keltoi debate every man is the equal of every other man on the other hand i ate well exercised trained men to use the sword and shield and made love every night to a woman who well who knew what she was about it is very different for a man to make love to a woman who is the same size as he is very different very athletic ah the blushes we celebrated the summer feast of demeter at least thats what it was to me and tertikles sacrificed a slave which was barbaric as far as i was concerned he came aboard my trireme because it was more comfortable we had three triakonters packed to the gunwales with keltoi warriors in good armour and a trireme with former phoenician slaves armed and ready to fight we were ready the gods had other ideas we put to sea and sailed for little more than two hours before the wind turned round and headed us and we were lucky to slip easily back into the estuary and land on our beach at oiasso two days later we rowed out past the headland and were back before dark the wind was too fierce for the trireme tempers flared keltoi picked up their gear and went home oddly this was balanced by late arrivals who wandered down from the mountains as if arriving a week late was perfectly normal of course theyd never rowed and they resented being taught tertikles became surly and only his sister being there prevented violence we were windbound for ten days i rowed in the estuary and vasileos kept them hard at it in the lydia but the other two ships did nothing but eat drink and sleep the season was getting on we had our first cool night seckla tried to kill doola it was quick and carefully premeditated but while vasileos was busy commanding his ship alexandros was right there and he tackled the numidian boy tore the knife from his grasp and then knocked him unconscious the next day i sat with seckla in my tent watching the whitecaps in the estuary and cursing the gods when his eyes opened he looked at me for a moment and then rolled over so that he faced the wall of the tent you are an idiot i said his silence was his only reply if you had killed him i would have killed you i said fine he said kill me now in a year this will be a bitter memory in five years it will scarcely trouble you in ten years youll make jokes about it i put a hand on his shoulder no he said yes i said i know i know lad i have been abandoned and i have abandoned others it comes and goes when we were slaves he spat you would moan in your sleep and say a name always the same name briseis briseis always the same he rolled over suddenly and glared at me tell me you have forgotten her yes old man i shrugged i have not forgotten her but i dont burn and neither will you my life is over he tried to turn back over i pinned him with an elbow no it isnt and now you can be your own man and stop being in his shadow silence the young burn so hot and they have so much energy for hate and anger so i put a watch on him the next day the wind pinned us to the beach and doola came to my tent i hugged him and he went into seckla as if seckla was sick and needed visitation which was true in a way seckla had a knife he slashed doolas face and then turned it on himself there are advantages to being a hardened killer when a good friend tries to kill himself you can disarm him without taking a scratch i had the knife before hed done much more than scratch his dark skin he glared at me like an angry tomcat i went to doola and found that while he was cut to the bone it was really just a flesh wound face wounds bleed like well like face wounds there seems to be enough blood to be fatal hard to staunch too the blood went on and on seckla watched alexandros was pinning him to his bed did i kill him he asked doola got up with a linen towel against his face soaked with blood let me just say the following conversation happened in a language i dont understand well mostly most of it was in their tongue despite that i understood it fine and besides ive heard the story told a dozen times stop being a fuckhead he said you betrayed me seckla screamed doola shrugged grow up be a man its time to leave childish things i want a wife and children we are free now we can have anything i want you seckla said no you dont you want someone to take care of you i want to be a free man im still your friend you get the picture it went on for as long as it took a man to run five stades blood flowed down doolas face and he shouted at seckla and seckla shouted back keltoi came and stood around watching the entertainment finally they both stopped an odd silence fell a sort of crowded hush as many many people who had been listening all listened harder in the hush i heard something i had seckla by the shoulders at the time vasileos who had run to the sound of the shouting stood in the doorway he heard what i heard he ran out of the door im ashamed to say i dropped seckla like a hot piece of meat and ran after him the sun was bright and the wind had dropped and now a whisper of east wind blew across the hills like a lovers caress man the ships i barked i knew that once we got to sea all this foolishness would be gone nothing nothing had gone well since we reached past the pillars i wanted to collect my friends steal some silver and go home i was no less an idiot than seckla four days sailing and rowing brought us to the iberian settlement across the bay from centrona they didnt give us a heros welcome we had too many ships but they sold us pigs and barley and we ate well enough ships come said the headman with sittonax to support me we finally established that a few weeks before a pair of triremes had come to centrona landed for a day and rowed away south that wasnt all good i bought all the grain i could which wasnt as much as i wanted and we rowed south we had to beach every evening in a smaller boat a triakonter you can stay the night at sea right up to a fiftyoared ship you can stay two or three days at sea and still have enough food to feed your crew stowed in the bilges and under the benches but triremes only carried food and water for one day a trireme needs to make port or beach every night but i knew i needed a heavy ship so we beached and bought fish fish for three hundred men grain rotgut wine terrible small beer at extravagant prices and the haggling meant that the crew ate after dark each night what was worse i had to turn back every day to find the laggards the two keltoi ships always left the beach late and rowed slowly if at all the keltoi were far too proud to row if they didnt have a wind theyd idle along i was starting to hate them and tara inevitably took their side useless lubbers no wonder they hadnt built their own ships sittonax laughed wait until you meet the venetiae he said then he made a face of course they never row either six days we spent on the coast of iberia for an expedition that depended on surprise we were the most incompetent squadron since poseidon ruled the seas we were loud we spread over stades we were visible from every headland we never sailed before the sun we were always caught on the sea by high noon we ate late and the keltoi drank too much any night that there was anything to drink little by little i lost control of the expedition from here i can see just how it happened i wasnt interested in taking tertikles on day after day night after night he on the other hand was relentless in his lazy shiftless arrogant way every day he would push his own authority after six days he left my ship and moved into one of the two triakonters that were all keltoi his sister went after me the next morning you treat my brother like a slave she said no tara i treat him like a fool who knows nothing of war or the sea i wasnt taking this even from her my brother is a master of war he has killed twenty men in single combat she was spitting mad you cannot take the tone with him that you take you speak as if to a child he wanted me to put the sail up i said it was a simple request she stood with her hands on her hips the wind was against us i shook my head i hope you are seeing what i had to deal with she shrugged so you say she said what do you do i just let it go seven days and we sighted the mouth of the tagus i knew from my prisoner that the mines were in the mountains east of the river mouth about a hundred stades inland on the south side of the river so i led my squadron out to sea and we passed the mouth of the tagus well to seaward and then angled back east and landed on the soft sand south of the river mouth well south that night i gathered my captains or rather thats what i thought i was doing instead when tertikles and his warcaptains joined me and vasileos doola and alexandros at the fire the keltoi refused to discuss plans tertikles was in full armour he jerked a thumb at himself with vast selfimportance ill do as i think best he said and i intend to attack the settlement i thought about it for several heartbeats it seemed to me that i had two choices i could kill him or i could submit to him both of those alternatives bored me or i could let him go his own way so be it i said enjoy yourself you will follow my lead he said no i said no were quits here tertikles you make your attack ill make mine he was puzzled a gleam of gold and bronze in the firelight what do you plan he asked i grinned my hand on my sword hilt i may have been wrong i never found out but i suspected that i could have put him down before he could take a breath none of your business i said tara frowned you must help my brother i shook my head no sorry tara i never intended to attack the settlement im not even going to scout it its defended well never get as lucky as we did at the last one you are a coward she said it is funny how much some things hurt and other things dont cowardice wasnt something id ever really worried about so i shrugged which infuriated her our marriage ends here on this beach she shouted goodbye i said she followed her brother across the sand dawn found us at sea i didnt trust tertikles not to burn the trireme out of spite but i turned south not north we ran two small coves down the coast and put in again before the keltoi were even awake we beached sternfirst and brought the ship well up the beach turned her turtle in case it rained then i gathered my whole crew armed them and we marched inland inland why attack the settlement the silver came from a hundred stades away and that was where in all likelihood my friends were if they were alive we marched across the plains south of the tagus it was hot here and we raised dust as we marched and there was no hiding the gleam of metal by midmorning i was sure we could be seen for sixty stades there were farms and plantations we took water from wells and i stole horses from the first really prosperous farm we passed and more horses from the next only about twenty of us could ride and we spread out to prevent surprise ive never really loved horses but they can be damned useful and iberians have fine horses by late afternoon my prisoner said we were halfway to the mines we found a stand of trees and my entire small army went into the trees and laid down and in minutes most of my people were asleep even the stolen horses slept alexandros took four men and found a stream and we filled canteens i was too nervous too aware to sleep so i helped carry water and i climbed a tree and watched in all directions when the sun began to dip i slid down my tree and ordered doola to wake the men in the distance there was smoke towards the estuary of the tagus i got my men together we drank water ate some dried pork and moved east into the hills there was a good road and we found it quickly and after that i didnt need my prisoner we found the mines at dark my herdsmen and shepherds crept around in the dark for a few hours and came back and reported i had hoped that when tertikles attacked the settlements the slave guards at the mine would react what i should have known is that a silver mine is much more important than a bunch of slaves and their families i can be foolish like that the guards were alert and awake they didnt actually catch any of my people but we had the immense disappointment of hearing the alarm sounded a man beating a copper plate and shouting in phoenician so much for surprise i slept for a little and when i awoke i decided to have a look for myself i climbed above the mine actually a huge open pit with giannis and alexios another shepherd lights twinkled below us like orange stars giannis had grown up during the summer he lay on his stomach and pointed i think these are the slave quarters he said see the largest building next to it the tower yes you see and then i dont know what this other building does i did i could smell it they smelted in that shed in the moonlight i could make out pits and slag heaps among the shadows id had a glimpse in the last light it was the only time i can remember where my skills as a smith had tactical value i had a dozen archers a dozen trained marines and a lot of oarsmen i couldnt afford a complicated plan we lacked the skill or the trust neither did i have the time on the other hand the garrison couldnt be more than fifteen or twenty men and when push came to shove i didnt really need to storm the tower i wanted to thats where the silver would be but what i really needed were the slaves if demetrios and gaius and daud were here theyd be in that slave pen sometimes you make complex decisions on the slenderest of evidence it can lead to foolishness or brilliance i put a hand on gianniss shoulder im going for the slave pens i said if im not back in an hour tell doola to come and get me giannis argued but not for long and then i was ghosting along through the darkness i am an old campaigner i knew how to move well in the dark even in a foreign place on foreign soil i fell once with a clatter in fact i fell rolled and came up one twitch short of falling over a fortyfoot cliff that would either have killed me or left me a broken man but i got up and moved on no worse for near death theres a moral there i stubbed my sandalled toes several times on the rock but i moved slowly took my time and in an hour i had gone down the slope and moved from slag heap to slag heap across the flat ground at the edge of the great black pit the slag was fascinating i lay against one heap and smelled it ran my hand over it i even tasted a sample that slag heap told me more than my prisoner had told me more than the slaves had told it explained everything they didnt mine silver here they mined gold i crept carefully across the last of the open ground towards the slave house it was quite big a sort of hall of hides with palisade walls bigger than the largest barn in boeotia and it smelled it smelled of men the timbers in the palisade were huge big resinated pines from the hillsides the hide roof was well up over my head i went to the door first it was at the top of a low ramp up a set of steps and it took me precious time to find it was latched outside with a heavy iron spike driven through a shackle attached to a huge sliding bar i crouched listening to the men in the tower there were at least two on duty they knew that someone was moving its a fox said one with a deep voice its not a fox you fool said a highpitched voice that was a man on the slag heap wake the captain then said the deep voice you wake him idiot said the higher voice and so on i sat on my heels in the shadow of the slave quarters and waited this had happened to me many times i feel it is impossible to explain that i am waiting for a sign a signal there is no point in hurrying i had no idea what i was waiting for but i waited and i prayed to heracles my ancestor and to poseidon lord of horses and the stars wheeled above me mocking my pretensions to greatness i thought of briseis and euphoria and lydia of phrynichus and aristides for the first time in months i thought of miltiades it is an odd thing i suspect that when i am on the edge of life and death perhaps i am closer to the gods my mind is clear i think well there in the shadow of the doorway i took stock and found that i was wasting time that my mourning for euphoria was over i missed penelope i missed plataea i didnt want to start again i didnt want to make a life of killing men either it was a moment of great clarity for me i remember it much better than i remember the landing on the beach or the march overland i believe that the gods reached out and touched me i think that athena stood by my shoulder and helped open my mind i reached up and opened the iron shackle it wasnt loud but it made a distinctive noise whats that asked the deep voice i began tapping on the door we had tapped on dagons ship if neoptolymos was in there hed hear the tapping i say we wake the captain said deep voice and then he orders us to go out in the dark said high voice taptaptap tap tap thunk well that could be any slave on the other hand it scarcely mattered i realized i was trying too hard i reached up and pulled the bar it moved silently the wood smooth the door opened inwards of course there were fifty men by the door stinking filthy and thin eyes shining in the dark neoptolymos i whispered daud demetrios men were grabbing my arms damn i thought hes in the slave quarters high voice shouted damn the men in the tower reacted far faster than i expected they must have had a sortie ready and armed the men on top of the tower shouted and banged on a piece of copper there was some more shouting the slaves around me seemed to hang back anyone speak greek i asked no need for silence now i do friend said a familiar voice and then the phoenicians attacked there were a dozen they sprinted across the yard obvious in the moonlight they had armour and spears of course they did in one glance i knew they were poieni citizen infantry phoenician hoplites it was after all a gold mine daud i asked arimnestos he asked by the gods and then the poieni were coming at me they had to come up the short ramp and then the steps and perhaps they didnt really believe that the intruder would be armed i got one for nothing you usually do my spear had not lost its purpose and my hand had not lost its skill my spearhead went in one eye and he fell on top of his mates i wasnt going into the slave quarters if i did they could simply lock the door on me and hunt me down in daylight but i had the glimmer of a plan so i took a step backwards onto the low platform just inside the log lintel they took a long minute to decide to come after me though and when they did they came silently their bare feet padding on the steps fast and purposeful the first man came though the door with his aspis thrust well up ahead of him i launched myself at him and we went shield to shield in the near darkness my spear was leaning against the wall ready to hand i had a short sword in my fist and i cut over his shield then under it this man was good he rolled with my shield slam and got free got his shield down and then up while he shortened his grip on his spear i got my sword against his helmet but not hard enough still where a mans head goes his weight goes so i kept pushing and he had to bend back but his spear started searching for me wild pecks like a snake striking at a bird all in nearperfect darkness something changed a man behind him thrust with his spear at my head and some noise betrayed him i wrenched my head to my right my adversarys head cracked against the doorpost helmet and all he fell away from me the spear hit my helmet but not a killing blow i got my weight under me powered forward got my right knee into my adversarys groin and then swung my aspis into his head and by sheer luck blocked the next thrust from his partner there is no going back in such combat i was too close to do anything but grapple i let the aspis drop off my right arm as my left arm swept past my new opponents head and i seized his aspis with my left hand spun it and broke his arm turned him as he screamed and pulled i threw him in through the door and in among the slaves doola i roared the third man came up the steps i had his spearhead heracles gave it to me suddenly it was in my right hand which ran down the shaft even as he ran up the steps and i turned it slammed the spear across his aspis and then slipped it over his head and locked him by the neck the fourth man thrust at me the third mans face went rigid and i backed up the steps using him as a shield i was strong oh i was strong i laughed i laughed at dagon break my body will you my victim screamed and i got the spear shaft under his jaw at last and broke his neck eager hands reached from behind me and grabbed him by the helmet and towed him into the slave quarters the fourth man was still in shock hed just seen three comrades die one judging from the mans skill his captain and then hed stabbed his mate i got a deep breath into my body seized my spear from behind the door and threw it into him so that he fell the spear deep in his body he thrashed and the other men flinched away from him instinctively men behind me passed me my aspis i had all the time in the world to get it on my arm i started down the steps the poieni shuffled and broke i must have laughed im laughing now oh the power id missed this they might as well have stood their ground none of them made the door of the tower because doola was there and his archers shot them down in the moonlit open ground a few ran off into the slag heaps some ruthless bastard in the tower slammed the door shut the slaves started to come out of their quarters the door was open in the darkness they looked like creatures from the underworld they were too thin to be men i didnt know neoptolymos when he stepped up to me in sicily he had filled out into a solid rock with muscles that stood out like a statue of heracles now the skin was stretched tightly across a skulllike head and his towblond hair was medusas in the moonlight brother he asked his voice a sibilant whisper i thought he was some iberian who spoke greek he didnt look like an illyrian but i got it some interplay of light and shadow something in the set of the mouth i crushed him to me we knew youd come he managed a laugh where are the others i asked he pointed towards the gaping pit a black hole in the dark they tried to escape and were caught so they arent allowed out of the pit gaius especially he grinned hes a bad slave but alive i said i feared the worst this was insane id heard rumours that the athenians used slaves like this in their silver mines but it made no sense and now i knew that i should have come as soon as i knew where they were but that kind of thinking leads to mistakes i shrugged it off lets go and get them i said you have to wait for daylight neoptolymos said you cant even get down the ladders in the dark he shrugged i tried once i reckoned it was two hours until dawn doola came out of the moonlit darkness and hugged neoptolymos so did seckla neoptolymos laughed aloud by the gods he said you came you came there were a hundred or more slaves milling about in the darkness many of them ran off i have no idea what happened to them many of course must have been iberians and found their way home or died but there were a hundred men who stayed greeks etruscans iberians africans from libya and farther off and keltoi too neoptolymos knew them most of them by name and he moved among them giving orders well he had been a prince once meanwhile doola and i looked at the tower men at the top of it shot arrows at us but i who had endured persian archery didnt think much of their weak bows and their pisspoor shooting in the dark no less we walked all around the tower if we burn it every phoenician in iberia will know we are here doola said i thought about it there wasnt a hurry yet and i took some time to think if they find our ships were fucked i said but other than that do you really think they have two hundred soldiers in this whole colony doolas eyes flashed in the dark he laughed a cruel laugh doola was a gentle man not a man who fancied killing not a man who loved the feel of a spear in his hand but slavery enraged him you want them to come here he asked we have the high ground and their gold theyd be fools to come for us but if they do we can teach them a lesson i grinned he grinned we set fire to the tower it took time it is one thing to say the tower is made of wood and another thing entirely to get it to burn heres what we did we stripped all the shingles off the livestock sheds and then we broke down the sheds themselves and the big wooden structure where the smelting went on we had a hundred pairs of willing hands and it is literally unbelievable how much damage a hundred angry former slaves can do to their masters property then we had ten of the strongest slaves led by neoptolymos carry loads of flammables up to the tower under the cover of twenty of us with aspides held over their heads the men in the tower understood immediately of course we didnt lose a man heh six trips to the tower and back across open ground then doola lit a torch one of ours from the ship he was going to throw it at the pile but i ran it to the pile and placed it well under nothing hit me because it is really very difficult to shoot straight down in the dark with a bow the pile caught the tower caught the men inside died screaming it should have been horrible but instead it was deeply satisfying make of that what you will before dawn the tower was like a lighthouse a beacon with flames ten times the height of a ships mainmast roaring into the sky one of the slaves a man named herodikles sacrificed a ram from the pens and threw the carcass into the fire he was an aeolian from lesbos and hed been a slave for fifteen years taken while on a pilgrimage to cyrene there were a hundred such stories men told them while their oppressors tried to scream the smoke out of their lungs and failed they smelled like roast pork as they burned in the morning when the fire burned less than a mastheight high and the sun was over the rim of the world we climbed down into the pit they were all there waiting they were even thinner and they didnt have darkness to hide the open sores the flies the ooze of pus despite which they grinned from ear to ear gaius daud demetrios who looked so bad i was afraid he would die before we could get food into him i couldnt even figure out how he could stand on those legs they had been slaves for just two months the phoenicians were i was going to say animals but no animal except man treats another like that we rigged a sling and lifted them out of the pit most of them were too weak to climb the ladder while that happened i went and posted sentries there was a new spirit among my men the shepherds the herdsmen the fishermens sons the slaves freed at centrona wed been victorious again we were doing something noble they were inspired just as men can be inspired by a great play or by the noble words of a godlike man like heraclitus or by the gods themselves i knew as soon as i looked at them they were ready to do something great for the moment all we had to do was to be alert we watched the plains all day while the tower burned men looked at me and i smiled i kept my own council there was food in the sheds animals in the pens and i prepared a feast on the coals of the tower and served it to the slaves telling my own men that they should go from slave to slave as if they were slaves themselves they did so with good will the slaves tore into the meat complained about the lack of wine and bread mock complaints although theres always some awkward sod who feels sorry for himself but they ate and ate i saw no reason to leave so much as a goat alive so as fast as they ate we killed more and watched the plains about noon we saw the dust cloud seckla was my best rider i gave him the mounted men and clear orders up at the mine we had a view for fifty stades over the plain so that i could point out his route this stream that copse of trees that farmhouse they cantered away and men cheered them the tower had just about burned out so i asked the slaves to fetch water from the well a bucket at a time and pour it into the coals steam rose to the heavens carrying the scent of roast meat some of it was roast men and the gods have never rejected such a sacrifice i remember wondering at myself i thought tertikles a barbarian for sacrificing a man before we launched our ships but i was secretly pleased to have sent twenty phoenicians screaming to my gods well its true i can be a vicious bastard when the dust cloud on the plain reached a certain point i took most of my armed men and marched we had full bellies and full water bottles and we moved fast going downhill despite the full heat of the summer sun my friends wanted to come gaius demanded it and muttered words about honour i pushed a chunk of goat into his greasy hands honour this i said ill do the killing you do the eating we went down the mountain crossed the stream at its foot and went along the ridge through the high beech trees until we came to the site id chosen on the way when you are a warrior you think about these things all the time that field would make a good place that piece of trail ambushes come in as many different shapes as women and men too if you wish what would make one ambush perfect would be certain death in another i had very few missile weapons so my ambush would be close in a deadly handtohand thing and since my men were on foot we had to win because we were unlikely to outrun pursuit if we had had missile weapons more bows good javelins and throwing strings heavy rocks we might have chosen other sites instead we lay down among the trees an armslength from the road i took my place with doola behind a big rock that slaves and oxen had shifted you could tell because it stood clear of the ground where all the other big rocks were half buried it allowed me to see the road in both directions if you ever have cause to lay an ambush whether you do it with a handful of mud for your brothers or with a sharp spear for your enemies remember these simple rules always have a clear line of retreat any other ambush is just an elaborate form of suicide tailor your surprise to your arms and your enemy if you have bows you should wait at a good killing range with an open field that wont block your archery if you have time plan your ambush so that your first flight of arrows panics your foe into a worse position dont drive him off a road and into an impregnable stronghold the moment anything goes wrong including an hour before you sight the enemy run men in ambush are absurdly vulnerable there ladies all my wisdom wisdom i learned for myself and not from heraclitus he was like a god but i dont think he knew much about ambushes at any rate we lay there and lay there an hour passed and another and the sun went down noticeably i had so much to worry about a man commanding an ambush always does had they stopped and made camp taken another route and even now they were storming the slave camp theyd given up and gone home theyd slipped past us another hour passed insects ate us and men snuck away to piss and snuck back men got the jitters and another hour and then we heard the sound hard to describe but instantly identifiable men a powerful number of them walking with a rattle and tinkle and clank talking they had two scouts they were moving two hundred paces ahead of the column walking on the road when they came to the edge of our copse of woods they stopped they talked with each other until the column had almost caught up then they came into the woods my heart was pounding the enemy had a hundred men perhaps double that it was difficult to count them from my hiding place but there were many of them they entered the woods their scouts moved quickly they were conscious that theyd allowed the column to close up to them too much and they ran but just about even with me one of them stopped he was a handsome young man wearing only a chlamys and a petasos hat and carrying a pair of heavy spears on his shoulder he stopped from a sprint and looked into the woods he wasnt looking at me he was looking away from me staring off into the woods his mate stopped running and looked back see something he called in phoenician the first man looked and looked and then squatted and looked at the road men were here he said you have to imagine they were an armslength from me they didnt have to shout behind them the column came rolling along the road i saw alexandros move and i glared at him ambush requires patience escaped slaves the second man ventured the first man looked all around he was young thats probably what saved him the young make pisspoor observers he looked but didnt see a commanding voice called from behind them on the road i couldnt make it out but it was doubtless their commander telling his scouts to get a move on twilight was only two hours away the young man looked around again and shrugged he and his companion loped off i looked around i could see alexandros and giannis and about fifteen other men i waited the column trudged forward waited she had tits like udders baal it was disgusting he was an ignorant so i said i drank the wine i just want to ask this again they were just men tall short weak strong smart foolish they were men walking down the road on a summer evening headed for battle nervous overtalkative as all men are before a fight as the tail of the column started to pass me i saw the last two men of the first taxis nervously checking the draw of their swords while their phylarch told them that they needed to stay together stay together in the fighting pirates just pirates they wont have any discipline like the lot we took yesterday dont worry about i rose from my place and roared my war cry we fell on the head of the column they died and the survivors broke and ran across the road for the shelter of the trees most ran a few steps into the woods before they died because doola and his men were on that side of the road a little farther back the second taxis froze outside the woods listening to the screams of their comrades and the sounds of onesided handtohand my dozen archers began to drop shafts into them perhaps their officer was hit early perhaps he was a fool either way they did the worst thing possible they huddled like sheep and bleated and the arrows fell a dozen good archers can do a lot of damage even to armoured men even trained men with good morale no one had trained men with good morale in a colony ten thousand stades from home by this time i was watching them the fight in the woods was over before it really began a hundred dead phoenicians mercenaries in fact mostly north africans with some greeks among them men like me heh but not enough like me i started to get my oarsmen in order and alexandros was there and doola and sittonax his long kelt sword red to the hilt i knew the second taxis would break the moment i charged it you can read these things as easily as you read words on a page its like a womans facial expressions the nervous tick the cold glance so by the same token you can read the moving of spears the shuffling of feet and the shaking of horsehair plumes nervous fidgets charge i roared we hadnt run six paces before they broke they ran away from our charge and many of them threw down their shields in the flight the archers loosed and loosed until our charge obscured their targets i didnt catch one of them they ran so early that they easily outdistanced my people all of whom had already fought in one combat even an ambush is a combat and by the time wed crossed the clearing it was plain to see we didnt have the daimon to run them down so we went around the darkening battlefield collecting loot there wasnt much the weapons were average the armour was leather and often already ruined and most of the helmets were cheap openfaced helmets or etruscanstyle salad bowls a few men had purses most of them containing only copper not much to die for at twilight we gave up plundering the dead there were no survivors not even the two scouts whod been killed by the northern fringe of our ambush thats the way of it when an ambush works we left the bodies for the birds and marched back towards the mine when we got there we ate some meat drank water and watched the steam rising off the ruin of the tower then we went to sleep i remember that i forgot to post sentries luckily doola wasnt as tired or as foolish not that it mattered about midnight seckla came back he had heads dangling from his saddlecloth bouncing and frightening his horse it was ghoulish i woke up long enough to embrace him and hear that hed hit the survivors and harried them back to their settlement and then i went back to sleep in the morning it was grey and the sun wasnt going to show my men were surly with fatigue and reaction i knew how to cure that i got a dozen former slaves and some of the stronger herdsmen and together we moved the two largest of the charred beams from the stump of the tower with shovels we cleared the ash and the collapsed roof materials but the fire had burned a long time and almost everything had been consumed except the gold and silver of course it took two hours and i was beginning to doubt but there they were a molten puddle of gold and another of silver about a yard apart a fair amount of gold and quite a lot of silver we took axes and hacked it up into manageable chunks and loaded it on to our stolen horses morale soared we gorged once more on the dwindling stock of animals and then we marched for our ships we all squeezed aboard although the conditions were probably not much better than those in the slave pens we had two hundred and fifty men in a trireme built for two hundred and we had sixty men in a triakonter off the tagus i signalled to doola to lay alongside and he agreed to take his shallower craft over the bar and have a look at the town it was raining and rowing the trireme was brutal and i already doubted whether i could get the ship home to oiasso like this now that the derringdo was over i began to consider what had happened to my wife and her brother my erstwhile allies i had to assume theyd been defeated how badly badly enough perhaps not to make it home or worse badly enough to make it back to oiasso and close it against me doola caught the morning breeze coming off the land and came back my beautiful lydia wallowing with so many people on board he gave me a thumbsup as soon as he was close enough to wave we went into the estuary at sunset the moon was lost in the clouds and the night was black and we crept up the river impeded by ignorance and by the current which was absurdly strong for summer the town was twenty stades upstream we found it but it had a mole and the approach looked too hard to try in the dark on the other hand there were a dozen small ships on the beach and in the channel on moorings there was amphitrite and there were two more like her tubby greekstyle merchantmen we took them and for good measure having silently acquired what we wanted we set the rest afire then on the dawn breeze and falling tide we slipped away my trireme was lighter by fifty men and lydia was lighter by thirty demetrios insisted on managing amphitrite himself it took us ten days to reach oiasso we were not welcome tara came down to meet us tertikles sulked in his great hall of timber and let his sister tell us we were not welcome through daud because sittonax wanted nothing more to do with the whole process we need water and food ill pay i wasnt contrite i thought that she and her brother had got what they deserved for poor scouting and planning pay with what she said you little coward running off and leaving us when there was a fight why would i give you food i have all the slaves we saved i pointed out they need food she spat not from us she said i liked her and she was making me angry the two sometimes go together you want to blame me blame your brother if he had followed me my brother the king follow you a foreigner she shook her head a man like you does well to follow a man like my brother i shook my head your brother is a fool no one will willingly follow such a man and this should convince me to feed your slaves she spat i shrugged sell me food or ill take it she drew herself up as only a woman of good birth can you think you can take us you and your slaves i nodded yes i pointed behind me there were six ships she turned her face away daud said something very quickly in keltoi we lost thirty men tara said in greek half half our war party and accomplished nothing i said my brother called out to them challenging their captain to single combat instead they shut the gates on us and shot arrows at us and then the garrison marched out she smiled we faced them and charged them we killed many at least a dozen i said hah what did you do she asked i shrugged we stormed their gold mine killed the guards took the gold freed the slaves and came home oh we massacred the town garrison too in an ambush i suspect i sounded smug she glared and spat some words in kelt daud despite his appearance was recovering he laughed his laugh stung her give me food and water and ill pay in gold and leave or refuse i crossed my arms and i swear to the gods ill storm your town and burn your brothers hall and leave you for the ravens you and your brother are amateurs war is not a pursuit for amateurs she shook her head no fuck you come and try she turned and walked away and her spearmen backed off carefully i walked back to the ship that didnt go well seckla was laughing doola wasnt i want my wife we need food said alexandros i scratched my beard for all my big talk i didnt fancy storming a former ally town that smacked of impiety we were guest friends oaths to the gods must have some meaning i dont think your wife will want you i said to doola but take a file of marines and go and try i sent alexandros to help and to keep doola from being stupid we had a hasty conference on the beach seckla and daud gaius and me neoptolymos and demetrios and sittonax we knew enough about the coast by then to know that there were thicker larger settlements farther north we can make it one more day sittonax said demetrios shook his head some men have no fat on their bodies he shrugged i am hungry all the time i am hungry while i eat and hungry again as soon as ive eaten and again after that daud backed him up some of us cannot go a day without food he said i scratched my beard doola came back without his wife he sat down like an old man and put his head in his arms alexandros turned to me she struck him said their marriage is dissolved sittonax shook his head what do you expect he asked you made them look like fools and then you came back and rubbed it in he shrugged tertikles is a weak king a bad king but his sister is smart and strong and rules through him and you have made him appear even more worthless and made her look the same he glanced at the heavens if we stay here tonight on this beach tertikles will attack you heracles i swore sail away sittonax said in two days of fair winds we can land on the isles of the venetiae our starvelings dont have two days i said i should have foreseen it i had three hundred men to feed i needed civilization good farms on good soil and men with an abundance to sell even for oiasso my three hundred would be a heavy burden on the tenday trip north and east my people had eaten fish in the villages every night wed emptied every village of meat and left silver in our wake i felt that it was all my fault in the inner sea it would have been easy or easier out here it was as if we were at the edge of the world men were too few to support a trireme i thought of how smug id been treating with tara and cursed my arrogance so i went back to her with a dozen of my shepherds now tall warriors in flashing bronze i went to the gate of tertikles palisade and shouted for admission tara came and opened the gate she was in armour so the great hero planning to take our pigs with a dozen spearmen do they do your fighting for you she laughed i had decided how to play this out i owed my men i owed my friends but it left a bad taste i offer gold for food and water i said she spat you can have our flesh when you carve it from our cold bodies and the only water you get is the water of my mouth she said that is i assume she said that i only got one word in ten i walked forward it doesnt need to be like this i said i won i took much plunder you can say im dividing it with you that your attack on the town was a feint she waited while sittonax translated then she came forward you used us as a feint didnt you i shrugged does it matter your brother was going that way no matter what i said she turned her back this is over go i took a deep breath i know you plan to attack my ships tonight i said she whirled give me food or i will challenge your brother and he will fight me in the morning and die i spoke quietly and sittonax paused looked at me and shook his head and then translated that will make me king but by my customs that will also make me an oathbreaker because we are guest friends listen tara these starving slaves they are my friends i told you i came here with other men i will not let them die i will kill to save them they are my brothers but we do not have to do it like this sell me food and water and i will slink away tomorrow leaving a tribute of gold on the beach and you can tell any story you like her eyes bored into mine i liked you she said slowly but you are not my idea of a man she shook her head too greasy i shrugged very well dont ever come back here dont ever cross that beach she took a deep breath i will see to it that you have fifty pigs and grain and water we ate within a ring of guards i left her two pounds of gold making those the most valuable pigs ive ever eaten and we sailed away north the coast of gaul was kind to us the sun kissed the water and the breeze carried us most of the day demetrios tacked while we rowed towards evening and we landed three hundred stades north of oiasso by my reckoning we ate sausage cooked on driftwood and drank water from a spring and in the morning we rowed away leaving a handful of terrified shepherds we killed twenty sheep and left them payment in silver pork doesnt keep in summer but mutton does even if not well prepared i was losing my taste for piracy by midday we could see the islands tall against the low swampy coast we knew the first one was olario and we found the town on the landward coast a fine town of slateroofed stone houses rising from the sea with a good harbour a stony beach and a natural mole of granite i sent daud and sittonax and my other keltoi ashore with silver what followed was more like sicily or rome than what i expected from barbarians once again my whole idea of barbarians was about to be stood on its head the town of olario was a venetiae town the warehouses were venetiae as were the piers and the stone roundhouses and the enormous round ships like a greek merchantman built by giants the town wasnt the size of athens or even piraeus but it would have been a good town in attica or italy it had sewers and customs officials they came out to our ships and looked at my crews at my emaciated stick figures at my cargoes and asked for bills of lading this from a man in a frieze cloak with a bright saffron shirt gold earrings and a magnificent gold neckpiece your slaves are in horrible condition he said they might bring disease you may not sell them here nor may you land them they are free men i said i have rescued them from the phoenicians the man had a fine red beard with which he fiddled often and watery blue eyes he wore a magnificent sword and a pair of knives mounted in gold i assumed incorrectly that he was the local warlord or king which phoenicians he asked i waved at iberia eight hundred stades to the south by my reckoning really by vasileoss reckoning hed recovered from ten days of puking and now had one of lydia s sisters which he had named adelphi my chieftain stroked his beard by violence he asked you always know when questioning begins to go wrong i have come from the inner sea to trade i said the phoenicians tried to take my ship on the sea they seized my friends i have spent months rescuing them red beard nodded we have no quarrel with the phoenicians he said we dont love them either but we trade with them he looked around you are greeks eh i smiled yes i am from greece the man smiled for the first time wonderful pots you greeks make and stonework there was a greek man on ratis five years ago he nodded an architect it was stunning to hear this barbarian use the greek word for a man who built stone buildings in fact i was being mocked but then he offered me his hand detorix he said i am the inspector for olario i will clear your cargo for sale you will have to write me out a list of everything you have yes like any other port and there will be taxes there is a harbour fee he smiled you expected painted savages perhaps i had to laugh it took me demetrios doola sittonax and vasileos three days of sitting on the waterfront to count number and list every item we had it was not entirely unpleasant for example the amphitrite had been inexpertly looted and left to sit on the beach her hull had a large patch of rot that was exposed when we careened her where shed sat on the beach fully laden on the sand we were lucky she hadnt sunk on the other hand most of her cargo was still intact most of the bales not even broken the bale of ostrich plumes was the most important but our greek fish oil and our greek wines were still in the bilges of lydia we had nine packets of dyes lovingly wrapped in pigs bladders and then sewn in canvas in fact all theyd taken off the amphitrite was the copper the lydia still had hers twenty three hides of copper we also had about a hundred water amphorae which we would have kept for fresh water except that the gauls offered such wonderful prices for them and the gauls had a cheap highquality substitute the gauls built water and wine containers of wood wrapped with cord roots or metal bands called barrels they made them in eight sizes standard sizes and every barrelmaker had a set of patterns to follow i tried to imagine imposing a set of standard sizes on greeks or even standard measures you do know that the mythemnoi varies from town to town dont you and so does the dactyl and the stade oh yes where was i barrels wonderful i loved to watch the gauls build them they were light and strong and when they were empty you could pull the hoops off and they became a bundle of slightly curved boards that took up no space the locals were especially interested in my trireme they crowded around looking at her construction her rowing benches her ram bow and all the bronze there after two days of intense work my crews had beached emptied and careened our ships our goods had been sorted dried counted and in some cases reluctantly burned or buried so to my sorrow were six men fifteen days at sea even in high summer are not the ideal anodyne to months or years of brutal slavery they werent my friends they werent men i even knew but they had however briefly been my men we had a funeral feast for them and we burned them the gaulish priests helped they were surprisingly welleducated men who knew the stars and two of whom knew greek although the version they spoke was comically spartan they must have learned from some laconian some wandering mercenary or trader herodikles my aeolian said the words he was recovering well he had been an aristocrat a priest from a good family but by his own admission he had been a slave fifteen years and some of that had been horrible he flinched when doola raised a hand in greeting he ducked his head when seckla let out a whoop of delight demetrios was more cautious otherwise he was very much himself he smiled a great deal and didnt talk as much as other men he was very sure of himself at sea and less sure on land daud had been a slave a long time he survived the phoenicians well enough gaius was the most changed he was deeply passionately angry it struck me that hed have been the first to die if we hadnt come back they treated us like animals he said one night on the coast of iberia i didnt bother to point out that we all treated slaves like that but by the time we reached the venetiae he was better his smile a little more bitter but otherwise more like himself detorix and a dozen other traders came to drink wine with us after i handed in our lading lists they were like traders all over the world carefully controlling their reactions looking for advantage doola who always handled these transactions was not yet recovered from the loss of his wife he wasnt interested in trade or anything else demetrios stood in for him dickering arguing or being silent i stood back watching we had decided that i would pose as the patron it was useful for demetrios to say ah well i must ask the patron and sometimes he would give a hurt smile as if he wanted nothing better than to sell his ostrich feathers for a song and he would say ah but the patron the food was good and we paid in gold we sat in actual wine shops and drank halfdecent wine too thick unwatered i felt but there you go each to his own taste it was good to drink wine at all and i bought great barrels of the stuff for the recovering men because wine is the very best thing for a man recovering from ill health wine and apple juice both of which were available and meat and bread they were getting rich off our need to feed hungry men but they were traders and they had the foodstuffs to sell and we had nowhere else to buy i had about enough gold to keep all of them for a month they werent strictly speaking my people but the gauls left almost immediately after coming to me with their thanks a dozen of them stayed they werent gauls at all but albans from another one of the islands they also came to me in the first days among the venetiae and asked if i would sail them home i said id consider it our third evening on olario was beautiful and we sat in our wine shop on the waterfront watching small boys fish in the harbour watching three young women posture for seckla who was diving naked from a rock with the exception of the african all my friends were there and other men like alexandros and vasileos who had earned their right to be included it was like a mix of democracy and oligarchy command always is demetrios shrugged its a good news bad news kind of thing he said the tin doesnt come from here sittonax shook his head thieving bastards i worked for them they said the tin comes from the islands i laughed ever seen a tin mine i asked i havent but i know what the ore looks like any bronzesmith does and it wont come out of searocks so they dont have tin asked gaius they do its their principal export demetrios sat back and played with a loop of beads it comes from somewhere near here i get that much is it worth finding the source i asked demetrios shrugged again i dont know but they drive a hard bargain they want all our amphorae and they offer a wonderful return all the wine all the oil i think they only want the jars but why should we care in each case we make five or ten times what we paid my turn to shrug a profit we might match at marsala and save ourselves danger and labour and travel demetrios nodded i thought the same it is worse for our copper they offer no better than the inner sea price they say there is copper all along this coast and in iberia thats what the iberians said too i admitted heracles and poseidon the weariness of it transporting copper halfway round the aspis of the world only to find that it is worth less there than at home vasileos spoke for the first time makes good ballast he said wryly we have the gold gaius said eagerly we could just go home i looked around seckla was drying himself with his chlamys to the complete approval of three young keltoi who had never seen anyone quite so like an ebony apollo how exactly are we getting home i asked that set the lion among the sheep demetrios nodded i wanted to talk about that before we start trading he said he looked at me we dont want to go back through the pillars i said and for certain sure we dont want to go home that way with heavily laden trade ships vasileos nodded and leaned forward that squadron at gades is fully alert now he said even if they were asleep when we come to the pillars the current runs outward without a perfect wind he made a motion with his hand we just wallow around waiting for their triremes to snap us up it is worse than that demetrios said the sikel was smiling but it wasnt amusement more like courage theres a rumour that came in with the fishing boats this morning that there is a phoenician squadron on the coast south of here burning its way north i hadnt heard that poseidons spear i said vasileos nodded you had to know theyd strike back he said all we did was singe their beards and they must have taken some of the keltoi i felt foolish of course i said theyll strike for oiasso i said standing up vasileos took my hand if they did they hit it days ago and our one trireme wont save it and we dont exactly owe king tertikles anything sittonax said i sighed and sat doola raised his head my wife he said and put his head down again jupiters dick gaius said id love to put a spear into some phoenicians seckla coming in from the water grinned he sat by doola alexandros watched him like a hawk and put and hand on the older mans shoulder did i hear someone suggest we could kill phoenicians he asked were trying to reckon how we can make it home vasileos said i too wouldnt mind a chance to kill some of the slavers daud usually quiet smiled that wont get us home vasileos said yes it will gaius said we strike their squadron and then slip past it and they keep going north i thought about that the good sailing is over in a few weeks i said i looked at vasileos of course i never made a statement about weather or sailing without his consent he nodded if we sail south i shrugged it can be done but not with amphitrite only rowed ships will make it into the pillars in one go unless we have the luck of the gods and i dont think we can count on that detorix wants the trireme demetrios said he wants to buy it then id have no ship i said demetrios shrugged im just saying he protested then he looked around as if afraid of being overheard the venetiae are in fear of the phoenicians coming here he said if you plan to go to sea and fight you dont want to tell them that i gave him the look men give each other when they mean they werent born yesterday nor the day before either i looked around what do you think i asked vasileos he shrugged are we traders warriors he met my eye i want to go home alive with a little silver i do not need to be a hero daud shrugged i am home he said i can walk to my fathers farm in ten days he grinned at his stick leg two weeks he looked around too but if you were going south to fight the phoenicians id come seckla smiled at me ill go wherever you go gaius was sharpening an already sharp knife i want to kill phoenicians neoptolymos said i am very strongly of gaiuss view doola raised his head for the first time i want to try and rescue my wife he said alexandros looked at doola and at me i didnt give him anything my thoughts were running like an athlete in a race and i wasnt sure what i wanted he didnt say anything but sat back demetrios took doolas hand i will come with you to get your wife you came and got me he said but i am with vasileos i am no hero i want to trade and go home rich i have been away from home too long i am scared all the time even with all of you my brothers around me this sea is not my sea sittonax looked at me and then around at all of them he kicked his long sword out along his leg and leaned back youre a pack of fools he said we all looked at him its autumn or near enough if doolas wife isnt a slave tonight she will be tomorrow night or not and shes not your wife you foreigners never get our ways she broke the pact shes gone he shrugged but thats not what makes you fools i think we only made it into the outer sea by a miracle i want you all to think of that storm he shook his head four days north of here is the delta of the river of fish the sequana one of the largest of the venetiae communities is there they hire guards there and ship tin across the mountains he looked at us to marsala you fools up the sequana to my peoples country and down the roan to marsala you can be home in five weeks it is what the venetiae do they run the tin trade to marsala sittonax had told us all about the tin route back in marsala and now we were on the other side of it it was almost funny vasileos pulled at his beard we arent going to get our ships over the mountains he said sell them sittonax said now i leaned back and scratched my beard i was looking at sittonax he was cleaning his nails we can do both i said often the smallest and least consequential things become the greatest complications it is the hand of the gods in human affairs i chose to represent our going to sea as my willingness to give the escaped alban slaves a run across the waves to their homes detorix spoke to them rapidly in greek and then in one of the keltoi tongues too rapidly for me to follow and then he smiled they should stay here he said it was a surprisingly false smile i liked detorix he loved gold but he was as friendly and as plainspoken as a trader ever can be why i asked detorix frowned we will not allow you to take them home he said he shrugged please do not press the point he withdrew from the meeting like a man who had overplayed his stones in a game of polis something was wrong and i didnt have time to figure it out what made no sense is that he couldnt actually give orders as far as i could tell i had three hundred armed men and he had a dozen other traders and none of them struck me as deadly blades i understood from sittonax that all the coastal tribes feared the venetiae they had many large ships and the money to hire warriors the keltoi had mercenaries like everyone else sittonax sought me out the albans have something to say he said best say it quickly i said detorix was approaching with a long tail of fellow gauls six of them had spears behon the healthiest of the albans came and took my hand he said a few words sittonax waved his hand he pledges his undying loyalty and so on he said he sounded bored he says the gauls dont want you to cross the little sea because thats where the tin is as he said the words sittonaxs intonation changed and he became more excited but of course he said now it is i who am a fool of course the tin comes from alba behons grey eyes bored into mine you be my chief and i will be your man he said at least thats what sittonax said for him his brother who had a name something like our leukas took my other hand detorix came to a halt foreigners he said formally i gave both albans hands a squeeze and let them go yes i asked detorix pointed at our ships there were men aboard them and they were being poled off the beach and into deeper water i have seized your ships temporarily he smiled a troubled smile i am sorry to be so highhanded but without meaning to break the law you have threatened our trade i had no idea you had these albans aboard nor that you had any intention of making the crossing i cannot allow it i looked out over the water you are taking my ships i said detorix shrugged only until you swear the oaths and offer some surety that you will not sail for alba i want you to savour the irony thugater i had never intended actually to sail for alba i had intended to go down the coast rescue doolas wife if it could be done and kill a few carthaginians it amused me that there were barbarian bureaucrats too i laughed the albans got behind me detorix resented my laugh how could he not but it was funny he looked at me and i laughed and finally i pointed at the men behind him about thirty men fewer than half of them armed detorix i said i dont want to make threats but you have taken my ships why shouldnt i kill the lot of you and storm the town he swallowed sharply i shook my head detorix there is no reason for us to be foes detorix nodded i cannot allow you to sail for alba ill give you my word not to sail for alba that was easy and i wasnt some persian truthteller im greek i can lie when i please he started to nod and a man behind him said something sharply in one of the many keltoi dialects i will have to send for instructions he said he licked his lips i was glaring how long i asked he didnt know he was sending to the capital i turned to my friends if we kill any of them i have to assume there will be no further trading i said and that screws us if we want to take sittonaxs route to the inner sea doola spat gaius crossed his arms you have to assume that his instructions will include several boatloads of soldiers if were going to fight the time is now we have every advantage neoptolymos said sittonax shook his head you cant fight these are the venetiae their reach is long longer than anyones no one will sell you grain every mans hand will be against you not if we kill them and sail south i said but the moment had passed it is odd five years before id have wiped the town off the face of the world sold the women as slaves and killed the men or died trying which as events proved was the more likely i slept badly my dead troubled me but my living troubled me more i was uncertain as to whether i had treated tara well i was deeply aware that i had treated lydia badly and the combination ran through my dreams and into my waking life it is odd to be haunted by a living person everywhere i went i saw lydia in keltoi girls washing their clothes in the stream by the beach in women at market standing by the well why i really hadnt thought of her in months i suspect that i had behaved badly and heracles sent these thoughts to torment me so evil is punished in the world but it may be that opening the bales of goods so carefully packed in another world on sicily and at marsala carried some hint of her i dont know i do know that i felt a surly failure when i awoke the next morning i went for a run with neoptolymos and seckla neoptolymos still a stick figure but eating like a horse and seckla now probably the best athlete among us my wound still troubled me so i ran carefully and slowly which suited neoptolymos but seckla simply ran off into the khora the countryside of course we ran naked and nudity is a shameful thing among keltoi or at least it is not as common as among greeks we of course thought nothing of it while we ran out along the muddy roads between low stone boundary walls we were untroubled but as we poured the daimon of competition into our aching muscles to sprint the last few stades into town there were men with staves we ignored them and sprinted past they closed in behind us and followed us to our tents they were grumbling angrily and we of course hadnt any idea what they were on about luckily sittonax was up and he laughed at us with them if you take my meaning and soon enough they dispersed as a foreigner it is always better to be an object of gentle derision detorix came to us at midmorning i was organizing some contests because my morning run had improved my mood and reminded me of what was important in life and i had decided again between one heartbeat and another to be responsible for the rowers and not simply send them off into the world let me digress thugater the truth is that if i released them or more likely drove them away they would be slaves again in no time one of the problems with slavery is that it allows a certain kind of man to cease to be in almost every way it extinguishes his willingness to be well free which of us does not long to be taken care of which of us does not desire at least in old age children and friends to wait on us and help us walk and piss and eat eh and the slave is this not why we call them children a slave with a soft place a good master and acceptable work is spared so many decisions is he not heh had you going there for a moment it can be quite comfortable as a slave if only you are willing to give up everything that makes life worth living but once a man has been a slave a certain time it takes time to make him free he has to learn to be free if you save a man from starving can you then leave him to starve again if you rescue a drowning man do you push him back in the water so so i was sitting under an awning on a crisp latesummer morning while two men one of the albans and one of the greeks fought with padded sticks the sticks represented swords now greeks scarcely ever fight with just the sword but polymarchos back in syracusa had taught me a great deal based on using the sword alone he had introduced me to the theory of combat much as heraclitus introduced me to the theory of living your life a man may be a good man and live a righteous life and never hear a word of philosophy but for most of us some education in the theory of living which well call ethics just for the sake of completeness is a great aid and likewise now that id been introduced to polymarchoss remarkable theories on fighting on body posture on balance on control i saw how all fighting could be governed by these principles if i wanted to digress all night here fill the cup full pais and dont stint if i wanted to digress all night id tell you how deeply linked the two theories are control moderation inner examination right the ionian boy is falling asleep back to the story i was watching two young men demonstrate that the greek saying that every boy is born knowing how to use a sword is pig shit they swung wildly at each other and cringed away from every blow detorix came up and leaned on his staff i need to talk to you he said come to take my goods as well as my ships i asked he managed to look pained it will all be returned to you he said sure i said or words to that effect your people need to remain clothed at all times he said all times i couldnt help myself i have had complaints you ran naked i laughed sittonax says the keltoi fight naked i said detorix glared at him with fixed disapproval madmen fight naked i shrugged greeks take off their clothes to do heavy labour i said and to bathe something we like to do often even if the sea is as cold as rejected love and my friends laughed doola nodded to detorix politely fishermen say the carthaginians are in these waters he said detorix looked away if they catch our ships in this harbour well lose everything he said detroix didnt look at us he shuffled his feet in fact for all that he was a tattooed barbarian he might have been any godscurse athenian bureaucrat unwilling ot take responsibility for a decision but as i spoke of bathing i had a thought and the thought made me smile very well i said well only be naked when we have to be detorix stomped away if a man in light boots can be said to stomp on a gravel beach he rattled away i turned to doola were going to have a swimming contest i said ive counted days the carthaginians could have been here two days ago we need to move doola nodded i watched some more bad swordsmanship and i went out on the gravel and began to give lessons in the most basic elements of swordfighting or boxing for that matter i walked up and down the beach speaking to every group of men pairing them off until every oarsman had a partner of roughly equal experience i got alexandros and his mates the six men with the most experience of fighting to coach with me gaius and neoptolymos and sittonax joined them although i had doubts about the way sittonax approached swordsmanship and as i went from group to group i outlined the days activities we formed two long lines and shuffled back and forth across the sand i was content for a while just to let them move practising the most basic footwork of shieldfighting or as i say boxing or any other combat sport we advanced and retreated we crossstepped we jumped after a while i sent them off to get sticks three hundred men take a great many sticks on the other hand we were in a merchant town and they were anxious to sell us anything including seasoned ash and oak in half an hour two men had broken fingers and one had been knocked unconscious pretty good for three hundred amateurs when men were drooping and all learning had ended i gathered them in a big huddle and gave them a long rambling speech about comradeship and good spirit long enough for them all to rest detorix and his six spearmen and a goodly number of his people were watching all of this from the edge of town and now swim i said and we all ran into the water only about twothirds could swim the men who couldnt swim just ran into the water and cleaned themselves cooling their muscles and relaxing those who swam well however ran down the shingle took long leaps into the surf and swam powerfully out to sea we swam as fast as tired arms could manage on the prearranged route out to the big rock off the beach and then north i remember watching doola swim a remarkable stroke with just one hand while the other hand held something out of the water to the trireme fifty of us went up the side together the two men left aboard as anchor watch werent so much overwhelmed as mocked it was if i may say so one of my better plans no one was injured and in a single burst of enthusiasm we retook all of our ships all of our weapons and all of our goods the shiphandlers were sent over the side it was i confess my intention to gloat but that didnt happen because as i settled between the steering oars to turn the bow doola gave a great shout hed shimmied up the boatsail mast to check the sail which had been left furled for two days in the rain he dropped to the deck by sliding down the forestay and ran along the catwalk six triremes he shouted there was only one reason there would be six triremes in the offing there was a wind blowing off the land the mainland across the straight a westerly hull up or down i asked hull up that meant that with low ships like triremes they couldnt be more than twelve to fifteen stades away cut the cable i ordered seckla shining with water used an axe the forwardanchor cable parted in one blow and the ship was alive half my rowers were frolicking in the surf on the edge of the beach and i needed them we beach sternfirst touch and go with half our complement of oarsmen this was going to be a complicated tangle but doola and vasileos were up to it in moments we were around helped by the current steady up doola roared amidships back oars i felt the steering oars bite and then i felt the stern touch under me and in moments the oarsmen were pouring in to my left vasileos had the lydia in the surf to my right the nike took in her rowers how i wished we had a signalling system anything but we didnt so i lay with my stern on the beach for long heartbeats with my rowers switching places the swimmers hadnt always taken the right benches of course while the phoenicians became visible to the south demetrios got the mainsail up on the amphitrite with the anchor still down her head came up and he pointed the craft due north it looked as if hed run aground on the north harbour entrance then he plucked up his anchor stone and shot away lydia couldnt lie close enough to the wind to use the west wind to run north she rowed off the beach nike followed at her heels almost falling afoul of her and i watched with my heart in my mouth and my stomach doing backflips someone was screaming my name it was detorix my rowers were almost ready lydia had thirty rowers and i had one hundred and eighty a hundred and eighty men take a certain time to get themselves organized i stepped out from between the oars carthage i shouted phoenicians six galleys that shut him up ill lead them away i shouted they want me detorix looked as if he might want me too but at that moment doola ordered his rowers to give way i was back between my steering oars in a flash in two more heartbeats i had that feeling one of the finest in a crisis that the ship was a living thing i gave doola the nod i always gave him that meant we had steerage way the stern was off the beach in fine style in ten strokes we were catching up on nike hand over fist a hundred and eighty men can row a great deal faster than thirty men all was not well though the trireme was not at her fastest because she was meant to be beached and dried after every day at sea and her timbers were heavy with water i consoled myself that the phoenicians were in damp hulls too they had to be to have made the venetiae isles in twenty days from gades that was my guess still is we raced for the harbour mouth the lead phoenician trireme was six stades away or closer even as i watched amphitrite shaved the northernmost rocks demetrios sailed between the outermost big rock and the headland trusting that a fully laden merchantman was still shallower than the water he was a great sailor he made it with about an armslength to spare and he was running closehauled his mainsail brailed and heaved right round using the west wind to urge him up the channel lydia followed him under oars also cutting inboard of the big rock white with gull droppings nike shaved the headland and lost the stroke for a heartstopping moment when gaius misjudged the turn and his portside oars brushed the gravel but he had enough way on to make the turn and then his men were rowing for their lives i didnt think i could shoot the gap i steered outboard of the rock by this time the euphoria was almost up to cruising speed and we shot out of the harbour entrance even as my marines armed and my archers wiped down their bows and shook their heads over bowstrings left exposed for two days and nights even as we ran out of the harbour we were passing the nike thats how fast a trireme can be behind us we could hear the drum on the lead phoenician he was moving to ramming speed it was going to be close doola was serving out bowstrings he steady sensible fellow that he was had his strings in a pouch at his waist all the time even ashore even mourning for his lost love bless him i used our relatively slow speed to advantage making a sharp turn to starboard head up into the wind almost across the lead phoenicians course making him turn a trireme at ramming speed has some very limited options for turning i caught doolas eye he was stringing his fine egyptian horn bow his eyes all but bulging with the effort but he nodded full speed he called one of the alban boys started to beat the new tempo against the butt of the mainmast with a stick now we were in a waterlogged hull a phoenician galley is a heavy trireme to start with heavier lumber a much heavier bow of course i now knew why they built them for the outer sea but they werent as sleek or as fast as athenian triremes on their best day add cargo add too many marines add our mainmast sail furled lying down the central catwalk ships planning to fight leave the mast ashore we were heavy and slow luckily our opponents were in the same shape plus their rowers had been rowing since dawn ill guess almost head on into the wind it was a curious sort of race tortoise versus tortoise ahead of us we could see the coast of gaul the mainland the channel the strait if you like would turn west in about six stades i had a plan for that too the phoenician fetched my wake and turned very slightly i could see his archers going forward into the bow the bow went down and cost him some speed the first flurries of arrows fell well short and were blown off to the west but we were almost in bowshot a stade or two i cheated the helm to port it wasnt enough but it was something the alban boy smacked his stick faster on the mainmast we began to pick up speed in the time it takes to tell this the phoenician closed from three stades to two and then the rate of her catching us slowed behind her the other five triremes trailed back two were right up close and the other three were well back almost a dozen stades i cheated my helm to the west again we were five stades from the channels turn to the west doola appeared in the helmsmans station alexandros was beside him in armour let me have the helm while you get into your kit the young man said seckla had my armour so i handed alexandros the steering oar and seckla buckled the straps of my thorax under my left arm we had passed all of our own ships they lay right against the coast i thought demetrios was insane but i had problems of my own the phoenicians naturally enough were throwing everything at me i was after all the pirate rowing along in one of their ships doola stepped up on the bench leaned out over the curving strakes of the stern and loosed i couldnt even see where he was shooting duck your head seckla said i did and unseen hands put my helmet over my head i stood up and behon put my aspis on my arm doola loosed again and again and again in a stern chase the pursued has one advantage the running ship has all the timbers of the stern which rise like a temple roof above the helm it is like a shield for the running ship the pursuers bow is lower and open so that arrows from the running ship can pass the length of the pursuer hitting oarsmen or anyone three of doolas archers stepped up and began to loose arrows with him taking turns on the portside bench it was difficult shooting with the wind the angle of the bow and the motion of the sea on the other hand they must have loosed an arrow every three beats of a mans heart a few were coming aboard us i was armed and i left the oars and ran forward along the mainmast to the place amidships from which i sometimes commanded men were grimfaced with exertion full speed ramming speed can only be held for so long a man can row flat out for about as long as a man can sprint at full speed wed already done that alexandros yawed a moments inattention and we turned slightly to starboard and there they were a spearsthrow aft their beak reaching for our stern everything you have be free men nothing at stake here but our freedom i called pull the next six strokes were better but the phoenician had matched our turn and now i couldnt see a thing aft doola stepped up onto the stern bench and loosed some flicker crossed his face a smile even as he jumped down and one of our greeks stepped up on the bench and loosed and then there they were the trireme appeared from behind us like a sea monster broaching the waves but this sea monster appeared because it was wounded it had turned too hard or a chance arrow had slain an oarsman causing the mans corpse to let go his oar and foul his mates so that his ship turned suddenly on the drag in a flash we were ten shiplengths ahead and the enemy ship had lost all his way and was headed due west into the stony beach she was turning and turning and the portside oars were in chaos she struck bowfirst i doubt that the beach did a bronze obol of damage but oars were splintered and when men take a heavy oar in the teeth things break cruising speed i called the alban boy looked at me with wide frightened eyes i made myself smile slow them down boy he tapped his stick more slowly he had a wonderful sense of tempo men on either side of me all but collapsed on their oars i leaped onto the unstepped mainmast and ran along it aft i stepped up on the starboardside helmsmans bench where the archers werent shooting on that side would cramp their bow arms and looked aft the second phoenician was making up the ground lost by the first she came on with beautiful symmetry the three banks of oars flashing in the blue and gold sunlight like a fantastic dragonfly skimming the waves he was three stades back i leaned forward we were three stades from the turn in the channel already the wave action was heavier on the bow deck crew ready with the boatsail i gave my aspis to seckla steering oars i said to alexandros well done he nodded a serious young man steering oars aye he said i got my hands on them he ducked out and i was between them the second phoenician elected to wait for the third their tactic showed immediately as the lead ship yawed to the east a few horselengths obviously intending to range alongside my starboard side the trailing phoenician would go for my port side but when the leader elected to wait for the next ship in line the initiative passed to me cables to the masthead i said but seckla already had them laid a good crew is the only advantage worth having even as i watched the cables went over the crown of the mast and were made fast four men began to haul them tight tighter and tighter and then they were belayed forward and the job was done we were less than a stade from the turn in the channel i was watching the phoenician coming up our port side wondering when his rowers would flag and she was just passing the one that had run aground and lydia forgotten came up on the phoenician from close to the beach and rammed her vasileos bless him the sound of his ram going home carried over the water the little triakonter wouldnt ordinarily have done much to a trireme but a trireme anchored by having its bow buried in the shale of the beach was a very static target and her beak opened the timbers lydia had changed the engagement in a single action now she was backing oars and nike swept past her under her stern and as they passed the stranded trireme they threw fire into her stern the trailing phoenicians now put their bows to the troublesome small craft and went to ramming speed i couldnt see amphitrite anywhere my first heartstopping worry was that shed been rammed and sunk while i was looking elsewhere but after a few glances i was steering as small as i could i couldnt find a ship in the geometry of sea combat that might have taken her i looked over my right shoulder and there she was shed tacked and was now hard against the coast of gaul and of course the phoenicians had to assume that demetrios was just a local coaster running for sea room doola was still loosing arrows at a magnificent rate and his apprentice bowmen were hard at it the newest of them had stopped shooting and was now simply handing arrows to the others but as the two phoenicians overhauled us we started to take hits seckla took the first arrow he fell face down and screamed alexandros stood over him holding his aspis to cover prepare to turn to port i roared in my best deepblue voice at my word port oars back water i watched the horizon glanced at the trailing phoenician it was going to be close if we lost too much speed wed be rammed doola and his archers all put a shaft on their bows and waited just for a moment we would lie across the bows of the trailing ship at less than a stade now i cried the portside oarsmen backed water laying on their oars for two strokes the ship pivoted on the stern the portside phoenician seemed to shoot at us like an arrow from a bow ramming speed i shouted i think i screamed it seckla rolled over and said something to alexandros who called out and the deck crew dropped the boatsail off its yard the breeze filled it instantly and the ship leaped ahead the archers loosed all together if they hit anything i didnt see it you cant always have a miracle on demand our turn on the other hand took the phoenicians by surprise and our boatsail gave us a tiny advantage in speed but a wonderful instant advantage in stability we were now running northwest with the wind on our starboard quarter the portside phoenician came closer doolas archers got off another volley then they cheered then they shot again and then the portside phoenician stopped gaining her beak was so close poseidon i can still see it the waves pushing against it the eyes on either side wicked with battle lust the beak itself so close i could have leaped to it for three heartbeats we were a spearlength apart and then we passed them shaving her beak id love to tell you there was a tiny thump as the beak touched our stern but i dont think it happened like that and we were away now we were running easily and they had to slow to make the turn by the time they made it we were ten shiplengths ahead seckla was propped up in the bow he was pointing at the mast and giving orders and before i felt i had to go forward and sort things out the mainmast began to rise it too had cables run to the crown it went up and up and seemed to take an hour and astern of us the phoenicians started to gain again far astern over by the island lydia made the turn in the channel and nike appeared in her wake amphitrite was somewhere to the north and id lost her again against the lowlying coast we cleared their archers doola said theres not an archer left alive on that ship i wasnt sure that made much difference again if id had a signalling system a way of telling lydia what i intended i might have made a fight of it i was confident that i could take any one of the phoenicians i was pretty sure that given the favour of the gods i could take both with the lydia and the nike ranging up on their sides but the risk would have been immense and the gain very small because as the mainmast went home in its box and the chocks were pounded in with mallets i knew that barring a weather change my trireme was safe none of the phoenician ships was faster that was vital we were all about the same the second phoenician had a small edge in speed which she had squandered waiting for her consort now both ships were five shiplengths back and too far to the north neither had started to raise their mainmasts and their rowers were flagging five stades behind me lydia s mainsail spread like a pale flower turning its face to the sun nike followed suit the three rear phoenicians still hadnt made the turn in the channel mainsail i called i put the helm down used the steering oars to bring the wind right aft and then the mainsail was sheeted home and doola was ordering the oarsmen to get their oars in i raised my arms and prayed to poseidon right then and there i sent the alban boy whom i christened tempo for wine and i poured it into my favourite bronze cup and threw it over the side and oarsmen cheered it took the phoenicians a quarter of an hour to get their sails up and they lost ground with every heartbeat so that by the time their big striped sheets were hung they were halfway back to the horizon and we were running free behind them a nick on the northeastern edge of the bowl of the world was amphitrite i assumed but the bastards didnt give up wed run off the beach with no food and almost no water remember wed sold our amphorae now with parched rowers drinking the little water we had aboard fresh water was an immediate crisis and as if they knew our ill planning the phoenicians dogged us well to windward but always close enough to snatch us up i summoned doola and sittonax i thought longingly of the wine id just thrown over the side did poseidon even know this sea with its horrifying tenfoothigh rollers and whitecaps in every weather sittonax pointed at the long line of lowlying land to the north and east i could already see the promontory that marked the extreme westward end i hadnt marked what it meant but before sittonax spoke i realized that this must be the westernmost point of europe we were sailing off the edge of the world whats north of here i asked how far to your sequana river the river of fish he shook his head a long way he shrugged ive never been there but it must be four days maybe six detorix had mentioned the sequana like it was near at hand and the main islands of the venetiae i asked they were three days sail or so detorix had said sittonax shrugged palms up im not a sailor he said im a guard i was hired inland on the sequana where the big ships unload poseidons rigid member i swore i remember because doola looked shocked it made me laugh which in turn lightened the tension behon was working on the deck crew and he came aft eagerly he spoke rapidly to sittonax and pointed north and west with the wind he says we can make alba in a day on this wind to dumnonia among his own people sittonax looked deeply sceptical i tugged at my beard ask behon what he did before he was enslaved i said he looked at me fisherman he said in greek aha very well doola hows seckla i asked doola leaned forward gut shot he said softly it went about three fingers in oozing blood hes fine for the moment we both knew what a gut shot meant sepsis and a nasty death go and stay by him i said i turned to alexandros take the helm to sittonax ask him whether this wind will hold two days the alban made an odd motion with his lips as if tasting the wind ask him what the coast is like in his dumnovia i was weighing my nonexistent options rock and more rock i swore were going to run on that coast in the dark he shrugged as if to say that all of us were in the hands of the gods in late afternoon the wind changed two points to the north as the sun dropped towards the endless western ocean the wind rose and we had to brail the mainsail seckla was up and moving id have gathered hope but i had seen this before men with gut wounds got better for a little while and then apollo came with his deadly arrows and took them as the red ball of the sun fell into the western ocean by the gods daughters to look west at the setting sun and see nothing but open ocean is perhaps the most terrifying sight ive ever had within the orbit of my eyes somewhere out there were the hesperides it was like like living in a myth while being chased by slavers we weathered the great promontory of gaul at sunset the sky was already full of stars and the swells lifted our bow and it fell and the sail was too full for my comfort far astern lydia and nike followed me and amphitrite who could sail better on any wind but dead astern had ranged up and lay five stades away as close to beautiful as she would ever be in the red red sunset we buried the phoenicians over the horizon but when we were at the top of a wave our lookout on the mainmast could see their mainsails flashing red to white in the setting sun and far far to the east a column of smoke caught the last light where the lead phoenician galley burned i dont want to say that i thought i could take all six of them ill only say that had i had drinking water aboard i might have tried but my men were already desperate and if we had had to row even for ten stades i think that they might have started to die remember i had men who were a few days out of desperate bondage a third of my rowers were strong enough but as thin as young trees but the knucklebones were cast the sail was brailed the helm set and we ran north and the sun set in the outer ocean like an evil eye into an alien sea of blood and we could all but hear the hiss as it plunged redhot into the sea it had an evil look and by the gods we were all afraid dawn and i was still at the steering oars i sucked on a piece of old bread to get saliva into my mouth men drank more questionable things water from the bilge urine mixed with seawater next to loss of breath thirst is the fastest way to bring a man to desperation try it sometime see how long you can go without water you can go a day but after a few hours it becomes the sole focus of your thoughts the worst was that the sun found us alone when you run at night without lights it is easy to lose your consorts there were no landmarks no rocks no coast in fact the very worst of it was that once we lost sight of the coast of gaul we didnt even know which way north was thats right think about it friends what magical device would give us direction all i knew was that the helm was the same way id left it and that the sun rose in the east give or take a few degrees but a few degrees at sea can be a great distance alone on the outer ocean no sails no land a few gulls on and on we rode at a breakneck pace on a freshening wind how far i asked behon he rubbed sleep from his eyes how would i know he said through sittonax who naturally was very happy to be awakened to translate you used to sail here remember i asked behon shook his head no one but a fool comes out on the great blue he said i never leave the coast he drew lines on the deck with a charred stick showing me how the coast of alba ran east to west with the coast of gaul like the hypotenuse of a shallow triangle so that he would sail east into the rising sun across the south coast of alba and then touch on gaul far far from where we were if we were anywhere if his chart was accurate the drawing of an ignorant man who measured distance in vague notions of time then we were south of alba west of gaul and more than a hundred stades from any land it would have been more terrifying if i hadnt been so thirsty we ran north and north one of our africans sprang off his bench at about noon took his oar in hand ran to the side and jumped he was gone in a few moments the sun was relentless for autumn in the north i tried to sleep tried to daydream tried to imagine sex briseis lydia or combat anything that would lift me and take me from water but a dream of lydias lips became my tongue questing her mouth for water and a daydream of fighting persians became a picture of drinking their blood about noon doola and a pair of our fishermen rigged the charcoal fire amidships and began to boil seawater they took the biggest cauldron they had and got it boiling and the vapour that rose off the boiling water they collected in a tent made of doolas bronze breastplate they collected it as rapidly as they could and in an hours work they got about two cups of drinkable water they accomplished very little except that they made everyone feel better and the water was passed around one man one of the greeks tried to drink the whole cup and when one of the albans pulled it away he spilled it alexandros drew his sword and refused to let the oarsmen gut the greek the young man was becoming an officer doola went back to boiling water the coast of alba resolutely refused to appear on and on we ran north and i lost my ability to tell time time passed eventually the sun set again towards last light i thought i saw sails in the south but i had sparkles in my eyes and i had already spoken twice to heracles by that time i dont think these were true visions but merely phantasms of my waterless brain and then came the night had i been in my right mind i would have been afraid of running on a rockbound coast but perhaps i no longer believed in the coast of alba yet i could think of nothing but water and if i slept it was fitful and if i woke i was not fully in the world i think that at some point in the night a sea monster or just a whale broached near us and vented and i was not even scared but merely curious with the lethargy of the dying i could go on but i shant eventually the sun rose and revealed the coast of alba rock girt and grey even on a bright day alba rose from the sea like my monster and my heart with it i dont remember saying anything to anyone but in moments the deck was astir and everyone was awake behon staggered aft and stood with me and muttered whispered things sittonax came aft after him he says youll make a fine landfall sittonax whispered behon pointed a little east of north the island of vecti he says foreign ships come there i put the bow at vecti and we ran on by the time the sun was clear of the eastern horizon the island was obvious set away from the coast and i could make out the eastern headland i assume the beach is on the landward side i asked behon shrugged never been there he said through sittonax and then the last hour two men were dead slumped at their benches gone in their sleep we put them over the side and the deck crew went to their stations as if they too were dead i was going to have to turn west into the channel between vecti and the mainland of alba and then land sternfirst on what i hoped was a beach i would need the rowers to row we made the turn and the mainsail came down in a rush and tangled the rowers and for minutes we rose and fell on the swell unmoving crippled by our own fatigue and our timing and then as slowly as a snail on a log we got the sail clear and the rowers began to row like small boys trying to row for the first time in a fishing boat pitiful an hour passed another now i could see the beach and there seemed to be people gathered there slowly like raw beginners we turned the ship got the bow to the channel and backed her onto the beach catching crabs with every stroke if the people on the beach hadnt rushed to our aid we might have lost the trireme at the every last the portside oars failed men simply stopped rowing perhaps they thought we were home and safe and the tide and waves caught us and threatened to throw the hull up the beach and break us but albans waded out grabbed our ropes and got our stern aground behon called out to them and tempo and they waved and water came aboard in skin in light wooden buckets and big bronze beakers and shallow bowls every man woman and child on the beach suddenly had water and i had the discipline to watch as men drank and then i couldnt stop myself a lighteyed man gave me a tin pail and i drank and drank and paused and drank again and drank and drank perhaps the most amazing thing about thirst is how very quickly you recover all that is required is water in moments your head is clear the lassitude falls away if you have been without water too long there may be cramps i had cramps i slumped to the deck and looked at the tin bucket and what i realized after a few breaths was that i was looking at a bucket a household bucket perhaps for feeding cows and that it was made entirely of tin the wind came up at midday while we were still in an orgy of drinking the water the blow began from the east and as the wind went around the points of the compass it rose and rose and when it settled as an easterly it shrieked along the beach like a racehorse we got rollers under our keel and moved our black ship up the beach i was afraid of storms but i was more afraid of being caught by the phoenicians with my keel in the water where they could just tow her off and then full of water we were given a meal and we went to sleep id love to tell you that we posted guards and acted like good sailors or even good pirates but we passed out and it was twelve hours before most of us were up i had the energy to help a dozen other men pitch a tent to pull seckla into it lie him on blankets and curl up by him with doola on one side of him and sittonax on the other it was cool in midafternoon and promised to be cold at night in the morning seckla was moaning on his bedroll i knew what came next in the dawn i considered putting a knife in him gut wounds are horrible id watched a few but doolas eyes were open and i knew hed never forgive me but again behon worked to our rescue he found a doctor one of the kelt doctors who were also priests men of learning and often musicians and led him by the hand to doolas side good morning said the white beard in a passable imitation of attic greek then he rolled seckla over and examined his stomach wound for some time no food he said nothing but water ill be back he picked up his heavy staff and left our tent seckla moaned but he didnt scream yet outside we could hear rain on the tent and i went out we were two hundred men in four tents stacked like cordwood the easiest way out was to crawl under the edge it was wet and cold i found behon standing in the rain and sittonax we walked through the downpour to the waters edge and looked out into the mist the wind was from the south and moderate enough sittonax led me up the beach to the warehouses there were six of them built of timber and thatch and a pair of stone roundhouses not unlike the venetiae houses not unlike a military tower in boeotia either except that the stones were smaller and completely unmortared the first warehouse contained about a hundred ingots of tin and each ingot was shaped like a capital eta h and weighed as much as a grown child i laughed i laughed and laughed this is where the tin comes from i said satisfied behon said something quickly and laughed sittonax nodded sagely not quite he says the tin comes from the land opposite and farther inland they gather it here to sell to traders phoenicians venetiae anyone who comes pray for amphitrite i said but it was lydia who appeared vasileos brought the triakonter in and we watched his crew make all the mistakes wed made we scrambled out into the freezing surf and helped the smaller boat land and pressed water on them theyd started with full water amphorae lucky them but spent two additional days at sea when vasileos had water in him he pointed south nike is somewhere out there and we saw amphitrite at sunset he said we smelled woodsmoke and i followed it then we met a fishing boat who gave us all his water and here we are the phoenicians i asked vasileos shrugged how far can they chase us he asked the ends of the earth i said we attacked their gold and their prestige in fact i was coming to terms with the notion that by raiding their mine id started a war i had no qualms the phoenicians got what they deserved between my trireme and lydia i had most of the remaining gold wed taken and all the silver amphitrite and demetrios had the rest of the gold keltoi love gold so i traded all the gold for food bad wine and tin i traded the amphorae in lydia s hold for more tin and for barrels on our fourth day ashore i sent lydia with vasileos to search the coast for the missing ships my sailors stripped my trireme to the gunwales and dried her and recaulked her and then we stowed the tin as ballast i could only buy about seventy of the pigs but that was enough the barrels went fore and aft into the bow and stern id never had so much drinking water i bought dried fish in enormous quantities and dried meat and dried berries after a week vasileos came back with amphitrite limping in at his heels the two ships landed just ahead of a purpleblack sky that swept out of the north and we had six days of violent rain and high winds demetrios drank the bad wine and smiled a great deal we are the greatest sailors in the circle of the ocean he said i saw nike a week ago she lost her mainsail in the blow and we passed them fresh line and they were rowing north theyll be well off to the east theres a current we lost our reckoning east i asked the wind was from the east ive been up and down this coast demetrios said fishermen said there was a big island full of foreigners but i couldnt find it whereas wed sailed right into it since demetrios was the best seaman ive ever known i have to assume we had the will of the gods with us we sat out the blow and rested our crews and fed them regularly the locals were friendly even when wed spent our money and our trade goods a surprising number of local ladies began to sport ostrich plumes african beads were wildly popular i think we added to the population after two days of fine weather vasileos and demetrios pronounced amphitrite ready for sea we finished lading our ships had a dinner of roast pig and leeks to celebrate spent the last of our trade goods saving aside only a few pots and some weapons and rose to a red sun and the promise of three days good weather we left vecti with the everpresent wind in our teeth but it was gentle and we rowed due east with amphitrite tacking far to the south i wouldnt let the men touch my hardbought supplies we landed that night and killed sheep and didnt pay for them like sea rovers the next day we met three fishing boats and the men aboard hugged behon he came aft to me knelt and took my hand and i pulled him to his feet and embraced him thanks i said it was obvious he was home and these were his folk they had a look to them that was similar dumnoni he climbed over the side and the fishing boats followed us into the beach a fine harbour with miles of beach and we feasted on their catch they told us that nike was farther up the estuary patching a sprung bow the wind was rising and i wasnt unhappy to go up the estuary we found nike towards nightfall and gaius was as happy as you can imagine but hed brought his people through in fine order he threw his arms around me youll never guess what ive found he said tin i asked spoilsport but he laughed the next day we said our farewells to behon leukas his brother elected to stay aboard perhaps it seems an odd decision but we promised to take him over the mountains to the inner sea and to send him home the same way and leukas was and is a fine sailor handy in a way behon was not and seckla liked him and began to teach him to tend the sails seckla who appeared to have recovered i dont know whether this was the science of the local priests or his own healthy flesh or the will of the gods i cant remember exactly how deep the arrow went but seckla made a full recovery and had a little bump on his chest he used to scratch we had water we had two days food our holds full of tin and we had exact sailing directions for the northern venetiae islands and the mouth of the sequana river which we were told was two days away we were five weeks from home it was glorious we set sail with the dawn and we had to row out of the estuary as the wind had shifted all night and then settled back into an easterly but the oarsmen every one of whom was going to get a share of all that tin rowed steadily slowly but with a will and our ships were clean and dry and we moved well enough we found amphitrite hurrying towards us in the early morning her mainsail and boatsail set slanting up from the south and east we watched them and chuckled because they werent going to reach us on that tack and theyd be all day following us if they lost ground there was a certain rivalry between the men who had to row all day and the mere sailors at our closest point of approach perhaps ten stades they dropped all their sails that meant something i think theyre waving doola said i nodded already my eyes werent what they had been at seventeen lets go and speak to them i said wearily they were downwind easy to get there harder to row back the boatsail mast was rigged so i gave the rowers a rest and we ran downwind and lydia and nike lay on their oars when we were a stade away they started to yell demetrios and a dozen other men all yelling in unison i got it immediately phoenicians as soon as demetrios knew that i understood he put his helm over raised his sails and ran back west even as secklas men raised the mainmast and the two triakonters followed suit you dont always need signals the first sharks fin nicked the southern horizon in the sunlight by the time we had our sails set and we were all running west there were five of them i was thousands of stades north of the pillars and the phoenicians had sent a squadron to track me down in a way it was flattering but the immediate crisis was one of navigation the wind was blowing off the coast of gaul and it was going to blow us west west was the tin island but after that nothing id seen glimpses of that nothing a grey rockbound coast stretching away into the setting sun there is a saying in plataea that the frog would rather be alive in the desert than dead in the pond its not a pretty saying but it is a true one my oarsmen grumbled and looked west with desperate anxiety but as long as we sailed west with the worlds wind at our backs the phoenicians were not likely to catch us so i sailed west i had a plan one that depended on my being a little more cunning than my adversaries i sailed west and planned to double back around the tin island and leave them all astand in the channel i didnt expect it to work but i wanted to try we sailed west a day and made camp in an estuary not a place id been of course leukas told us it was safe to land he insisted that if we beached and drew our ships up the dumnoni would protect us of course he said with a shrug it would have been better if youd sailed north into the heart of our country it was late and we had a dozen small fires burning behind the dunes that separate the cold beach from the sea i had as many men on watch all the phoenicians had to do was to catch us against the beach and we would either be dead men or wed spend the rest of our lives on alba all the natives said it was an island an island with three hundred stades of sea between it and the mainland i dont think i went to sleep that night it wasnt just the ships the truth was with vasileos possibly my greatest weapon i could build more ships no it wasnt ships it was the cargo the tin the silver and the gold if we abandoned or burned the ships we lost the cargo no two ways about it there was no way to keep thousands of pounds of tin or even a couple of hundred pounds of gold and silver and i hadnt come all this way to lose it long before dawn i stumbled around in the dark until i had located doola seckla gaius neoptolymos and the rest i had heated enough wine to fill my old mastos cup and above us the stars wheeled across the sky bigger and farther away i think than they were back in greece i had built up a fire and i handed the cup around and they pulled their cloaks as tightly as they could beyond the circle of the fire men were rising from sleep and none of them was happy to rise so early doola looked at me blurrily over the rim of my cup so he asked i see two choices i answered we can burn the ships and lose the cargoes go inland find leukass people and wait the phoenicians out i looked around we have three hundred men and they rely on us well have to feed them or risk having them either turn on us or to banditry i looked around demetrios shrugged you took them he said i did so they are my responsibility i agreed but we are in this together and that cargo is our cargo doola nodded neoptolymos shrugged lets fight he said thats a third option i agreed we could put to sea and fight five triremes against one trireme two triakonters and a tub of a merchantman all brilliantly handled of course demetrios shook his head suicide he said wed just die seckla grinned no the gods will make a way for us he looked at me because arimnestos has the luck of hermes gaius was staring out to sea you have another option i nodded we run west according to the dumnoni it is a long promontory then we run north around the north end of the island demetrios whistled how far he asked i raised my hands to the heavens how would i know leukas says ten days sailing but lets face it he doesnt really know any waters but these right here just like all the other keltoi except the venetiae demetrios said doola handed me the cup if we run all the way around alba and stay ahead of the phoenicians all the way where do we get to the coast of gaul i said i drew them a chart as best i could in the sand alba is a triangle about three days sailing by ten i said i remember saying that laughable but the venetiae had said it and leukas said it i believed it i drew the long line of the gaulish coast another angle north around alba then east to gaul looking for the estuary where the venetiae have their homes i said we sell them our ships and move our tin over the mountains and down to marsala demetrios was looking out to sea and all we have to do is stay ahead of the phoenicians all the way i nodded its true he shook his head listen im a good sailor and not a good warrior but that plan seems foolish to me fifteen days sailing twenty days more like twenty days for them to catch us on a beach twenty days where we have to find a safe route and a site to camp and all they have to do is follow us it is a landlubbers plan that depends on our navigation being perfect one error one blocked channel one day of adverse winds and they have us i rubbed my beard chagrined do you have a better plan i spat for all my vaunted maturity i didnt really like to be questioned he shrugged he was watching the ocean do we all agree we cant run the pillars again he asked he looked around and we all nodded so we have to make the coast of gaul right he was very serious he leaned forward i say we sail west yes but as soon as the wind shifts a few points we sail south into the deep blue south for oiasso right across the hypotenuse of the triangle right ari i had been teaching him basic geometry theres a lot of time to kill when you are at sea or camping on headlands every night and teaching your best navigator some geometry can prove quite valuable seckla nodded and even the cautious doola looked pleased this is a better plan doola said neoptolymos and gaius and i felt differently this plan is all luck and seamanship i said all the venetiae fear the deep blue they say ships die out there weve already ridden out two storms demetrios i dont really want to face a third neoptolymos nodded aris way keeps us on a coast all the way he said if the phoenicians catch us we can abandon the ships and run inland gaius agreed demetrios you have a ship that sails closer to the wind than mine you have a deck for men to sleep under and honour requires me to say this you are a far better sailor than i you could weather a storm that would kill me he looked around he was a proud man who is not but he hung his head when i lost you i was afraid afraid right up until i found you again i want a plan that keeps us together he shook his head or i want to give my command to someone who is better at it seckla of all people put an arm around him you command very well he said gaius shrugged outwardly perhaps inwardly i looked at demetrios but surely that is how command is for all men i said you worry for them they row for you well at least that line won me a laugh demetrios came and stood by me your plan is the plan for the warriorlandsmen my plan is the plan for the fishermen he made a rocking motion with his hand either might work or be disastrous but i agree that you have the luck of the gods so i will do as you desire choose i held this council so that i would not have to make this decision alone i said seckla laughed nice try lets get moving before the phoenicians solve the whole thing by hitting us in the dawn i agreed but first i explained my plan for losing the enemy around vecti and gaius and i wrote out a simple signal book on wax tablets and handed them around we got off our rocky beach in fine style and we were out in the rollers before the morning raised the wave height and made launching impossible and we were at sea for three hours and hadnt seen a sail and hopes were beginning to rise and then they were there the first sail nicked the horizon at midmorning and by noon all five were visible and gaining we were sailing at the speed of the slowest nike im sorry to say they had longhulled triremes that cut the water like dolphins and they ran off three stades to our two the sun had passed its zenith and i poured wine over the leeward rail and put the helm down for vecti now visible at least to anyone who had been there before on the starboard bow by the will of the gods the timing was perfect they were well up with us and it was late enough in the day that a cautious trierarch would be scouting the coast for a place to camp east by north an hour and the island filled the horizon and then i turned and ran due west again the phoenicians were now hull up perhaps twenty stades away perhaps less honey hull up is when you can see the hull of a ship over the rim of the world the horizon with a stubby merchant ship you can see a glimmer of his hull at thirty stades or more but a low warship is invisible until hes close unless his mast is up seckla had gone aboard gaiuss ship to support him hed left me leukas who was becoming one of us sea time bonds men quickly or leaves them enemies so it was leukas who stood by me at the helm doola was amidships everything was laid by ready for action every man aboard knew that the easiest solution to our problem was to weather the island of vecti and leave the phoenicians gasping in our wakes and run for gaul doola came astern about an hour before id have to execute the heart of my plan he looked out to sea and made a motion and leukas smiled and walked amidships down the catwalk doola wouldnt meet my eye i want to sail south he said i confess that your plan is better safer i agree that demetrios is pretending that all of us have his knack for weather and sailing i nodded but i want my wife he said if it was lydia left at oiasso if it was your briseis of whom you speak in your dreams he met my eye i am the old mature man i am the solid man the one whose shoulder you all cry on but i want something i want my wife i had sworn to live and die with these men they were my brothers and what exactly were we were we merchants were we warriors what would heraclitus say well he would most likely have said something dark and mysterious and difficult to make out but he insisted to a group of us once that in friendship men came closest to the gods because friendship was selfless he gave a eulogy once for a boy who died protecting another boy from dogs he said that this fiery soul had gone straight to elysium because there was no finer death than giving your life for your friends i didnt stand there pondering it i just want you to understand that there was no way that i was telling doola no in three years i dont think hed ever asked me for a single thing we were slanting down on vecti on a quarterreach with the wind a few points off the stern everyone ready to row i called everything would now depend on the ability and willingness of my friends to trust me and read the signal book because i was throwing the plan out of the window there was one advantage to having the smaller ships we were lower in the water what i was about to try was insanely risky it made me smile in fact as soon as id made my decision i began to grin uncontrollably there is a feeling you get as a commander a feeling you get when you know youve made the right choice even if you fail i had it immediately i grinned at doola well get your wife i said we were six stades off vecti racing for the westernmost point of the island in the old plan we should have dropped our masts and turned north to row through the channel signal that we will turn to the south i pointed at the great blue doola had the signal tablet and he began to flash my bronzefaced aspis we had an alternate signal system with lanterns and another with cloaks the sun isnt as common in northern waters as he is at home amphitrite signalled that they understood euphoria signalled that they understood but nike shot in under my stern gaius leaned far out over his curved stern south he bellowed south i called trust me gaius shrugged and his ship dropped astern signal again i said one by one the three ships acknowledged sails down on the signal i called doola repeated it in three flashes this we had practised do it i roared leukass men sprang into action and our sails dropped to the deck our masts came down with a rush and no one was killed the deck crews grabbed the billowing canvas trapped it against the deck and sides and began folding it aggressively the triakonters had the harder job no real deck crews less space no deck or even a good catwalk but the sails were gone in the beat of a heart even a nervous heart before the way was off us i had turned my trireme south by west out to sea and headed for the deep blue we were going to spend a night at sea in the most dangerous waters in the world on the positive side the sun was golden orange and there wasnt a cloud in the sky against the coastline our low hulls ought to have been invisible and we were rowing west and south out into the open ocean if the enemy saw us or deduced our course wed be caught on the other hand wed know almost immediately when they figured out our ruse because they would have to turn to tack across the wind and with their sails up that would show at quite a distance i watched those sails the way a coach watches his runner at the isthmian games or the olympics my heart was in my throat it beat twice as hard and made my gut ache on and on we rowed not at racing speed either i knew we were in for a long haul and the wind was still blowing from east to west it should have favoured us but we wanted to go south and our sails would give us away even poor amphitrite had to row and she was a pitiful rower after an hour i cast her a tow my two hundred rowers were her only hope otherwise her twelve oarsmen were going to burst their hearts passing the tow cable used some time and we rowed some more and i watched those ships and then they all took their sails down it was late afternoon by this time if our plan had worked then they had followed us into the channel between vecti and alba theyd have had to take their sails down to row east into the channel but one ship kept her sails up and as i watched that ship tacked across the wind and came down towards us i cursed doola came aft hes not onto us yet but the phoenician trierarch smelled a rat hes sending one ship south just to have a look i watched him when hes hull up to us then he can see us well know the moment he catches us hell turn back north and start signalling like mad and then what do we do doola asked we raise our masts and pray to the immortal gods i said it was two hours before he caught us late enough that we began to hope darkness would creep over the rim of the world and save us but the gods were not with us and we saw him suddenly spin about on his oars and we knew the game was up every one of our ships had his masts laid to with heavy hawsers already laid to the mastheads the masts went up the sails came out like the rapid blossoming of flowers and the oarsmen relaxed with muttered curses men rubbed their arms or each others backs and we ran towards the setting sun at a good clip but the moment the sun touched the horizon i put my helm down and headed south due south the wind had backed a few points and we were committed now and there was no way the phoenician scout could see us we should be lost in the dazzle of the setting sun or the gods hated us about midnight the wind dropped altogether i had stars by which to navigate and i kept the north star over my shoulder as best i could no mean feat when theres a roof of wood covering your navigational aid let me tell you i kept giving the oars to leukas and running forward to take another sight how the gods must have been laughing the moon was full and we ran south over a ghostlit ocean i could see the other three ships well enough and whenever we threatened to get ahead i would order the sail brailed up it was my second night awake and i must have fallen asleep between the steering oars because some time not long before dawn when the air goes through that change from cool to warm i think hard to define but the moment when your mind if awake begins to hope for dawn something was wrong and i awoke as if a trumpet was being played in my ear we sailed on for twenty heartbeats and i couldnt place it but my heart was beating a spartan marching song and then i caught it it was an unmistakable sound even to a lubberly sailor like me surf leukas i roared and threw my body into the oars turning the bow to the north as hard as i could the wind had swerved to being almost due south and i wanted to get the head up into the wind and drop the sail the fastest way to get a ship to stop leukas had his deck crew on the sail instantly the sail came down even as doola roused the oarsmen to their duty and the oars started paying out of their ports we were losing way the steering oars wouldnt bite and i could hear the ocean pounding on rocks to starboard i left the steering oars and leaped onto the rail looking south i couldnt see a thing and then i saw water shooting into the air perhaps as high as the top of a tall temple due south it was hard to make out thats what it looked like just astern nike was following my lead head up into the wind oars were coming out euphoria had made the turn amphitrite had been last in line and now she had turned all the way to the east and was still under sail but she could make way with the wind almost amidships and we could not she began to come up on us hand over fist when my rowers got their oars in the water i was all adither about what to do had we discovered an island what rocks were these what lay beyond them i couldnt see enough to tell and as minutes led into hours i realized that our beautiful weather was gone and now we were running east slowly under oars and the sound of surf crashing on rocks came from astern it was dawning a grey grey day with fog and i couldnt see a thing we ran east for three hours before the fog burned off and then we couldnt believe our eyes due south across our path was land i summoned leukas what the hell i shouted i was angry the anger of fear he shook his head i think that is i he looked around as if perhaps poseidon would come and save him from my wrath he shrugged it has to be gaul he said we had taken eight days or so i assumed to sail from the coast of gaul to alba and wed done the return trip in the same number of hours or so it appeared thugater the truth inasmuch as ill ever know the truth is that the venetiae had lied to us about the shape of alba and the shape of gaul why should they tell us their navigational secrets so we spent days running along the coast of alba when we might have been safe in a harbour in gaul we landed at noon and bought some bread and some good wine and got sailing directions for the mouth of the venetiae river the sequana that night we made camp on a good beach one of six or seven in a row almost as fine as the inner sea it was easy to land despite the rising swell we purchased fish from local men and we ate well oarsmen need food i posted guards on the headlands and ordered a day of rest wed been at sea five days straight and the oarsmen had worked every day theres a limit to endurance especially with men who have been kept under cruel conditions although i was also happy to see how neoptolymos and megakles were both filling out their emaciated bodies starting to remember their form i had been through the same process when i was recovering from dagons tender mercies that bastard sometimes i wondered if he was aboard one of the ships that were trailing us but of course it was unlikely nor did i think he was a good enough sailor to survive in the outer sea we slept a lot that day and the locals flocked to see us and sell us food i had silver and by midday the local war chief came in his chariot and looked us over with lordly disdain that was fine with me neoptolymos wanted to challenge him to single combat he was young mornings were starting to be cold i didnt feel young after the local aristocrat was driven away by his charioteer i found doola he was stretched out under a sail staring at the canvas over his head i handed him a cup of wine were in gaul i said he nodded i meant to sail south to oiasso i said but either my navigation is very bad or the bastard venetiae lied to us about the shape of gaul i shrugged the local chief says that your wife is about nine hundred stades south of here he actually laughed he got up on an elbow and patted my arm now thats an error in navigation he said i shrugged were all alive i said and we have our cargo on the right side of the channel even if the phoenicians catch us now he put two fingers to my lips naming calls he said i plan to sail north another two days to the mouth of the susquana theres a venetiae town there i fingered my beard if you want to take the warriors and go south ill buy horses for you and ill wait for you i shrugged its the best offer i can make doola nodded ill take it he said he picked himself a halfdozen fighters alexandros of course and neoptolymos which was no surprise i traded a full ingot of tin for a dozen good horses with tack and some dried fish dried meat and wine in the dawn there were still no phoenicians in the offing and we prepared for sea one of my fishermen from marsala an older man gian took doolas place as oarmaster my marines rode away south with a local guide sittonax went with them leaving leukas as my sole interpreter we got off the beach beautifully gian seemed to know his job immediately and despite heavier waves we made good time the coast was low with some beautiful small islands one was a magnificent rock rising out of the water and as we sailed by we could see that it was dry at low tide tides here ran very high insanely high by the standards of the inner sea we camped on another fine beach of beautiful white sand in the night someone attacked my guards and we all stood to arms waiting for the phoenicians to descend but in the morning it was obvious that wed been raided by a halfdozen young men because their tracks were clear in the sand i sighed for my lost sleep watched the cliffs carefully and ordered my ships to load i was suffering from a nagging fear by then that we were simply too far from home the men were hungry and our feast day of a few days earlier was already just a memory but early afternoon showed me an opening in the coast it had to be the estuary of the sequana but i couldnt run into the estuary in the dark so i stood off we spent a brutal night at sea the wind rose and i began to wonder if i was going to be wrecked just when all seemed safe dawn found me too close to land with a rising westerly that threatened to drive me hard to shore i had no choice but to run into the estuary and once i did that i was at the mercy of the venetiae on the other hand i had three warships one of which ought to be the biggest in local waters well of course there were the phoenicians but i hoped that they were well to the west i ran into the estuary with a gale rising behind me the estuary of the great river runs east to west and we ran east for hours in the odd light with the sky to the west growing blacker but the water of the estuary was calm and shallow almost too shallow amphitrite had trouble tacking back and forth and she parted company to travel long boards to the north and south we had to row and my unfed rowers were increasingly unhappy i had no more wine to give them i walked up and down the catwalk promising them a life of ease once we reached the town i had only other mens word there was a town the estuary seemed to go on for ever and by the end of the day despite the rising storm behind us we had slowed to a crawl because amphitrite had no more room to tack and had to row everyone was exhausted no one was making their best decisions late in the afternoon gian spotted what seemed to him to be a line of masts to the north we turned towards the north bank of the estuary and rowed slowly and as we rowed it became clear that the fisherman was right the masts developed hulls big high round hulls like athenian grain merchants and to our delight well to mine there wasnt a single trireme among them in the darkness of my thoughts id expected to find the whole phoenician squadron here ahead of us trapping us against the storm at our backs there was a town later we knew it was called loluma and the first lights were starting to twinkle on the stormladen air as the sun set i could see a line of three stone piers and another pair of wooden ones built it seemed of enormous trees tied up along the piers were lines of large open boats of a type unfamiliar to me dozens of open boats ten yards long and only one yard wide closer up each boat seemed to be carved of a single giant tree beyond the piers and docks was a broad beach more of a mudflat or so it appeared the tide was high let me just add that by now i was beginning to learn to judge their fickle and titanic tides we stirred a great deal of interest a pair of small boats launched from the piers while the light was still good i wanted to beach all my ships demetrios came up under my stern to tell me the same its going to be bad he said we lay on our oars watching that pretty town big wooden houses with thatched roofs muddy streets open fields cows and the smell of woodsmoke which to a sailor is the smell of home and hearth i dont know what the oarsmen thought but i know what i thought i thought about what the venetiae would say now that i was here i wasnt sure that the phoenicians hadnt burned the other venetiae settlements behind us that they hadnt decided to arrest us in fact wed gone and bought tin from their source the first man up the side of my warship was detorix in a way seeing detorix was a relief he was a known quantity hed done right by his own lights and at least i wouldnt have to explain from first principles i saluted him gravely and then offered him my hand he took it and clasped it like an old friend we thought you dead he said he smiled and some of us thought that was the better way still alive i said how is olario he nodded untouched the phoenicians were so busy trying to kill you they passed us by how many of their ships did you destroy i shrugged one i said at least thats all i know of i lost the rest of them on the coast of alba i thought i might as well get that in right away i took my round ship to sea behind you and ran north to ratis he said but the phoenicians stayed on you out to sea he raised an eyebrow so you found alba yes i admitted no thanks to you he shrugged listen i said i have a cargo of tin i want to take it all the way south to marsala ill pay the freightage in ships ill sell you these four ships for the freight on our tin and other metals you dont need to worry about my coming back for your tin i wont have a ship on the western ocean he smiled i do want your ship he ran his hand down the steering oar a warship his lust was evident who was i to stand in his way and id thought it through this way seemed to me to cause the least chance of resentment the last thing i needed was for the venetiae to have me killed to protect their tin monopoly i wasnt ever coming back i was prepared to swear oaths on any god they named well i asked he shrugged i cant say he prevaricated but i imagine something can be arranged along those lines i dont have the prestige to negotiate such a big trade in one go ill need partners no one will want these smaller boats he pointed to the triakonters its a miracle theyve survived as long on our coast as they have and i imagine you want to land tonight and not fight that storm this was the part i had been dreading yes i admitted he nodded leukas translated what we were saying for the other man another aristocrat taller older and wearing a torq of solid gold i bowed to him he was introduced as tellonix he had the only cloak i had seen among the keltoi that was dyed with tyrian dye bright purple like a tyrant or a king or an aegyptian priest he looked at my ship how many ingots of tin do you have he asked in greek in the inner sea we like to chat a little before we do business but there with the lights of the town behind us and the gale beginning to blow down the estuary i was happy to negotiate in a hurry seventy i said he twirled his moustaches which were heavy land your ships as our guests he said you have my word you will not be seized here he gave detorix a significant look the younger man was unabashed what was i to do he asked he had three hundred fighting men and he still does and yet he has come back to us in peace tellonix said in keltoi which leukas translated well i knew i had nowhere else to go but there was no reason i had to say so aloud we got our keels up the beach as i say it was more mud than sand mens feet stank when they got ashore and we were so far up the estuary that the water was scarcely salt we pulled the ships even higher up the beach at high tide my trireme was ten horselengths onto the grass we had help from a hundred willing keltoi men and women we got the ships ashore and we got our cargoes off and under our tarpaulins and then the rain started and we ran for shelter i think that in all gaul only the venetiae had the facilities to sleep three hundred sailors and even so we had to raise our tents in a blustering squallladen wind it was hard work but our feet were on dry land and we were filled with spirit like heracles in the morning the weather was if anything worse but i woke in a fine wooden house a little smoky i confess and cold but outside a gale blew over the town and even the water of the estuary looked deadly breakfast was an oddly shaped squash full of good butter and honey and we ate with gusto and drank the thin local beer demetrios raised his small beer and said may the gods protect all sailors on a day like this even the poor phoenicians i dont think neoptolymos would have drunk to that but he was away south we slept and ate for three days while the storm blew itself out and then the serious trading began we had been unlucky in some things and lucky in others in our favour the winds that had seemed adverse to us had allowed us to bring a cargo of tin before the last convoy left the mouth of the sequana for the interior winter closed down the tin trade as it closed everything else and we had arrived in good time to make the trip our ships were not as valuable as i had hoped freighting three hundred men and seventy muleloads of tin overland to marsala cost me all four ships and all my silver my silver thats a laugh and my gold was spent keeping us all in marsala while the convoy prepared it was only in the mouth of the sequana at loluma which is what the venetiae called their trade town there that we really saw the power of the venetiae it wasnt just that they had ships and they did ships as large as our inner sea grain ships capable of carrying thousands of mythemnoi of grain in a single cargo the keltoi built barrels as ive described to standard sizes and they built the open boats the ones id seen at the piers also to standard sizes so that the barrels rolled easily aboard right down the gunwales to the stern it was a superb design a gaulish riverboat could load on any bank and unload right back up the bank with a few strong men they could row or pole and they drew so little water that they could run up quite a small stream or pass a dam or a fish weir they had a particular flat barge for carrying tin each boat took three ingots and had a crew of two tin was so valuable even here that each boat had a curiously carved log on a rope and the log was threaded into the ingots i asked tellonix what it was for he smiled if the boat capsizes and sinks the little piece of wood floats to the surface and shows where we can retrieve the tin he said they usually hired out guards men like sittonax detorix wanted my oarsmen but i wasnt willing to sell them i did convince him to treat them as free men and offer them wages few of them were willing at first but after an idle week and some descriptions of the trip we were going to make more and more of them signed to row for him almost a third of the former slaves none of the men from marsala of course we were almost home or so it seemed to us and most of the fishermen assumed we had about ten days travel before we got there i spent many fine evenings in the tavernas of loluma talking to venetiae captains about their routes they were careful circumspect but sailors have a natural tendency to brag to each other and demetrios was the very prince of navigators he had brought us through the pillars of heracles and all the way to alba and his exploits loosened their tongues they told us fabulous tales tales of islands west of alba and north too of islands of ice that glittered in the sun and shoals of cod so thick a man could walk on them one captain had made a dozen trips to the north of alba for slaves and gold he laughed at our notion that we could sail around alba in ten days thirty days he said shaking his head and even then you would need the gods at your helm demetrios gave me a long look what could i say we greeks gathered in a circle of standing stones and herodikles said the prayers for the autumn feast of demeter we gave a horse race with prizes for poseidon who had favoured us and let us live it pleased the keltoi too because they loved horses even though theirs were to me the ugliest horses id ever seen heavy ungainly and shortlegged but they raced them praised them called them names like wind and spirit just like our horses at home we introduced them to the idea of a nighttime torch race on horseback which they liked a good deal we paid for a feast our convoy was completed i was taking a little over two hundred men home all i needed was doola ever waited for someone in the agora ever sat by a stream waiting for a girl who promised to walk with you or by a door because she said shed be there in a minute ever waited and waited and been disappointed at what point do you walk away for me the issue was winter the venetiae were unfailingly polite even a little oily which is not how one thinks of barbarians is it but they wanted us gone they feared that the phoenicians would come as did i and they feared that we would make trouble which wasnt so far from possible either and they feared that we might try to seize our ships back they feared too that my freed slaves might eat them out of house and home i feared the cost i wasnt living on charity but i had made a deal for the whole journey and i knew that sooner or later detorix would sidle up to me very apologetically and demand that we get under way i didnt really have to care but there might come a further point where the venetiae would simply refuse to perform their part or that the passes would close and wed be stuck for another winter in the north country something had happened to me and the longer i spent in the pretty town of loluma the more thoroughly it happened i was turning back into arimnestos i still mourned euphoria but i was merely sad i missed athens i missed plataea i was sorry that i had made such a mess of lydia and sicily but i was determined to go back and set it right i was going back to being the man i had been with perhaps some changes i did not seriously consider just for example threatening the venetiae with the burning of their town just to keep them in awe of course im smiling thugater things change people change but some things remain the same always as youll see if you stay with me another hour about two weeks after we landed to be honest the whole period is a blur of activity to me a round ship crept up the estuary under oars eight long sweeps handled in a fairly seamanlike manner and i sat in my favourite of the three waterfront tavernas drinking a wooden bowl of the excellent gaulish wine and watching the ship come in she was a trader of course a venetiae ship that had just made the passage to alba not a tin ship or not this trip this ship had been far to the north along the east coast of alba collecting hides and selling wine the captain whom ill call accles because thats the closest i ever got to his name sat with me for a day recounting his adventures he was eager to meet me because hed met with the phoenicians off vecti and spoken to them you have made them very angry he said detorix was sitting across from me spying i think or at least watching leukas translated for me translated some by then my gaulishkeltoi wasnt bad the phoenician trierarch said that you were a pirate who came from greece just to prey on phoenician shipping he said i smiled i have no love for carthage or tyre i said i have sunk many of their ships and killed or taken many of their men detorix and accles exchanged a look have they asked for you to hand me over i asked they will accles answered i mean i had no idea who you were until i came ashore here i nodded will they come here i asked detorix gave me an odd look we dont allow them to come here he said i looked at both of them they both watched me i resisted the impulse to place a hand on my xiphos hilt while we were all staring or perhaps glaring at each other a woman came in she was a matron a year or two older than me i expect keltoi women are very fit like spartan women and you cant always read their age in their bellies but she had the wrinkles of laughter in her eyes and the way she carried her head spoke of dignity combined with shall we say experience she wore a sword but that wasnt so rare among aristocratic kelts she looked at me with appraisal perhaps even challenge and sat by accles is this the pirate she asked accles pretended to laugh yes i said i am but not of keltoi merely of carthaginians she raised an eyebrow she had redbrown hair and a long straight nose and wore a gold pin on her wool cloak that was worth hmm a small ship im arimnestos of plataea i said she looked at accles well she asked detorix leaned forward hes on his way south with a cargo of tin stolen tin she asked detorix ten years before id have slammed my fist on the table and said something like im right here instead i sat back and had a sip of wine he purchased the tin at vecti detorix said with spoils taken from the phoenicians she insisted i snorted she ignored me detorix looked at me though he says not he says that he brought trade goods from the inner sea and the phoenicians our most reliable trade partners are lying is that it she asked detorix shrugged and didnt meet her eye she turned to me the phoenicians landed north of vecti burned a village and killed a handful of people she said slowly my people and took fifty of them as slaves i guessed she shrugged yes i have reason to believe it i nodded when i stormed their town i opened the slave pens there were hundreds of keltoi i shrugged and i rescued them and brought them home ask around your attack may have provoked a war she said they attacked me first i said she shrugged as if the rights and wrongs of the issue didnt interest her much and there was no reason it should as i found out later from detorix she was the queen of three tribes and she needed to keep her peoples happy and well fed which meant a constant tin trade reliable alliances and open communications with the phoenicians wouldnt it make more sense to burn a couple of their ships to teach them not to enslave your people i asked she went back to talking to detorix if we just send them his head will that be enough detorix shook his head they dont even know what he looked like he said well theres barbarian honesty for you they discussed taking me executing me and sending my head to my enemies in front of me its honour of a sort im not sure there are enough men in this town to take me i said conversationally she looked at me the way a man would look at a pig if the pig talked she smiled southerners dont even know how to use a sword she said really i asked i dont expect many of our swordsmen come this way the way i hear it you get architects tin vendors and wine merchants she smiled it was amazingly condescending briseis could have taken lessons and are you a swordsman she asked damn it i was being played she knew what i would say and i was being manoeuvred into giving a display of skill so that i could be killed and neoptolymos wasnt close i had a boy a pais named ajax he was tiny underfed and fast he was around me all the time fetching me wine carrying my purse you know a pais he wasnt a slave or rather he had been a slave and now he was free and im not sure he had noticed a difference ajax run and fetch gaius will you lad i said the boy ran out into the afternoon the great lady leaned forward are you going to show us your swordsmanship she asked i frowned against whom you she smiled you are as far beneath me as the pigs who eat rubbish on my farms foreigner why not fight one of them first i leaned back im a greek not a kelt i was being bated and i knew it and i wasnt fifteen years old either we were sitting on threelegged wooden stools at a wooden table in the open under a linen canvas awning that stuck out from a timber building when i leaned back on two legs i could put my back against one of the supports that held up the awning i pointed a finger my left hand at detorix as if i was going to make an accusation and then my left hand darted to her right arm and pinned it down and i drew my kopis and laid it on her throat her eyes were fairly large leukas tell this woman exactly what i say are you ready leukas swallowed shes my queen boss i nodded good tell her she can fight me herself i dont see any reason to fight the pig the pigkeeper you getting this the pigkeepers boss her warlord her top swordsman no ill wait until youre done i kept her pinned in place she tried to get to her feet and i slammed her back down on the stool or ill just cut her throat and burn the town and steal what i need to get home i said to detorix understand me detorix you tried to take my things and my ships once before call me pirate what you lack here is the force to carry out your will understand the silence went on a long time gaius came in theres some very unhappy barbarians over there i think they are sending for archers he said you will be my second in a duel i said he shrugged detorix i let go of the queen and backed away she looked at me with pure unadulterated hate i smiled you havent met a swordsman lady i know because a swordsman wouldnt have let that happen i dont think you want the humiliation of facing me with a sword in your hand but unless you apologize to me now and swear an oath to the gods that you will not harm me you can fight she stood straighter fight she spat i turned my back on her and walked out into the sun leukas followed me aristocrats all they do is fight and practise to fight i was looking at her sword which was long and straight ajax go and fetch me my long xiphos i said six burly kelts in heavy leather came and stood around the queen i smiled at them none of them smiled back two were huge and two were quite small thin and wiry such men can be the most dangerous detorix came towards me hesitating with every step i really need to stop this he said this is not our way this woman is a guest you are a guest and we have agreed to play a little game i said gaius ask her if she wants a shield leukas asked the question no one answered him ajax ran back with my longest slenderest xiphos i had taken it off a carthaginian and i rather liked it i walked in the sun a little way along the gravel turned and drew the sword i put the scabbard in my left hand and threw my chlamys over my left arm she had a shield a big shield i saluted and she did not i stepped in flicked my blade up and she raised her shield and i kicked it and her to the ground with a pankration kick which she didnt see coming because i was too close and shed raised her shield and thus couldnt see i stepped back and let her get to her feet when she set her stance again i shook my head no you lost there is no second chance if you want to send another man so be it but you lost she glared but she walked over and tapped one of the big men his sword was as long as my arm and longer he took the shield it didnt look thick enough to be stable it was oddly shaped and too damned long and his arms were like an octopuss arms too long and too fast he came at me whirling his sword in front of his shield polymarchos had made me practise against this sort of thing which he called the whirlwind i made myself relax moved with him backing away letting him slowly close the distance he had a tempo to his spin and i moved with it almost as if we were dancing i had my strike prepared but he surprised me leaping forward with a shriek the sword cutting up from below my cloak i got my scabbard my heavy wooden scabbard on his blade and he cut right through it and into my chlamys the blow didnt cut into my arm but he almost broke my arm with the blow of course he had a foot of my steel through his head a little punch a handreverse to clear his raised shield one of polymarchoss best tricks he was dead before he hit the ground i hadnt intended to kill him in fact its worth noting that he was too good if hed been worse or slower or less longlimbed id have let him live and he was certainly trying to kill or maim me i stepped back and the pain of his blow hit me i stepped back again and one of the little bastards came for me he leaped the corpse of the big man and swung his heavy sword with two hands i cut his sword to the ground and pinked him in the hand he roared and cut at me again again i cut his sword to the ground with my lighter weapon and this time i skewered his right hand but he raised the sword with his left so i ripped my point out of his hand and brought the blade down on his left forearm and then stepped in and kicked him in the crotch and he slammed his maimed right hand into my face kelts theyre insane he didnt break my nose that was lucky i was blind with pain for a moment so i slashed the air in front of me to keep him back i connected with something but most of my long xiphos was scarcely sharp and all it did was raise a welt i suspect he leaped at me again just as i got control of my head he didnt have a weapon and he was as fast as a fish in the stream his wounded hands were up and he was reaching for my blade i had to kill him too now i was breathing like a bellows and i fell back i wanted to say something witty and insulting because i was angry full of rage like ares but all i could do was breathe it didnt feel good in fact i felt wretched these two men had never done anything to hurt me well except to attack me at the behest of their mistress and now they were dead she looked at me and at the four men beside her i breathed hard and waited gaius nodded thats it then he said in his aristocratic greek tell that woman that it is over or it is war and if its war we have two hundred men and she has four i looked at him i hadnt expected him to step in but thats what friends are for i turned to detorix we will leave in the morning i said let this be an end to it and dont let me regret not walking over and killing her detorix nodded that was good i was done with the venetiae so we left without doola and that didnt make me happy nor did i trust our hosts any more or our boatmen or anyone we had to pole our boats north some of the oarsmen were quite good at this and some were not we had a pair of guides and interpreters but otherwise we were on our own after the first night we built a regular camp by the river and we put brush all the way around it and stood to fully armed an hour before darkness and an hour after dawn the third day we saw horsemen on the horizon as we poled upstream by the fourth day we were quite aware of the horsemen who scarcely troubled to hide themselves and the river was a snake swimming on the sea an endless curve and backcurve sometimes we could see a town or settlement a dozen stades before we reached it some settlements were on both sides of a peninsula so wed pass the town twice and it did seem like we paddled or poled twice the distance that wed have walked or that our shadows rode id had about enough of the keltoi by then and i was unhappy with myself the more i thought on it the more i decided id allowed myself to be ruled by ares in the taverna i didnt need to show her my arete i didnt need to fight i could be odysseus instead of achilles and the two dead men were powerfully on my conscience but even as i thought these thoughts thoughts largely fuelled by heraclitus of course i also thought like the pirate i often was i considered setting an ambush for the riders it was foolish to let them pick the time for an attack but it would be worse to fight them once we fought wed be the enemy to every barbarian on the river and that would be the end of us and our tin too i thought about it for another day as we poled on and on and seemed to make very few stades that night gaius and seckla and i took herodikles and one of the younger shepherds leo who was growing as a man and as a leader the five of us slipped downstream in a small boat and we floated silently in the darkness until we came to a campfire we landed well upstream and crept carefully down on them eight men a dozen horses it was the work of two minutes to cut all the hobbles of the horses and chase them off into the darkness they roused themselves and we were gone the next day we had no contact with them we poled on we were low on food and i had to bargain with a fairly hostile village of kelts who lived in reed huts that stood on stilts in the water we bought grain for silver and got the worst of the bargain two nights later one of our interpreters tried to run he was surprised to find that i was right there waiting for him three more days poling and i was sure we had slipped our pursuers the poling had become quite difficult as we were travelling into the upper reaches of the river let me add that although i was sick to death of barbarians and their neck collars and their feuds and their superstition it is beautiful country and those gauls could farm the banks of the river were cultivated not everywhere but long swathes cutting through the forests the towns were prosperous if hagridden with aristocrats another thing i feel i must mention although this is not meant to be a tale of marvels encountered in travel travellers tales are all lies anyway is their priests they were all men all representatives of the aristocratic classes and they could perform prodigious feats of memory i met a priest on the sequana who could recite the iliad i didnt stay to hear the entire piece id have been there all winter but his memory seemed perfect to me and he could start wherever i asked him i could name a verse or an event and he would begin to recite i found this very impressive and told him so yet these learned men seemed to me more like magpies than like true priests they absorbed a great many facts it was from a keltoi priest that i first heard of pythagoras for example and they knew everything about plants herbs and medicine but so does any decent doctor in athens or thebes for moral philosophy they were merely barbarians they had no great code of ethics and their laws were mostly learned by rote and not reasoned or so it seemed to me in behaviour too the aristocrats seemed to do every man as he wished and when the wills of two such clashed there was war petty or great depending on the status of the contenders twice as we poled our way up the sequana we passed villages burned the second was still smouldering greeks could be just as bad so could persians but there was something ignorant about the keltoi of course im a greek and that may just be my own ignorance speaking and you must remember that i was seeing all this through the eyes of a man who had suddenly begun to see the uselessness at some level of violence the keltoi queen nordicca i knew her name to be of the dumnoni was typical of her breed the truth is that i had found her quite attractive sought to impress her and ended up behaving like a posturing adolescent and men were dead i wont say they haunted me they had died with weapons in hand striving against me but i will confess that i knew their deaths to be unnecessary but i digress fill my cup pais i had my two interpreters watched very carefully night and day demetrios managed our boats and gaius managed the interpreters we made sure they knew theyd be well paid for example i was quite sure they were supposed to desert us but we promised them enough silver to make them modestly wealthy men in truth detorix had taken some precautions to make sure we never came back i might have hated him but life had taught me that merchants will act to protect their trade the way farmers act to protect their crops they will make war or commit simple murder to keep others off their trade routes the venetiae were no different in kind from the phoenicians except that they werent quite such rapacious slavers when i look at how athens behaves these days i have to admit that apparently greeks are just as bad or perhaps worse more efficient the younger of the two interpreter guides was gwan and he was a warrior an aristocrat and not a merchant over the course of a dozen stops on the sequana i gathered that this was a great adventure for him that his father was deeply in debt to the venetiae and that his service was part repayment he was of the senones the people who ruled the great river valley he loved horses and he was the most profligate lover i think i have ever met it was difficult to find time to talk to him he was so busy lying with women the men that gaius sent to follow him always blushed to tell of his exploits he was neither particularly clever nor particularly handsome and yet in every village one or two young women seemed to leap on him with an enthusiasm that might have made me jealous if i hadnt been so busy what was his secret i have no idea at any rate after twenty days we were in the upper reaches of the sequana and poling was hard the current was fast even in autumn and we were all tired at the end of the day gwan rode ahead on horseback and was waiting for us on the riverbank we put up our tents in the fields already harvested men and women with baskets were making a small market an agora for us to buy food gwan was good at his job his partner was an older man a fisherman he was not an aristocrat and he didnt speak much or have the pure enjoyment of life that gwan had his name was brach and he was dark tall and silent and he walked with a stoop that looked sinister to a greek gaius and i were poling together with seckla and a pair of marsalian fishermen i dont even remember their names but i remember they were both cheerful companions we were singing hymns homers hymns all we could remember seckla was laughing at the words his gods were otherwise and he found ours odd brach was sitting in the stern hed poled for an hour and it was his turn to rest he was watching the bank and i was watching him he seemed alert and afraid when i stooped to get my wooden canteen and have a drink i happened to stumble by him try retrieving anything on a barge that is ten times as long as it is wide and youll see why i stumbled i got a whiff of him and he was afraid he smelled of fear whats the matter i asked i could see gwan standing on the bank and i could see fifty or so farmers and local peasants with their baskets of produce none of them was a warrior you can disguise a warrior but not if you pay attention men in top physical training stand and move differently from men who work the land for others men at the edge of violence have a different look on their faces not that i thought all these things at the time merely to note that i was conscious that we had more than seventy giant ingots of tin and a lot of gold too and that in my heart i knew the keltoi would try for it sometime i couldnt see anything whats wrong i asked brach glanced at me his face a dead giveaway and shrugged he stared at the water armour i ordered i shouted the order sternwards to the next boat and reached for the heavy leather bag with my thorax we were armoured and ready for anything in a quarter of an hour and the farmers stood on the bank puzzled anxious and then downright fearful they abandoned the bank and many packed their goods and fled the market when we landed we looked like a war band before the sun had set another finger a dozen chariots appeared and fifty keltoi on horseback i had forty men with spears and shields out as guards while we dragged downed trees to form an abatis a wall of branches not a great defence but enough to discourage casual looting and easy predation the local aristo had an eagle in bronze set on top of his helmet and wore a kneelength tunic of scale not a style of armour id ever seen before and it looked as if it would weigh far too much for use in combat of course the great gentry of gaul travel to war in chariots i wondered if this was what lord achilles looked like he spoke to gwan saluted and his driver rolled to a stop an armslength from me i had my pais offer him a cup of wine and he took it poured a libation like a greek and drank it off tell him that i apologize for frightening his people tell him as one warrior to another that i received a sign perhaps from my ancestor heracles and had my men get into their armour as i spoke i indicated the plaque that showed heracles and the nemean lion that was affixed to the inside of my aspis he listened and id say he understood as he gave me a sharp glance dismounted and offered me his hand to clasp i took it he spoke slowly paused took off his helmet and spoke again he says warriors must learn to understand and obey such signs he says a party of armed men passed his outposts this morning travelling quickly on horseback and he has been in armour all day he says perhaps your ancestor is not so wrong after all he gives you his word that no harm will come to your people tonight i let go his hand let me say that sometimes between people there is a spark of understanding it can lead instantly to love or friendship to treaties to alliances to marriages this man was cleareyed and honourable i would have staked my life on it gwan said his name was collam we passed a few minutes looking at each others war gear his scale mail was beautifully wrought the scales were fine the size of a mans thumb or slightly smaller and id say as a bronzesmith that there were four thousand of them in the whole tunic his helmet was superb very different from the helmets i made and he took mine put it on and moved like a fighter trying it while encouraging me with motions to try his i found his interesting airy open the cheeks were hinged the bowl was shallow the neck curved down like my fathers to meet the armour at the back like the tail of a shrimp or lobster except without the articulation there was a narrow brim over the eye which even late on an autumn day kept the sun from my eyes collam made a motion and grinned he had bright blond hair and enormous moustaches i dont think id ever seen a man with so much moustache he wants to trade gwan said my father is his sisters husbands brother does that make sense were not close but hes a famous warrior and his words are true i hadnt needed gwan to tell me that i loved my helmet i had made it with my own hands it fitted me perfectly and i trusted it but when you cant give something away you are a slave to it and generosity is one of the virtues besides his helmet was a magnificent piece of work the eagle on top was an artwork i grinned tell him it is his we fed him the farmers came back at dusk when they saw their lord sitting on one of our stools drinking our wine and we bought pigs and grain we also bought some dried fruit and meat i was so interested in collam that i lost track of brach and so did gaius collam was the sort of man that gaius loved and he sat with us the latins are not entirely keltoi but they have many words in common and gaiuss keltoi was far better than mine good enough that he could almost converse without gwan i missed sittonax and i missed daud play it as you will it was morning the night passed uneventfully when we discovered that brach was missing collam came down to the riverside with his corps of charioteers and cavalry to see us off i was in my armour watching the men load the barges and keeping an eye on gwan while seckla and gaius searched the fields and woods around our camp seckla could track so could a number of the herdsmen when collam came up we embraced he asks if youd like to sell any of your tin gwan said he was on the main tin route but then of course he was wearing ten pounds of the stuff in his harness his war band probably ate bronze how much do you want i asked he shrugged one pig he said eighty pounds the value in marsala would be almost eighty ounces of gold twice that in sicily gwan turned to me he wont well trade precisely if you give it to him he will make you gifts of equal value this sort of thing frustrates the venetiae he smiled but i had approached collam as a warrior so we were bound to behave like heroes fair enough id been a hero before herodikles had a team of men who had just wrestled a pig of tin to the riverside i waved to stop them from loading it into herodikles barge yours i said in passable keltoi that was oneeightieth of all our profits i was going to look like an idiot if he didnt give me something in return he went and lifted it by himself he grunted grinned and put it in his chariot and the leather and rawhide stretched and the whole light vehicle sank a little into the riverbank the charioteer looked as if he might cry i said im missing a man a gaul lent to me by the venetiae as a guide he has wandered off and i would like to know anything you know about this party of armed men collam nodded when this was translated and gwan grew pale and looked at me in greek i said gwan i suspect you were told to betray me yes gwan couldnt meet my eye do you want me to tell this famous warrior that you are a hireling of the venetiae that you have been paid to lead me to an ambush it wasnt quite a shot in the dark they have my father he said gwan the world is not always as dark as it seems when detorix knows that i am gone away south to marsala and wont return hell release your father or you can come and find me and i swear by the immortal gods ill come back with thirty warriors and take your father back gwan looked at the ground collam asked him something asked him what was wrong i think he looked at collam and spoke for a long time collam grew angrier and angrier it can be very difficult as an alien in another culture coming upon the keltoi from the sea it was easy to assume that the venetiae were typical of the breed indeed that they were the lords of the whole people i had fallen into this trap and that morning on the sequana i realized that i knew almost nothing of the keltoi collam was no more like detorix than detorix was like tara briseis and euphoria and aristides and i are all greek and yet four more different people could not be imagined one wants to typify a people but they are always too diverse to be typified at any rate collam began to ask questions and gwan hesitated to answer and i began to suspect that collam was going to injure or kill gwan on the spot whats the problem i asked gwan went on talking to collam i stepped in between them speak to me i said he is angry because my father had no right he says my father had no right gwan was on the edge of tears collam was shouting his charioteer had his hand on the knife at his belt i put a hand on collams arm tell him ill fix it i said collam looked at me he says what business is it of yours warriors are all alike in too many ways most of those ways are dark but not all gwan are you my man or do you serve the venetiae i asked gwan met my eye yours my lord then tell collam that i say gwan is my man i will see to his fathers debt i offered collam my hand collam listened he took two or three deep breaths and took my hand i thanked the gods that i had just given him a small fortune in tin it had to sway him he had to accept that i was an aristocrat like him not a venal river trader he drove away in his chariot and i doubled the guard and told seckla and herodikles to hurry the loading and i took gwan aside youd better give this to me straight i said gwan shrugged im supposed to leave you at the first portage he said that would be tonight or tomorrow night and then what i pressed my fathers people will put together a caravan of donkeys and horses to go across the hills to the next river he said he shrugged i dont know what happens next but i can guess he looked miserable i think they will ambush you in the hills or perhaps he shook his head perhaps my people will ambush you i nodded i think you should come with me all the way to marsala take a share of the profits and come back and buy your fathers freedom i looked into his blue eyes you really think your people want to fight me and two hundred of my men i asked he shook his head when we had most of our boats loaded a pair of heavy wagons came down to the waterside and two chariots collam leaped off the lead chariot as it drove by and landed cleanly on his feet he was a pleasure to watch and i would have liked to wrestle with him the wagons were full of barrels and the barrels were his gift to me we had twelve big casks and each weighed as much as a pig of tin i laughed embraced him and told him through gwan that gwan would go with me to marsala and return rich enough to retrieve his fathers debts to the venetiae in effect i involved collam in an alliance to preserve gwans honour and my convoy collam shook my hand again and through gwan told me that fifty horsemen had crossed his lands the night before and that as far as he knew brach was gone fifty horsemen i laughed theyll need a lot of help i said collam offered me twenty warriors but i patted his shoulder and told him not to worry we swapped belts there on the shore it was a little like living in the iliad and then we were away into the late morning poling hard upstream gwan usually rode ahead but i kept him by me the best way to avoid temptation is to avoid temptation in fact and i sent seckla who was a brilliant rider to lead a dozen other men who could run ive already said that the sequana runs like a snake a few men running and resting can easily pace a convoy of boats it was midafternoon when we ran out of water there were good landing stages this was the point from which the venetiae transshipped their own cargoes a big town stood there well fortified with heavy palisades and a stone socle under the timber ramparts gwans father was a minor lord in these parts but the men who were to form our donkey train didnt seem to be part of a conspiracy the animals were already assembled and they had panniers sewn to hold the big pigs of tin there were eighty animals in the train with forty men to handle them the whole assemblage cost us four pigs of tin in the town which was both smelly and quite marvellous i found a gem a goldsmith whose skill while barbaric was still very fine i traded him a small amount of our gold for a pair of arm rings such as the local gentry wore i liked them and i needed to wear my status it is often that way when you are among foreigners in boeotia they would know who i was even if i was naked and covered in soot from the smithy in gaul i needed a pair of heavy gold arm rings herodikles mocked me for turning barbarian but i think the arm rings stood us all in good stead we drank wine ate well and a day later we were away in any place we lingered we spent too much i had almost one hundred and eighty men and they cost me an amount of gold equal to the size of your little finger every day just to keep in food and wine let me put it this way we took a rich treasure from the phoenicians and two hundred slaves the treasure every ounce of it about paid for the food it had been the same when i served with miltiades there isnt much economy to piracy on the other hand without two hundred hungry men with an absolute loyalty to me i doubt that wed ever have got so much tin over the hills at any rate we enjoyed agedinca gwan was feasted and through him seckla and gaius and i met the lords of the senones the people who controlled the upper valley of the sequana they were rich in good farmland and in the possession of the trade route and their halls were full of armour and magnificent plates and cups their women wore more jewellery than persian princesses we camped well outside of town and we rotated a guard of forty men on our camp by now every former slave had a sword a helmet a spear or two and a shield and i drilled them myself teaching them the dances of ares each day i had two reasons for my care first that they might fight well if we had to fight and second to keep them busy they were oarsmen and they had every reason to be bored when our donkey train was ready to cross the hills the king of the senones came to see us off he admired my warriors and offered me a hundred more men i bowed respectfully and refused them i didnt want to have to trust him he shrugged the aedui are our enemies he said they often attack the tin trains be wary gwan nodded after we had started up the valley he rode up to me we had twodozen horses and pointed up the pass if the venetiae are going to ambush you he said they wont do it themselves theyll pay someone to attack you the aedui are the obvious choice they attack trains all the time and yet the king said nothing of the fifty horsemen i noted gwan looked away he is my cousin gwan said but not a friend to me or to my father i think perhaps he takes your tin to build your train and takes silver from the venetiae to allow your train to be ambushed gaius said if thats so then the baggagehandlers and the teamsters will all desert or attack us gwan shook his head that would be hard to work out he said i wanted to trust gwan but there was a barrier between us deeper than the cultural divide i truly wished that i had daud or sittonax with me leukas was alban and too far removed from the politics if i may call them that of the gauls leukas distrusted gwan all the time leukas was also jealous of gwans continuing success with every maiden i use the term loosely on the river people are very complicated men told me that it was six days over the hills to lugdunum the town at the head of the rhodanus river that flows into the inner sea the first night in the hills it was cold and men pulled their cloaks tight around them and lay closer to other men or built their fires higher we had camped at a traders campsite so it was stripped of all useful wood you can bet i sent fifty men off into the hills for wood and another ten armed men to watch them we built big fires and shivered and gaius and i went from fire to fire reminding men that we were ten days from marsala and the inner sea to encourage them that if we had to fight it would be worth doing at a fire one of the original crew of the lydia asked me what the shares of the tin would be it was a fair question and one that had occupied me wed started as a halfdozen men with a dream we were coming home with more than a hundred freed slaves only sixteen men had died on the whole trip through accident quarrels and apollos arrows and the men who were almost home had begun to wonder what they might receive and of course the men who had started from marsala thought they were more worthy than the men who had been rescued from slavery gian told me pointblank that the former slaves now had their freedom that was their share and weapons shouted another marsalian shepherd greed theyd been like brothers when we were rowing for our lives in the fog but ten days from home i assured everyone that the shares would be fair there was probably some halftruth to my statement because i had yet to think of a simple logical mathematical solution but the mere promise that there would be a payout was enough the hills were magnificent greener and more heavily wooded than hills in greece i thought they were quite high until we climbed over the summit of the second pass and arrived at a mighty hill fort set at the top of a rocky crag and surrounded by stone walls built like any fortress wall in the ionian sea it was a puzzle of giant rocks as if the whole wall had been built by titans from those heights i could see a range of mountains to the east that rose like jagged teeth i had never seen mountains so high even on the coast of asia they were breathtaking at least in part because they were so far away the senones all told me they were the alps the hill fortress was a capital of the aedui but they offered us no violence in fact the lord of the place i forget his name told me that a greek had designed his walls and taught his people to build them i thought about what it would be like to be working so far from home it cost me a whole pig of tin to feed my people across the hills they had their own gold and silver here they wanted tin and then we were down the other side of the pass down the path into the high valleys of the cares river fewer farms and more trees my pig of tin had purchased more than just food it purchased six more horses and some information and i was aware that there were fifty horsemen ahead of me on the road north of lugdunum where the cares flows into the rhodanus we marched down the valley and i saw the sparkle and sundazzle of helios on naked steel and i knew i trusted my senones by then they didnt seem shifty enough to be traitors and they laughed a lot and drank hard it is difficult for a greek to distrust such men despite which i had a former oarsman stand with every senone in the train and then we all armoured ourselves you may say that i was broadcasting to the ambush that we knew they were there i was why fight if they wanted to slip away into the hills i wanted to let them my guides and my drovers swore we were a day from the navigable waters of the rhodanus i didnt want to fight in fact all i wanted to do was to get home the charms of travel and exploration had faded i was beginning to feel old in fact i was thirty years old that autumn and the age of it was in my bones i watched the hills and the steel moved but it did not disperse whoever was up there had enough men to fight my two hundred when we were armed i sent my dozen horsemen to scout as an aside greeks are not much good as scouts greek cavalry tend to fight other greek cavalry its like any other greek contest and the losers dont go back to tell their friends what happened i can tell you but secklas people have different notions of scouting and seckla led his boys down the valley and across the fields on a long sweep while i got my train organized and pushed my main body of spearmen out in front of it i left eighty men with the senones a fine reserve and at the same time a good baggage guard my other hundred pushed forward in a line four men deep a small shallow phalanx that nonetheless covered the train behind them they werent closed tight the ground was far too broken but they were close enough to support each other ebbing and flowing around the patches of woods and rocks like a stream of hoplites seckla sprang the trap if it could be called a trap he encountered a blocking force at a small bridge and rode away before they could throw javelins at him then found one of the flank forces moving along some hedges to the right he rode back to me as we closed on the low stone bridge he pointed sixty men at the bridge lightly armed at least a hundred to the right in the woods those horsemen must be somewhere but theres no dung on the road and no horse signs to the right friends thats a scouting report honest factual and terse i had put demetrios in charge of the baggage train and i took command of the phalanx myself with gaius and gian as my deputies i got them all together quickly were going right over the bridge i said well smash them and move across and then the spearmen will switch from advance guard to rearguard while the train moves as fast as they can well be out of their reach before their flanks can close on us i pointed at the bad going the fallow fields the marsh on our right dont lose your nerve just keep going my only worry is that they have more men in ambush on the other side of the stream seckla thats your part as soon as we clear the bridge ride through and look down the road everyone got it everyone did i rode to the head of the phalanx dismounted and gave my horse to my boy philoi i shouted you are better men and you are better armed see the men by the bridge we will sweep them aside like a woman sweeps dust off the floor and then we will go home they roared i was glad that they were roaring because my stomach was somersaulting like a landed fish my quick count was that the enemy i had to assume they were the enemy had three hundred warriors and another fifty cavalry odds of three to two sound heroic but in a small fight a few men are an enormous advantage the ground was passable for cavalry hardly ideal but fifty saka archers could have destroyed my whole force luckily gaulish noblemen dont use bows ares be praised i took my place in the ranks and raised my spear lets go i said and like miltiades at marathon i called lets run we ran at them the entire time i held my command meeting and gave my little speech the men on the right flank had been moving forward cautiously it is a thing men do they sort of pretend to cling to cover even after they have been discovered my archers the same men who performed the role on board ship but without doolas magnificent archery began to drop shafts among the more confident men on the right i dont think they hit a man but they slowed the right flank of the ambush to a literal belly crawl we ran forward to the bridge the aedui were in a shield wall about forty men with javelins big shields a few wellarmoured men in front gaius and i took the centre of our spearmen into them and our flank men went right down into the stream and up the other side in spring im sure the stream was full and the bridge was required but in midautumn all they lost was their close order as they poured over the streambed i didnt have time to watch i ran forward and despite the old wound in my leg i flew when i reached the aedui shield wall it was just me and gaius we had never really fought together perhaps we sought to impress one another but neither of us would give a step and neither of us slowed and so we hurtled straight into their ranks i got my aspis up and forward onto the spears and i let them slow me and then i leaped as high as i could and threw my spear hard into the front rank and came down without getting a spear in my foot or knee or head alive in other words gaius must have thrown a pace farther out because a man fell and for a moment their ranks rippled i put my shoulder into the back of my aspis as i landed head down and my impetus slammed a man back even as i got my kopis out of the scabbard the long swords the gauls used only hampered them this close i know because one rang off my helmet immediately i was in their ranks moving among them slashing right and left i doubt i killed a man but ill wager i hit six in as many heartbeats and about then the rest of my spearmen hit their shield wall and they folded they began to break from the front not the back and suddenly they were dead men just like that let me say we outnumbered them four to one and we had every advantage terrain flanks depth and armour but their shield wall couldnt hold two of us it is a difference in attitude eh as many persians would have killed us hmm or perhaps not eh i burst out through the back of their shallow line and my flankers were climbing the bank and i was almost across the low bridge to the right a hundred men or more were coming at the flank of the tin train it would be close whether they got to it or it got across the bridge to the left the river guarded my flank or so i thought but when i looked there were fifty armoured horsemen swimming the river the same low water that had allowed me to cross the streambed well i can be a fool sometimes and my spearmen were running the gauls down and killing them instead of stopping to rally oh for a hundred real soldiers even real pirates men in victory are as irrational as men in defeat only a veteran knows the truth that its not over until it is over seckla hadnt crossed yet i held up a hand and stopped him if theres an ambush the spearmen will find it i said stop the horsemen and take the archers seckla nodded and rode off and i ran in armour damn it back to the donkey train they were trotting along the road demetrios was at their head move i roared move i looked to the right the archers lofted another volley and hit not one but two aedui warriors and the rest fell on their faces my archers turned and followed seckla and the aedui rose to their feet and came forward slowly at first and then with more spirit i had been far too confident panicked men do not make good animalhandlers panicked men lead to panicked animals and panicked animals run in all directions in a matter of heartbeats an easy victory had become a disaster my train didnt cross the bridge it ran off away from the charging aedui and towards the river a donkey with an eightypound ingot of tin doesnt run all that well but it will run as fast as it can the horsemen were almost across the archers were starting to engage them the range was close and the archers had time and felt safe at least for the moment horses and men began to die behind me the aedui from the bridge were dying but my precious spearmen had run too far all but alexandross marines and maybe a dozen others i could have screamed in my frustration even gaius had run off after the aedui gwan i could see his gaulish gear was beside him halfway down the valley on the other hand when the animals broke for the river the eighty men in reserve ceased to matter as baggage guards thats how it goes demetrios i called he did not look like a great warrior he wasnt very tall and his helmet looked several sizes too big face to the right i called i ran to his men id like to say that the enemy didnt expect us to abandon our tin but they were not under anyones control either at this point i put myself at the head of demetrioss baggage guards and we charged the aedui on foot who had been pricked by the archers and crawled across the marsh a few of them died but the rest chose to run evading our short charge and running back into the marsh there were some desultory spear casts from both sides i needed a decisive result i wasnt going to get one hold them here i said to demetrios and ran panting now with effort back to my marines and giannis and a few comrades follow me i spat i ran down the slope towards the river the cavalrymen were trying to kill seckla and seckla was refusing to be drawn into a fight and the archers were running around trying to stay alive and occasionally launching a shaft i only had six archers and they were the balance of the fight the cavalrymen didnt seem to know that though phokis one of the former slaves and a fine archer died from a chance javelin throw but he was one of the few at any rate i charged fifty cavalrymen with twenty infantry i didnt have a spear to throw it was foolishness they were brilliant horsemen as good as persians and one of them saw me and all by himself he turned out of the chase for seckla and rode at me i should have stopped running but i didnt i ran right at him he was grinning he had a scale shirt down to his thighs a fine helmet and two javelins he threw one just before he reached me it bounced off the face of my aspis and then i sidestepped and his horse sidestepped he struck with his javelin hitting me in the head my sword licked out and caught his leg and then he was past me and i was alive i shook my head and the eagle fell off a dozen more of their cavalrymen turned now eager to emulate their fellow and he was circling wide behind me coming back for another try form on me i croaked and set my feet i remember praying to heracles and feeling like a fool i had come all this way and i was losing my train of tin and perhaps my life or my freedom i gritted my teeth a dozen cavalrymen may not sound like much after all i was a hero of marathon i had faced down a hundred persian noblemen the finest horsemen in the circle of the world but the gauls were man for man marvellous horsemen perhaps the equals of the persians and they were fresh delighted to be fighting dangerous men on welltrained horses i was tired and defeat has its own fatigue and we were losing behind me the aedui infantry were gaining courage and working their way forward far to the south i could see gaiuss etruscan feathers waving on the brows of his helmet he was rallying my phalanx he would only be ten minutes late in time perhaps to rescue my corpse my marines and some shepherds pressed in around me spears up i remember roaring theres a belief that horses wont face a spear point or a wellordered host of men i dont know perhaps it becomes true at some point if the host is wide enough certainly ive seen five hundred athenians turn the charge of the very best of the persian noble cavalry the horses turning away before a single man had died but the gauls trained their horses differently the gauls came at us in no particular order but one man on a beautiful white horse was in front and he came at me at a dead gallop and when he was a few horselengths away i realized that he was not slowing down and that i was literally trapped between my comrades so naturally i leaped out and charged him what would you do i got my aspis up no low blows from a horseman i was on the cavalrymans bridlehand side so he had to cut crossbody at me and i took his blow on my sword held high over my head across my aspis face and i let the blow roll off my blade like rain falling off a temple roof turned my hand and struck it was a short blow but i had plenty of fear to power it and he had no armour on his thighs and then the next horseman hit me in the back and i went down my cuirass took the blow but i went face down over my aspis and i stunned myself on the rim of my own shield a horse kicked me as i fell right on the point of the hip i thought id got a spear through my armour i assumed i was dead i was down and the pain was intense and when i tried my legs they didnt work my legs didnt work i dont know how long i lay there i was conscious but i had taken two bad blows and a light ring to my head and i had every reason to think i was ravens food then a riderless horse came pounding across the ground at me and without conscious thought i rolled myself over to avoid it with my legs thought is action i got my feet under me and powered to an upright position my sword was lying there my helmet had twisted on my head i remember standing there on a stricken field unable to decide which i should do first retrieve the sword fix the helmet aye laugh if you like pain and fatigue and desperation make you stupid my marines had scattered giannis helped me get myself together six of the gauls cavalrymen were down and seckla was leading the others in a merry dance suddenly we were in a stalemate a stasis i muttered to giannis and he began shouting for the men to come to me other men pointed at me demetrios had all of the reserve together and they came to me in a block the aedui infantry were still hesitant my archers were in a patch of brush down by the water and they were carefully loosing at the bolder gaulish horsemen they didnt hit many men but they hit a great many horses and the gauls are tender on their horses when i went down we were losing when i got up we werent wars like that i made a good plan and it failed the enemy plan was foolish and it nearly succeeded but now we had some advantages so i ignored that dull metallic ache in my hip and i picked up a fine gaulish spear and pointed it down the field at the riverbank where our donkeys and horses were pinned by a handful of mounted gauls theres our tin friends i said arimnestos shouted giannis i thought he was trying to get my attention but demetrios shouted it too in a moment a hundred men were bellowing my name as if it were a war cry im not ashamed to say i almost burst into tears and when we charged i had the feeling that old feeling that i was invincible thats the daimon of combat thugater one moment you think you are dead and the next you are full of of piss and vinegar ready for anything ive seen a few defeats but far more victories and men die in defeat faster than they do in victory we slammed into them no thats a lie friends we ran at them and most of them ran from us into the river the men chasing sekla were cut off well up the ridge to our right and in a few moments we were all around our pack animals the stubborn panic of the average donkey is a twoedged sword they ran from us but they werent going to tamely submit to our enemies either if men hadnt died it would have been like comedy thugater wed run around in all directions our bandit enemies had largely run around us and now they were running away im not sure if that counts as a battle or not we lost nine men dead and badly wounded and the worst part was killing off our own wounded garun a marsalian fisherman whos been with me since i poured bronze for the ramspur and others just as good or just as deserving of life but when a man has a spear right through his guts so that the head comes out the back best he have brave friends the aedui infantry on our side of the stream faded the moment it became clear that their noble cavalry wasnt going to fight we took eight of them too tired men who didnt have the muscles to run away the enemy had about thirty dead and wounded and twenty captured a dozen of the captured were cavalrymen they couldnt cross the gully to freedom and gaius closed the bridge and demetrios and i worked with sekla to herd them into a circle they were mostly very young men and all the fight had gone out of them and i think theyd have surrendered sooner except that they got the idea we were going to execute them did they think we were fools we used them as hostages of course we sent the youngest a boy of seventeen up the ridge to tell his lord that we had them and then we made camp we spend two hours on our ditch and our abatis and then we collapsed in exhaustion a fight even an easy fight takes it out of you and the affray at the bridge on the rhodanus was a sharp fight with a bad bit the next morning we rose and packed our animals carefully and marched with a strong advance guard twenty men after all wed captured a dozen horses and we now had a dozen men in fine scale shirts by evening we were camping within bowshot of the walls of ludunca the town had hundreds of timber houses and some dozens of stone houses as well as four temples and a stone outer wall we paid a fine for camping in someones field gwan and his senones unpacked the donkeys and the horses and the carts and turned them around for home their part was done at ludunca all of our tin was loaded onto barges these werent made of a single tree trunk like those on the sequaana these were made of planks as few as three very wide planks or as many as nine the sides were formed of single heavy planks that fitted perfectly to the strakes of the bottom again the boats were designed to take the standard barrels but could also hold our pigs of tin vasilios was fascinated he told us all several times that the way they built boats depended on the available timber he was especially impressed with the way the galles used iron nails to clench the timbers to cross supports very alien to the greek construction method but very strong he showed me one in particular that impressed me the floor of a particularly large and heavy barge had cross beams to support the side of the boards and to keep them together these boards had holes drilled in them and then in the supports and pegs of oak were driven into those holes and then iron nails were driven into the pegs forcefully expanding them against the wood around them the result was watertight and as strong as well as iron and oak we loaded for marsala even while we negotiated with the local aedui for the release of our hostages they were all important young men not the infantry no one even wanted them back but the horsemen in the end i released them all for a pound of gold and some casks of ale i dont think ive mentioned that we figured out that callum had traded us twelve casks of bees wax for a pig of tin i had no idea if that was a fair trade but people had begun to make offers on the bees wax already without doola i was helpless to guess the value demetrios said it would trade well in many places because it was so clear and white i have to smile i had a picture in my head of arimnestos the killer of men standing in front of a group of unwed maidens perhaps at the temple of artmeis at brauron i was holding up a ball of pure white beeswax and telling them that it was the very thing to use on their best white linen thread well i think its funny the trip down river from ludunca was uneventful we reached the inner sea at the old phoneician port at arla im not ashamed to say that i threw myself down on the beach and kissed the sand and the water i was not alone we ran up and down the beach and then we ran again until the running became a kind of celebration the boatmen were cautious about the edge of the sea but they got their barges all the way along the coast to massalia almost one hundred stades poling along the beaches it is a protected part of the sea but it seemed dangerous to me perhaps because i had been through so much that i feared the loss of everything at the very end but one fine day in late autumn just the edge of winter with a bitter wind blowing out of the west and a chill in the air that could make a man ill we sighted tarsilla people came down to the waters edge and we landed on the beach landed our pigs of tin our little remaining silver our bees wax gallish wine hides and all we moved them all into vasilioss shed that he had used to protect our ship when he was building it we had a feast on the beach and the next day we celebrated the feast of dionysus in style with wine and song and even a play done by one of the teams of actors from massalia two more days and demetrios of phokia arrives with sixty men and a pair of oxen to kill and gave another feast for our return we spent two days telling him of our travels he spent both days telling us of war with carthage carthage had struck at sicily in our absence and not just sicily the carthaginians were using force to get absolute mastery of all the trade routes in the western inner sea carthage had been involved in wars on sardinia for fifty years and had squandered armies and fleets attempting to dominate the stiff necked peoples of the island by the time telesinus was archon in athens carthage had at last dominated the sardana and was now attempting to use her new ports to attack greek colonies like massalia and syracusa but the greek world had not stood still during the year i had been away gelon the tyrant of gela and naxos had seized power in syracusa that was news i knew a sicilian greek aristocrat named gelon in fact i had enslaved him it couldnt be the same man the sicilian tyrant had never been any mans slave but i wondered if my gelon had made it home at any rate gelon the tyrant was unifying the greek cities of sicily and magna greca against carthage not everyone joined him rich cities like himera on sicily and reggium in southern italy chose to remain independent really it was the ionian revolt played out in miniature it had been going on for years as one or another greek state rose to prominence and led the resistance against carthage and was conquered or bought off another would come but gelon of gela a right bastard if dionysius the phocaean was to be believed had at least achieved the building of an alliance i wondered what his conquest of syracusa meant we were lying on the beach it was still warm enough to be outside with a bonfire eating beef and lobster dionysius the phocaean was licking his teeth there is no side i want he said i dont want the carthaginians to enslave me and gelon is a horror he enslaved half of the free population of syracusa you know that my blood ran cold women children sold off or put in brothels men made into oarsmen or forced labour on farms gelon wont allow a lower class a thetis class claims they destabilize the state he insists hell have only aristocrats and slaves like sparta dionysius picked his teeth and looked at me i dont like either side i lay on my straw paliase using a metal pick to get the meat out of the body of a lobster and drinking wine i owe carthage something im of a mind to trade my share of the tin take a ship while i have a crew a fighting crew i paused i hadnt been aware that this was my intention but suddenly it was i nodded but first im going to have demetrios here go sell the tin while i go back and find my friends i said doola daud sittonax alexandros theyre probably right behind us on the road and i owe something to young gwan there winter will close the passes demetrios said and i wont be selling any tin this winter either as if to prove him right a cold gust of wind blew down off the mountains at our backs part iii massalia even more should we deserve the ridicule of men if having before us the example of the phocaeans who to escape the tyranny of the great king left asia and founded a new settlement at massilia we should sink into such abjectness of spirit as to submit to the dictates of those whose masters we have always been throughout our history isocrates archidamus i didnt go anywhere that winter i sat in massalia with my smithy and a supply of tin the other bronze smiths envied and cast a pair of light rams carefully designed and carefully cast according to my own theories around the headland at tarsilla vasilios laid down the keel for a trieres she would carry one hundred seventytwo oarsmen and each oarsmen would have a dactyl over two cubits in which to breathe i had copper and i had tin and i traded dionysius a competed ram for all the timber i told the oarsmen that i would need them in the spring and that the payoff for the tin adventure would happen at the spring feast of demeter gaius stayed the winter with me he disdained working in the forge but he would sit in a chair and chat with me while i worked which made the time pass pleasantly enough winter passed slowly it was interesting the experience of being rich some men were jealous and some were openly admitting it of course i had two hundred clients in the form of the former slave oarsmen the marines the shepherds and the fishermen none of them seemed to want to go back to work piracy has many ills and the greatest may be that when you teach a hardworking boy that he can steal and kill for gold he may feel that hauling nets is dull and there was an element of comedy to my riches after all the tin ingots were still stacked in the warehouse and before midwinter when one of the ingots showed signs of the tin illness we brought them into the house wed built and kept them warm which seemed to help you probably dont know about tin blight tin when it gets cold and wet can develop an illness like wheat it grows a white mould and once the mould spreads the metal can be ruined indeed if you leave the tin long enough one day youll walk in and find your fortune in tin is nothing but a small pile of white dust this was one of the reasons smiths couldnt build up stores of tin as a smith i knew a few tricks i knew to run over the outside of the pigs with flax tow and pork fat i knew to keep them warm but i spent my winter in a constant anxiety about the tin and that wasnt my only anxiety again my riches were more apparent than real we had some gold the ransom of the gaul aristocrats the gold we took all the way back in iberia but it was only really enough to pay for food and wine for the oarsmen who remained it was the rumour of our wealth in tin that made us rich some men thought we had thousands of mythemnoi of tin other men thought wed discovered a new source all ascribed to us an almost heroic level of wealth as the winter wore on and i worked in my shop in massalia i began to fear what those rumours might sound like out on the great blue somewhere i feared that men just like me were hearing of the fabulous wealth wed won and were fingering their swords after the midwinter festivals i laid out the rest of my hoard to have my oarsmen build a pair of towers down by the beach and i put the word out in massalia that i was looking for archers massalia isnt a big town at most there are a thousand free men with their families another thousand slave men or perhaps a little more and then another few hundred gauls mostly jobbing labourers or craftsmen while there are caravan guards working the tin trade and the wine trade there arent enough professional soldiers in the town to make a company and when i enquired around the wine houses for more archers most men shook their heads archery isnt all that popular among the gauls in fact as dionysius said one evening on a kline in my townhouse i already had the biggest body of soldiers in the town he didnt sound jealous his new ship massalia was being built in a stone ship shed down by the beach he was planning to go to sea to prey on the phoenicians and to protect the massalian trade increasingly as winter passed and we talked i was of a mind to join him but only after id found doola who i hoped and prayed was wintering with his wife somewhere on the other side of the alps spring came late after a great deal of rain my new ship which i called lydia despite some superstitious qualms was taking shape but demetrioss new merchantman sikel herakles was almost complete we were standing on the beach in the rain looking at the hulls ill take her to sea as soon as shes ready demetrios said he licked his lips as a boy does when a girl shows a bit of thigh or breast sorry girls these things happen and im sure they are all errors eh with the tin i asked he nodded quietly where do you plan to sell it i asked syracusa or just possibly rome he shrugged id like to have doola back id like you to wait for me i said seventy pigs of tin a rich prize for a pirate and everyones had the winter to hear of our success i shook my head please wait for me he narrowed his eyes i was trading these waters before i ever knew you i said we looked at each other listen i said im not telling you im asking doola will want to be here for the sale he has contacts he understands things i paused i could tell i was going the wrong way i was trading tin when you were off being a pirate in the east he said and because im an excellent pirate i want you to consider that in every little port on the inner sea men like me are gathering over cheap wine and entertaining themselves with stories of how arimnestos of plataea and his friends went and got a thousand mythemnoi of tin i shrugged do what you like demetrios its as much yours as mine i know its as much mine as yours demetrios said quietly do you i crossed my arms whats that supposed to mean equal shares for the seven of us and all your oarsmens pay comes out of your share they arent my men they dont work for me he spat they dont get a dactyl of my tin to say i was taken aback wouldnt do justice to my feelings we wouldnt have any tin without them i said he shrugged says you demetrios i shouted what we swore by zeus and heracles dont be like this we need everyone together to decide on the shares he turned away doola and the others are dead why do you think so i asked him following him along the beach if they were alive they would be here he kept walking it is you and me and gaius and seckla but gaius and seckla are your men not my friends riches the root of all evil if you ask me so i spent the winter worrying about doola and daud and alexandros and the rest and about pirates taking my treasure and tin blight and friendship not the best winter i also looked for love and found nothing i bought a slave girl i fancied and she was temperamental anxious ill used and mostly not very interested in what i purchased her for her name was dais and she was iberian and she hated my pais and he hated her and she was jealous of everyone in my life and at the same time demanding and lazy she had a beautiful body she had been badly treated i felt for her i caught her slashing her arms with my bronze razor once i had enough to worry about nor did i feel that by freeing her id do her any favour she couldnt take care of herself before the winter was over i hauled her by the ear down to the market and sold her to a temple priest chastity was better than dais the rains came and went and in late spring well after the first feasts of demeter i gathered my archers and marines sixteen men and we bought good horses and headed up the coast to arla i left gaius with demetrios and that was a hard parting demetrios had left our shared house and moved in with a sikel slave woman hed bought and he was making it fairly clear that we were not friends he was openly offensive to seckla and cautious with gaius tilla his slave woman was just as difficult as he she seemed to feel we were all in a state of near war perhaps this is a sikel thing but she wouldnt unbar their door when i came to say goodbye she shouted that she knew id come to kill her by zeus i was angry i went to embrace vasileos he and gaius were laying down another keel gaius had decided to order another trireme before mine was even complete he was going to go home a rich and powerful man if he could find oarsmen vasileos heard my tale about tilla and shook his head she is a witch he said she has turned demetrios into a very small man and now she seeks to poison him against the rest of us i shrugged its the tin ive seen this with soldiers and pirates enough money makes men go mad vasileos shrugged your ship will be ready when you return gaius hugged me ill watch demetrios as my little cavalcade rode out of town i happened to see demetrios watching from the window of his house so the bastard had been home by comparison with tarsilla life on the trail was easy pleasant and adventurous the wet early spring had given way to an early summer and the ground was dry we had two horses for every man i had seckla of course and giannis and megakles the eldest of the fishermen who had made the voyage with us and who showed no inclination to go back to his nets he was old to be a soldier well over forty and not much of a fighter but he was one of those men who can do or fix almost anything and he was unbelievably tough he never complained about rations never minded the weather and never minded work if i dont mention him often its because he seldom spoke but he had a smile a wonderful smile when he was happy and a slightly ironic smile when he felt that someone wasnt pulling their weight his entire ethical system seemed to revolve around how much work a man did he seemed to think highly of me but he wasnt above mutely handing me a sharp knife and a lot of raw pork with a silent look that said hey dont be a pompous fuck do some work a very expressive look for one small smile and a slightly raised eyebrow the first night we stayed on a farm west of tarsilla the second night we were in massalia drinking wine with dionysius he wished us luck and despite some hard heads we were away in the dark picking our way across the tracks to arla going up the ridges past the shepherds and into the high hills it only took us two days to make arla and i truly hoped i dont know why to find doola there or some rumour of him after arla we became a war band we rode every day in formation with three scouts well in front a main body a rearguard twenty men in armour on horseback is a lot of men in the high country behind arla the greek homesteaders feared us and the gauls barred their doors we slept in the open and when it rained we were wet several of my marines had taken gaul scale shirts anchises one of dionysius men from lade and his brother darius and what an unpopular name that must have been during the ionian revolt when we had been on the trail a week they were in despair over their shirts which were turning brown despite relatively good weather what you need is a dozen slaves apiece to keep you polished i said megakles showed them how to use ash tow and olive oil to polish iron but the amount of work involved staggered them living outdoors is a different skill from sailing on ships horse care all by itself can become a fulltime job every man had two horses and they had to be curried blanketed picketed out and fed every night and curried and fed in the morning and being horses we had one down sick before we left massalia and another lame at arla between maintaining armour cooking food and caring for horses every one of us was fully employed from dawn to dark horses really if there was only a way to live without them they dont love me and i dont love them im a passable rider and a passable charioteer too i was trained to chariots in my youth as some of you may remember and i love the look of horses but may poseidon forgive me im a bad aristocrat because mostly i think theyre the stupidest animals that a man has to deal with every day unless he herds sheep what other animal will run off a cliff eh at any rate we were five days going north up the valley of the rhodanus river to lugdunum and another two days there in a fine house that took travellers a large stone house with its own stables where thirty merchants could eat sleep and rest despite excellent weather ten days travel had tired us out we had a spot of trouble in lugdunum the second night there seckla and i went out to a wine shop to drink we were unarmed because the town was well governed and the aedui lords didnt allow men to wear arms openly we were on our third bowl of the excellent local wine when a group of young sprigs came and sat on the trestles it was all openair there were twenty men and a few women all sitting under the vines one of them a curly blond in purple trousers kept looking at me and glaring he had gold earrings and was heavily muscled a lord almost too late i figured out how i knew him id cut him out of his saddle and sold him back to his father thats how i knew him i cant remember his name he and his friends began the usual way looking at us and laughing now thugater i was no longer eighteen in fact that year i was thirty years old my blood didnt seem any cooler and yet a group of gaulish boys catcalling from an adjacent table didnt spark me to violence the way it might once have done seckla on the other hand began to flush under his dark skin i put my hand on his lets just drink and go i said we didnt have weapons and this was an aedui town but purple trousers couldnt let go and when we rose to leave he got up and blocked our way to the outside he said something and all his friends laughed i assume he thought i didnt speak any keltoi but of course i did he made a statement about what i did with seckla i laughed i suspect he alleged what seckla might himself have preferred if you take my meaning and again among greeks its not a killing insult but i suppose it is among gauls which is funny all by itself then the man turned to face me and his face was already transformed that look men have when they switch from rational creatures to animals and his fist went back and there was a dagger in it i caught his dagger hand in my left thumb down and i broke his arm and took the dagger and i punched him six or seven times until i broke his nose all the while clutching his broken right arm in an elbow lock he slumped and i kicked him hard i looked at his friends in gaulish i said he attacked me with a dagger next man i kill they followed us into the street and down the street and to our lodgings gathering friends as they went about an hour later they got torches our landlord was none too happy and sent for the lords of the town who sent a dozen warriors and the archon whatever they called him ordered me to pay a fine of twenty silver coins about fifteen athenian drachma when i explained in my not very good keltoi that i had been attacked he just shrugged so i paid gwan didnt play any part in this because as a senone he was only going to make trouble here we rode out the next day followed by thirty or so aedui gentry but we had food two horses to a man and pack animals and they didnt and if they wanted a fight i wasnt interested we took the west road over the passes toward rhodumna and the upper senones country and we outdistanced them easily but i began to wonder how i was going to get back now i hoped to find doola in every town and village when we reached the limits of the senones country i sent gwan and his two retainers out ahead to arrange food and to scout and ask around but by the time wed been twenty days on the trail and we rode our tired horses across the divide and down into agedinca we hadnt seen or heard any rumour of them and a black man should have been easy to find in gaul two days later we guested with collam and i brought him some persian saffron and some pepper from the beach market in massalia he offered to let my little war band stay for some time and he sent riders out to the south and east i passed a very pleasant week we hunted deer and wild boar and i showed him how the greeks hunt rabbit and he laughed himself silly even when i came back with a pair of coneys he was still laughing no gaul aristocrat will do anything on foot if it can be done on horseback and the sight of me running the trails of his forest naked was apparently the very height of gaulish humour summer was coming and the grain was ripening in the fields and all i could think about was the tin and demetrios there was a girl in collams hall well i was quite taken with her she had beautiful big eyes and a wonderful laugh she was by no means a great beauty except in a lithe flatchested sort of way ah i beg your pardon girls but she made the time pass quickly and the enthusiasm with which she opened the pins on her dress and let it fall ah blushes all round i really shouldnt tell these stories i merely want you to see that i was coming back to life in every way im ashamed to say i dont remember her name but she was no slave one of the very finest things about the keltoi is the freedom of their women in that respect theres a great deal the hellenes could learn from them collams son came back from the south with a rumour that there was an early cart train coming up from korbilon which after some talk proved to be a town on the mainland opposite the venetiae islands i was worried that the venetiae might hold a grudge although if youve been listening youll know that we did them no harm but as i have said elsewhere merchants guard their trade routes the way farmers guard their fields dicca as i called the lad told that over the hills men said the cart train was guarded by a black man with magical powers that seemed hopeful sophia that was her name or perhaps that was her name in greek at any rate i was enjoying her and in no hurry to leave once i knew that doola was coming my host had tribal problems a fractious neighbour and gwans father still owed the venetiae and was still a hostage with them collam sat down with me wed been there a full week and perhaps more wed eaten a feast of pork and the wine bowls were passing i was sitting with sophia my arm around her waist the keltoi encouraged such behaviour in public whereas in greece it would have excited comment to say the least collam looked at sophia and nodded be sure you get a boy off him he said she threw back her head and laughed im past all that she said but she smiled at me collam leaned back against the table and twirled his moustaches let me make you a proposition he said dont listen to him sophia said he wants you to fight she grinned and collam frowned i want you to fight collam admitted and tossed the woman a false glare they werent brother and sister i never fully understood their relationship but it was deep he looked back at me listen i can help you and you can help me the venetiae they want to move their goods without paying a toll and my brotherinlaw he paused is willing to make concessions to them concessions he shouldnt be making but they are buying him against the rest of us instead of paying their tolls ahh i said or something equally intelligent hes assembled a strong force he has venetiae cavalry and his own charioteers and several hundred infantry and you want to take him on i said collam nodded hes a rich man far richer than any of us but if the smaller lords band together we can take him and you are a famous warrior and you have twenty warriors at your tail a fine company if you fight beside me ill give gwan any venetiae prisoners to trade for his father i shook my head i didnt really plan to come here and make war i said i need to find doola i wont do anything to annoy the venetiae while doola is still on the river or the road it was a good thing to say but the lord of the biturges had other ideas i suppose he heard that my host was making alliances and causing trouble because genattax of the biturges marched against us with twelve hundred men and he came almost without warning i might have wondered why collam was so glad to see me that spring or why he was so eager to send scouts out to the south in fact his son and his other horsemen were watching every road and path for genattax all spring and my search for doola was merely fortuitous but i wasnt going to ride off and leave collam in the lurch and the rumour was that the black man and his convoy were ten days away maybe less why did things have to be so complicated collam used me as a recruiting tool showing his greek warrior off to his neighbours he had me demonstrate pankration with seckla and sometimes with some unlucky gaulish lad i felt as if i had become some sort of slave prizefighter but by the time genattax came at us over the hills we had a thousand men almost a third of them cavalry seckla was hesitant but the rest of the men were game to fight fighting for strangers can be a testy business you dont really know who can be trusted and theres always the possibility of outandout betrayal but i trusted collam we dismounted and fought with his tribal infantry im not very good at fighting on horseback and i thought that i could do something to stiffen the javelinthrowing peasantry we formed on a hillside with the enemy in full view also forming chaos really men wandered up to the battle and when they formed their phalanx each man chose his own place it was alien and yet somehow familiar after all even in plataea men generally stand beside their brothers and cousins i wanted us to form quickly and attack across the valley while the enemy was still forming but collam laughed at my notions of tactics and said that such a fight would decide nothing so instead both hosts formed and moved carefully down the ridges towards the streambed at the bottom it wasnt very full there was marshy ground to our left and all of our cavalry formed on our right all the enemy cavalry was there too they had more cavalry than we did and more chariots and we had more infantry may i say that war looks a good deal less necessary when you are fighting for strangers as far as i could tell the differences between collam and his brotherinlaw could have been resolved in an hour over a cup of wine perhaps a gaul would have felt the same about datis and miltiades at any rate i didnt feel fired with enthusiasm for the conflict and as morning wore into afternoon i was increasingly aware that the enemys mounted flank outnumbered ours and also overshadowed it as their line went well beyond ours to the right but they wouldnt cross the stream and neither would we i understood why we wouldnt we were outnumbered but they had the numbers and that trickle of water wouldnt have slowed their cavalry after some discussion i found that it was only my ignorance the chariots couldnt cross the river and that meant neither side was anxious to engage well they arent professional warriors they have their own ways and they are after all only barbarians we stood across the stream from them for hours they would chant and our side would chant sometimes a lone man would emerge and bellow a challenge i stood with seckla and watched as the sun began to go down a big man with a red beard emerged from the enemy infantry and whirled his great sword over his head and smacked his shield boss with it i remember thinking why not in fact i dared myself i had never been so close to conflict and felt so little i was afraid afraid i was losing my taste for war i was going to become one of those old men who love babies who knows what i feared i am now an old man and i love babies hah the things young men fear at any rate i kicked off my sandals and walked to the edge of the stream he came down i dont think he was delighted to have his challenge taken up after an afternoon when no challenges had been answered since he hesitated i jumped the stream immediately a great shout went up from our lines and men clattered their spears on their shields and roared he was obviously surprised nor did he have a spear and i did he backed and backed and we began to circle i tried some old tricks to draw and attack but i began to fear that i was dealing with a very experienced warrior he would not be drawn he wanted me to commit to my attack so that he could counter it come inside and hit me with his sword i wasnt sure his strategy was sound i wasnt sure that his long sword could even hurt me through my armour he wore no armour just a silver torque and trousers we circled again and men shouted insults they wanted us to get on with it easy to say when you arent the one facing three feet of keltoi steel and then he crossed his feet a foolish thing to do at any time and dropped his shield just a bit we were ten feet apart and he thought i couldnt hit him i stepped forward and threw my spear he raised his shield and i was already drawing my sword and my spear went in under his shield and into his thigh and he grunted i use heavy spears and the blow went well in and he couldnt get it out he screamed and fell to his knees and of course that hurt him more i carefully pinned his sword hand with my shield dying men are dangerous and cut his head off with my kopis it was a good stroke and he was positioned for it and ares himself held my hand i have cut mens hands off before but i dont think until that moment that i had ever beheaded anything but rams in sacrifice blood fountained out of his neck and his body twitched and fell forward and his eyes blinked from the severed head i swear it it shook me our whole phalanx set up a wild bellow of approval like so many oxen i went and retrieved my spear and then well apparently my interest in war had not waned i started walking towards the enemy send me another hero i shouted the enemy phalanx was not very tightly formed as i have said every man stands where he will and their spacings are not ideal and men who dislike each other leave gaps as do strangers all in all they form at something more like our fusin or normal order not the sunaspismos or close order that a phalanx more typically fights in i walked forward slowly and the men opposite me shuffled back well a young man without a torque came out he was probably someones bondsman and although he was well muscled he didnt know much about using a spear i killed him a tall man with heavy moustaches came out he had a magnificent torque and a shirt of scales and a helmet with a pig on top his shield was long and narrow like two boards together with a long central boss he had a good spear and he crouched like a boxer as he approached me he tried to shieldbash my aspis he hadnt fought a greek before the round face of my shield ate most of his energy and the willow splits resisted the rest and he backed away i stabbed for his feet and got one my spear came away bloody and he roared in pain and leaped i wasnt prepared no one had ever leaped into the air in front of me before and instead of gutting him in the air i ended up slamming my spearhead into his helmet better than nothing but he came down on my shield and we went down in a tangle i went over backwards my legs trapped under me and something snapped very painfully in my right foot as i went down i was under him but he was just barely moving and i had time to get the knife out from under my arm and put it under his chin by heracles my foot hurt when i looked down my toes were swollen id broken it what an inglorious wound the next man was already dismounting from his chariot by greek standards the keltoi have very little sense of honour id put three of theirs down and they just kept sending champions this new one was somebody his men cheered and he had a long shirt of polished scales and a beautiful helmet with eagles wings real ones on either side of his head i got my aspis back on my arm and i sheathed my dagger and my kopis and got my spear back he stood by his chariot and shouted his lineage descended apparently from the war god i was breathing like a horse after a race and he was fresh he picked up his shield hopped once and hurled his spear like zeuss thunderbolt the hop gave him away however and i deflected it with my aspis he reached up and his charioteer handed him another spear and he threw it i began to get angry and his second throw wasnt any more decisive than the first and he reached for a third spear the bucket in the chariot had six you can run on a broken foot really you can i didnt run at him i ran at his horses they wanted to shy but the charioteer held them i killed one heh then i killed the other one then i killed the charioteer he was yelling at me as if id committed some sort of foul kelts dont kill charioteers apparently then i turned and started hunting the lordling his daimon had already left him he tried to keep away from me and he was yelling demanding that i stop that i had broken the laws of a duel at least thats what i think he said eventually when he was pressed almost back to his own foot soldiers he stopped we went shield to shield i used mine with a push of the shoulder to roll his down and i pricked him with my spear i got him but his scales saved him from the worst of it he stabbed at me but i had turned him with my stronger shield and he stumbled away my spear licked out and struck his helmet he stumbled i struck his right foot with my spear he gasped but his shield was still steady as i leaped forward and our shields went crack as we struck at each other my spear went into his throat and his spear rang off my helmet i stumbled back if i had not killed him he would have had me then now their line was backing away from me seckla came across the stream at my back he rightly assessed that i was hurt but he didnt come alone the rest of my men crossed with him and collams infantry although they owed me no loyalty they apparently thought that this was a signal and then began to cross and suddenly our whole line was crossing the stream but the enemy were falling back our cavalry didnt move they sat on their side of the stream and watched our infantry push the biturges up their ridge they began to run the senones leaped forward like hungry wolves gave a bellow and it was over well except for the actual battle the infantry didnt decide keltoi battles cavalry decided keltoi battles the biturges cavalry watched their infantry run and they turned on us i couldnt keep up with the runners my foot hurt too much so i was standing breathing leaning on my spear when the biturges cavalry charged into the senones infantry it was an insanely stupid thing to do they abandoned the streamside and charged our victorious infantry out of loyalty to their own infantry i assume the way collam tells it he couldnt believe his eyes for several long breaths of a man it seemed to good to be true but as the last of the horsemen cantered uphill away from the stream he decided it must be true and he led his cavalry across the stream and that my friends was the end of the battle collam captured half a hundred noble cavalrymen and twenty chariots of course the biturges cavalry had had ten minutes to chew on us and i missed the end because i was lying face down in the grass i missed everything doola came upriver with ten more pigs of tin his wife and twenty barrels of wine as well as three hundred gaulish refugees looking for a new life on the inner sea collam made a treaty with the venetiae on his own terms and traded them six of their merchant aristocrats for gwans father and his debt i was two weeks returning to consciousness and i had headaches and black depression the result a greek doctor told me later of a bad blow to the head i never saw the man who put me down i was alone and a great many of them came for me because of course id downed their champions my recovery was slow i caught something one of apollos arrows that made me drip at both ends and my foot swelled and got purple so that i thought it would have to come off and then i lost more time off my head i think with a fever doola nursed me bless him and his wife i was a hero to the gauls but with so many prisoners so much loot and the trade negotiations i was largely forgotten it was a month before we left even then id lost weight and i could just barely ride and it was doola not me who led us back across the passes to lugdunum we had many parting embraces and declarations of friendship and i had enough golden torques given me to start a collection and in fact gold is always good when doola rode south to find his wife he found oiasso destroyed the villages burned the hall flattened but the people were scarcely touched they simply retreated into the hills the carthaginians encouraged the local iberians to attack again and winter set in with no crops harvested the whole community of oiasso had to depend on relatives in neighbouring communities for food as soon as the hill thawed neoptolymos and alexandros led a hundred men on a counterraid into the mountains and they took flocks and grain and tin doola convinced them that they should pack their belongings and leave it was a fine tale and one that i heard told several times and never fully understood i did learn that tara and her brother died defending their hall that the phoenicians had come back twice and had four ships the second time and five ships the first time they were hunting us doola said we said goodbye to gwan at lugdunum and rode south moving in easy stages i was still recovering and our gaulish horde needed food and rest but it was a fine summer and we had doolas tin to trade illgotten gains from the iberians midsummer saw us at arelata and men said that phoenician ships had been on the coast all summer and there had been raids massalia had been attacked and had repelled the attack my stomach clenched and then rolled no one at arelata knew where tarsilla was but they all agreed that the phoenicians had attacked every town on the coast that was greek at arelata we prepared for the last dash to home we elected to do it by land because everyone at arelata said the coast was too dangerous there were no tin shipments moving into or out of massalia and sittonax and daud were leaving us they had helped get the convoys out to arelata where all of taras people were planning to settle there was good farmland all the way up the hillsides and these were people used to terracing but the last night sittonax and daud both changed their minds daud and i embraced and we both wept a little and then he said fuck it im coming sittonax looked at him as if hed grown an extra head and then shrugged fine he said ill come too so we all drank more wine the next day we offered sacrifices for our own safety and for that of our friends at tarsilla and we headed for home tarsilla was not a smoking ruin we came down the steep ridge behind already aware that the town was safe from our friends among the herdsmen and shepherds but still peering over every hill for a sign the timber temple of apollo was still there the theatre a small one was still there there were ships on the beach i knew lydia as soon as i saw her she was perfect the finest trireme i had ever seen vasileos had outdone himself and her twin sister was next to her gaiuss vessel and although i did not know it at the time she was at that moment just a day old all complete the traditional ceremony just complete the oarsmen sleeping off the festivities under awnings gaius called her iusticia justice demetrioss house was closed and boarded the wine shops certainly looked as if the phoenicians had landed and smashed the town but the rest looked good and our house was secure the main gate closed giannis opened the gate and embraced me and we were home the thing i remember best about that homecoming was doola and seckla doola had brought his wife of course seckla helped her down from her mule and we all knew right there that all was well she smiled at him perfectly aware that this was an important moment then doola went and embraced him seckla cried well lots of us cried but we were home and wed done it we had done it i havent mentioned neoptolymos of course he was with doola he had done great deeds of arms in the south with the vascones and against the iberians and when i recovered from my wounds i found him as big as ever his frame filled out but calmer and happier too he had married a vascone woman brillix who was as much the opposite of the blond illyrian as a human being could be where he was tall and pale she was small and dark he was taciturn and morose and she was cheerful funny endlessly talkative ive heard that opposites attract but brillix was the most opposite i could imagine to my vengeful illyrian friend and she made him better she made him happy happiness is better than revenge nonetheless she also gave him a reason to want both wealth and security he was no longer a sword for hire he was a husband and it was obvious about to be a father brillix was as close to perfectly spherical as a woman could be when pregnant we drank a lot of wine that day and handed out more to the oarsmen its not all war my friends sometimes life is just sweet the next few weeks oh theres no story to tell except that watching brillix wander the house cooking cleaning feathering her nest watching doola and seckla rebuild their friendship with doolas wife as an ally caulking and preparing our triremes for sea training our oarsmen drinking at the edge of the middle sea it rivals any time in my life i missed having a love of my own but to be honest watching neoptolymos and brillix or doola and his wife i was not interested in buying a slave and pumping away at her i wanted a wife i wondered if lydia were still available but it had been more than two years and to a marriageable young woman still one of the things my teacher calchus had taught me over and over again when i was a boy at the tholos tomb above plataea was that you never know until you ask i had thought about lydia many many times in two years i had behaved badly shockingly badly really by my own standards but her father was not without error either it began to occur to me that in my new status as a rich shipowner i might have a certain appeal other things were occurring to me as well riches real wealth the wealth to buy and maintain a ship retainers warehouses have a cascade of effects have i mentioned that i knew by then that miltiades had died pointlessly of a minor wound in prison the fucking athenians pardon me thugater had imprisoned him for failing to take the island of paros heh thats what they said anyway i loved the pirate but he was scheming to make himself tyrant i guarantee it and i wasnt there to save his aristocratic arse themistocles was building athens a mighty fleet all the inner sea was talking about it because the phoenicians were rumoured to be allied to the persians in massalia over wine dionysius told me that two sets of persian envoys had come and gone from carthage and everyone in the inner sea knew that persia was going for athens again but this time not with a provincial satrap and a hastily raised army the word was that the persians were going to throw a thousand ships and a million men at greece well thats what dionysius said anyway and demetrios was gone hed taken sikel herakles to sea as soon as i was gone hed also taken a quarter of the tin and he hadnt come back theres time for rage friends time to swear revenge and get it there are other times to shrug and call it a day it was only tin there were fiftysix pigs still under the floorboards of our house and another eight wed brought all the way from the vascones land interesting that doola insisted we all share even though he and neoptolymos and daud had done all the work so we had sixtyfour pigs left less four pigs that gaius used and four i used sheathing our ships and our rams and two more that we sold in massalia to cover expenses and to do favours for bronzesmiths who helped us that left us fiftysix pigs we sold ten pigs a lot of tin to dionysius both to keep him sweet on us and to raise the cash to pay my oarsmen and hire oarsmen for gaius in the view of all of us except unfortunately demetrios these were group expenses we ballasted our triremes in tin twentyfour pigs each ship it was a lot of tin those fortyeight pigs were pure profit and every man of us was due onesixth in cash at the same time i threw all my remaining silver and all the gold torcs id earned into the common pot doola and neoptolymos had loot too and in it went that came to a tidy sum vasileos was voted a full share of the tin and so was sittonax which reduced our shares to oneeighth getting all this merchants are always surprised at how well soldiers can divide profits but listen honey the rules for dividing spoils are in the iliad were good at maths i had run the tin as a profitable military venture not as a trading concession or at least thats how it had ended vasileos was deeply moved to be offered a fortune and sittonax laughed he just laughed of course we had one last task to sell the tin fortyeight pigs of tin was enough to wreck the trade in a small market or make other men rich in a large market doola had other plans he wanted to sell the tin at the top of the market a month or so before the yearly convoys from iberia reached carthage he studied such things and he sat on the beach at massalia and listened to the merchants no phoenicians this year and made his plans sometimes you wander lost in life and you feel abandoned by the gods and you move fecklessly from one day to another without purpose other times it seems as if the hand of the gods is on your steering oars and no matter what you might plan the gods point you to a certain act or in a certain direction that is how i felt that summer we had four glorious weeks of preparation and then after a night without wine and a good sleep i rose in the dark with all my friends and all my people and we got the two new ships manned and friends shepherds and fishermen pushed our heavily laden ships down the beach and into the sea and as the sky lightened to the east we pulled our swift ships over a calm sea bound for sicily and syracusa and the largest market for tin in the inner sea we rowed east and south and stayed on open beaches with a heavy guard fishermen fled us but when we managed to convince one we were safe off etrusca he reported that a heavy carthaginian squadron was operating in sardinian waters we rowed south the next day giving sardinia a wide berth by continuing down the tyrrhenian coast we seemed to push the trade right off the seas we did after all have a pair of sleek warships and everyone ran which was just fine with all of us we passed the tiber without entering the estuary gaius didnt want to go home until the tin was sold and i appreciated his willingness we didnt want to stay at sea with our cargoes we wanted to get to the sicilian market as soon as possible let me wander off my topic to say that by this time i had begun to consider returning to plataea euphorias death was far enough behind me now and i had begun to think of taking my tin and going back to start again so i did mention to doola that the very best market at which to sell our fortune in tin was athens doola just shrugged i dont know athens he said and that was that listen when the storm was roaring we listened to vasileos and demetrios when there were spears drinking blood they all listened to me when there were things to be traded we listened to doola thats what made us strong we had three days bad weather south of tiber we were headed by winds and the seas were short and choppy and a misery for the oarsmen and i did something i hate i turned tail and ran for a beach landed and spent two days watching the weather i remember so well because without it well talk about the hand of the gods the gods had me in both hands that summer two days later we weathered pelorus in a fine west wind passing charybdis under sail with the rowers making jokes about their godsend of a vacation with the wind under our sterns we ran west as far as we could tacked rowed and did it again i mention this because it was a tactic i used to work up a rapid response in my crews and always have its neither faster nor slower than rowing but it does give the men a rest and it also trains them in the rapid switch from sailing rig to rowing and back which is essential to survival well i laugh survival as a pirate anyway both of our ships had the new tyrrhenian rig which men now call the triemiola so we no longer took our mainmast down ever and we had a halfdeck aft instead of a catwalk making for a heavier but more stable ship a wide platform for our marines and archers and a permanent station for the deck crew who worked the sails again none of this was revolutionary there were a hundred triemiolas in the inner sea but we had a pair and we had trained our crews the way the best military crews were trained wed been together a long time too the core of our crews were the men whod gone to the outer sea and back you can tell were coming to a fight cant you heh we were tacking and rowing our way down the strait of messina with me in the bow watching our tacks and trying to decide whether i was going all the way to syracusa or whether to make do with regium on the port side the mainland side i passed the city noting three triremes in the harbour yards crossed and ready for sea and we crossed the strait one more time and ran south along the sicilian coast watching for the beaches north of katania as aetna grew to starboard to dominate the horizon the wind abated blocked by aetna and we found the beach i remembered i missed demetrios and thats the truth he knew these waters like a pilot and i was a mere duffer by comparison but we got our heavy hulls ashore and we hired rollers from the fishermen and ran our hulls right up the beach to give them a good drying wet hulls are heavier and slower and when you have a ballast of tin we set a heavy guard i was a day short of my goal with a fortune in tin and there was a heavy carthaginian squadron at sea i was no fool i had marines on either headland and by all the gods that night i considered hiring a hundred donkeys and walking the ingots to syracusa i was that afraid i was afraid of more than that the tyrant of syracusa was becoming renowned by then for his treatment of merchants he was a bloodyhanded aristocrat a man who had risen to his place by a long string of military victories gelon hated merchants and little people as he called them he exacted heavy taxes to pay for his wars and despite all that syracusa was more prosperous than ever maybe because of him he had restored syracusas military power carthage was not going to find syracusa an easy nut to crack but i might former slave tin merchant i was more than a little afraid of his customs officers and as we sat on the beach at katania returning to talk to lydia seemed stupider it seemed like foolish romantic claptrap cowardice is the sum of the whispers of the weaker daimons in your soul my friends the sun rose and i didnt buy the donkeys i got my oarsmen onto the ships put on my finest chiton my armour my best cloak i arrayed myself as arimnestos of plataea lord of men i took a deep breath and reminded myself that gelon of syracusa was a parvenu from magna greca and i was a son of heracles i prayed too we got off the beach in fine style and i sacrificed a fine silver cup and some superb sicilian wine to the sea god and then we were rowing south when we were clear of aetnas shadow the west wind was unleashed and we began to make leeway to the west virtually a stade west for a stade south it was a strong wind raising a phalanx of whitecaps that made the water look like the outer sea any stronger and well have to run west i commented to giannis and megakles who were sharing the steering oars megakles grunted giannis smiled he was about to go to syracusa and he was excited i remember looking up from giannis to find that seckla was pointing at the bow and i followed his pointing finger to see the low shape of a ship nicking the horizon to the west on the opposite course and another astern of it and another they were all of them triremes or so they appeared at this distance a word for you virgins a warship is low and crewed by rowers virtually invisible until you are within fifteen stades or so and even then difficult to see a heavy merchant is not longer but it is rounder higher out of the water heavier in its masts much easier to see in any weather so we could see that the ship closest to us on the horizon was a trireme or a big bireme and the ships astern of her were not merchantmen also worth noting is that there are a hundred things a sailor learns in one look at a ship even a ship on the horizon listen girls when you are going to the fountainhouse with your friends and your slaves you know it is young eustacia bending over the well long before you can see her face right you know her from her clothes from the shape of her hips from the indefinable way she bends her body isnt that true just so at sea one glance and you know so the lead ship was greek the two ships behind were phoenician there are these moments in every mans life women too in fact whole cities and nations that define them and are defined by them there are moments where you act because you are what you are and not because you have some finely realized philosophy to justify your actions i turned to megakles hard to port i said doola was a few steps away on the halfdeck all i had to do was give the signal to raise the mainsail and it was in motion we heeled a little as we turned the mainsail raced up the mast and we had the wind astern and we were tearing downwind at the two phoenicians it feels to me now as if we turned before the words had left my mouth but in fact it must have taken some minutes and many breaths must have passed my lips none of them questioned me let me say this with a smile i hope i had two ships laden with treasure and i was a few hours sail from the port where we would realize our fortunes and when i ordered us to turn the phoenicians were far too committed to the chase of that greek ship to pay us any attention wed have been in syracusa by late afternoon i turned off our plot to run downwind on a pair of wellarmed enemy warships with professional crews for no better reason than that i hated them and that they were chasing a greek ship and every one of us had been a slave on a carthaginian i threw it all away hah beat that we ran down at them they were well trained and saw us almost immediately with our heavy sails set no reason that they shouldnt but they were nearly up with the greek galley and they began to range up either side archers shooting into the crew the greeks were resisting then one of the carthaginians dropped astern and with a magnificent effort got his crew to row double hard and he rammed the greek ship in the stern a difficult ram in any conditions and twice as difficult in that sea the greek ships bow fell off the wind and she was caught broadside and rolled the phoenicians rammed the greek but their attacks were oarrakes and they may have killed rowers but they couldnt get their beaks in all this time and we were racing down the wind and then we saw why they were so bold there were two more triremes rowing up in the eye of the wind two more phoenicians this was the heavy squadron i laughed i mean i had committed my treasure and my ships right down their throats we were under sail so i manoeuvred my hull right alongside gaius i got up on the swanneck of wood that protected the helmsman and he climbed out to meet me we were only a few feet apart want to run for it i called he laughed no he said that was our command meeting two stades out we got our sails down we were racing along faster than a horse gallops a heady speed that fills the senses and we had newbuilt ships with strong bows and new timber and tons of tin and new rams just cast by me i trusted vasileoss work and i trusted my own ah the moment we were going so fast that when the rowers put their oars in the water they slowed us and we threatened to fall off our course as they touched the choppy water the two nearest phoenicians were on either side of the greek boarding from both broadsides because theyd made shallow oarrakes from astern they had both grappled with their bows just about amidships to the greek ship so their sterns projected we came at them like arrows from a bow an oarslength separating us my lydia just astern and to the starboard we struck their sterns almost together lydia s beak struck through the enemy ships timbers like a man punching through a house wall when his house is afire and timber flew through the air it was the most decisive strike i have ever seen most ram attacks turn a ship over and the wreck floats but the target was stationary held by the grapples and couldnt turn or roll and we hit hard hard enough to stove the bows of most ships but not my lydia we ripped the stern right off and the phoenician filled and sank as fast as i can tell it two hundred men died in the next minute drowned slave and free phoenician nobleman and greek victim i watched them die as my rowers cheered and backed water gaius blew right through his probably an older ship or one with the tenedos rot because he tore the stern off and his hull slid over the wreck and he raced on leaving his victim to sink i admit that i watched his standing mainmast spring forward the length of a horse as he struck and i feared it would rip through his bottom but it didnt the greeks cut their grapples desperately because the weight of two sinking ships was dragging them down like one of poseidons monsters the greek was in rough shape he had a dozen phoenician marines on his decks and a great many dead oarsmen his stern was badly damaged and his ship was sinking under him that was too bad because i wasnt leaving gaius to fight two angry phoenicians alone and i wasnt about to put my marines onto a sinking ship doola shot one of the phoenician marines a beautiful arrow and we were away and that was all the help we offered him well aside from sinking both his enemies of course the two oncoming triremes were under oars and they had had a long pull theyd been far to windward you could see from their rowing we had standing rigging remember we didnt have to take our masts down even after a collision like the one wed just had now we had them aloft again just as fast our victorious oarsmen resting i laughed i felt like a god of the sea i would have fought fifty carthaginians if they had come at me the ones to the west of us turned on their oars and raised their mainsails and ran it was the right decision wed evened the odds in one headlong rush and now we had the fresh crews and the edge that victory brings and they knew it now in sea terms we were supposed to let them go it is not for nothing that we say a stern chase is a long chase when you are astern of an enemy you have no advantage of wind direction you have only the speed of your ships for the most part greek ships are faster than phoenicians but we were heavily laden and when they turned away we had won it became our duty by the laws of hospitality to rescue the greek ship but the closer phoenician had lingered in his turn bad shiphandling the westernmost one had issues too and got around before his sails were well set leading to some yawing megakles looked at me he had his grin on his face that guy is a fool he said pointing with his chin at the nearer phoenician bad crew seckla was all teeth lets take him doola had just unstrung his bow without demur he restrung it it was like that the oarsmen grumbled but as i pointed out we were under sail we ran about six stades and the sail began to shiver the wind was changing the sun was clouding over and the air had that taste it gets when theres a storm over africa we got our sails down long before our prey and they wallowed in the gusts as the wind changed and we were coming up on them hand over fist gaius was well astern of us and five stades to the north this was a natural consequence of the weather change and if the pattern of wind gusts had been different hed have come up with the third phoenician and wed have been left to the south but there came a point when he was no longer in the fight that decided me on my tactics we crept up the last three shiplengths using the boatsail to give us an edge and then we went to ramming speed our ship shot forward and we caught their steering oars the enemy ship yawed and all my archers shot into the command platform we ran farther west because we could only turn so fast and it was then as the second enemy ship ran like a rabbit leaving the one wed just struck to its fate that i saw dagon he was a stade away and i knew him in a moment and every shade of fear and hate struck me all together ever see a woman you have loved a boy you wanted and lost to another girl you know what i mean all that in one moment i swear i had all but forgotten his existence until i saw him my ship was already turning under me the orders were given the sails were down the rowers fully engaged i was not going to catch that galley that day but i watched him from my command deck until we turned back to our prey i dont think he saw me damn him the wounded phoenician surrendered he hadnt a chance i had a consort on the horizon and he had lost his steering and most of his officers in one pass and as soon as we came alongside some greek dragged a carthaginian down into the benches and strangled him i put doola and megakles and all my marines into him and we rowed his bow around while megakles rigged a jury steering oar and then we were rowing across the new choppy african wind darkness was falling when we came alongside gaius gaius had run west ahead of us he was the one who came alongside the sinking wreck of the greek ship and rescued her crew and her oarsmen filling his ship to a dangerous degree knowing that i was right behind him and i was i came up beside him and at the edge of darkness lashed together we transferred a hundred desperate men a trireme can only hold so much and then it wont float or it folds in the middle but bless vasileos he built good ships and we ran for the coast rowing as well as we could with so many extra bodies on board but they helped sometimes three men sitting on the same bench i put forty greek rowers into my capture and at about midnight we were off the beach at katania seckla swam ashore roused fishermen and got beacons lit and one by one we got our ships landed sternfirst it wasnt that the seas were high or the current treacherous it was merely that we were exhausted it was dark mistakes were made men were injured but we didnt lose a ship or an ingot of tin and in the end we got fires lit and men fell asleep naked on the summer sands i dreamed of dagon they werent pleasant dreams but on waking they reminded me of how much i hated him and how deep he was in my soul he had made me feel weak he had hurt me i wasnt going to forget and all my vaunted philosophy wasnt going to change that he needed to die id like to pretend to you that i felt some greater urge that i wanted him dead so he couldnt kill any more preganant women something noble no he hurt me he hurt my image of what i am i have spoken to women who have been raped we share this he hurt my soul i wasnt going to let him go hed passed within two stades of me but tyche had decreed that his ship got away i rose shivering and got some warmed wine i heard the sound of a woman shouting i knew there were women aboard the greek ship id seen them as we swept by as the sun rose i found out who they were there were five of them a free woman and four slave attendants they were swathed in cloaks and shawls like any woman who travels at sea with two hundred men and in the lukewarm and rosy brilliance of a sicilian morning they looked like drab flowers scared angry flowers they had their own firepit in the sand but no wood the free woman barked orders slapped a slave and carried firewood herself boldly walking to the fire my archers had going and taking from theirs i watched all of this a horn cup of wine in my hand while doola sold an ingot of tin to the local bronzesmiths guild there were apparently six smiths in katania and they banded together to raise the money for a full ingot their spokesman was a big man with a heavy beard he might have been a plataean he nodded to me and we gripped hands and his eyes widened you work metal he asked i nodded and pointed at lydia i cast the rams i said he walked down the beach and we examined the rams he was interested in my design i served him a cup of his own local wine sicilian wines are superb and we walked back up the beach to doola you are clearly sent by the smith god he said we havent seen this much tin in two years it is deeply pleasing to make another man happy is it not and this was a worthy man the sort of tekne whose craft pleases the gods it was a fine start to the day as was the silver that doola took all the while i watched the women i was curious i suppose the free woman sent a slave girl to borrow a copper mess kettle from the archers which she did with a flirtatious twist visible from half a stade away and smoke rose from their fire they were a competent bunch gaius came and doola seckla daud and sittonax sitting on stools or on their cloaks in the sand and we ate sardines and olives and new bread despite or because of yesterdays exertions we were all in fine spirits and we broke our bread with the gusto of the victorious gaius saw me watching the women she was taking passage to croton he said no great beauty he added dismissively tall as an amazon though doola raised an eyebrow and chewed on his bread in a way that rebuked gaius quietly gaius snorted marriage didnt make me an expert on women why did it make you one doola ate an olive i live with mine he said you visit yours in the holidays gaius spat angrily but anger never sat long on him now what he asked after we had all chewed more food syracusa i think i said we can be there by nightfall everyone nodded and slaves appeared to fold our scrap of a tent and our stools but i told the officers to assemble all the rowers and i paid every man a silver tetradrachma of syracusa from the store of silver ten days pay they filed past gaius and neoptolymos one by one as doola read their names from his tablets and made a mark in the wax most men grinned a few bit their coins and one fellow immediately handed his to another he looked at me sheepishly dice he said i spent two hours rearranging the crews the greek ship was a fast merchant out of croton the master was achilles son of dromos a professional sailor his ship was owned by one of crotons superrich aristocrats achilles didnt seem too concerned you saw me make a fight of it he said if it comes to court i have your testimony and the ladys im not worried his eyes were on our carthaginian capture going to fit her out he asked i laughed i dont know if we can afford a third ship i said but at least today well sail her into syracusa he nodded i can command a ship like that he said not everyone can i was entertained my people called me trierarch which in athens was the commander of a ship but in magna greca the trierarch was a rich and often useless member of the crew if he shipped at all achilles a short balding man with a bent back and a permanent sneer took me for a rich aristocrat i can i said and any of my friends can as well weve sailed the outer sea he stepped back meant no offence he muttered id just like to have a job between his oarsmen and the freed captives from the phoenician we had a full set of rowers for the captured ship we the six of us had a quick meeting and handed the command of the ship to neoptolymos with sixteen pigs of tin we offered achilles the post of helmsman he wasnt exactly eager but he took it in the end by the time wed shifted ingots of tin and made repairs to the former phoenician wed wasted the day evening fell wine appeared and men drank neoptolymos and seckla had the duty and they visited the watch posts on the headlands giannis had in a somewhat circuitous manner become the commander of the marines and i took him aside and asked him to have men watch the womens fire wine and women are a fine mix as long as everyone is in agreement about the whole thing but these women were different sure enough before the moon rose some of my recently freed slaves attempted to carry off one of the slave women the archers pounced and my evening was interrupted by an angry virago a pair of archers and a struggling very drunk greek i was sitting on my stool trying to tune my kithara i think ive mentioned that i had become determined to learn to play it this determination ebbed and flowed and never seemed to result in my getting anywhere if gaius or neoptolymos tuned it for me i could play a few tunes like a small boy as gaius liked to tell me but i couldnt seem to tune it the slave girl was black and had lost most of her wrappings and her body instantly put me in mind of just how long it had been since id felt such smooth skin under my hands hah i really shouldnt tell you girls such things on the other hand better you know what men really are like eh heh she was scared her eyes everywhere wild her mouth slightly open her mistress had her arm around her is this your version of a rescue she shot at me her greek was perfect attic greek the way a lady would speak it jocasta for instance i rose put my kithara on my stool and shook my head im sorry despoina but no harm has come to the girl and it is my version of a rescue if these archers had not happened by demetrios the archer a cretan grinned we didnt exactly happen by either he said she turned and looked at him it wasnt a glare just a carefully judged look he fell silent i demand better protection and how many days are we going to stay on this beach she asked there are situations it is very difficult to resist the food is good and the company suitable i said she surprised me by smiling i think perhaps our views on suitable company might differ she said her voice was deep almost masculine her face was veiled she was tall as tall as i am and thats saying something later in fact i noted that she was a hand shorter than me but she always left the impression of great height something about her voice and posture suggested she was my age or older not a young virgin by any means but a matron her figure was good a man can become quite expert at judging women through enveloping robes and i find that my skill in this regard is inversely proportional to the length of time since i last saw a woman unclothed hah a mathematical joke you young people have no notion of humour would you join me for a cup of wine and seckla take a file of marines and remind the oarsmen that these women are off limits yes seckla rolled his eyes and walked off with two of gianniss men as well as the slave girl and the prisoner my guest watched them go she turned to me it is a long time since i have been alone with men while drinking wine she said i would like one of my women to attend me not tessa shes in shock send a man for antigone send a man for antigone she issued the order with a slight wave of her hand the delightful thing was that she had every expectation of being obeyed complete assurance doola laughed and went gaius rose from his stool and inclined his head my lady he said we thought you were some merchants wife she was very tall i might well be some merchants wife she said wouldnt that entitle me to your best treatment anyway you are too well born to be a merchants wife rather the queen of croton he bowed she laughed croton does not have a queen and you she said back to him gaius julius claudius he said with a fine bow in his own barbaric tongue he said civis romanus sum he grinned im from rome oh she said with instant dismissal croton and sybaris were two of the richest cities in the world we still call the lifestyle of the very rich sybaritic and such people sybarites croton was just as rich and full of scholars and poets too rome was by contrast a town full of cows and chickens gaius was abashed she turned to me are you a pirate she asked i nodded yes all my life she had just drawn breath to launch into a speech i could read her and her reply was predicated on my denying the title of pirate my acceptance of it caused her to step back and throw an arm across her body i smiled nonetheless we will land you unharmed at syracusa tomorrow if the gods will it so it can be hard to talk to a human with no face a woman swathed in veils i couldnt tell what she was thinking she raised her cup and drank and i saw a hint of a strong jaw and a long face you speak well enough for a pirate she said and you are brave enough for an aristocrat and a woman i smiled and held out my cup to my pais for more wine what brings you to syracusa despoina she shrugged that is my business i fear she said few things kill conversation so effectively as telling someone to mind their own business i bowed i hope we can make you comfortable despoina is there anything you need you built and maintained your fire very well i noted do you need food a cooking pot some wine she nodded wine is never amiss and i note that your sailors have straw for bedding the sand is cold and women have hips we would appreciate some straw the reference to womens hips was clearly an attempt to warm over the conversation but i was done she hadnt even bothered to thank me i knew her kind or thought i did gaius will see you back to your fire and ensure you have wine and straw i said in dismissal i will gaius asked oh right trierarch and still functionary follow me my lady i have offended you she said suddenly i didnt mean to i am not good at this i do not mix with others then you mustnt be surprised that others do not seek to mix with you good night i said i walked off into the darkness not that i had anywhere to go but i didnt need to talk to her any further just then arrogant woman mix with others we are seldom so offensive as when we seek to make apology we put to sea with the dawn three warships under easy rowing it was a hundred stades to syracusa and the weather was turning bad the wind from africa was in our teeth and the southern sky was dark and the wind held a hint of sand the rowers had to earn their bonus by midday they were pulling full strength to gain us a few dactyls at the stroke into the teeth of an african gale this was the one point of wind at which the new triemiola rig was inferior and the carthaginian capture with her mainmast stowed between the benches offered less resistance to the wind and kept pulling ahead despite the relative inexperience of her crew our masts took the force of the blast and caused the bows to fall off course over and over until i finally surrendered to the inevitable and began to make short boards steering southeast and then southwest that eased the ships motion and helped gaius as well i watched his bow to gauge the effect on my own and saw the woman standing there her shawls streaming behind her in the wind yes she had a fine figure i had decided that i disliked her and i was anxious to be rid of her to be honest i must have been suffering from the reaction that always sets in after a fight even such a onesided fight as we had had the day before because the storm seemed to me to be the last straw i felt just at that moment as if we were never going to make syracusa and that the woman was the curse oh i can be a fool too sometime after noon doola came aft and megakles stood in the helm oars and we shouted at each other they wanted to turn back i did not its not worth repeating the argument which was probably rendered comic by the wind none of us could understand each other and we all wanted to be heard it was one of those times when men are reminded why only one man can be in command at sea because divided councils result in compromises in assembly or when directing the affairs of a great merchant such councils are essential at sea i was determined that we would continue even in the dark if for no other reason than that i feared what would happen if we tried to turn the seas were high and our sleek warships had high bows but very shallow waists and the rollers coming from africa would wash clear over us amidships i feared to lose a ship in the turn along with a third of our precious treasure and a third of my friends care and work would get us into syracusa im making this too long it is a curious facet of reminiscence my friends i exaggerate those things that were important to me and i skip over events that might have had far more importance to others if seckla were telling this tale bah im an old man that was a hard afternoon and a hard night and i was proceeding against the advice of my best helmsman into the teeth of a gale sure i was right i had become a far better captain in the outer sea and now i was willing to hold my course against their advice thats why i remember it was close on midsummer and the sun was out there somewhere above the cloud it was dark by midafternoon and darker still at what should have been evening and the dust coming off africa was in our eyes but after the wine had been served out to the oarsmen seckla caught sight of a glimmer to the southwest and shortly afterwards it was visible on every rise i relieved megakles and he went forward looked for himself and reported that it was the outer lighthouse at syracusa bless him the rowers were filled with confidence and in an hour we gained fifteen stades on the wind and the harbour entrance was clear enough i cheated the helm to the west so that we approached the entrance at a shallow angle from the north the great breakwater wasnt built in those days and the lesser breakwater only protruded a stade from shore about a stade off the entrance i noted that there was a current running inshore from the sea west into the harbour twice i had the rowers row to hold us in place bow into the storm while i ran amidships to peer through the murk at the harbour lights we had a lantern three lanterns over our stern and another at the masthead and despite all of that neoptolymos almost ran us aboard his ram shaving past our portside oars and he was gone heading fast into the harbour his ship turned far too fast the starboard rowers backing water took a wave right over the counter and shot into the harbour it was ragged but he was in i had intended a somewhat overcareful approach using the current to push our bow into the harbour which my rowers held steady but neoptolymoss success emboldened me and i waved to megakles i was less bold i let the wind push our bow around our rowers gave five rapid strokes as if we were ramming an enemy and we were in the change in the sea was instantaneous we went from a howling wind and steep waves to glassy calm water and no wind in five strokes a shipslength aft gaius made the turn later i understood that he left it late and his portside oarsmen actually struck the rocks with their oars but close enough is close enough he weathered the headland and we were in the harbour it was moving to sail along the beaches of the harbour front where i had spent so much time i wondered if anarchos still lorded it over the waterfront i wondered what gelon was like i wondered where lydia was doola came and stood at my shoulder as we slid down the calm water towards the waterfront we are coming back he said i smiled we said the same at massalia i noted there was quite a crowd on the waterfront it was nigh on full dark but three warships passing the harbour mouth in a storm was something worthy of comment perhaps a thousand people watched us land our ships doola leaped over the side and went up the beach to find lodging and food for six hundred sailors and oarsmen i was busy getting the crew off guiding the stern of a heavy ship well up the beach and setting a night watch on our fortune my oarsmen were all aware of what theyd been rowing in the bilges beneath their feet and in an hour theyd have told every petty criminal in every brothel on the waterfront gaiuss passenger disembarked he provided her with four marines under giannis and she vanished into the darkness i missed her going but i wasnt sorry to be honest now that we were ashore i was foolishly eager to find out what had happened to all my friends and foes in the town and at the same time suddenly apprehensive all over again i feared lydias scorn i feared her fathers scorn i also feared thieves and i slept aboard my head pillowed on my cloak and my feet on the helmsmans bench i rose in the morning swam in the sea and then walked up into the city to find an open bathhouse the temple of poseidon maintains one for travellers and i emerged clean massaged and feeling alive and virtuous on return to my ship i found doola surrounded by merchants none of whom was familiar to me i looked in vain for anarchos instead i saw a cloaked herald approaching and i ran aft and changed hurriedly into my best clothes and jewels as i expected i was summoned by the tyrant of syracusa he sent me a dozen gentleman hoplites and a polite messenger named dionysus son of anchises the messenger was a beautiful young man with hair so blond he might have been a gaul the message was a polite command to attend the tyrant at my earliest convenience i am ready i said i sent a messenger for gaius and asked him to accompany me he was obviously a gentleman remember that i had heard that the tyrant was against commoners we walked up the twisting streets to the citadel through a city that was far quieter than the syracusa i had known three years earlier there were few men and no women in the streets and those men i saw did not meet my eyes but merely hurried by i had mistaken the hoplites for local aristocrats but after climbing a few streets i realized that they were beautifully kittedout mercenaries anyone here from plataea i asked cheerfully none of them was but there were men of thebes and megara and even little thebai are you from plataea then asked the escort officer a phylarch from hermione in the peloponnese im arimnestos of plataea i said he stopped dead youre not i am i said he shook his head and then gave his spear to another man took my hand and shook it a pleasure to meet you why didnt you say the tyrant would have sent a better escort i laughed it is good to be famous the other mercenaries pressed around me and shook my hand over and over one of them a short man with short hair and an attic drawl laughed i was there too he said at marathon with miltiades he shook his head great days i understand miltiades is dead i said he nodded where have you been he asked hes been dead nearly five years i shrugged its a long story gaius stood by and rolled his eyes well no one is very famous to his friends which is probably just as well the palace of syracusa is to me an exercise in hubris it is built like a temple to the gods and yet its only purpose is to house men it towers over the town on top of the acropolis where there ought to be a temple and instead there is a citadel as far as im concerned that citadel is the reason that syracusa succumbs so easily to tyrants always has and always will the man who holds the acropolis holds the city by placing the gods on the acropolis athens makes it much harder for a mere man to take their houses and any man who does such a thing is an obvious blasphemer the peisistratids had houses on the acropolis but no one but priests dwell there now i digress again high above the town we emerged on a path with a marble railing lined by statues of women who were holding the railing the view was breathtaking and the storm off towards africa was a pronounced darkness like a bruise in the sky my escort halted at the end of the path where the statues gave way to a garden open on one side to the city and closed on the other three by deep colonnades all this for the pleasure of one man gelon was standing among his roses he had a small sharp sickle in one hand and he was pruning cutting dead flowers slicing away buds past their promise hah it all appeared a trifle contrived to me gelon the great aristocrat tamer of the commons pruner of the high and the low something like that nonetheless i bowed my escort commander said lord arimnestos of plataea and saluted with his spear to me he said lord gelon of syracusa he caught my eye as he turned and his escort marched away smartly gelon the tyrant of syracusa was a tall deepchested man with deep dark blue eyes the kind of eyes usually painted on by amateur statuepainters who have access to too much lapis his eyes were arresting his gold hair almost metallic in its vitality was arresting too he had a touch of silvergrey at the temples well muscled arms and legs he looked in fact like a big handsome man in the very prime of life and condition and i have always thought that his looks were part of his success he looked like a statue of a god like the best statues of heracles or zeus he dressed simply as had become the fashion since the teachings of pythagoras began to sweep over the greek world and he wore no jewellery unless he wore a cloak at any rate at the mention of my name his eyes widened ever so slightly are you really arimnestos of plataea he asked i bowed what do you say to such a foolish question well he said welcome to syracusa i gather that your ships bring a cargo and i gather that you have quite a story to tell you have the better of me then my lord i said i have a cargo of tin which my factor is even now selling of course i have the better of you gelon said a trifle petulantly it is my business to know such things i gather that you had an encounter with ships of carthage we encountered them i admitted such encounters are my business tell me please he snapped his fingers and a pair of slaves appeared one reached for my cloak the other handed me wine i removed my cloak in a fine swirl of tyrian red and both slaves fell back a pace gelon paled or rather as i was to learn with him his lips grew redder you are armed he said at all times i said cheerfully and tossed my cloak to the nearer slave see to it the pins still there when i get it back i said my slaves do not steal he said good i said i found three ships of carthage pursuing a greek ship north of here practically off your harbour mouth i sank two and took the third under whose protection the tyrant asked do you act for athens is that why you feel you can take ships on the high seas with impunity i laughed i doubt that anyone in athens even knows that i am alive i said i need no mans permission to take ships on the seas but my own dano says that you told her you are a pirate he said dano i asked the woman you might recall rescuing he said with a slight smile i shrugged i served miltiades too many years to call myself anything else i said and i was bold enough to assume that i would be welcome here for making war on carthage the tyrant pulled his beard and nodded you are correct and yet it might have been better had you asked me first carthage has a mighty armament off my coast and i am not yet ready to contend with them he shrugged where did you acquire so much tin preying on carthage i shook my head no and then perhaps they would tell this story differently we sailed into the outer sea and they hounded us unfairly after a while i attacked their shipping and their trade yes gelon nodded there have been rumours of a greek pirate in the outer sea he said well done now that i know you are the famous arimnestos it makes more sense to me as the earliest rumours said you were some bronzesmith with a taste for war i was feeling perverse i am a bronzesmith with a taste for war i said i cast the rams on my ships prows i can make a better helmet than any smith in this city and i have fought in a dozen pitched battles on land and sea and in fifty skirmishes heracles is my ancestor i led the plataeans at marathon i smiled my ships carry more than forty full ingots of alban tin which sicily needs he nodded his godlike face split in a smile you need to put me in my place because you have heard that i hate the tekne he said he shrugged men lesser men who cannot understand me say such things indeed i love fine things and i honour the artisans who make them yet i know that they lack the skills and education to serve as citizens and voters their dedication is their craft as womens dedication is their children they are too busy to direct the affairs of the city you should meet my friend aristides i said you two would have much to discuss gelon shook his head again debate with me if you disagree if cities were directed by craftsmen perhaps there would be less war and more art the exercise of craft the excellence of making things well is i maintain as sure a guide to arete as excellence in rhetoric or athletics what excellence does a man have merely by birth i nodded out to the south towards carthage i have seen more courage from keltoi slaves sometimes gelon was not angered nor was he stung he was no straw tyrant well said if full of possible holes what if a man makes things all day and has no idea of what has gone on in the assembly when did your assembly last meet i asked the sound of a womans laughter pealed through the garden i knew her laugh immediately the laugh of a deepvoiced deepchested woman she came along a gravel path with the grace of a goddess she was tall as i have said her face was magnificent but not beautiful the angles were too sharp her nose almost like a beak her eyebrows fierce her mouth a long slash and yet dano of croton was and remains as enigmatic as her father he argues like a sophist changing his ground as fast as you change yours she said i practised debate as a boy when i was learning to be a swordsman i said gelon raised an eyebrow learning to be a swordsman he said with gentle contempt any wellborn boy is born knowing how to wield a sword it is an innate skill like virtue he truly believed what he said it is important that you understand this to understand the complexity of our lives he was a great man a great mind a deep thinker a superb general and yet he truly utterly believed that the well born were superior in every way far more like the gods than say one of his sikel or african slaves but my growing respect for him couldnt stop the sneer from touching my face would you care to put one of your wellborn young men against me i asked he shook his head you claim descent from heracles he said naturally you are a better warrior than other men he smiled even if you waste your talents working bronze it was like the feeling of a heavy persian arrow hitting my aspis would you care to put one of your wellborn gentlemen against a slave of my choosing i said he shrugged there are always exceptions but in general come you wont deny that the well born are handsomer with better bodies and more aptitude for anything it doesnt surprise me that you are a fine bronzesmith any gentleman will excel at any of the lesser trades but this is like an adult stooping to enter the boys events in the olympics let the lesser men work bronze a gentleman should work with men if this is true i said trying once more why are so few gentlemen any use at the helm of a ship in a storm dano of croton laughed he doesnt know and you should stop trying to beat him and gelon be a good host this is the man who saved me from the phoenicians even now my great height would be fetching a stunning price at some brothel in carthage she smiled at me i failed to thank you at the time arimnestos i was disconsolate it is difficult to explain i do not live in a world of ship battles and pirates i read about such things she shrugged well it is rather difficult to harbour resentment against someone thanking you in front of the ruler of a tenth of the known world she offered her cheek to be kissed and i kissed it the tyrant laughed do you know who she is son of heracles shes dano of croton pythagorass daughter one of my best friends i owe you immeasurably for her rescue but we had no notion of what kind of man you might be i had imagined a much blacker pirate i shrugged i have been a black pirate i imagine that the darkness of ones acts is often judged differently depending on which end of the sword faces you dano shook her head i confess that you rescued me and i am grateful but despite that i believe that all violence makes men lesser more like animals war is the king and father of all some men it makes kings and others slaves i said peace begets nothing but dull care strength comes through change the wise adapt heraclitus she said that charlatan he was my master and teacher i said and he honoured your father my father did not honour him she said she paused her voice had begun to grow coloured heated and she took several breaths more than any pythagorean i ever knew dano controlled herself at all times now the tyrant laughed brilliant he said i have a follower of heraclitus to debate with my daughter of pythagoras we can form a threesided triangle of discussion arimnestos be free in my city i may have a matter of hmm policy to discuss with you now that i have met you im sure many people here will want to meet you do you wish me to give you a guide i know the city well i said gelon gave me an odd look and said very well i will have rooms assigned to you in the palace i would be too afraid of being murdered by fanatic pythagoreans i said she started to bite back and realized she was being mocked instead of glaring at each other we found ourselves smiling it was an odd interaction i was quite sure that i didnt find her attractive so i wondered at the readiness of my unintended smile the pretty young dionysus son of anchises reappeared to lead me out of the palace we didnt leave the way wed come but went up into the main apartments so that he could show me i suppose the sheer magnificence of the palace and then we headed down a grand outside marble stair that wrapped around a small temple platform to nike a priestess was just emerging from the temple her sheer gracefulness caught my eye she wasnt tall but willowy and her neck rose from her sheer white chiton it was lydia i stopped on the steps and almost fell she looked at me put a hand to her chest and then turned and went back into the temple of nike without intending it indeed without any conscious thought i ran back up the steps to the temple but dionysus caught my hand you cannot go in there he said gelon would have you killed i saw that the temple doors wellworked bronze the height of a man with deeply inset panels that showed scenes from the triumph of the goddess were slightly ajar she was watching me or watching for me to go i know her i said it was all things considered a foolish thing to say dionysus looked at me i must suggest that you are mistaken he said primly the next few days passed in a pleasant but confusing whirl doola was busy selling our tin and through him our inn became a hive of mercantile activity gelon might disdain merchants but his factor made it clear that syracusa needed tin i received invitations to the palace which i accepted i dined with gelon and the nobility of syracusa lydia if it was lydia i had seen was nowhere in evidence i shared a couch with gaius and we were bored i didnt see dano of course i was back in civilization and women didnt in general dine with men especially in conservative aristocratic syracusa dull after two days of it i couldnt stand the inaction at first i wandered the waterfront i met men from athens and croton from rome from all the cities of the etrusca from as far away as tyre the tyrian a senior officer of a merchant on the beach looked me over carefully from the deck of his ship and then beckoned to me you are the great greek pirate he said he grinned it wasnt a real expression more like a dog showing its teeth he sent a boy for spiced wine and we sat on bales of his linens from aegypt and he told me without preamble that darius the great king for all of my life was rumoured to have died at persepolis which was about as far from syracusa as i could imagine in distance his successor was xerxes or so my phoenician helmsman informed me he talked about persias determination to conquer athens and after a while we moved up the beach to a taverna men came and went asking his leave to buy one thing or sell another after some small talk about his family he got to the point he leaned back stuck two fingers in the top of his linen kilt and smiled now i have told you something yes so you tell me you make war sea war on carthago yes he smiled but the smile didnt reach his eyes carthago enslaved me i said mildly he nodded you have killed many of my people many yet i sit here and make the talk with you and you do not seem like a monster why so much war eh i spread my hands it seems to follow me i said he nodded so tell me this is it true you went to the tin islands all the way into the outer sea i was watching him carefully i didnt think it impossible that the phoenicians would murder me in cold blood for all sorts of reasons but first and foremost because i knew the route to the tin yes all the way to alba and back he smiled leaned forward and extended his hand im thato abn baal i too have crossed the northern seas he grinned i tell them at home that we could publish the route in every city in the world and do ourselves no harm because only a great sailor can make the trip that the squadron at gades is wasted he nodded you have prisoners i believe i am a man of the world and i like most people i have come to an age where i can say that in truth there is no one truth that no man is much better than any other and that greeks are not handsomer or smarter than persians no race has an edge in courage or discipline or shiphandling but i cannot abide phoenicians maybe it is bred to the bone after years of war or perhaps they really are rotten to the core of their childkilling society eh so all this this whole pleasant morning of conversation was a preamble to asking me if he could ransom my prisoners i have a few i said my annoyance was already rising give them to me and ill see what i can do to get you trading privileges in sidon and carthago he said with a smile why would i want to trade there i asked i was already getting to my feet the richest trade in the world the finest entrepot the best warehouses the most imposing array of products the best craftsmanship athens you mean i said he laughed but his laugh was more false than an old whores smile athens is a nice little town he said sidon tyre carthago these are the finest cities in the world and you should beg to trade in them why i asked i leaned forward i can take whatever they have to offer whenever it suits me i nodded like that ship right there it would mean war between carthago and syracusa a war that syracusa would lose carthago can put a hundred thousand men in the field he stood up slavery has eroded your manners as well as your sense of right and wrong i sought to do you no harm greek i want to buy your prisoners i nodded ill send you my factor i said haughtily in fact i wanted rid of them and money is always nice the problem with anger is that it can get in the way of common sense i didnt need him or his ship or the international complications that would arise even as it was my possession of the hull of a captured carthaginian warship and the freed greek slaves roaming the streets spending their pay was making trouble for my host who in turn was increasingly distant to me piracy always a complicated matter i turned to leave thato abn baal and had another thought do you know a greek in carthagos service called dagon i asked the phoenician rolled his eyes yes insane i asked the phoenician shipmaster shrugged a bad man and not one of us whatever you say he spat will you see him in carthago i asked thato narrowed his eyes i shrugged i am not after your ship i spoke in heat he splashed some wine on the floor make me your guest friend and ill talk to you about it a guest friend is a sort of sacred trust like brotherhood if you make a man your guest friend you accept responsibility for him in your house and your city but you also in effect swear to support him and not to harm him ever sometimes guest friendships are passed down from generation to generation if you wanted my prisoners why not just say so i asked it is rude to start a conversation with a demand he said i am a gentleman i heard that you are too despite your violence i sat again poured a little more wine guest friendship is a door that swings both ways i said he spat thoughtfully i am not a barbarian he said make me your guest friend and we will share the rewards in the eyes of our gods and men despite all i liked him so i got up and swore the oath to zeus and he swore by baal and apollo and we clasped hands some bystanders in the taverna witnessed a big athenian helmsman i didnt know came and slapped me on the back then take the prisoners i said to my new brother no ransom he was genuinely surprised unaffectedly surprised you mean that he asked i led him to where neoptolymos sat under an awning drinking wine he had six carthaginian officers and a pair of our marines watching them and making sure our former slaves didnt gut them for old times sake neoptolymos i said let them go this man will take them home neoptolymos nodded he was an aristocrat too he rose to his feet and bowed to our phoenician guest thato started to lead them towards his ship they clutching his knees and patting his hands and weeping as well they might but he pushed the youngest one away and turned to me i may see dagon in carthago he said i cant stand him but i see him all too often tell him you met arimnestos of plataea i smiled tell him that when i find him i will break him on an oar and crucify him on my mainmast thato nodded and pursed his lips i will he said seriously i was busy in other ways as well the athenian helmsman a former slave named simon like my hateful cousin was almost fully loaded with sicilian wine and copper ore and three ingots of my tin and he was headed east to athens since i had already begun to form my plans to return to my own life so to speak i asked him to see if he could find mauros or any of my other friends in athens or piraeus i wrote a letter to aristides sometimes known as the just who had led one of the athenian taxeis at marathon and another to themistocles the leader of the athenian demos asking them to see to it that if my ship still sailed the seas it came to me at massalia i wrote another letter to my sister penelope i had decided that it was time to return to my home but first i had a military operation to plan and i had to know about lydia i completed my letterwriting visited doolas mercantile exchange and sat down to listen to him dicker with a pair of sybarite merchants it took me a moment to realize that he was buying their tin this made no sense to me but i smiled at doola who was clearly having a fine time and walked outside where to my confusion seckla was leading a pair of donkeys loaded with tin out of the inns yard he smiled at me and walked on attended by a pair of slaves perhaps we delivered i fortified myself with one more cup of wine and walked up the town to the shop where i had worked for a year i sent a slave in for nikephorus but i already knew that the forge was silent and when the mistress of the house emerged she looked at me face carefully blank where is master nikephorus i asked she looked away he died and his wife i asked the woman looked at the ground she died first she finally met my eye and hers held rage you have nerve coming here after what you did you dont think i know you i know you this was what i had imagined when i imagined the worst possible outcome of my visit and i didnt know her you ruined her turned her head made her a whore the woman spat at my feet my curse on you i pray for your destruction every day may the sea god suck you down may the carthaginians take you i confess that i stepped back before her rage i wanted to marry her i said weakly knowing that this was not precisely true did you she asked im sure you still can she might make a good wife between pleasuring gentlemen at parties she stepped forward my sister died of a broken heart her husband died when the fucking tyrant took his citizen rights they took you in you fuck gave you work you ruined them she was screaming now i was backing away as if she were three swordsmen or perhaps five five swordsmen would not have made me feel like this one middleaged woman what do you say to the screaming harridan in the street i meant no harm we were just playing i play with girls all the time im a warrior and it is my right to take women as chattel one of the effects of age is to realize that most of societys rules even the most foolish exist for reasons and are broken only at someones peril from the comfort of this kline and across the distance of years i doubt that i wrecked lydia alone or that her mother died entirely of my actions nikephorus could have been less intransigent as i discovered he threw her from the house she was a prostitute by the next morning thats the way of it and she came to the attention of the man who became tyrant and he took her for his own as you will hear well how much of that is my responsibility eh when the night is dark and the wine is sour it looks to me as if it is all my responsibility all of it i played with her life and i broke it thats hubris my daughter treating a free person as if they are a slave i never promised you a happy story i left the street and walked down the hill and sat on the beach over the headland from the citadel and i wept and then i went back to town along the waterfront looking for a fight and didnt find one you never do when you really want one so i drank and i walked and i wandered it grew dark and there was doola standing in front of me and he walked with me a way and then it was morning and i awoke with a hard head and a general sense of hopelessness i went downstairs and sat with my friends because they were true friends i told them the whole story doola knew some and neoptolymos most of it but when they heard the whole story they gathered around me and seckla hugged me and doola just stood with a hand on my shoulder you owe the girl he said she must hate me i said doola nodded i dont think that will change you must help her anyway take her away from here to where she can start again perhaps she likes it here i said a fairly weak thing to say really doola just looked at me neoptolymos said lets just take her i didnt see any solution but doola insisted i had to see her and i determined to try i began by asking any staff i met when i went up to the palace rumours of the tyrants hetaera were everywhere in the town but there was no one at the palace who would even mention her at my third invitation to dine i went and sat on young dionysus couch it was crowded i can tell you to see what he would tell me but the party was growing wilder by the moment and i couldnt even get his attention i have seldom felt such an utter depression of spirit as i felt that evening i sat in the tyrants beautiful garden hed had the couches arranged outside and the sun stained the sky and distant clouds a magnificent orange pink even as his roses scented the air it was an intimate dinner perhaps thirty guests with superb music and very good food i remember none of the dishes because i didnt want food i sat alone on a couch ignored by the other guests a mere oddity a foreigner who had sailed a long way and nothing more i was thirty years old and more i was a famous man in a way but that way was not the kind of fame any man seeks i had the reputation of a killer a pirate a thug i had abused a girl half my age and because of it her family was disgraced or dead and she herself dishonoured and nothing could make that right there was no one to kill i am not a fool i was trained by one of the greatest minds in the history of greece and i have a brain of my own i could and did see the difference between what my emotions said i had done and the actual responsibility i bore but that didnt matter any more than the various excuses i make myself for the oceans of blood i have shed with the edge of my sword i was more than thirty years old and i had neither wife nor children no permanence no hope of continuity if an enemy spear took me i would be gone like a bad smell in a powerful wind i still think these thoughts thugater nothing makes it better it is dark and it can go on for days there is nothing joyous about murder the thrill the contest of war is only half the story and the other half is remembering all the men whose lives you reaped so that you could have their gold i decided to go if i had been feeling better i might have been bold enough to walk off and search the palace but dark spirits do not raise your courage gelon came and sat on my kline just as i was about to leave you are like the spectre at the feast he said is my food bad do the musicians displease you no i said i am not in the mood for food i should have declined to come my lord i am poor company he furrowed his brow i expect better of my guests come tell us of sailing the outer sea another man one of the horsebreeders who seemed to be gelons favourites clapped his hands together tell us another one of them a taller man with ringlets looked at me curiously i suddenly knew him he was one of the wealthy men who had evicted me from the city gymnasium some years before had i been in a different mood that might have roused me but in my present mood it only served to make me tired another time i said wearily i insist said the tyrant well he was the absolute lord of syracusa and my ships were in his harbour very well i said he held up a hand let me send for dano he said she loves any physical science she will want to hear this herself in fact she insisted i lay back while slaves rearranged the couches so that i could tell my story to the party theodorus his name came to me came and stood by my kline i think i know you he said hesitantly i was a slave i said and you didnt want to know me he frowned you probably shouldnt be in the palace i nodded i found that i was growing angry easily that i wanted to quarrel with this relative nonentity which was foolish anger is always foolish why dont you tell him and well see how he reacts i said theodorus looked at me how does a former slave own three warships he asked me good question i said i smiled he went and said something to one of his cronies and then the tyrant was back with dano she wore a veil and sat in a chair theodorus cleared his throat even as dano raised the edge of her veil and gave me the sweetest smile it wasnt the smile of a flirtatious woman but merely a smile in that moment it was as if she read my mind my anger my hurt she was a good woman a good woman i tore my eyes away from her to find theodorus standing by gelon the tyrant was listening to him speaking low and urgently despite danos presence i was content to be thrown out i didnt like gelon and his cronies seemed to me to be the opposite of proper aristocrats instead of tough educated men who could lead war parties or talk about the affairs of their city these seemed to me to be softhanded sycophants but gelon laughed theodorus do you actually think that men like us are bound by petty notions like slavery his laugh was real and it rang loud and full and again the tyrant gave me the impression that he was like the lord zeus it was the laugh of the king of the gods if the lord apollo fell to earth and was enslaved would he be any less a god some of the others looked at theodorus and some looked at me im not sure that the tyrant convinced them but after a moment it was obvious that i wasnt going to be conveniently thrown out of the palace and would have to sing for my supper so i began to tell the story i thought id tell it fairly so i started from syracusa with our first boat they were true nobles they were fascinated by the way that small men make money the tale of the purchase of our second boat fascinated most of them in a way that the tale of my trip beyond gades did not when i mentioned anarchos the tyrant slapped his thigh and laughed i know him he said he is precious to me well well by the time i had the ships off the beach at massalia and off the inner sea coast of iberia twothirds of my listeners had lost interest the tyrant and the lady dano on the other hand were rapt with attention and young dionysus gazed at me with genuine heroworship when i told the story of running the mill race at the pillars of heracles he clapped his hands together and said odysseus come to life and danos eyes shone let me tell you a secret no matter how far down you are the admiration of a handsome woman will almost always bring you up in your own estimation and some male heroworship doesnt hurt either not at all i took them up the coast out to sea in storms in raids on the carthaginians up to alba and all the way home the sun was gone the lamps were lit and half the guests had left when i was done i took a long drink of wine dano threw back her veil and drank some wine she looked not at me but at gelon who nodded indeed for an hour i was the king of the phaekeans listening to the man of sorrows tell his tale if you ask me for a ship to take you home i will have to give you my treasure that was a great tale dano raised the communal cup how my father would have loved you she said i smiled i eat meat i admitted i dont think i could give it up sorry that quip was aimed at her because the secretive pythagoreans didnt let outsiders know anything of their practice but everyone knew they didnt eat meat she shrugged he loved men who do things and men who learn things it seems to me you are both and that was a marvellous story what will you do with the rest of your life i shrugged you overwhelm me with so much unmerited praise i slid off my couch and stretched gelon rose and crushed my hand in the two of his stay here with us then be one of my captains persia and carthage are combining to extinguish the greek world a single great war to dominate the earth or so my spies tell me come and help me stop them this is the richest city in the greek world we can have a grand fleet dano made a motion with her hand athens has built more than a hundred triremes in the last three years she said i whistled i can buy and sell athens gelon said a commercial city ruled by a squabbling assembly of proles they will never rise to greatness men require to be led and well led by those who are better syracusa will be a greater city because those who rule her are themselves greater i shrugged again men on ships require to be led i said men on farms require only to be left alone dano laughed may i quote that its brilliant and you say you studied with that fool heraclitus he was not a fool but a great thinker and a brilliant man humble before the gods capable of solving almost any problem and yet he studied other mens thoughts and learned from them too in aegypt in persia even your father who he viewed as the greatest mathematician of the age i had a thought then of sitting in the garden of hipponaxs house teaching briseis from a book of pythagoras watching her beautiful fingers work the geometric figures with the compass i had made her gelon smiled can you work any of pythagorass solutions he asked me several i said i can find the value of the hypotenuse given the lengths of the two other sides seeing his surprise i said i use it every day to figure my dead reckoning at sea if i am rowing twenty stades an hour to the south and wind and current are moving me six stades an hour to the west what is my true course and speed i asked a little less then twentyone stades an hour south by east dano said clapping her hands together what do you do when your course and the current arent at perfect right angles gelon asked guess i said and he laughed and how do you measure the speed of your crosscurrent or the wind or even your own speed through the water dano asked we cast the log for speed it is guesswork but accurate guesswork my young friend seckla can cast the log for a ships speed and hell be accurate within well within my tolerance anyway currents more guesswork i waved my hands gelon nodded it is experience is it not that gives a mariner the ability to make these guesses i sensed i was entering into another argument but you could teach another person to do it could you not lord arimnestos she demanded i am reckoned intelligent could you teach me to command your ship or could she teach herself asked the tyrant could she work it all out from first principles and then put to sea my lord my lady i have the feeling that i am caught between scylla and charybdis here but i would say that yes i could teach lady dano to command or to pilot and yes she might even teach herself although she might also die in the attempt but i would insist that while she might learn to be a brilliant navigator by practising mathematics seamanship is a great deal more and requires years at sea i started late and my helmsman megakles for example a fisherman born has a deep understanding of waves and weather and i do not so i ask him often nor have i learned his knack yet i can pilot a ship from here to gades with a few landfalls and the sun moon and stars and he would have to coast the whole way there are many skills at sea just as on land and not every skill is acquired the same way the tyrants laugh boomed out again you dont lose an argument often do you he asked he rose from his couch and went to be gracious to other guests and i gathered i had annoyed him dano sat on the edge of my couch i wonder if you could come and speak about navigation for our school in croton i was flattered i would be delighted i said but i understood that your father was exiled from croton and no longer had a school there oh she said that was many years ago members of our group she looked up and met my eye men can be fools no matter how well born and well educated indeed it sometimes seems to me that wellborn welleducated greek men are the greatest fools in the world i laughed such speech must endear you to all such men she shrugged impatiently it is foolish to speak in generalities she said indeed you make me garrulous when i would prefer to be silent because women should be seen and not heard i asked she glared and then saw that i was smiling because a philosopher learns more from listening than from talking she said you are a philosopher i asked everyone is she said simply only a few mortals have the leisure to devote the time to it that it deserves but everyone who travels the face of the world is a philosopher unless they sink to become animals she smiled at her own vehemence i think pythagoreans eschewed displays of emotion i think i must agree to that or be characterized as an animal i said she looked at gelon with the last of his guests and said i love it here but i am merely a curiosity i came for the friendship my father bore gelon i have been well received but gelon imagines that i am a woman and sends me yarn will you take me back to croton i can pay i nodded with pleasure i wanted out of sicily and i had remembered anarchos the next morning sober and of sounder mind i wandered the inner harbour not where the big foreign ships beached but where the local trade came it took me about two hours to find one of anarchoss enforcers and an hour later i was with the man himself he looked at me over the rim of his wine cup and toasted me heres to success he said the greatest mariner of the age or so i hear it heres to your friendship with the tyrant i said he told me that he loves you in just so many words anarchos looked around he said that out loud he snorted ill be lynched i gather hes none too popular with the lower classes i said anarchos leaned back he stripped everyone but the richest six hundred families of their voting rights set against that hes lowered taxes and he has kept the carthaginians at bay he motioned over my shoulder nice ships you have become an important man again i said i smiled so what do you want he asked of me you dont need me any more he shrugged i try to be realistic about these things he nodded or do you need me after all wheres lydia i said ah he said in fact he knew what i was there for from the moment i walked in anarchos was a man who bought and sold weakness and he knew mine our eyes locked you walked off and left her he said i offered to marry her i said in instant defence foolish wasted words but her father turned you down i remember when you left her father threw her into the street he licked his lips i took her up his statement cut me like a sharp sword he spread his hands dont pretend you cared we are men of the world you had your turn and i had mine he laughed at my face but i lay with her which you hadnt the balls to do and she liked it he smiled i didnt rape her hah you are a fool and my men are all around you if you draw youll be dead in a moment i couldnt help myself rage jealousy selfhate what a stew of low emotions i was i got to my feet and men crowded in close and i felt the prick of a knife through my cloak when i was tired of her just as you tired of her no doubt i arranged for gelon to meet her beautiful well spoken hot on the couch and cool in debate the perfect mistress for the tyrant he couldnt have some lowborn porne could he anarchos laughed you still think that you are better than me lad it is chilling that in the moments that most matter we dont think of our great and noble teachers and their fine thoughts but instead we think like animals i wanted to kill him because of course he was completely correct his contempt was merited and he had probably dealt fairly with her by his own lights but as a man i didnt see any of that i burned oh zeus i burned with rage anarchos laughed again will killing me make you a better man hero he asked get you gone he stood up i stood too it may not strike you as one of my boldest bravest strongest moments but it was i stood up and i mastered myself i clamped down on the rage i told myself that i was not responsible for his actions but only my own tell me how to reach her i said i kept my voice low he looked at me as if i had slapped him i want to talk to her i said that is all he narrowed his eyes why i mean why should i help you i took a deep breath you and i have a great many things in common i met his eyes so im going to assume that some of the things you do are difficult to live with and that once in a while you have to do something to help someone or become a monster anarchos paled but he made himself laugh i cant remember when someone last appealed to my beneficent nature i shrugged i intend to offer her a path away from here and a great deal of money to start again somewhere she hates you and she wont hate you less its odd i knew that but hearing anarchos say it in a matteroffact voice devoid of sarcasm or deliberate malice brought home to me that it was true it made me feel a little sick the way a man feels when he first discovers that he has a fever i accept that i said quietly he nodded if i can arrange something it will be on my grounds and you will be in my hands he said youd be a fool to have me killed i said but i expect youd weather it i nodded you know where to find me he nodded i think you owe me money he said he actually smiled the amount might not even be noticeable to you he laughed i had to laugh too he was right he extended an arm and i clasped it somewhere he and i had taken each others measure i couldnt manage to hate him on the way back to our inn i saw seckla with a dozen of our oarsmen loading mules with ingots of tin our tin at a warehouse well above the water i looked at him and he shook his head dont ask he said i waited for doola to be done with his latest transaction then i sat down and told him everything id learned from anarchos he nodded you behaved well he said gaius shook his head well he asked lets go and gut the crime lord ive always wanted to do him the bastard kill him grab the girl and go neoptolymos nodded i too have always wanted him dead gaius grinned think of all the other little people whod bless our names hes a complete bastard and he raped your woman kill him i sighed because part of me wanted the same thing i looked at gaius someday i hope you get to meet my friend idomeneus i motioned to my pais for a cup of wine you cant kill everyone you disagree with says who gaius asked if doola ever finishes dicking around with these merchants i aim to be the richest magnate in rome and if men annoy me i may well kill them i hope you will all come with me one more time first i said gaius smiled where i looked at neoptolymos illyria i promised to put neoptolymos back on his throne and i will and i intend to kill dagon gaius shook his head but not anarchos i shook my head no it is different gaius narrowed his eyes you think too much brother i have neglected i think to mention that all syracusa was a field of ares that men were drilling in the squares dancing the various forms of the pyrrhiche running in armour to harden their bodies the shops on the street of hephaestos were thriving and helmets thoraxes greaves ankle armour even armour for mens feet and elbows poured forth a lot of it was crap i walked down the street and was surprised at how poor some of the work was but some was magnificent and the best work was that of anaxsikles who had more than fulfilled his promise i had known him as a young man and now he was a man and a master i think i mentioned that he was the second son of dionysus the master smith at the top of the street and his work was god sent he had his own shop his work struck me like the shock of a nearby lightning strike like full immersion in icy water there were three things that distinguished his work his absolutely perfect planishing so that even the most complex curve of a helmet or a greave was as smooth as a mirror his elegance of form so that i could pick his work out when i paused to lean on my staff and watch the youths drill because his armour made a man look like a god whereas other mens work could make a mans legs look shorter or their torsos broader anaxsikles work had the opposite effect and finally the almost total lack of decoration he was in his way a genius and he had perfected his forms to the point where embellishment was unnecessary his greaves were completely smooth his torso cuirasses followed the musculature of the body without the complex hip extensions or the acanthus whorls that were standard on most breastplates i stood in the street watching him work under an awning and my heart was torn in many different directions i wanted to be working i wanted to be as gifted as he he was younger than i and already a better smith age brings its own humility as well as its own relaxation when one is young one strives to be best against all comers the best in war the best on the kithara the best at reciting poetry the best at smithing time passes and some men are revealed as swordsmen and some as kithara players and some as smiths greater and lesser according to their merits heraclitus taught us that no man need do any more than to strive to be the best he can that arete lies not in triumphing over others but mostly in triumph over yourself so he told us but which of us believed it not i i wanted to be best of all men i still do humility is not yet my portion but standing there i had to acknowledge that this young man made armour on a plane that i would never reach not if i put down my spear and did nothing but work at an anvil until the end of my days it was a curiously painful discovery and yet liberating all this in as little time as it takes one man to greet another on the street and then anaxsikles raised his head and smiled that smile was worth a great deal to me i was afraid well that my behaviour with lydia had poisoned everything he put his hammer carefully into a rack at his side handed his mittens to a slave and came out of his shop to embrace me that was pleasant spontaneously mostly to show him how highly i regarded his work i asked him how much he would charge for a full panoply he grinned you can make your own he said i want yours yours is better i nodded at a pair of greaves on the display bench the pure form of a mans lower legs without any decoration beyond the beauty of the body i cant make those i said he laughed flatterer he said i learned to make armour from you you were the one who taught me that there should be nothing on which the point can catch i have thought about our duel a hundred times youve created a style i said i see men in your armour every day you are the best armourer ive ever seen he beamed and you i laughed ive made some simple helmets i spent a winter learning to cast larger pieces he nodded yes thats an important skill i havent tackled it yet what did you learn i wont bore you i talked about casting ships rams and he came down to lydia and looked at the ram and smiled when he saw the name so you still love her too i shrugged most of what happened is my own fault i said with an honesty that surprised me i loved her i think of her often he nodded i always loved her he said i would have married her after you left he paused looked at me many hold you responsible i dont he said i am though i said he shrugged i would have married her he said quietly even after her father cast her out really i asked he shrugged men are fools is a hammer the worse when anothers hand has touched it so long as i wield it well he shook his head even now i would marry her you wouldnt be able to live here i said it with flat certainty he nodded i never expected to be talking to you about this i too failed her when her father cast her forth i allowed my father to convince me that she was worthless he shook his head gone was the master smith and in his place was a very unhappy young man i thought for a few heartbeats im trying to contact her i said i thought to offer her a dowry and a trip to somewhere else athens perhaps she would never take anything from you anaxsikles said im sorry but it is hard to hear that someone you have loved hates you utterly and yet how could i have expected anything else if i arranged a meeting i said would you go he nodded of course i took a deep breath i never expected this as an outcome i went to your shop to tell you what a fine smith youve become he nodded the gods walk the earth he said indeed i agreed i didnt tell anarchos what i had planned but my heart was lightened i told only doola because of all my friends only he seemed to understand me my plan was simple i intended to reunite lydia and anaxsikles and then get them transport to athens lydias dowry would set anaxsikles up in a shop under the temple of hephaestos it was a good plan and it deserved to succeed but anarchos dragged his feet explaining that he only had one clandestine method of contacting lydia and it was complicated depending on a saka slave in the nursery where lydia seldom went as she had no children of her own i tried to see her on my next visit to the palace i wandered as if lost looking for her but the slaves were too afraid of their master and too helpful and i was quickly escorted to the tyrant who laughed and made quips all through dinner about the navigator of the seas who got lost in his palace that night he invited dano to join us she shared my couch in the italian way for a while and when it was time for her to move and i cant pretend i didnt enjoy her warm femininity next to me she smiled im ready to leave she said when can you depart i thought about it it was a fourday run to croton unless the weather turned nasty a week and a half round trip doola was all but done with his sales we accused him every day of playing with the syracusan merchants the way a cat plays with mice the syracusan armament required bronze for everything from armour to ships rams and bronze needs tin day after tomorrow i said she grinned it was a lovely grin and made her beautiful wonderful she said an hour later gelon sat on my couch you are taking my dano home he said i had thought to keep her longer i shrugged she asked me i said he nodded but you will return he asked of course i said people tell me you are having armour made by anaxsikles he said i smiled he is perhaps the finest armourer in the greek world i said gelon frowned he is after all just a smith i understand you have spent time with him why does his conversation fascinate you dangerous ground were plotting to steal your mistress he was once my apprentice i said gelon recoiled as if he had been struck i am not only a merchant and former slave but i am a master bronzesmith i said you are a man of many faces he said he was clearly displeased his displeasure meant little to me and it occurred to me that if he discussed me with lydia he might learn a little too much i have had complaints about your black man he said my black man that wouldnt go over well even as a joke in our inn my friend doola i said carefully if you must the african merchant his contempt was so deeprooted as to be offensive he charges outrageous amounts for tin i have been asked to seize your cargo and sell it at a fair price would that be the carthaginian price i asked he laughed you know full well that they are boycotting us ahh i see you make game of me i shrugged yes and no my lord i wonder if the merchants who want our tin understand the risks we took to get it or would be willing to take those risks themselves yet my understanding is that your doola now holds all the tin in the city and demands almost twice the carthaginian price he shrugged the mechanics of trade bore me but the adventure of it would not my lord we sailed the outer ocean and made war on carthage every day to take that tin i knew what he admired and what he would accept too he smiled just a little this is why i will allow no merchant to vote in the assembly they are men without a single noble thought whatever i might have felt inside i merely nodded it was the only role i played in the sale of the tin yet i suspect it was important enough while i worried about lydia and spent money on armour doola had not merely sold tin he had followed a strategy like a military campaign selling tin only to traders who were leaving the city with their cargoes like the athenians and using the profits to buy all the other tin there wasnt much but he bought the illyrian tin and the etruscan tin that trickled into the city he bought most of it on credit because when you have fifty ingots of tin in your warehouses everyone is willing to give you credit while i lay on a kline with the tyrant talking of politics doola owned all the tin in syracusa almost all the tin on sicily and then in the decisive battle of the campaign he sold it to six buyers as he had up the coast at katania selling simultaneously to each of them at the same price the next morning i was up late i walked up into the town and found the craftsmens gymnasium it had been closed by order of the tyrant it turned out allowing little men to exercise was apparently as wrong as allowing them a voice in government i asked around for polimarchos eventually i gave up and asked anarchos who shook his head the fighter he asked no idea i had forgotten him so when i stood on anaxsikles shop floor with his apprentices measuring me with calipers i asked him he thought a while i wonder if he didnt go off to sybaris he said i think i remember him getting an offer from a rich man to train him in arms oh i said or something equally foolish when you are young you expect everything to remain as it was while you change as you grow older you realize that nothing stays the same ten days anaxsikles said ill work on it myself ten days i said a helmet alone will take that much time he grinned ahh now who is the master what colour do you want your horsehair red black and white you ungrateful pup truly anaxsikles made me feel better and i cant explain precisely why i made the rounds of the town i bought myself a new sword and a pair of spears and i bought arms for giannis better and finer than what id made i armed megakles as a hoplite i put seckla in a fine corselet i met neoptolymos going into anaxsikles shop as i was coming out and we both laughed you said we were taking me home neoptolymos said i thought it was time to look the part were all rich or so i understand it was great fun to spend money like water on beautiful things the run to croton was beautiful all the way the weather was startlingly fine as it can be on the east coast of sicily once in a while the moist haze lifted the skies were blue and the wind mostly west of north so that the rowers had little of which to complain we coasted to katania and ate lobster coasted again until we were opposite rhegium and then crossed the straits effortlessly as if such a thing was easy next day we coasted east along the base of the boot of italy there are rich towns all along that coast and we lived well paid silver and even the oarsmen ill wager enjoyed the trip i have said before that few things are as good for a crew as an attractive but unavailable woman dano was a fine sailor delighted by every aspect of life at sea and she insisted on rowing one afternoon simply to see if she could two of her ladies joined her she didnt strip to the waist to the disappointment of the crew at night she sang and men came from all the fires to listen to her or to her slaves and ladies pythagoreans make no distinction of rank when they eat or speak so she discoursed on philosophy to any oarsman who approached her the food was good the wine was better and the company excellent doola was as pleased as a craftsman at the completion of a noble work and we were all as rich as croesus great days it was a different greatness from marathon or the heady days of the ionian revolt i remember lying one night on a beach i think we were a day east of rhegium and thinking as i passed the wine to doola that this was how life was supposed to be friends whatever will we do next i asked were too young to lie on our laurels doola laughed home to massalia and make babies he said buy a farm and get fat gaius joined his laughter i have two fine daughters who barely know me he said and enough money that i need never leave them again i will build a temple and restore my familys power and prestige neoptolymos nodded i will take back my castle and my people and raise strong sons and raid greeks he said daud shook his head i dont really want to go home any more he admitted settle in massalia then doola said lots of room he looked around doesnt anyone but me miss demetrios i nodded i do daud said we should find him make peace he looked around not everyone agreed sittonax fingered his beard im not ready to settle down he smiled and what of you ari are you done will you stop being a seawolf i remember smiling around at them i would that it could be like this for ever triumph after triumph adventure after adventure but i am growing older and my sword hand will slow i think i will go back to plataea after neoptolymos is safe in his mountains and see what awaits me doola looked blank you wont return to massalia i shrugged who knows what the future holds i said dano was good company i admit that some days i wanted to bed her and then other days i thought of her as a companion not a woman hah make of that what you will at croton she was very nearly a queen she feasted us in her home seven warriors eating vegetables because as everyone knows the pythagoreans eat no meat she spent an evening telling us what the pythagoreans do believe which is complex and made me vaguely uncomfortable it seemed to me and still does faintly blasphemous at the core of their beliefs lies the tenet that the human soul the very essence of a man or woman is indestructible and endures from aeon to aeon so that a man is reborn again and again in a different body with different parents perhaps greek in one generation and aethiopian in another that much is easily understood but after that it grows more complex they believe that the reward of a good life is to go on to a better life and that the curse of an illlived life is to go down the ladder as they say so that a bad man might be reborn as a dog of this i have the greatest doubts how can one cow live a life more filled with cowarete than another cow and thus earn a higher step on the ladder perhaps i needed to sit longer at danos feet and worship on the third night we stayed late and i sat at her feet quite literally some of her followers and friends had come to meet me and the others and they were brilliant people well educated handsome and very ungreek men and women lay together on couches for dinner and after men lay with men and women with women and all of them seemed like family to all the others yet at the same time they didnt seem to me to treat their slaves any better than any other group of people they were all rich at least by the standards of plataea and had many of the vices and attitudes of the rich if their women were freer than greek women let me add that greek aristocratic women are also very free it was pleasant but far more alien than a similar visit to a keltoi hall or a cretan lord many of them owned all their belongings in common which sounds remarkable but in truth they had so much and so much surplus that i doubt the sharing was ever very onerous i ramble i was delighted with dano but not with her world i didnt enjoy eating vegetables without meat indeed i slipped away every day and ate pork in a taverna by my ship but that last evening as i lay beside dano and she was facing her friend thanis and had her back to me her hips pressed against mine she took my hand as she never had before and pressed it against her stomach while chatting the invitation was clear later while most of the guests were leaving she took me aside you could stay here and be one of us she said you are a natural aristocrat a man of worth leave the world and join us i am not sure i could stop eating meat i said pah she said and wrinkled her nose i can smell it on you even now but despite that i think you might find compensations you have all by yourself changed my view of your heraclitus you have a good mind and good discernment you could be one of us with me i kissed her it was not enough it didnt move me particularly i am hard put to explain what was wrong my body found her attractive enough my mind found her mind attractive enough perhaps i had grown too old for love that is certainly what i thought i kissed her my tongue roving automatically my performance barren of meaning oh the horrors of age i cursed inside at my lack of passion she broke away she seemed as unmoved as i it is your decision she said with a smile that was a little more brittle than before you would be welcome here the next day we sailed for syracusa and she didnt see me off anarchos had nothing for me i confess that i threatened him something about my failure my failure even to make love to an attractive woman made lydias happiness more important perhaps i was cursed by aphrodite that was secklas opinion he was unimpressed by my threats he laughed in my face well there you are two bad men locked in a pointless contest i went back the next day and apologized i can save her i said weakly so can i anarchos said bitterly but i dont because she wont save herself does she love the tyrant i asked he shrugged i sighed ill return in the spring i said he nodded and extended a hand i hear you are very rich now he said i laughed now or perhaps again i reached under my cloak heres your initial investment with a sizeable return he eyes the leather bag id given him gold for his silver and a magnificent alban pearl id picked up he rolled it in his hand congratulations he said i admire your fights with the carthaginians you could come along sometime i said ill be fighting in the spring he patted his waist not likely but i might build a privateer to go with you would you stomach that if his captain obeyed i said we shook on it i collected my armour from anaxsikles in the same hour that neoptolymos tried his men said we were like achilles and hector standing side by side we glittered with all the new bronze now if you consider in all my life i have been armed in the arms of dead men or in my own work this was the first panoply id ever had that was all the work of one man purposemade for me glorious like the sword and the spears that went with it i had thigh guards and arm guards upper and lower and ankle guards rendering me proof against any chance blow in a ship fight a solidbronze thorax and a helmet with folding cheekpieces and greaves that fitted up over the knee like a bronze skin a shop boy held a mirror and i looked at myself a man of bronze i ran up and down the street in it to the delight of a hundred small boys despite the old wound i ran well although neoptolymos ran better and we threw our spears and even fenced a bit with our swords and the crowd roared with pleasure remember this was a society at the edge of war with mighty carthage they were afraid afraid they would lose and seeing us friendly foreigners who would help gave them heart ah it was glorious last of all i went to see gelon he seemed scarcely to remember me which was odd i explained that i was returning to massalia and he was uninterested until i said i would be back in the spring with five ships it is my intention to strike the carthaginian trade in the adriatic i said if you prefer i can touch at rhegium rather than here i know your relations with carthage are delicate he nodded oh come here he said will your five ships support me when we are at war yes i said he nodded then let us not mince words we are at war with carthage now and with persia there is a rumour that xerxes is now great king and has sent an ambassador to carthage to demand they make war against us to destroy the greek world i nodded i have heard this rumour before i said it is something men say i doubt the great king even knows where syracusa is he frowned yet athens intends to send an embassy here to ask for our support against persia he said my eyebrows shot up oh yes plataean it has come to that he drank wine athens has more than a hundred ships to put in the water all triremes yet i have half as many again when all the cities of magna greca support me he nodded i will be hegemon of the league against persia wait and see i couldnt see this idealist being invited by athens to command a rowing boat in a race but he believed himself a great man and indeed despite my dislike of him yes i had decided i disliked him he had greatness in him as for promising my ships to support him i assumed that we would how could i have seen how it would all fall out the truth is that like many greeks i never imagined what was coming to men of my generation lade and marathon settled everything lade gave persia the upper hand in asia and marathon denied them greece that business was finished in retrospect i should have known of all men where we were headed and at what speed we sailed for massalia near the end of the season rich fat and sleek gaius went back to rome and we feasted with him and his delighted wife for three days before dropping down the tiber and racing north we worried every day and every night about a carthaginian squadron and we met none massalia seemed very small after the summer in syracusa dionysus was delighted to see us he had taken three merchantmen over the summer and was eager to take part in our adriatic adventure in the spring he was as ever a hard drillmaster and our rowers cursed him all winter as they sat on benches on a freezing beach lifting weighted oars and doing other exercises meant to keep their bodies hard we trained too i tried to remember all that polimarchos had taught me and i had men lifting heavy stones fencing with sticks practising taking and defending ships large and small we had two months of heavy icy rain and dionysus kept us at it i think some of the oarsmen would have killed him if they thought they could have got away with it but it was not all work we celebrated feasts like rich men we built the first stone temple in our small settlement and many of our men rebuilt their homes in stone vasileos rebuilt our carthaginian capture making her a lighter ship and slightly longer we hired more marines from all over the tyrrhenian sea most of them etruscans we had some latins too big tough men i threw myself into exercise it appeared to me that this was my last adventure i felt old that winter with aches in my hands and knees that wouldnt go away i had no interest in women and little in wine or song it seemed to me that the compass of the world was drawing in smaller and smaller and that after one more raid i would go back to plataea and be an average smith and die there and that seemed to me just how the gods must have laughed just before the spring feast of demeter dionysus rode over from massalia to tell us that a sikel fishing boat had come in with rumour of a heavy carthaginian squadron cruising our coast so we got our hulls out of their ship sheds and into the water my lydia and neoptolymos eleuthera i had megakles as my helmsman and neoptolymos had vasileos our crews were veterans and our marines were if i may say so superb all fully armoured and all in the peak of training we couldnt wait to get our beaks into some carthaginians we rowed out for a stormy day our bows into the wind and came home lashed by rain and never had a sniff of the carthaginians of course we never had more than a sixstade sight line either so it would have been poseidons will if we had seen them but we slept dry at home with sentries on the headlands and food and wine which was more than any raiding squadron was getting and we were off the beach again the next morning when the air was still brisk and the sun not even a streak of salmon pink on the eastern horizon we ran along the coast to massalia and landed at noon dionysus was ready with two ships we spent three days training rowing out towards the northern point of sardinia until we could see the headland and then performing manoeuvres line to column column to line changing stroke changing direction reversing benches my oarsmen were openly discussing killing dionysus it was lade in miniature except that i was a much better trierarch myself and knew that the standard dionysus set was perfectly reasonable listen thugater its like this if you take a warship to sea spend the summer rowing up and down the coast looking for the enemy and raiding his pastures and then finally meet up in the fall well your rowers and your marines have in fact spent three or four months training getting hard every direction change every squadron manoeuvre gets them better all dionysus did was to insist that we be as good as autumn sailors in the spring by packing a lot of drills into the first week at sea but such things were innovations then young phormio does it all the time these days or so im given to understand as usual i digress but it is important to understand how untrained crews were usually in the spring wed worked all winter i suspect i was the only pirate in the whole circuit of the inner sea who paid his crew through the winter i had never really done it before when i worked for miltiades we fed our oarsmen all winter but we didnt train them they just drank and er did what oarsmen do when theres a town available anyway three days at sea and never a sign or report of the carthaginian squadron we went back to our home ports for two days rest and then we were at it again this time we cruised west along the coast the mountains rising away to the north and the sea spring blue and clean beneath us two days west and we sighted a pair of warships to the south and gave chase they fled and we rowed like madmen all of us even me oh how i remember that chase two days at sea and we rowed and rowed and we were the better men finally they turned west just at sunset the second day and ran ashore and we were so close behind them that we landed in the froth of their oars and had our marines ashore before they could draw up their ships but they were etruscans how we laughed there on the beach they laughed too with the sudden relief of men at the edge of death we were poorer by the value of their ships but that twoday chase put us in fine condition most men will only train so hard when theres no real threat but offer them a prize on the horizon we were already a third of the way down the coast to the tiber so we camped with our etruscans for a night and set off south in the morning now a powerful fleet of six ships the etruscans were veii and ostensibly at sea to protect their citys shipping i suspect they had in mind a little piracy we left them at the mouth of the tiber and rowed upstream to rome where gaius was like a man awakened by his friends for exercise surely youve had this experience eh a friend sleeps late you arrive for your morning run and he pretends hes ready you know what im talking about gaiuss ship was still on stocks and his oarsmen had spent the winter making babies and propping his new vineyards so we set a rendezvous and went back to sea north of the straits we picked up a carthaginian merchantman he surrendered at once but swore he was part of a convoy for sardinia we had six days until our rendezvous so we rowed east along the north shore of sicily looking for the convoy we swept for eight days and found nothing we left our carthaginian prisoners on their own coast of sicily i watched demetrioss homeport go by under my lee and considered dropping down for a chat he had to be there but sometimes it is best to leave a man alone so we rowed north to ostia two days there see i have the logs two days there and our crews were sick the place is deeply unhealthy and the spring mosquitoes were brutal and men were fevered and no sign of gaius dionysus grew angry and threatened to leave us we were drinking in a waterfront taverna so filthy that i had my pais wipe our table down with his chlamys which he then threw onto a heap of filth rather than wear one of the porne who served the wine picked it up and put it on when achilles said it was better to be the slave of a bad master than king of the dead he hadnt seen porne in ostia it was an oppressive place i sent doola upstream in a small boat while i kept the squadron together by force of will a dozen of my own carefully trained oarsmen deserted or wandered off or simply got sick two days later doola returned alone hell join us later in the summer doola said he scowled which was unlike him hes a great man now doola said dionysus snorted and later that night gave full vent to his feelings wasted time lost oarsmen disease suffering the missed chance of a great capture but the gods meant us to be there that night a dancer came to our taverna we were surly drunks but she was a finelooking woman not young but in high training with muscled legs and arms she danced beautifully some foreign dance that was just enough like our womens dances at home to make me weep winesoaked tears we showered her with money and she smirked and the tavernas porne cursed her and glared the tavernas owner a surprisingly young and innocentlooking villain caught the woman unawares and tried to take her earnings he didnt even bother to threaten her he just grabbed the front of her chiton she threw him over her hip and slammed his head on the dirt floor my lads cheered and threw more money she bowed and smiled she was missing some teeth and was none too clean but in ostia she looked like a fine courtesan she bowed and did a little skip on her feet seckla hooted seckla let me say again doola grinned at me megakles stood up and yelled show us your tits sorry ladies but that was his speed and he was a sailor our dancer smiled and pulled her chiton over her head as easily as a snake wriggling out of its skin and stood naked one hand on her hip she had a matching pair of bruises inside her thighs and a nasty cut at the top of her right thigh but otherwise she was the bestlooking woman any sailor needed to see in ostia or anywhere else we roared and more coins were tossed she reached out and grabbed seckla and kissed him and hooked his chlamys off his shoulder and wrapped herself in it she was grinning the innkeeper started to get off the floor she flicked one nicely arched foot at him and it caught him on the temple and he was out quite a performance she collected her coins showing a great deal of herself doing little acrobatics like walking on her hands naked to pick up coins and doing the splits and backwards handsprings and such stuff she put the coins into a bag around her waist that seemed to be her only permanent possession this process went on a long time because men threw more money and she had to come up with ever more inventive methods of picking it up finally she pulled secklas cloak around her and suddenly with a spring she was sitting on the bench across from me where i sat beside dionysus you two are the captains yes she asked dionysus shrugged yes he said i pointed at neoptolymos who was very carefully not looking hes a captain sos young achilles there achilles was dionysus hardbitten second achilles whose real name was teukes gave me a mock glare he was older than any of us and calling him young achilles was well teasing of a sort hah hah at any rate she leaned across the table and i couldnt really keep my eyes on her face if you take my meaning i was old but not so very old i have something to sell she said with a wink im sure any man in this room will buy i said she shook her head not that i dont sell that what do you think i am a whore im a dancer listen trierarchs i have something to sell the value of it wont last she shrugged a lovely motion dionysus was quicker witted than i information he asked she smiled at him perhaps she said reaching up to put her hair back up it takes a superior courage to be a woman alone in a room full of pirates wearing nothing but a borrowed cloak and dickering over the price of information i couldnt do it are you a slave i asked she raised her eyebrows on and off she said she shrugged just now i own myself tell me your information and ill tell you what its worth i suggested she smiled you have a special herb and i wont ever get pregnant she shot back youll pay tomorrow your rich aunt just died and you havent got the bequest yet how did you know i asked she leered dont be like this i have something amazing to relate and you are my only customers by aphrodite gentlemen how much do you want then dionysus asked a talent in gold she looked back and forth evaluating our reactions ten silver drachma would seem to be more your price dionysus said ten silver mina she said wait i said is this shipping information i asked she grew demure perhaps on this coast i asked she looked down no but by aphrodite gentlemen its an opportunity for wealth beyond she shook her head howd you get it then i asked a gentleman friend told me some things she said smiling navarchs dont actually whisper secrets to porne dionysus said his voice hard go and ply your trade with the others woman she looked at me why you two are heroes i want to tell you death to carthage eh we all hate the bastards why cant i make a killing with you dionysus caught her pinned her hand to the table and put a knife against her wrist hey she said and then the confidence went out of her i wager this is a trap dionysus said you are far too expensive and far too out of place to be here who told you to come here she wriggled damn you every porne on the waterfront knows who you are and how much cash you have i know something worth knowing i wont give it for free dionysus rolled his dagger blade over her wrist and she whimpered he was a cruel bastard in fact he liked inflicting pain it wasnt just that he was a strong leader he liked watching his men suffer when he trained them i can maim your hand he said or your face or have every oarsman on my ships fuck you till you die now talk whore i can be a hard man ive killed a lot of men and some women but this sort of thing sickened me on the other hand i was fairly sure dionysus was right seckla on the other hand was watching and he wasnt having any of it let her go he said lurching up to our table in drunken arete dionysus pushed the blade down harder she moaned im not seckla pulled at her hand im sure he didnt mean to cause her more pain but he rotated her body and she screamed fuck you you bastards im not lying dionysus leaned back and let her go she snatched her hand away and nursed it against her breast she seemed smaller and dirtier she began to cry why she asked looking at me why did he have to do that ill slit your nose next dionysus said he leaned back and motioned a porne for wine he looked at me you cant believe any of this i rubbed my beard dionysus rolled his eyes even as seckla tired to comfort the dancer and she kept away from him listen if you want this woman lean her against the wall and take her from behind so you dont have to listen to the shit that spews from her mouth he laughed its a door that opens and closes a great deal i shook my head she has a fair amount of courage i said i want to hear her information she turned and threw herself at my knees please she said i will i raised a hand listen to my terms you want to offer us a target yes she nodded emphatically a rich target so i said you come along as our guest i will make you some guarantees swear oaths with you you will receive a share of our take when we make the capture not before she shrank away never go to sea on a pirate ship you must think im simple she laughed it was a terrible laugh thats not the way i want to die raped to death by criminals her eyes flickered to dionysus i thought you were different the heroes of lades and marathon she spat dionysus shrugged i think arimnestos is too kind he said she spat on the floor my curse on all your kind she said and ran out of the taverna seckla glowered at me i nodded go and chase her down and make her a better offer i suggested he stumbled after the dancer now i dont think seckla had shown interest in five women in his entire life up until then so you may find my choice odd but women can be sensitive to these things and seckla was not a hard man seckla suffered every time he had to fight every wound he inflicted sat on him he was only with us because of his love for me and for neoptolymos and doola and daud he followed her into the edge of darkness i remember telling dionysus that he was a right bastard i remember him telling me i was a fool in the morning seckla was sleeping with the woman wrapped in his arms on a palliasse of straw under the upturned hull of the lydia she was as pretty in the morning rising from her blankets as she was in the night and as naked she ran into the water and bathed and wrapped herself in secklas chlamys and planted herself in front of me ill come i lift my curse trierarch i offer my apologies but your friend hurt my wrist something cruel seckla and i have made a deal seckla said i gave her my word she gets the same share that i get i was staggered seckla listen lady without meaning to dicker he cant offer you the same share he has not without seven men voting to agree i glared at him she can have my share then seckla said well split it she said her eyes were interesting she could be cold as well as cold as a warrior or quite the passionate thing shed settled her claws into seckla and i couldnt decide if she was a porne or not in her heart i mean in fact she was dionysus came up she slipped behind seckla good morning young lady he said he looked at me slit her throat and lets be on our way she stepped back he grinned seckla stepped up to him fists clenched dionysus however was twenty years his senior and had a dignity not usually found in pirates although come to think of it let her alone seckla said its a trap dionysus said one of the carthaginians youve robbed is setting you up or that fellow whats his name who enslaved the lot of you dagon i said while i loathed dagon and wanted him under the edge of my sword i didnt really think of him all that often and i didnt see him as well as intelligent enough to plan something like this he was sly crafty evil but not capable of setting a trap with of all unlikely allies a woman i looked at the dancer whats your name i asked men call me despoina she said when i made a face she shrugged i was born to geaeta where i asked athens she said i shrugged beware i said i know athens fairly well really she said id have said you were a boeotian bumpkin who had visited once or twice not bad i allowed tell me where the bronzesmiths gather the temple of hephaestos on the hill below the areopagus she said whats the rostra i asked she rolled her eyes anyone knows that the speakers stone in the pnyx how did miltiades die i asked his wound festered while cimon tried to raise the money for his debts she said i looked at the ground damn i said my emotion must have showed her eyes softened dont tell me you really are the great plataean she laughed come on arimnestos of plataea is dead everyone says so she looked at me i wish i could ask you about plataea how is it with aristides i asked she shrugged were not exactly bosom friends she allowed what are you doing in magna greca i asked she looked around men were watching from a distance i was sold she said she raised her face defiantly i was a free woman but i was sold as a porne i ran and got caught they sold me to a carthaginian she shrugged i lived they didnt know i could swim i jumped over the side at rhegium im bettertrained than any kid on this coast betterlooking too she shrugged and i wont be a slave again and i dont open and shut for free either she looked at dionysus a pretty story he said fuck you pirate she said his fist smashed into her cheek and she fell speak respectfully whore he said i am not your equal women who sell their bodies are so much lower than men who kill for money she spat from the sand he looked at me while seckla fumed dont imagine seckla was too much the coward to fight for his woman it was more complex than that dionysus was a superior officer and also an old friend of mine and seckla didnt trust his sleeping companion yet anyway dionysus looked at me im inclined to try her he said if its a trap well fight our way out i said i remember grinning he shrugged the best way to get out of a trap is never to enter it we need gaius i said i looked at the woman who was rubbing her cheek dionysus liked to hit women id figured that out despoina how much time do we have she considered rebellion i saw it on her face she considered telling us all to fuck ourselves she had a lot of pride and a lot of arrogance for a woman whod been so ill used but good sense won out if you believe me you need to catch them at the new moon she said that gave us two weeks where i asked softly i held her eyes do we have a deal i split secklas share she breathed if you tell the truth and we get a prize you will have a sizeable share i said not less in value than one half of secklas share is that agreeable and i guarantee your body your person and your freedom on my oath to zeus the god of kings and free men and i offer you bread and wine hospitality and guest friendship from my house to yours until my heirs and yours are all shades in elysium i held out my hand unless you betray me or mine in which case by the same oath i will hunt you like the furies and cut your throat seckla nodded at her and gave her a small smile he means it she smiled back and took my hand deal she said dionysus snorted in disgust new carthage she said the tin fleet carthage got her tin from iberia as ive mentioned four times a year when the iberians had filled the carthaginian warehouses they sent a fleet to pick up the tin and sail it home half a dozen round ships guarded closely by a squadron of galleys this was well i wont call it common knowledge it was uncommon knowledge shippers tin miners bronzesmiths and pirates knew it id say that the carthaginians kept the movement of the tin fleets secret but that wouldnt do justice to how secret they kept it they didnt want the greeks to know where the tin came from or how much there was most merchants even tin traders thought that the tin came from etrusca or illyria or some hazy point outside the gates of heracles geaeta had quite a story an adventure of her own with knifefights lovemaking and clever escapades worthy of odysseus i even believed a few of the stories she had courage and strong muscles and i can witness that those two things alone can win you free of slavery her story the parts that made sense and i believed was complex she had started the spring sailing season in a slave pen in carthago and gone west in a consignment to new carthage a colony on the inner sea coast of iberia facing the balearic islands she said that she was sold off to a brothel there and two weeks later the first ships of the spring tin convoy had arrived all badly stormdamaged by a freak spring storm in the strait they were all afraid and angry she said all the owners all the rich men she shrugged your friend says navarchs dont talk to porne maybe maybe not his kind she spat but most men talk and good friends a pair of them will hire a pair of girls you know together she shrugged and the men will chat while she shrugged again i got the captain of one of the round ships she said he had had quite a scare thats when men talk the most he almost lost his ship and his life he went to the temple four times while he was staying in my room she shrugged smiled he wanted me she made a face pride and revulsion together he wanted me every hour of the day and night besotted he was so he paid a bribe to the brothel owner so that i could come with him to carthage and back he was being sent for replacement oarsmen and all sorts of chandlery that new carthage didnt have she met my eyes the day we left news came that the other survivors of the tin fleet had returned to gades and that we could expect them in fifteen days at the new moon she looked around it was the evening of our second day at sea shed told the story enough times that it had a polished ring to it that made her sound like a liar the problem was that she was a damned good storyteller and that didnt actually help her veracity gaius now a surly somewhat domineering roman magnate who clearly didnt want to go to sea that summer shook his head dionysus is right he said you cant believe a word she says seckla spat i believe her he said gaius made an obscene suggestion as to exactly why he believed her and daud laughed and laughed it was good to hear the keltoi man laugh he had been silent for so long his second brush with slavery had all but ruined his cheerful disposition leaving him dour howd you come to be in ostia daud asked when he was done laughing i jumped ship at rhegium she said why exactly i asked i mean why would a carthaginian ship bound for carthage ever come anywhere near rhegium she shrugged how would i know she said im not a great sailor when we were at sea hed um make use of me when he pleased and otherwise the boat went up and down men ran about and the oarsmen all watched me like cats watch rats i swore id never go to sea again gaius pursed his lips and scrated his red hair im leaving my farms at a touchy time to be killed by the carthaginians he said perhaps if im lucky ill only be a slave geaeta looked pointedly at his waistline at least you know you wont be sold to a brothel she said gaius wasnt used to being talked to that way much less by a mere woman he stomped off that night dionysus said to me shes either real or shes the most gifted actress ive ever seen i agreed i believed her most of the time of course it was possible it was all plausible ships go off course but an unarmed merchant ship headed for carthage should have avoided the north coast of sicily the greek coast like a plague he should have run south and coasted africa on the other hand she was just the kind of girl who got the trierarchs in a brothel not a broken spirit in a vaguely fleshy body but a passionate woman with good looks and a mouth if i owned a brothel id buy a dozen of her hah sorry ladies a man can dream we coasted northern sicily secretly every night when i landed i asked the men of the towns whether theyd ever seen geaeta before or a ship bearing her none had she said shed never landed in any of them of course a round ship is more at the mercy of the winds and poseidons whims and never has to land it can carry food and water for weeks all of her story was plausible we landed next on the south coast of sardinia close enough to home to think about chucking the whole thing but we didnt the prospect of riches can be as intoxicating as wine south of sardinia we picked up a pair of carthaginian traders half a day apart i caught one and dionysus caught the other neither skipper knew anything about a tin convoy but both admitted there had been a ferocious storm in the straits of heracles a month before their cargoes were valuable grain in one and olive oil and hides in the other we concentrated the cargoes into one of them and put a dozen men aboard under giannis and sent her north to massalia and went west with the second capture filled to the gunwales with water and dried fish a crew of fishermen under vasileos sailing her with our consort to provide food for a thousand rowers we managed to make the fiveday crossing to the balearics in three days with seven hundred and fifty mythemnoi of food and as much water no fleet could have done it but a handful of pirates listen ive made dionysus sound like a monster in the matter of the girl he wasnt a nice man he had fine ethics but didnt apply them to women at all but he was an excellent sailor a fine navigator and he planned i learned on that trip how to calculate food expenditure off alba we had a round ship in consort but we hadnt used her for food dionysus method allowed a squadron of triremes to keep on the sea virtually for ever as long as the owners were rich enough to buy stores a thousand men eat a lot nine days out of ostia and we were on a beach on the south coast of the balearics id landed there before and i liked the beach and then we were away south we cruised warily off ebusus and landed on a tiny islet and then we slipped off the beach in the first light of a newminted summer day and crossed to the iberian coast and worked our way along with a favourable wind for two more days the second evening a pair of local boats saw us from seaward as we were landing dionysus was off the beach in a flash and he took them both no fishing boat can outrun a warship as i had reason to remember we ate their fish as the crews sat disconsolate dionysus and i questioned the two fishing captains they knew new carthage and feared it it was clear nether knew anything about the tin fleet both expected to die neither knew anything about a big squadron of carthaginian triremes setting a trap for pirates either to be frank dionysus was planning to kill them all but i insisted we leave them there on the beach alive well not all of them four men volunteered to row with my ship i took them we were off into an overcast morning of light rain we crept down the coast the wind was wrong so we rowed into a light headwind our fiveship squadron spread across thirty stades of sea so that we would sweep up any ship we might want to catch it was midafternoon when neoptolymos he had a carthaginian ship so he was the most landward of the sweep signalled that he could see new carthage an hour later the town was visible in the haze her red tile roofs glinting against the rising redbrown of the hills behind the town the harbour was empty so were the seas after fifteen days of frenetic rowing and planning and training and sailing our disappointment was palpable i had to admit that we hadnt planned for the situation that confronted us we planned either to fight our way out of an ambush or swoop down on our prey in fact we found a fortified town with a heavily walled inner harbour empty nor was there a powerful naval squadron waiting for us in the fading ruddy light i rowed up alongside dionysus and hailed him have you cut her throat yet he asked i laughed no she says were late or early he said i dont like it the whole towns empty now what i asked now we take the next ship in he said that didnt take as long as i feared we stayed at sea all night ate cold rations from our merchantman and the dawn showed us a phoenician ship under oars coming up from the darkness to the south and east from the coast of africa neoptolymos dropped down and took her with only a cursory fight i winced to watch neoptolymos a decent man slam his fist repeatedly into the captured phoenician trierarch torturing prisoners is cowardly to me i didnt like what i was seeing heh then he was brought aboard my ship it was hasdrubal he had a bad cut under one eye and another on a corner of his mouth which was ripped open by repeated blows even as he landed on my deck neoptolymos who followed him over the side hit him again the illyrian laughed mirthlessly i cant stop hitting him he said make him stop pleaded the carthaginian he didnt recognize me id like to say that i stopped neoptolymos from tormenting the man who was already broken listen theres limits i try to be the man that heraclitus taught and not the thug i might have been but sometimes an hour passed dionysus dropped onto my deck he looked down at the wreckage of a human body on my ship he laughed i thought you were too soft for this life he said ares kill him he looked at me a little sickened i could tell he enslaved us i said he killed neoptolymoss sister dionysus nodded looked away have you vengeful furies even asked him about the tin fleet he asked neoptolymos nodded he passed it two days ago headed east under full sail the same wind that wed rowed into dionysus nodded lets chase them he said gently this is a waste of time he picked up hasdrubal and threw him over the rail into the sea without asking us neoptolymos growled i seemed to awaken sometimes when i fancy myself a better man then other men i think of two things from the ten years between plataea and artemisium i think of how i treated lydia i think of what i did to hasdrubal he didnt even scream when he hit the water he sank unable even to swim choked and drowned slowly i hope all of his marines had been killed and of course dagon wasnt aboard his ship was a small merchant galley of fifty oars with the usual collection of broken men as oarsmen men hed played his own role in breaking no doubt as soon as neoptolymoss marines came down the gangway the oarsmen had ripped the rest of the crew asunder it is odd that there are so many bad captains as the payback is so ruthless we took the ship and the oarsmen it was ballasted in wine for the western stations so we gave our oarsmen good african wine every night as we ate salt fish and rowed and sailed east we tried every trick we wet our sails to take the breeze when it was coming over our sterns and we sailed on a quarterreach with both boatsail and mainsail drawing together a rare point of sailing even in our rig and very fast so that for a whole day we made perhaps thirty stades an hour we had advantages and disadvantages we knew where our quarry was going and elected to cut the corner they would have crossed directly to africa while we went on a long hypotenuse slanting away east southeast we were neither lucky nor unlucky in our winds and of course our quarry had the same winds best of all we knew about them and they we hoped knew nothing of us dionysus knew the waters better than i and he was making for hippo on the north shore of africa about six hundred stades from carthage this was more bluewater sailing than most of our oarsmen had ever seen we were lucky to have so many veterans from our adventures in the outer sea sailors like nothing better than to tell a shipmate this aint nothing brother and i stood between the oars on the third night the taste of salt anchovies barely drowned in wine on my tongue listening to my oarsmen you aint seen nothing mate said xenos a fishermans son from massalia we were nine days at sea off iberia the outer sea coast of iberia mate in a storm so bad men cut their wrists rather than face another day as poseidon is my witness and when we tried to run from gaul to alba says another voice in the darkness poseidon blew us over the edge of the world and then what happened asked a sceptic a titan blew us back said the storyteller im here aint i five days at sea even with the prospect of boundless riches sailors will eventually tire of bad food and backbreaking labour even sailors five days of rowing for the most part we were low on water and out of food men spoke poems in praise of bread no lie bread is the thing you miss most at sea well many men were missing something else geaeta was not inhibited by the presence of two hundred crewmen and secklas continuing education at her hands and more was noisy demonstrative and sometimes annoyingly emotive i have said before that a woman especially a desirable but unavailable woman aboard a ship is a fine thing for morale but to be sure a desirable and sexually active woman aboard a ship with two hundred men just makes the one hundred and ninetynine more difficult myself i took to pulling my cloak around my head despite the heat i wont say the crew was near mutiny merely that i thought it possible that seckla would be murdered i confined him to the sailors deck amidships and read geaeta my best speech on being a shipmate she laughed but obeyed she knew that she was still on sufferance most men believed her story now i did but she understood another day we finished the water we sighted land wed sighted it for days but that evening dionysus laid alongside and told me that we were hundreds of stades short of our landfall and that we had to land anyway i knew that in the last light of a summer evening we rowed into a river mouth we rowed until the water was fresh and drank it straight from the stream reaching through the oarports to drink out of wooden cups the water was brackish not even fresh but men were badly dehydrated and most of them drank and pissed it away immediately pardon my frankness but we were close to the edge we landed in the darkness put a guard over the wine and slept in the morning the marines caught a shepherd boy who said we were west of kissia dionysus shook his head poseidon hates us were hopelessly behind morale plummeted things might have gone ill but we made a landfall got water and sent the shepherd for his father and paid silver for the whole flock and ate it too next morning full of mutton we rowed east we stood well out as we passed kissia which had a pair of triremes on her open beach i proposed we burn them on the beach but gaius wanted to go home and dionysus wanted to try for the tin fleet for two more days right up to the walls of carthage we landed that night with the twinkling lights of hippo in the distance and the smell of their fires in our nostrils in the morning when the sun rose we saw that her harbour was full of ships full of ships dionysus turned and hugged his helmsman most of the men on our ship hugged geaeta sixteen ships though wed chased a gazelle and caught a lion the bay of hippo stretches a good sixty stades from promontory to promontory forming a superb natural harbour with shelving beaches running into the fertile lands above the city is really three or four communities all the way around the halfmoon curve theres a fishing village a sailors village with wine shops and an entrepreneurial agora theres a fine town with walls and homes for the rich and theres a slave town that stretches along the downwind side of the beach if i keep telling this story ill eventually tell you how i came to know hippo and carthage so well but for the moment just take my word for it top up my wine lad ah lesbian wine when it crosses my lips i feel young again where was i ah we sighted the carthaginian tin fleet dionysus was a shipslength ahead of me we were under oars the wind heading us as it had for ten days there was a commotion aboard my ship and doola came aft to tell me that dionysus was standing on his stern platform and asking for me i ran forward along the gangway i ordered the marines into their armour as i went my heart beat fast and my old well lets call it what it is eh my old greed for glory was suddenly there so much for maturity i ran onto the bow platform dionysus hailed me from his stern and bellowed lets take them even as he called he was turning his ship megakles was following him and the oars were in perfect order with doola sounding the time as seckla put him in his thorax i stood on tiptoe on the bow rail for a long breath the enemy ships were not in supporting range why would they be they were a day out from home in a carthaginian port not in the face of the enemy and who had ten warships to come after their fleet we had five their warships were mostly clustered at the western end of the crescent the seven big tin freighters were three stades farther east opposite the agora it was early morning well before the hour when a gentleman puts on his chlamys and wanders down to the agora only slaves are awake at such an hour and pirates i scratched my beard took another breath and raised my fist lets take them i roared back behind me on my own deck the rowers grunted in unison and there was a rumbling of approval i hoped im not usually one for speaking when going into action but i ran amidships and stood by the mainmast listen philoi the whole treasure of carthage lies under our rams and all we have to do is take it some of you have your own quarrel with carthage some of you would like to be rich theres five hundred ingots of tin over there maybe more enough for every man here to buy a farm and twenty slaves to work it for him my maths may have been weak but they cheered but they arent weak the men of carthage so listen carefully for orders and when we board i want every man coming with a roar right here we go it was something like that they roared and on the ships behind gaius and neoptolymos probably said something similar we rowed i was not willing to use my rowers energy yet and dionysus must have been of a similar mind so we rowed at a walking pace in line ahead dionysus was first and i was second neoptolymos third teukes fourth vasileos had our round ship and daud who had seen plenty of sea time had asked to be placed in command of hasdrubals pentekonter he had a difficult job we put twodozen good oarsmen into his ship and took the hardest cases out but the pentekonter was always sagging behind a slow old ship thats how hasdrubal had ended up and well deserved too at any rate we pulled into the east wind and as we closed with the westernmost part of the convoy the tin ships we saw men waking up running down the beach pointing at us and so on i had all the time in the world to put on my gleaming magnificent new panoply i walked along my catwalk feeling rather like ares come to life men reached out to touch me thats praise the enemy warships were coming awake men were pouring down the sand working like titans to get those ships off the round merchantmen were anchored out with their round stone anchors holding them near the beach i watched them all as usual with a fight everything seemed to be moving very slowly right up until the moment when everything would suddenly go very fast our surprise was slipping away and i began to wonder if wed have been better to come in at ramming speed and try to crush the enemy triremes where they lay but it was too late for that now doola came up next to me bow in hand he looked under his hand at the merchantmen i want you and seckla and ten men of your choosing to go into that one i said choosing the third ship out from the beach put her sails up and get into the offing and then run for massalia he looked at the warships you might need every man he said i might but im not aiming for a heroic last stand i grinned just take it and run pick up vasileos and daud as you go he nodded you think it is a trap nope i said i could feel the strength in my sword arm i think weve bitten off more than we could possibly chew we didnt bother to ram the merchants we wanted them intact my lydia shaved alongside my chosen victim my starboard side oars in and across in perfect order and my archers watched their rigging while my marines went up a ladder and across from our standing mainmast to theirs boarding from the mast was one of dionysus tricks it had a number of advantages and in this case where we really had reason to fear a trap even a handful of men well above the enemy deck allowed us some security a merchants sides are much higher than a triremes which makes boarding difficult and dangerous a merchantman packed with soldiers would make a tough target and a perfect trap but not that day our men stormed aboard as cleanly as they might have in a drill better because their blood was up the ships keeper the only man aboard jumped over the side and swam for shore doola crossed over with his chosen volunteers too late i realized that seckla was taking geaeta i saw her run up the boarding plank long shins flashing in the early summer sun well she was or she wasnt a spy i doubted she could kill doola i got my marines back as the first of the carthaginian triremes came off the beach six stades away these things have a life of their own you might ask why we didnt make a plan and ill say that had we hung off the coast to make a plan wed have found them in a defensive circle or their triremes coming out after us dionysus was confident and so were all the rest of us that said my plan depended on the others following me because i took my marines aboard got them into the bow and headed due east into the oncoming enemy i hoped that my consorts were coming with me leukas my alban had the deck with the sailors he was acting as oarmaster in doolas absence i gave him the nod to go to ramming speed he gave me a thumbsup anchises and darius led the marines and i joined them they were big men and all my marines were now bigger men than iid had a year to pick and choose the best and arm them like heroes too i pointed to the lead enemy ship off the beach were going to go aboard her and take her i said anchises kill your way aft and take command the rowers ought to obey you if they dont darius you kill a few until they obey understand both men grunted row clear and run north look for doola got it both men nodded the other marines nodded across the narrowing strip of water that separated us the carthaginian trierarch had just realized that i meant business and that his friends were coming to help him he had the best ship and the best crew and like such men he thought he could do everything himself of course he did i was another such man but now he was coming to ramming speed and he realized that win or lose he was alone the next best carthaginian was just getting his hull in the water i looked aft at megakles he waved both ships went for an oarrake and both ships got their oars in they were fine sailors with superb helmsmen for the most part we raced down their starboard side and the grapnels flew in both directions we were going so fast that some of the grapnels ripped free and i saw a rope snap as the whole weight of two racing ships came to bear on it the flying end of the rope struck my pais and ripped his face off the skull beneath and the poor boy screamed and screamed it was one of the most horrific wounds ive ever witnessed i had to put him down that felt bad id planned to free him hed served me so well pah it still tastes bad and then we were slowing both ships were turning fast heeled over from the weight of the other ship i got my spear free of the dead weight of my former slave and i needed action i was about to weep i really felt bad about the boy i was up on the rail before the ships stopped moving a carthaginian marine threw his javelin at me it missed by a hands breadth and i leaped down into the rowers one foot on the crossbeam and one flailing wildly for a moment until i got it down and one of the rowers grabbed my foot my spear went straight down into his open mouth i still remember that kill poor bastard rowers should never try to fight marines unless they get off their benches first remember that they are in three tiers and that they cant really stand or support each other if they have weapons they stow them under their benches hard to get at hard to use i pushed up towards the catwalk this was an undecked trireme like an athenian in fact it might have been a captured athenian ship rowers in three tiers open to the sky and a catwalk all the way down the centre line most of the enemy marines were on the catwalk using pikes over the heads of the rowers i took a pikehead on my aspis my attacker was trying to push me down into the rowers i batted the pikehead aside and made my jump i landed badly lost my balance and my armour saved my life as a spear cut some unintended engraving between my shoulder blades the mark is still there see look right there thats death honeybee but not for me i had to put a foot back and by luck nothing better than luck my foot landed on the crossbeam and i didnt fall i stabbed with my spear and my two opponents one with a pike fifteen feet long and one with a short spear stabbed at me pushing me down the man with the short spear tried to parry my spear with his own but he had his spear too near the haft and i had the leverage and i pressed his aside and ran mine home he had armour leather and bronze but my needlesharp spearhead pricked him not a killing blow but by the feel in my hand i knew id punched the point into him and he flinched and gave a cry and i rifled my spear forward again at his helmet and he stepped back the pikehead slammed into my helmet and i saw stars but i kept my footing and pushed forward into the space of the wounded carthaginian and now i had both feet on the catwalk i had both feet under me but now i had enemies ahead of me and behind me on the catwalk i slammed my aspis as hard as i could into the man behind me using the bronzeclad edge as a giant axe i caved in the face of his rawhide and wicker shield and broke his arm then i turned pivoting my hips and thrust backhanded with my spear thumb up spearhead down like a dagger blow it is the most powerful spear blow but of course when you deliver it you are wide open to your opponent as your shield is behind you it is like the famed harmodius blow none of you cares about the technicalities of good fighting a pox on you then my spearpoint went in over the pikemans arms right through his helmet and into his brain and down he went dead before he hit the deck but his weight snapped my spearhead the beautiful needle point must have been a little too hard and it snapped short of course i didnt notice right away i sprang forward into the next man another shielded armoured man with a heavy short spear and a javelin which he threw at me as soon as he had a clear throw but i sank beneath his throw like a dancer oh i was the killer of men and ares hand was on my shoulder i passed under his throw and rammed my spear under his shield and into his shin but the tip of my spear was gone and the spearpoint wouldnt bite i hurt his shin though he tried to back up but there were other men on the deck now in his confusion i whirled changed feet and rushed aft i got two paces and threw my spear into the next enemy marine it glanced off his shield and vanished into the oarsmen and i drew my new long xiphos from under my arm a lovely weapon almost like a spear with a long slender blade slightly wider at the tip i rotated my right wrist reached over his big rawhide shield and stabbed down my weapon caught armour grated and went straight home through his throat while his spear flailed over my shoulder i pushed past his corpse and the next man slammed his aspis into me and pushed me back and i cut low with my xiphos and realized that my opponent was anchises as my blade rang off his greave he roared and we were screaming at each other to stop comic in its way wed carried the ship the trierarch was trying to surrender in the stern the helmsman was on his knees and darius killed them both with two blows foolish and clean against the laws of war on the other hand we were badly outnumbered and it was the very heat of the action neither of them was dagon either i hoped every time i faced a carthaginian ship swords up i yelled swords up stop anchises joined his calls to mine it took a long minute to stop the killing the ship was ours i turned anchises to face me get under way north he nodded i ran down a crossbeam the same one id boarded on i suspect and leaped back aboard lydia ran aft to megakles the next three or four carthaginians were off the beach or nearly so to the west dionysus was clear of his merchant ship and turning out to sea bastard i said dionysus was going to cut and run doolas ship had her sails down and some way on her i was broadside on to the approaching carthaginians because thats how the impetus of the grappling action had ended we wasted valuable time poling off our new capture neoptolymos cleared his merchantman and came on my decks looked curiously empty because doola had most of the deck crew and anchises had my marines we inched forward the lead pair of carthaginians was already at ramming speed have your outboard oarsmen row i shouted at anchises twice time passed slowly he got it the former carthaginian rowers had no reason to love us men who have never been in a ship fight always imagine that when a ship is taken the rowers if they are slaves or have been mistreated should rise for their new masters it does happen that way but only if the old captain was abusive and foolish otherwise they tend to be more afraid of their new captors than they were of the old hard to explain but ive seen greek slaves newly freed all but refuse to row for greek marines at artemisium ah artemisium your turn is coming our two ships the grapnels gradually coming off rowed pitifully we must have looked like an insect on its back but we rotated back so that i was bow on to the enemy and anchises was stern on and then we got the last grapnels off and poled off so that he rowed away headed west and i rowed away headed east it wasnt a battlewinning manoeuvre but it saved us what happened next was from the gods i had little choice but to pass between my opponents they were side by side at ramming speed coming down my throat if megakles could manage it wed pass between them and rake their oars but my opponents hadnt been born yesterday the helmsman on the northernmost of the pair flicked his steering oars to close up with his consort by the whim of the gods the southernmost ship chose to do the same thing the two ships didnt slam together instead they brushed one another with a sickening tangle of oars to the sound of screams as oarsmen died or were broken on their tools it seemed to happen very slowly the ships didnt quite collide but slipped together like two pieces of fabric sewn up by a matron if id have any friend close by or any marines id have tried to sink them but instead i passed inshore of the two ships and my archers shot into them and then we were past in the bow leukas had readied a dozen jars of oil he knew what i intended we were at ramming speed and by our luck and fast manoeuvring wed passed inshore of the two locked vessels and isolated the next three ships to launch all to the north and east on the other side of the accident all three began to turn their oars working both sides portside oars reversed we ran down on the four triremes still fully on the beach and as we passed the pair of us heaved oil jars into the bows of each with a long rag aflame two of the four went out the third caught spectacularly our six archers poured arrows into the stricken ship and then we were turning out to sea wed run through their whole squadron the three ships that had turned end for end now had to pick up speed the two ships that had collided were picking themselves apart even three stades away i could hear their officers screaming at each other i watched the fourth ship on the beach get off a brave man threw my fire jar over the side burning himself badly in the process but my immediate opponents had troubles of their own they had all turned to follow me and neoptolymos was coming at them from the opposite angle and behind him gaius was up to full speed his oars chewing the sea to froth eight to three if dionysus had turned back wed have been eight to five and with our superior marines he kept rowing teukes his second captain turned out to sea it was one of those times when it is senseless to curse the gods had been kind enough without the two overeager helmsmen wed already have been dead men leukas ready about ship i called leukas looked at me as if id lost my mind megakles expression was a fair match it was a snap decision like my earlier one to attack the carthaginian squadron before it formed up and perhaps both were incorrect if id taken one ship and run doola and i might have made it but i swear wed have lost the others and at this point the only advantage our three ships had was that we caught them between two angles and forced them to make decisions if i ran for the open sea to my mind that left gaius to die our portside oars reversed their benches and pulled and our ship turned end for end five enemy ships came at us neoptolymos and gaius were coming up on them from behind and gaining at every stroke because our oarsmen were better and because they were free men pulling for the chance of riches and id forgotten anchises i left him pulling away to the west with an unwilling crew most of the carthaginians didnt realize that his ship had been taken and they swept past anchises stood amidships and offered his oarsmen a share of everything that was taken and turned his bow back east towards the enemy a second carthaginian ship caught fire on the beach sparks from the first the hand of the gods who knows we had turned to fight and now the odds were seven to four with two of the enemy ships damaged and somewhat unwilling and one still barely off the beach lydia was almost to ramming speed i ran aft and joined megakles in the steering oars and we aimed to go beak to beak with the lead enemy ship they were an echelonned line not of intent i think but because the better faster ship pulled away from its allies as soon as we touch reverse your benches and back water i roared we couldnt fight a boarding action not a chance i might hold their rush for a hundred heartbeats but i couldnt stop twenty men from boarding me not on my big sailing decks nonetheless when my orders were given i sprinted forward taking a spear off the stand by the mainmast i got to the marine box over the bow and stood there in all my armour and savoured the moment the finest sailors in the world and we were holding them i raised my sword and roared heracles at the onrushing enemy ship i was still shaking my sword when her bow moved a few degrees he declined the engagement and turned north out to sea he could do that we werent in a thick fight like lades we were in an open bay with stades between ships he turned north and we passed under his stern the other two raced past to the south even as they passed i saw them raising their mainmasts the fourth ship passed close enough that their archers lobbed some shafts at us my archers returned fire they had their boatsail mast up and the sail on and drawing the mainmast was slow going up one of my archers a skinny kid id purchased in ostia who swore he could shoot and damn he could put a shaft into a sailor pulling a rope and the whole mainmast swayed and fell over the side the ship yawed it didnt quite capsize but it shipped water rocked and neoptolymos slammed into it his ram catching the stricken ship broadside on at ramming speed as we shot past that was perhaps the most devastating single arrow ive ever seen shot i thumped the boy on the shoulder and gave him his freedom on the spot the two damaged ships were creeping away to the south along the coast four of the merchantmen had gone ashore in a mass they were beached and lost to us two were under full sail headed out to sea for a moment i thought we might snatch the two damaged triremes but instead of running out to sea they beached side by side under the walls of the town the city militia were pouring out of the gates now a hundred cavalrymen and then a thick column of numidian archers a really great trierarch might have had the lot had we had time to plan but it was a great day and the gods were kind equally we might all have been dead or taken it was close gaiuss marines swept the enemys deck and neoptolymos backed his ram out and the wreck sank and we turned north dionysus rejoined us in late afternoon and while i was tempted to berate him i had seen enough sea fights to know that all i had was a gut feeling he leaped aboard alone well fought he said he embraced me its hard to be really angry with a man who is calling you a hero and a demigod you fought like heracles he shrugged perhaps i should have lingered but he met my eye i assumed we were going to grab what we could and run i nodded i was afraid that if i didnt attack them theyd close around us i said he shrugged you might be right he said and grinned still friends id been cursing his perfidy all afternoon so naturally i shrugged and said of course he laughed we did it he said i propose we head for syracusa you wanted to raid illyria this summer if we head north to massalia thats the summer over he smiled and besides we cant sell all that tin in massalia we landed on maltas little island gozo where the witch enticed odysseus it has nice harbours and good food and sweet water and no carthaginians despite the proximity we drank deep slapped each other on the back and inspected our captures we had tin but only one ship was laden with tin about sixty ingots each as heavy as a man could carry deeply stamped with the carthaginian inspection mark it was also full of hides big heavy bulls hides some of the finest id seen but the ship doola had taken didnt have a single ingot of tin on board the central hold was full of iberian grain and the bilges which we missed at first were full of small ingots of silver almost a thousand small ingots of silver of course tinmining yields silver any smith knows as much but i suppose wed never really thought about it it was past the summer feast when we landed in syracusa we entered the port in a squadron three warships in the lead three merchantmen in the centre and three more warships astern syracusa had seen much larger fleets of course but not many with carthaginian captures so blatantly displayed within an hour of landing both anarchos and gelon had sent me messages requesting that i attend them while doola sat in his warehouse and sold our new fortune in tin i walked up the steep streets in my best cloak and entered anarchoss house his slaves were as well mannered as ever i sat opposite him on a couch and drank excellent wine he had just been for exercise and was covered in oil which made him look younger still the hero i see he said after a pause i remember grinning the fight at hippo had restored something to me something im not sure i ever knew was missing but the word hero was not i think misplaced i had tried to be a man i hankered for the warmth of human contact for a wife and a shop to work bronze but what paltry things they were love friendship next to the feeling in the moment when the lead enemy warship turned away from me any of you understand lydia is ready to leave he said gelon is about to discard her he shrugged she is not a natural courtesan do you ever know regret hero i writhed at his tone yes i said he nodded heavily me too he sat up on his couch let us try and give her another life eh the crime lord and the pirate i asked he laughed bitterly you love her i said oh yes he said men are complex are they not but this is my tale not his i walked up the town a little drunk and very maudlin i walked into the street of armourers and stopped at anaxsikles shop he was standing in the back staring at a helmet shaking his head he showed it to me beautiful as usual i said he shook his head look more closely he said it was true under careful inspection the left eyehole was slightly lower than the right apprentice i asked he shook his head and sat i think my eyes are going he confessed and burst into tears it was that kind of day would you marry lydia if she was available i said he looked up what he asked lydia if she was available if i could carry the two of you to another city where you could be a citizen a full citizen with voting rights would you go and marry her he looked at me why he asked i shrugged i helped ruin her so did another man we are willing to make good our error he looked around leaving home my mother my father he looked at me but yes id walk across my lit forge to have her just for a moment i had a flare of pure brutal jealousy let me try to make this happen i said if it will work i will send you word we will leave very suddenly i dont think that gelon will be happy to lose you or me for that matter i smiled or even lydia it might be tomorrow it might be the end of summer he nodded youve made my day that made me happier how was the armour he asked like hephaestos himself made it i said he made a gesture of aversion dont say that he groaned thats the kind of talk that makes the gods angry gelon wanted to hear about our fight and demanded a tenth of the profits in many ways gelon and anarchos resembled one another in the end i got him to settle for a lump sum in silver forty silver talents a fortune i went back to anarchos and informed him of everything the payment to gelon the bronzesmiths wedding plans anarchos sat sullenly and drank i am old he said bitterly i would marry her and take her to another city but she would never have me who would what could i say i left him to his bitterness the next day we paid off our debts in the city and filled our merchant ships with food and mercenaries almost a hundred men hired off the docks i picked up a dozen nubian archers being sold as labourers fool of a slavemaster i got them at labour prices i bought back their weapons from another dealer and put them in armour their leader was ka and he was taller than some houses as thin as a sword blade and he could draw a scythian bow to his mouth as if it were a childs bow kas lads were very pleased to be bought in that i promised them their freedom and wages in the immediate future doola had turned our tin into gold but if we paid off our oarsmen theyd never be seen again so we made a single payment that night about onetwentieth what every man had coming doola gave them a fine speech more than a thousand men standing by torchlight on the beach between the quays on the syracusan waterfront and he told them how much money they had coming at the end of the illyrian expedition and exactly why we werent paying in full until that trip was over i suppose they might have rioted but money lots of money has a magical quality it is often better in the offing than in reality and no one knows that as well as a sailor gaius and neoptolymos daud and sittonax vasileos and megakles and doola and seckla and i all lay on couches that night with twenty more men anchises redfaced and too loud and ka shining black and deeply versed it appeared in aegyptian lore debating with doola gaius rolled over to me probably to avoid having to watch geaeta and seckla on the next couch but he met my eye and we laughed like boys he held out a silver wine cup and tapped it against mine i guess this is the last time he said it is time i grew up and became a rich fuck on a farm i shrugged you were doing well enough this spring when we found you i said gaius rolled his eyes that is what worries me rome is such a backwater when we put neoptolymos on his throne youll go back to athens plataea i corrected automatically and well never see you again he said oh the seas not that wide i joked he nodded well he said heres to the last of youth i drank to that because i shared the sentiment i was thirtyone years old not bad you think but thats quite old for a warrior hah little did i know what the gods had in store we were pretty drunk when the pais came he was ten or eleven pretty enough if that sort of thing is to your taste he bowed deeply and held out a scroll tube to me lydia is at my house she awaits her transport it should not be you she expressed the deepest gratitude to me that i had found her a husband i regret that i will not be here to attend you i will not see you again i fear so i offer you this boy as a token of my regard you mentioned yours had died through the fumes of wine i had to read the note three times then i sent the boy to fetch anaxsikles i was half sober by the time he came and sent him to fetch his bride from anarchos i begged doola to carry them to croton for me he accepted gravely and embraced me i confess that i stood in a doorway near the ship and watched anaxsikles bring her down to the shore the only skiff was loading the archers he picked her up and she snuggled her head into his shoulder he carried her out into the water and handed her up to the sailors on the deck and then leaped up into the round ships waist and she put her arms around his neck bah why do i tell this more wine doola sailed long before dawn i suspected that gelon would be none too happy when he found out that his smith and his mistress were gone so i ordered my drunken orgiastic crews rounded up we were a surly vicious pack of scoundrels in the first light of dawn my new boy wanted me to come with him to anarchoss house to fetch his belongings he also insisted that he was free not a slave and that i should ask anarchos the crime lord lived close enough to the water that it was the matter of a few minutes to go there and i wanted to tell him that she was away i suppose i hadnt read his letter closely enough the pais found him he wasnt in his andron thats where lydia had waited for anaxsikles the andron smelled of her i slammed my fist into a wall if you dont understand why well good for you but in the back near the courtyard he lay on top of his sword which hed wedged between two paving stones he was quite dead men are complex to my lights he died well and was a man i could if not admire at least call a friend heres to his shade we got to sea before the sun was high my new pais cried and cried i am fairly certain he believed that anarchos was his father and perhaps he was his name was hector ah you smile yes hector finally he comes into our story doola was gone over the horizon and i confess i had a million fears that day that the carthaginians would snatch up his ship only in the cold clear light of day did i realize that his ship held lydia anaxsikles and all our treasure and i had sent it off unguarded men are fools but the gods watch over drunkards and fools we lay that night on a beach north of katania and the next night we evaded the whirlpool and crossed over to rhegium doola was a day ahead of us which suited me we made the beautiful beaches of rhegium in midafternoon and when the setting sun gilded mount aetna over on the sicilian side that night we were already in the waterfront tavernas i sat with gaius i was poor company a single trireme came in with a small merchant ship trailing astern making tacks to get in under wind power the ship was well handled and the longer i watched it the more convinced i was that it was giannis the trireme was athenian i could see that by its light construction the way it moved how low it was to the water a warship a shark the warship landed first a crew really shows itself in landing a wellconducted ship spins end for end a stade offshore and backs into the beach its not a tricky manoeuvre for a veteran crew but it always shows a crews skills this ship was beautifully handled not just the helmsman but the oarsmen mine were good these were better a pleasure to watch them im going to go and praise that man i said pointing at the new arrival gaius nodded beautiful he admitted does this mean we have to do more drill youll miss dionysus when you are watching your slaves plough your fields i laughed it was my first laugh in eight hours we wandered down to watch the new arrival his oarsmen were already buying food from the farmers who hastened down to the beach sacks of charcoal were being bargained for and the braziers were already coming out of the bilges the man with his back to me dickering with the local farmers looked familiar he turned just as i came up and we saw each other cimon we threw our arms around each other and hugged slapped each others backs and hugged again this went on for a long long time in fact i cried look thugater im crying now you bastard you said to meet you in massalia paramanos hugged me too there on the beach at croton i tried not to look at the town we were on the beach for the night and dano sent her greetings and a gift of wine there were two more black ships on that beach paramanoss black raven and harpagoss storm cutter friends friends are men who when they think that you are dead will come halfway around the world because you ask them and because they want so much to believe that you are alive i hadnt seen these men since well since the beach of marathon almost eight years before there were a dozen athenians i knew there for example was aeschylus who fought in the front rank at marathon and at lades there was phrynicus young nephew aristides harpagos my former right hand was still a lisping islander as strong as an ox with the beginnings of grey in his beard mauros my helmsman come to think of it paramanos got his start as a helmsman too start with us that is he was cyrenian and had fought for the phoenicians before i took him in the sea fight off cyprus back in the ionian war thats a new ship i said pointing at storm cutter my old storm cutter was a heavy phoenician capture heh i took her and paramanos in the same sweep of my spear the original is firewood he said athens has a fleet now not a dozen vessels from rich men either we have more than a hundred hulls aegina he laughed aloud aegina isnt a naval power any more young aristides nodded vehemently athens is a better place for the common man he said with all the arrogant pomposity of the young had i ever been that young anyone been to plataea i asked there was some shuffling of feet i introduced my friends of the last six years to my friends from athens seckla was abashed for a while gaius on the other hand kept looking at cimon chuckling and saying so you really are miltiades son i suppose they might not have got on cimon was the son of a hundred generations of eupatridae and seckla was a numidian former slave daud was worse an outandout barbarian and sittonax didnt even like to speak greek however piracy is its own brotherhood i listened with half an ear as harpagos poured out the tale of athens war with aegina and themistocles daring political manoeuvre by which he took the profits of the new silver mine and bought athens a public fleet next to the reforms of cleisthenes it was the greatest political revolution in athenian history if cleisthenes gave all the middlemen the hundredmythemnoi men a noble ancestor and the right to think themselves aristocrats and fight in the phalanx so themistocles bought athens a fleet and gave all the little men free citizens but without franchise a weapon as mighty as the spear he gave them the oar nowadays we take it for granted that every athenian thetis is a rower athens rules the waves from here to the delta of alexandria and across the seas to syracusa too but in those years between marathon and the next stage in the long war athens was just feeling her way as a power i watched as gaius began to talk to cimon about raising horses and doola found common cause with harpagos on the subject of trade seckla stood nervously with his attractive courtesan a woman who couldnt resist male attention and suddenly had a beach full of it but in time mauros my former oarmaster and fellow hero of lade started to talk first to doola and then to seckla and then they were all talking to paramanos four africans on a beach full of greeks aristides the younger was amazed to meet an actual keltoi barbarian and managed not to sound as condescending as he might have the fires roared the wine was excellent and as darkness fell and i was apologizing to cimon for the fiftieth time that i wasnt with his father at the end dano herself came down the beach with a dozen of her friends it is like having the battle of marathon brought to my town she said so many famous men ari in truth my friend when first you told me you were arimnestos of plataea i thought you one of those men who lie habitually cimon was deeply pleased to meet the daughter of the great pythagoras he bowed greeks seldom bow and was allowed to kiss her cheek very italian and not very greek and he actually blushed so did giannis who had come with cimon from massalia aeschylus just stood there drinking it all in how is aristides i asked when chance threw us together you mean the real one he asked raising an annoyed eyebrow at phrynicus graceless nephew i smiled hes a great man now he and themistocles are rivals enemies really im not sure if they dont hate each other worse than either one hates the persians aristides has inherited the eupatridae he leads the oligarchs aeschylus shrugged what aristides the just i shook my head politics in athens is different my friend themistocles has raised up the thetis and hell end up giving them the right to serve on juries mark my words and that will be the end of us aeschylus was an oldfashioned man despite his relative youth of course looking at them i realized that my friends were ageing as fast as i was myself that was a shock aeschylus had grey in his beard harpagos had a white mark the scar of a persian arrow from lade in his beard but his hair was getting grey too and to see dionysus talk to cimon dionysus had been our trierarch at lade cimon and i had been mere ships commanders now we commanded squadrons and dionysus i could see was quite old perhaps fifty a decade younger than i am right now id watched him put a carthaginian marine down just recently he wasnt that old but we werent any younger and i couldnt help but notice that the annoying aristides the younger was the age id been at sardis seventeen zeus im lucky i was allowed to live so cocky so sure for the first time that night i watched older men proven men men of unquestioned worth i wondered when the young men competed on the beach on chios or again at lade i wondered how many older men watched me and thought i was an arrogant pup and too young to know any better age your turn will come my young friends but enough it was a great night so many friends such laughter such wine and we were not so very old either finally the sun peeped over the horizon we were lying on straw above the highwater mark and wed seen the night through and slaves were picking up the amphorae and the broken cups dano lay by cimon on a kline of straw lucky cimon flirting with paramanos who appeared to know more of pythagorean philosophy than any of the rest of us but hed been raised at cyrene they were talking about mathematics and cimon laughed and then raised himself on his elbows to speak over his companions so ari why have you called us all here some men laughed and others hooted but they all fell silent i was hoping we could all spend the summer raiding carthage i said to the rising sun but the summer has slipped away like youth i have a friend here who is a prince of illyria we were slaves together i thought that if i could raise my friends wed have enough of a fleet to sail north of corcyra and restore him to his hill fort kill all his enemies and perhaps pick up a few bars of silver into the bargain paramanos grinned theres not a one of us who couldnt use a few bars of silver i heard there was a tin fleet cimon said dionysus was drunk too damned late athenian he shouted we took it all i shook my head we took a third of it thats a story for another night friends we have ten ships with ten ships we could probably conquer any island in the aegean with these men but if you will follow my lead we will restore neoptolymos and perhaps take a few carthaginians on the way cimon nodded im not likely to turn back now theres nothing else going on this summer although you had best pay well you old rascal ive rowed from athens to massalia and back to croton to find you i laughed i have a few coins i admitted i dont want to linger he said the phoenicians are everywhere in the east theres no getting a cargo into aegypt men say that the king of kings and his phoenicians have made a pact with carthage and there is war in aegypt i shook my head i keep hearing that i said but i see no proof the phoenicians are no real friends of the great kings supposedly there are embassies going both ways even now said paramanos in cyrene i heard that your how should i say it your friend hipponaxs son archilogos is taking a squadron to carthage or perhaps took one last season cimon shook his head that at least is not true he was in mytilene a month ago cimon smiled in the rising sun i spoke to him were not at war id just heard the message that ari was alive i told archilogos that was a pleasure i coughed but youll all come north against illyria paramanos looked around at the greeks why do you think we came here for a rest he laughed cimon scrambled to his feet apologizing to pythagorass daughter my pais refilled his cup he poured a long libation of priceless sybarite wine to the immortal gods and then raised his cup to the rising sun phobos lord of the chariot of fire and poseidon lord of horses and swift ships and the sea with a thousand beautiful daughters athena matchless in guile who loves men best when they are most daring aphrodite of the higharched feet and all the other immortals hear us we thank you for this night of mirth and friendship and we ask your blessing we all cheered great days and after that night i had a hangover of homeric proportions worth it we spent another day provisioning our round ships and making our plans by then local rulers were sending embassies to the men of marathon a rumour went out that dano had hired us to avenge her father on the sybarites we sharpened our weapons and drilled we had a farewell feast with the pythagoreans vegetables it turns out are perfectly palatable i saw lydia at a distance it is odd how you know a person by their shape and movement when you couldnt possibly see their face i knew her and i knew the man with his arm around her there is no happiness of mortal men that cannot be marred in an instant part iv illyria having passed by the island of thrinacia where are the kine of the sun they came to corcyra the island of the phaeacians of which alcinous was king but when the colchians could not find the ship some of them settled at the ceraunian mountains and some journeyed to illyria and colonized the apsyrtides islands but some came to the phaeacians and finding the argo there they demanded of alcinous that he should give up medea he answered that if she already knew jason he would give her to him but that if she were still a maid he would send her away to her father however arete wife of alcinous anticipated matters by marrying medea to jason hence the colchians settled down among the phaeacians and the argonauts put to sea with medea apollodorus library i and then we sailed for illyria i wont say that nothing happened as we cruised up the west coast of magna greca ill just say that bar one incident i dont remember anything there was a lot of fog i remember that and i remember that on our second morning as we rowed north through the fog dionysus ship fell afoul of cimons with much cursing and shouting since they were reckoned two of the finest trierarchs on the seas the rest of us revelled in their distress like men do the only incident i remember well arose out of the fog im going to guess it was the third or fourth day and again we launched off a small and rocky cove just big enough for our ships with bellies full of lobster and our ships laden only with fresh water but the fog was everywhere some trick of the gods and every morning to a depth i hadnt ever seen before it took all morning to burn off and for long hours the sun was a golden orb in the haze at any rate that morning as we rowed north again rowing because there was no wind at all we were trying to practise signalling dionysus was making himself increasingly unpopular with the other captains by insisting on drill and signalling when we knew we were after no prey loftier then some illyrian pirates in pentekonters no one likes to work that hard had we been rowing north to fight the persians at lade we might have felt differently although come to think of it when we rowed to lade we all hated dionysus then too the sun climbed above us in the haze just visible one of the few times in your life you can look directly at him in all his glory and as with the other days just past midday the fog suddenly burned off as fast as a bird crossing the sky so that in one moment it was all we could do to see the ships ahead and behind us in line and then we could see three ships ahead and then i could see dionysus up at the head of the line and then and then we could see the merchant trireme six stades away and just as surprised to see us as we were to see him every ship even dionysus turned out of the line as fast as their oarsmen could respond to volleys of orders and went from a slow cruise to ramming speed the triemiolas raised sail as the fresh wind was suddenly coming off the land we could all see it was a phoenician or perhaps a carthaginian and he could see us too his oarsmen beat the water into a froth like a good athenian matron making soup the evening before a feast day and he struggled to get his mainsail up it was a race of sorts but a horribly unequal one between ten ships in high training with full crews and marines and sailors and clean hulls against a lone merchant with fifty oarsmen and old sails he could sail much closer to the wind then we could of course so as soon as he had his mainmast rigged he lay over and ran north and we all lost the wind and had to row lydia was fast but paramanoss new black raven was like a racing shell with a ram and cimons ajax was as fast as paramanos dionysus agamemnon was as fast as either oh how we exhausted ourselves we raced along our oars all but touching the nearest ship a missed stroke might have been disaster but we were heroes of course we didnt miss any strokes we caught the merchant at midafternoon about the hour a gentleman rises from his nap and goes to the agora not in plataea ladies men work all day in plataea but in athens we caught him and he surrendered without a fight who would even try to fight with ten sharks all around him cimons hull was the first to come aboard his and dionysus was second we carried the captured ship to the next beach and pulled her up the sand and gravel the oarsmen were cleared off and the deck crew the miserable owner and the trierarch all cowered together she had a cargo of cheap carthaginian pottery some greek wine with ionian labels that must itself have come off a capture and copper with the cypriote mark the copper was valuable the wine we broached on the spot for our oarsmen cimon and dionysus began to argue over the spoils paramanos wandered over to where i stood seeing to it that lydia was carried well up the beach and rolled over to dry her hull he nodded to me i thought this was your little expedition he said i shrugged cimon and dionysus are going to gut each other over a handful of copper he said not because its valuable but because they are important men and each has to be first i sighed the party was over sharing spoils always the moment when arete goes by the board and life among pirates becomes difficult i walked across the sand cursing how it burned the sides of my feet it was deep and soft try walking with determined gravity and manly elegance across deep sand they werent quite spitting like lesbian fishwives not quite but close friends i said this is unseemly that may not seem like a very telling remark to a pair of bloodyhanded pirates but the two of them immediately pivoted on their heels to face me unseemly dionysus said i dont remember asking your opinion as long as you are in my squadron you can listen to any opinion i choose to deliver i said dionysus mouth opened and closed cimon laughed slapped my shoulder and nodded youre right ari my apologies you divide the spoils i snapped my fingers and there was my pais with a stool as i sat dionysus stood arms akimbo he glared at me for a long fifty heartbeats or so im not in your squadron pup he growled you are in mine i shrugged and sat no my friend i invited you to sail with me you joined me i have drilled and drilled this squadron i appreciate that but thats not command please you understand command you commanded at lade i asked all my friends on this expedition it is pardon me mine if anyone could dispute this it would be neoptolymos the illyrian had come up with all the other captains and a number of other leaders the commander of the mercenaries from syracusa a spartan called brasidas doola and sittonax vasileos and his nephew aeschylus they gathered around my stool like any greek assembly all talking all with an opinion to offer neoptolymos shook his head paramanos who had never thought very highly of dionysus nodded you are in command arimnestos not this wine bag i shook my head no insults dionysus i will divide the spoils between the ships that performed the capture i think just for a moment that he was so angry he considered leaving us this is a thing i have seen men do two hours before if asked i think he would quite happily have allowed that i was the trierarch in as much as anyone was but having once got his back up or perhaps it had been an error to allow him to drill the squadron but he was quite possibly the greatest trierarch of our time the finest innovator the best tactician it was from him that i learned how to perform the diekplous and the wheel perhaps two of our most important tactics at any rate he took a breath i think to denounce me and geaeta did a handstand something you have to see to believe done in a chiton and came to rest by me she smiled at dionysus you are eldest she said and men talk of you as one of the noblest men of your generation she smiled at him as if the two of them were the only two on the beach sometimes a woman can say something that would be a matter for swords between men his face was almost purple but she went on please let us not mar this day and this week she put a hand on his arm she who he had called a whore a dozen times he bent slightly at the waist looked at the sand for a moment cocked his head at me and smiled ruefully it is hard to take orders from a younger man he said i nodded when you are my age see how you like it he looked as if he was going to say more but he swallowed it never mind cimon my apologies and mine to you sir i spoke in heat the two clasped arms like men in the gymnasium i looked at the stack of copper ingots it was worth a small fortune to one man it was to be frank worthless to two hundred oarsmen and marines i looked at the two of them gentlemen i said this is a small amount of booty i propose that rather than dividing it we have a foot race and the fastest man takes all the copper and we dedicate the game to olympian zeus pour the wine down our throats and offer some of the sheep i see on that hill as sacrifices cimon laughed dionysus laughed a seventeenyearold oarsman from etrusca won the foot race we crowned him in olive and his mates helped him carry his copper onto gaiuss ship gaius put his olive wreath on his mast for luck thats the incident that i remember oh i ran of course i ran i lost in the first heat aristides the younger flew past me from the start i was placed fifth among eight men i felt old but men said i had made a fine decision as wise as odysseus as the sun set on our sacrifices and their smoke climbed to heaven cimon was a priest of zeus of course like all the men of his clan dionysus put his arm around me lets sacrifice the prisoners he said men began to call for it men who surprised me young aristides for example and many of the other unblooded young paramanos smiled and looked away doola shook his head vehemently sittonax sidled closer to me i had no idea he said ive never seen a greek sacrifice a man and you wont here i said by zeus are we as bad as barbarians i seldom swear by zeus but some things i walked across the sand as drunk as a sailor and stumbled to the prisoners with a hundred oarsmen and officers behind me most of them knelt in the sand the carthaginian helmsman grabbed paramanoss knees and began to beg for his life in phoenician the trierarch eyed me steadily he didnt kneel you are a free man i said go walk away he didnt say a word he caught the eyes of his mates and picked up a bundle at his feet paramanos somewhat surreptitiously handed the helmsman a sword the carthaginians were off up the beach before most of my audience knew id let them go you really are too soft for this dionysus said winesoaked breath in my face i shrugged perhaps i said like i said thats the only incident that sticks in my head word must have been out that there was a squadron at sea the adriatic was as empty as a mud puddle after rain the morning after we released the carthaginians the wind came up a favourable wind and we sailed across the adriatic our swords were sharp and we were as ready as men can be we landed south of dyrachos an hour before nightfall on a late summer evening the sun took his time going down to the west over the mountains and we were ashore and camped before the night was dark insects chirped and it sounded like greece it smelled like greece we built no fires but rolled in our cloaks and slept on the sand and in the morning we were up long before the sun now i need a horse neoptolymos said he and the spartan brasidas stood together both in full armour because you dont want to walk i asked i intend to ride around and raise my friends and relatives he said dyrachos is sixty stades that way i had slightly different notions of how to proceed based on years of experience with miltiades i sent all my archers inland under ka and before i was done with my stale bread and sour wine ka was back all but bouncing on the balls of his feet like an eager hound with a fine bay led by the halter he had four prisoners and a dozen horses ka was from the far south of aegypt nubia and not numidia south even of the kingdom of adula of which if you stay with me long enough youll hear more to be honest it was years before i truly understood the difference but both peoples love horses ride superbly and view horsethieving as a natural part of life we started our march for dyrachos before the sun cleared the distant coast of italy and ka and his men were all mounted with seckla laughing along with them seen together numidians and nubians are as different as keltoi and hellenes and yet they rode like scythians knees high hips moving with the gait of the animal and with their dark skin they looked like centaurs on their stolen bays i kept neoptolymos from riding inland i feared that he would be taken or killed and that he would give himself away he accepted my guidance with an ill grace and the command party was a surly group as we trudged inland over the first low ridge the khora was incredibly prosperous fields of oats and barley stretching away in a beautiful patchwork harvest wasnt far off once we were clear of the coastal scrub we had excellent sight lines which of course meant we could be easily observed i sent ka and his scouts well ahead blessing the gods i had made such a provident purchase the nubians knew their business they rode south and east to the horizon collecting every horse on that flat plain and terrifying the inhabitants i have to say a word about illyria the illyrians are like hellenes indeed many of their aristocrats claim hellenic descent and they share our gods and heroes although they have some cruel monsters of their own they are far more warlike than hellenes the whole of illyria is in a perpetual state of war and every mans hand is against everyone else or rather perhaps i should say that every aristocrats hand is against every other aristocrat they have no hoplite class of farmers there are only the rich and slaves the only real way for slaves to win their freedom is by fighting they arm their slaves for war and the bravest are promoted to the aristocracy on the other hand the least effective warriors are captured and made slaves or killed you might think that this vicious system would create superb warriors perhaps it does but i never met them mostly it creates brutal ignorant aristocrats and a society of semislave landtillers with nothing but contempt for their lords who cant seem to grow food or protect them neoptolymos was a fine man and a pretty fair spearman but i taught him that and slavery mellowed him by the time the sun was high in the sky wed marched twenty stades or more and we had a dozen prisoners local men all unfree but more like overseers than like slaves neoptolymos insisted we take them because he said they would report to his uncle if they could in fact neoptolymos after seven years with me had reverted to being an illyrian he wanted to kill them all from the eldest of them we heard the story of the last few years epidavros had seized power after arranging for neoptolymoss murder but after that things had gone wrong he had seized power with the support of the carthaginians but he failed to deliver the tin he had promised and so the carthaginians had abandoned him his own cousins had begun to raid his borders and take his land and his slaves and he had spent the last two years in a constant state of war last summer while we were bringing our tin over the mountains he had gone to sea with a dozen pentekonters and taken a pair of phoenician merchantmen and carthage had sent a reprisal raid which had burned the shipping in his harbour including a pair of greek merchantmen who he had seen as his most promising new allies id like to moralize and say that epidavros got what he had coming to him but thats illyria however because of the carthaginian raid his petty kingdom was as alarmed as the house of a man who has been robbed the overseers all agreed that by now epidavros had been fully informed of our force he had coastal towers every few stades or so they claimed neoptolymos wanted to start burning things we camped that night at the edge of a stand of ancient oak trees in the foothills having marched farther east than we needed i wanted to hug the edge of the hills and avoid detection and obvious moves like taking the direct route we sat down in messes a hundred mercenaries another hundred marines and a dozen aristocrats plus ka and his nubians an odd collection but i think as deadly a raiding force as i ever commanded i was warming to the spartan brasidas he was quite the gentleman with fine manners and a ready smile he almost never spoke just met your eyes and grinned if he agreed hed nod and if he disagreed hed raise his eyebrows what are you doing here brasidas i asked spartans never leave home theyre afraid of water he grinned and rolled his eyes meaning so you say plataean you are allowed to speak you know i said he nodded gravely and smiled meaning when i have something to say perhaps i will a theban cut your tongue out i asked he smiled and took a drink of wine no he said i wish you spartans would learn to say what you mean in a few words i laughed he was very likeable he smiled and raised his cup to me he was built like a wrestler with long limbs and lots of muscle he was a handsome man but most spartans are his equipment was very plain cimon was sitting with me he said whyd you leave the land where helen bore sons to menelaus brasidas brasidas shrugged bored he said and smiled he made a face and held out his cup to my pais poor he admitted cimon nodded my father had many spartan guest friends their mess fees are high a man needs two or three estates to pay brasidas nodded if anything goes wrong if crops fail or helots revolt a man can find himself without his mess fee cimon watched the spartan carefully it was an odd form of social interrogation cimon would make guesses and wed watch his body language for confirmation brasidas was a patient man he had the kind of strength that is beyond mere temper or the need to prove itself but he got up swallowed the last of his wine nodded and walked off meaning none of your business cimon rose to follow him but i held him back its his business i said let him go cimon nodded neoptolymos joined us his face thunderous in the firelight why wont you let me burn these farms he demanded it was odd a sign of how i was growing between heraclitus and dano but i couldnt help but be amused at the complete contrast between the taciturn spartan and the emotional illyrian i put a hand on his shoulder by the end of the week theyll be your farms i said why burn them hell raise his cousins and his war band and well accomplish nothing he all but pouted he didnt seem like a man in his midtwenties but like a very young very angry man i put my arm around him he fought me for a moment and then he grunted and i saw he was crying dont worry i said well get him thats what leaders do we sound positive the nubians were away in the wolfs tail of dawn we moved along the road between the fields a dry sunbaked track there was a storm brewing away to the south and thunder sounded in the distance like the grumbling of the gods around midmorning ka brought back another dozen horses and daud and sittonax took two of them and rode off with another dozen men who could ride doubling our scout force a ridge rises from the plain about forty stades inland and we had marched around to the east of it and now we passed along it keeping the ridge between us and the sea we joined the main road i use the term very loosely south of a fortified settlement called pista if all was going well our ships should be off dyrachos by now snapping up any fishing boats in the offing and making trouble and being very visible in late afternoon after marching maybe seventy stadia we crossed the ardaxanos river in late summer it was scarcely deserving of the name we moved right up until dark and we camped at the top of a low hill twentyfive stadia from the town of dyrachos we hadnt seen any opposition and with twenty horsemen covering a broad arc before us i didnt really expect ambush at nightfall daud took all the mounted men on a sweep to make sure we werent going to be surprised in the morning my intention was that we storm the town at daybreak but the truth on the ground was very different from neoptolymoss description he remembered the ridge as running right down to the town but it wasnt that simple and there was open ground all the way to the coast from where we were camped i stood on the hilltop in the last light looking at the sea in the distance and worrying wed eaten our rations and even plundering the farms we passed wasnt feeding us really efficient plundering takes time and slows a march to a crawl and we had moved fast moving a force fast requires discipline and supplies in the morning we would be out of food further our rendezvous with our ships was for noon the next day and if we missed it well things were about to grow very complicated indeed i didnt sleep well i dreamed of the keltoi girl throwing herself over the side and miltiades the night after marathon saying he was with the gods and lydia not speaking but just looking at me with a face full of hate i rose in the dark and prayed im not much of a prayer but that morning i felt close to death when i rose my joints hurt my hands ached and the old wound in my leg burned and away to the south was a line of dark clouds that boded ill for a sailor there was a sheep that had strayed onto our hill and i walked down trapped it against a cliff and grabbed it i built a small fire and sacrificed the sheep to zeus and burned its thigh bones and took the meat up the hill for my mess of course we got a late start our sentries werent as alert as they ought to have been wed awakened slowly and the sun was rising by the time we cooked my sheep nor could i feed mutton to two hundred men from one animal sittonax took a dozen horsemen out and they were back before they left riding hard brasidas spotted them returning and ordered his men to arm i was still greasy from mutton as i saw the dust cloud my pais helped me into my thorax i put on the whole panoply it was obvious we were going to fight so much for my careful strategy sittonax rode in about the time that i had my armharness on he rode up controlling his horse effortlessly and dropped off six hundred men no kind of order not much armour a dozen horsemen headed this way he shrugged i think theyve marched all night six hundred i scratched my jaw officers i bellowed neoptolymos looked at me he was in his magnificent armour and he made a brilliant show he looked like achilles son he has raised all his people he said simply he has his retainers the local lords and his best slaves if you had let me raise my relatives wed match him spear for spear he shrugged well hubris is always with us all id done by marching around the mountain was to give him time to raise his troops of course i had given my own troops time to shake off their sea legs and eat a few hot meals right i said looking around we have half the heroes of marathon we have armour discipline and a good nights sleep cimon raised an eyebrow his father used to say that all that mattered in a land fight was how many men you had but cimon was good enough not to say so well move right at them i said right down the road when were close really close we form up and go right in no mucking about and no shouting insults theyll try and get formed and go around our flanks all we need to do is get epidavros and kill him right neoptolymos nodded brasidas nodded too i get it he said form a good phalanx i said daud you and ka and sittonax stay mounted and harass them pick off any man on the edge of their formation get behind them and shoot arrows best of all dont let their right flank form ka wrinkled his brow daud shrugged get in close and crowd them and when they come at you ride away then go back dont let them form their line id watched the saka and the persians do it i knew what a handful of horsemen could do to infantry i put a stick down on the ground this is their column marching i said at some point when we are close enough they pick a field and start to form right and you get in on their right and make trouble right in their faces while they want to be shouting orders and getting the laggards to stand in a shield wall cimon laughed cavalry tactics from a seawolf we ate the last of our stale bread with the last of our olive oil and drank the last drops of our wine to neoptolymos i said were lucky he glared at me your uncle could have cowered in his town wed have had to go to the ships i was watching the storm to the south it might not be today but it was coming you think we can win he asked me i shrugged of course i said when your wife asks if you think she is beautiful what do you say cimon came up to me as we prepared to march the sun was already hot my hands were shaking he looked at the sky i was made for better things than dying here he said i nodded i remember that moment i slapped his shoulderpiece good i said dont die he laughed and that laugh spread over the column because every man could hear me lets go i shouted and we were off we came down off our hill some of you maidens may wonder why i didnt hold the hilltop and the answer is water at any rate we raced along the road as fast as men in armour can move we were fit strong men and we could go quite fast two stadia past the foot of the hill we crossed a little stream i made everyone drink and fill their canteens then i stood and shook i swear that the minutes it took those men to fill my canteens were as long as any minutes in my life command has a level of fear that is absent in mere service in command it is just you and the gods two more stadia and daud came back to report that the enemy were just there and moving slowly over the next low ridge there were sheep on the ridge and i turned to the mercenaries and brasidas were going to run up that little hill i said brasidas nodded and checked the laces on his sandals word spread down the column men took a slug from their canteens and then we ran it wasnt a sprint or a hoplitodromos and almost immediately men fell out greaves have to fit a column of men in armour makes a remarkable noise running it raises the heart that noise the feet pounding together the slap of leather and bronze it is the sound of ares one of his many sounds men jogging towards the enemy may tire but they dont have time to feel fear because it all hurts we ran up the hill we lost about twenty men but we reached the crest of the low ridge on the road well ahead of our enemies i turned to my pais catch me a sheep i said he nodded ran off the top of the ridge had a definite crest and it was open short cropped grass rolled away down the far side the illyrians were coming up the hill in no particular order and by ares they were close we werent a stade apart our field was bounded by scrubby woods that had once been an olive grove to the north they ran most of the way down the hill and a low stone wall on the south of our hill that i had to hope would anchor my line i assumed it wouldnt have to hold anyone long because my cavalry would slow their right flank where if they were like greeks all their best men would be form your front i called men were breathing hard but they got it done well brasidas ran effortlessly along the front of his forming line slapping cajoling suddenly his mouth was full of words i noted he never swore or defamed a man he said things like well run philios and youre looking like ares come to earth draco cimon had his handful of athenians on the far right our front rank was brilliantly armoured and in the centre neoptolymos stood out from the line he raised his spear and screamed a long war cry in the enemy line men stopped and stared of course until that moment epidavros and his men thought we were a raiding party neoptolymos took off his helmet and his blond hair shone in the sun he shouted again ive heard him tell the story so i know he was challenging his uncle to single combat illyrians do that sort of thing but epidavros didnt get a chance to play the hero or the coward because there was a rumble like the thunder of the day before and suddenly all of our mounted men burst from the end of the old olive grove and rode for the flank of the column battles especially small battles can be very complicated animals indeed and the notion that men can really plan what happens in them is sheer hubris daud was on the wrong flank he had confused as many amateurs do our right flank for the enemys right flank balanced against that his surprise as he appeared was total the whole enemy force flinched and he and sittonax and ka doola seckla and their men didnt look like twentyfour horsemen they looked like a thousand their hooves made the earth shake they didnt charge home they rode right past the tail of the column on the road throwing javelins and shooting bows and they circled around in short reins and came back riding along the flank of the column seckla took a wound where a brave illyrian slave stepped out of the column and stabbed at him they were that close but the javelins and bows put a dozen men in the dust forward i shouted our line went forward sometimes it works our line was formed and theirs was not our cavalry had scared them and neoptolymos was palpably alive to my mind everything that was going to go our way was going our way and it wasnt going to get any better if we stood there at the top of the hill we moved at a fast walk and our phalanx spread out wed only practised together a few times on beaches and the like so our order wasnt perfect gaps showed immediately but we were the pyrrhiche dance team of plataea compared to our opponents who hadnt yet pulled their helmets down over their faces dauds men turned like a snake for a third pass at the enemy seckla and another man reined in their horses and slipped off at the top of the hill the illyrians started to form their line the back end of the enemy column was slow to get the word or perhaps hesitant a gap opened between the centre of the enemy line and what should have been their left daud put his heels to his horse and raced for the gap with all my horsemen on his tail the illyrians at the back of the column who by all rights should have panicked and run decided instead to charge uphill by ares into my horsemen except for fifty or so of them who started killing the others from behind of course epidavros had placed his least trustworthy men on his left neoptolymoss cousins i slowed our advance i needed cohesion not impact dress the line i roared on me the phalanx such as it was closed up men lapped their shields over their neighbours to the left and our advance slowed as men turned half sideways and began the crabwalk that hoplites use when they are at the synaspis the closer order the bestarmoured man on the other side i assumed he was epidavros called something to his men and they roared and charged us an illyrian charge is a fearful thing and not very greek or rather perhaps it is exactly what we looked like at marathon when we ran at the persians but there were a lot of them and they came at us screaming and their front rank men had armour and big spears they were big men too exactly opposite me was a towering figure like a giant a head taller than me with shoulders like an ox and a giant aspis the size of a table in a taverna i hate fighting big men but my daimon was there too and as they roared and ran at us i was arimnestos of plataea and no mans slave or chattel and this was my fight when he was three paces away i threw my heavy spear he was running try to run with your aspis covering you he took it in the chest he had a bronze thorax and his last thought was the shock that my spear went through it second to last thought i guess he stood and looked at it for long enough that i stabbed him in the throat with my second spear ripped it clear and stepped up onto his back to kill my second man a roaring madman all teeth and rage he seemed to be trying to embrace my shield i gave him my spear tip instead and my spear broke and while i drew my sword my line gave a great roar and pushed forward we had the hill we were four deep a forest of skilled spearmen and a great many illyrians died in the first seconds of that meeting the line gave a push and suddenly we were ten paces down the hill and men were stumbling back epidavros roared for his men to stand he was a few feet from me faced half away and neoptolymos shoved brasidas aside took his uncles thrust on his shield and thrust back but the wellarmoured man fell back a step and made a good shield parry fair fights are for fair men i reached out with the tip of my sword and slapped his sauroter so that his spear turned in his hand he half turned the panic obvious in his openfaced helmet as neoptolymoss second thrust took him in the cheek carving through his teeth and jaw and into the back of his throat i knew in some trained portion of my mind that i had left the enemy to my left for too long and i turned my head and thrust with my shield just in time to catch a thrust coming from that direction but gaius bless him was there and he powered forward shieldcut the man forcing him to raise his aspis and then cut beneath it into the mans leg and we had won war is chaos and a battlefield is so much a piece of the outer night that no man can really tell you exactly what happened in any one place but from what i saw it appeared that neoptolymoss illyrian cousins cut into the back of the attempted charge at dauds cavalry panicking the enemy left which then became a mob of frightened men and not part of an army dauds charge foolish under other circumstances passed into the gap killing few enemies but sewing despair and neoptolymos killed his uncle our front broke their front and they ran i doubt the fighting lasted as long as it takes a man in armour to run the hoplitodromos we didnt win because of my brilliant plan or discipline or armour or the hill behind us or our cavalry all contributed a little but the will of the gods and a healthy draught of luck won us the day and the furies their wings and claws beating at epidavros may he rot id like to say that neoptolymos forgave his uncles relatives and retainers but he didnt and there was a lot of blood in the next few hours his cousins gathered around him shouting out each indignity that they had endured at epidavross hands and they mutilated the mans corpse then they started to execute the prisoners slave and free noble and peasant i could have stopped it but i didnt i suppose that i had secretly wanted dagon to be in the harbour he wasnt but there were three carthaginian ships all small coasters and we took them from the land while dionysus closed the harbour mouth and as the storm came up at sunset our triremes came onto the harbour beach safe from the storm which raged for three days with adriatic ferocity while the streets of the stronghold ran with blood i know philosophers who praise the illyrians and the other barbarians for the purity of their way of life the honesty of a world where a mans strength is in his hands and his weapons as a warrior i realize that this may sound hopelessly pious but as the rainthinned blood ran down the cobbled streets of dyrachos and epidavross relatives retainers and womenfolk were hunted raped and executed i could only think of them all as barbarians it can happen in greece it has happened in greece but by the gods we do what we can to avoid it dionysus took epidavross daughters as slaves to sell in syracusa in brothels neoptolymos sat on an ivory chair in the citadel he had blood under his nails i have blood on my hands too i embraced him and wished him well but i wanted no more of illyria he loaded me with gifts gold cups an aegyptian ostrich egg a silk cloak from cyprus he was openhanded with his uncles riches which was as well as all of us had oarsmen to pay on the first fine day i piled all of our loot our plunder and our gifts on blankets on the beach with silver ingots and bronze kettles helmets swords spearheads we began the division of the spoils i sat on my stool to adjudicate arguments will that girl clean up well when she stops crying can she weave compare her value to the value of that silver inlaid helmet whats between her legs is softer but a moment of fever and shes a stinking corpse and the helmet will protect your head ah thugater you hide your head what do you think those scenes in the iliad are about when men divide the spoils it took two days there were the carthaginian prisoners by then we had learned from them that dagon had escaped us by less than two weeks but at sea two weeks is an eternity and his ship had been clear of the adriatic before our sails nicked the horizon at any rate i took the prisoners as i was determined to send the bastard a message men made their marks on everything and there was some rearranging of crews most of my oarsmen wanted to go home to massalia not leukas the alban or some of the others and daud and sittonax were done wed sworn oaths and now they were satisfied they would be going home doola and seckla would return to our little town under the mountains i was going back to plataea we loaded the spoils on different ships and we exchanged oarsmen we drank together one last time it is odd i think and speaks directly to the power of the gods and of our oath that of the seven who swore one day on a beach in etrusca we all lived to go to alba and six of us gathered on a beach in illyria to say goodbye despite slavery war betrayal and murder we sacrificed an ox sent his thigh bones to zeus and asked the king of the gods to witness that we had fulfilled our oaths to each other gaius and i made all of them swear to be guest friends and each of us swore to visit the others again giannis took the pentekonter for the oarsmen who were bound for massalia megakles just shrugged ill go where you go he said simply as long as i never have to serve under that fuckhead again by whom he meant dionysus doola and i had a long conversation the last night at dyrachos perhaps someday ill tell you what we said he felt i was making a terrible mistake in going home violence burns you like fire he said you sound like dano i said he shrugged i no longer eat meat and now that i have fulfilled my oath i will go back to croton and become an initiate he said you should too i am a man of war sometimes when one man wrongs another only violence will settle the matter we argued but we embraced and the next day i sailed for athens with cimon harpagos and paramanos under my stern and sekla on my deck he embraced doola but he came with me you get wounded in every fight doola said in the end youll be killed sekla grinned everyone dies he said i want to see athens and then perhaps ill go home the full irony of the next part cant come home to you children unless you understand that i thought that was the end of adventure i was at sardis lade and marathon i went to alba i was thirtyone years old and it was time to grow up and go home face the burnedout forge kiss my sister grow a crop perhaps arrange for another wife children certainly thats what cimon and harpagos and paramanos and sekla and i discussed the next two nights as we worked our way down the coast of illyria past leucas and landed at last at ithaca i felt like odysseus returning and we made some jokes the truth is too much blood had been spilled at dyrachos for too little and we were not ourselves i have found that men of blood can go into black moods for little reason that was one of those times for me indeed as we rowed south towards the peloponnese the same darkness began to come over me that had driven me off the cliff at alkyonis when i tried to kill myself i was savage to megakles who bore it with amused resignation and to ka who glowed with his own rage and to sekla who grinned and paid me no further attention that night though i saw a satyr near pheia men say they are myth other men say they live only in the chersonese or only in scythia or only around olympia i know what i saw and the wonder of seeing it transfigured me i had walked off the beach to have a piss and i came back all but glowing cimon believed me told me he had seen one himself in the south of the peloponnese while brasidas ridiculed me and told me to grow up brasidas had come with us as a passenger he had the money to pay his mess bill or the term of his exile was over either way it might have been the longest speech id heard from him up until that date you sound more like thales than like a spartan i said all spartans are philosophers he said they have to talk about something in between fighting cimon said i had decided to sail all the way to athens to sell my loot before going across the mountains to boeotia in truth i think i was delaying my return home now that id decided on it it scared me or rather confronting my sister scared me and the thought that she might have died in the meantime i thought a great deal about odysseus to tell you the truth the next day the sky was red at dawn and we debated spending the day on the beach but the rain when it came was gentle and we put to sea but the visibility got worse and worse and by midday i couldnt see any of the other ships the wind was rising and i turned the bow for shore and the wind changed we had had the wind alongside all day and now it swung from west to east and came up with a howl almost as fast as i can tell the story an hour later it was as dark as night the wind howled in the rigging and the rowers were exhausted and i knew i couldnt land the ship in this i had sailed the western ocean and i had been captain of my own ship for fifteen years at that point but i would have liked to have paramanos harpagos or demetrios or doola at my side or miltiades or cimon for that matter all of them better yet i was with megakles at the steering oars we have to turn and run before the wind i shouted wearily he nodded well i hoped he agreed i ran down the sail deck to leukas and sekla held their arms while i shouted in their ears thats how bad the wind was leukas looked at the sea for a moment as if he hoped that something would save us a friendly sea monster perhaps then we began to run along among the oar benches crawling when we had to we told every oarsman what we were going to do every one because turning a galley across big waves in a high wind is suicide we had no choice only excellent luck and fine rowing and the favour of poseidon would win us through i ordered sekla to get the boatsail up i needed leukas to get the oarsmen around and i was going to be at the steering oars with megakles but the boatsail required timing and boatsail courage and sekla had plenty of both he took ka and the archers even from the bow i could see nothing to the east but i thought i could hear breakers under the wind there was no time to think i got on the starboard steering oar i caught megakles eye and he nodded the wind roared we rose on a wave about ship i called with every force i had the portside rowers reversed their benches as the bow fell off from the wind the wind wanted us broadside we were still climbing a great breaker and then the portside oars bit the starboard oars pivoted through another stroke there was a crack forward where ka had cut the boltrope of the boatsail and it filled filled cracked slapped and tore in half but in those heartbeats while it was intact it swung the ship a third of the way around and the oars now had purchase and the bow was a little west of south we hit the top of the wave and we werent broadside on and started down the two oarbanks gave a great heave like hoplites pushing at the climax of battle our bow came around another point while the wind screamed and then we were around even the ruins of the boatsail were enough to keep the bow pointed west and now we were running free and the rising sea was under the stern megakles used to swear we were close enough to prote that he could have thrown a rock and hit the shore i dont know i never looked back we spent the night at sea running before the wind and rain the turn was terrifying but it was in many ways less fearsome than that soaking endless maw of darkness and freak waves that rolled across our seas against the wind making my life and megakles an endless torment of crisis but we did it on and on and finally the sky was a paler grey the mainmast went about morning the pole was bare of course but the force of the wind had borne upon it all night sometimes lashing it back and forth and never had i thought so ill of the ships rig and finally there was a thump from below a scream as an oarsman was pulped by the swinging stump of the mast and then it was gone over the side will of the gods it might just as easily have gone through the shell of the ship and broken us in half but it didnt it killed one man it only had two heavy ropes supporting it and we cut them away with swords as fast as we could took a wave that soaked every man aboard and nigh filled us with water and then the rags of the boatsail took the windboatsail and we were back on course bailing like mad that was the last gust of the storm we were all but sunk the wave that struck us filled the bilges and a trireme is a difficult ship to empty of water our rowers were already exhausted and now they were trying to pull the weight of five thousand mythemnoi of water through the waves the boatsail kept us alive but we were wallowing and had the storm risen again to its former ferocity we would have foundered right there we bailed and bailed and rigged our wooden pumps and used helmets and buckets and clay pots and anything we had to get water over the side we tossed the dead mans corpse to poseidon little by little we won our ship back from the sea i cant tell you how long we bailed i only know that every man not rowing was standing in the icy water between the thranites legs passing buckets up or taking empty ones down and dumping them as fast as we could and then when megakles reported that we were steering and the wind had died away i went up to the sail deck curiously naked without a mainmast to a calm grey day with a hint of a breeze and every chance of sun later the sea i ordered leukas to belay bailing long enough to rig the second boatsail in no time we were moving smartly and all the oarsmen were bailing and men began to complain about the lack of water to drink thats when i knew we were going to live i knew we were well south of the peloponnese in the great blue deep between carthage sicily athens and cyrene i watched the water for a while and let the wind take us south and west the rowers were exhausted i needed land water and food men slept fitfully and i told them all we would be another night at sea i served out half the water we had and all the grain and stale bread and a dozen flasks of wine it was thanks to poseidon an easy night as the sun touched the eastern rim of the aspis of the world with her rosy fingers we saw a trireme lying under our lee low in the water and unmoving without even a boatsail rigged we didnt even have to run down on her our ship was pointed at her i thought for a little bit she might be cimons or paramanoss but as we got closer i thought she was harpagoss storm cutter until i remembered that the old phoenician ship was gone replaced by a sleek athenian hull this was no athenian this was a heavy phoenician warship the kind that fills the centre of their line in battle as we manned the oars and brasidas armed the marines we saw them doing the same the damaged ship began to crawl away from us and her archers lofted a dozen shafts and one of kas men was killed outright they were rowing directly away from us which was insane we had the wind they couldnt outrun the wind it was shockingly poor seamanship not that they were going to escape fewer than half their oars were being worked i motioned to leukas and he took in our boatsail when we were two stadia apart and we rowed not that my lads were rowing better than theirs but i had a great many more exhausted desperate men id like to think my first intention had been rescue before the arrow killed kas man now as we closed the arrows came thick and fast kas nubians returned them shaft for shaft i went forward with brasidas we were going to ram the phoenicians stern and board i made it to the foredeck with only two arrows in my aspis on lydia we had a screen built in front of the marines boarding station long experience had shown me how dangerous this post was in a ship fight my screen was riddled with arrows we were ten horselengths apart i could now see why my opponent was running straight downwind he had no steering oars damned fool he started the fight by lofting arrows at us a fight he couldnt win from the phoenician ship there was a roar of rage and a sound of many women screaming another arrow struck my aspis it struck hard enough to rock my body back and the head of the arrow drove through three layers of good willow and one of bronze and the light bronze head protruded a good three fingers above my naked arm in the porpax kas lieutenant artax took an arrow that went through the wooden screen and hit his bow shattering the wood and horn artax stood there with the lower arm of the bow in his hand staring at it i reached out threw a hand around his neck and pulled him to the deck before he got killed the truth was my nubians were losing the fight theyd put a great many arrows in the air and they had the wind behind them but they were exchanging arrows with persians persian noblemen i was guessing by the length of the shafts and their thickness warriors trained from youth to draw the bow and shoot well bows that i had to struggle to draw arrows as thick as a ladys finger and as long as my arm my aspis fielded another one look thugater it is the third aspis there with the raven in bronze see the holes all from that day count them eleven holes each time an arrow shot by a persian nobleman hits you your body staggers as if youve taken a blow and when two hit together you rock back a step ka had an arrow through his bicep the blood was red and his skin didnt appear so dark he slumped to the deck his back against the lower part of the screen sorry lord he said i shook my head he and his nubians had done pretty well considering brasidas was crouched behind me the spartan was brilliantly trained but he wasnt stupid and my marines were crouched in rows ready to go over the bow i wished for doola and his heavy bow keep your aspis up when you jump from our ship to theirs go fast and keep your aspis towards the archers understand me i shouted the words men nodded the man behind brasidas darius licked his lips i never thought id be fighting persians again he said ah said brasidas he brightened these are persians i nodded at least half a dozen of their noble archers i said someone on that ship is important we were very close i wasnt going to raise my head to find out just how close but the archery had stopped and i could hear the sound of swords screams from men who were wounded and the shrill keening of women quite a few women i raised my head above the screen we were passing down the enemy side you cant board over a wellbuilt triremes stern of course the stern timbers rise like a swans neck over the helmsmans station and there is no purchase for any but the most desperate boarder megakles was running up the enemys side he or leukas had coaxed a burst from our oarsmen and now we shot along our oars came in and we crushed the few oars the phoenician had over the side our bow struck their side just forward of the rowers station and we spun the enemy ship a little in the water and had we been at full speed wed have rolled her over and sunk her right there it was a brilliant piece of helmsmanship as it was we tipped the heavier ship our ram biting on his keel or some projection below the waterline and our bow catching his gunwale so that he took on water at them i shouted i dont remember much of the boarding action because of what came next but this is what i do remember i pulled the rope that held the screen and it fell forward and i jumped up onto it ran a few steps and leaped for the enemy ship i got one foot on the gunwale and had one heartbeat to see the whole ghastly drama right in the stern around the helmsmans station stood four persians helmets scale shirts long linen robes and fine boots one was still shooting and the other three were armed with short spears and swords behind them packed into the swans neck were a dozen women some screaming and some clutching daggers in and among the women were two corpses one of a persian with gold bracelets and gold on his sword his head in the lap of a woman in a long persian coat with sleeves and a shawl even as i watched she laid his head to the side and took his sword from his hand forward of them was a horde of desperate men with various weapons boarding pikes spears broken oars swords and fists the pile of dead in front of the persians told its own story i leaped down onto the afterdeck phoenicians are often decked directly above the rowing compartment this one was decked over the afterrowing area like lydia brasidas landed on the deck behind me clear the riffraff away from the persians i ordered the desperate dehydrated unfed oarsmen should have been easy meat but they were not there were an awful lot of them and their desperation was total let me tell you how fighting is while i was killing them i never thought of how i had been in the very same position once of how understandable was their desperation i called them riffraff hah i have been riffraff but they were beyond fear it was like fighting thracians they came at me first in ones and twos as their rear ranks discovered us and then the mass of them trying to crush us or throw us over the sides before we got all of our marines on their deck and formed up i was hit repeatedly in the first moments and never have i had such cause to bless an armourer as i did anaxsikles i took a heavy blow on top of my outstretched right foot and the bronze turned it a boarding pike went past my aspis on my naked right side and scored my bronzearmoured thigh and the blow slipped away turning like rain from a good roof a thrown javelin left a deep dent in my right greave and then the shaft rotated and slapped hard into my left ankle and there was bronze there too their screams and roars were those of a hundredheaded monster and that monster had two hundred arms and unlimited stores of strength the press of men struck my aspis and i staggered back a step and behind me was empty air and water listen then this is who i was as they came to contact my spear flew like the raven on my shield i had a trick id practised for a year rifling the spear from my shoulder on a leather lanyard so that in fact i threw it about the width of a mans palm but the leather never left my hand and armoured wrist so that i could tear it out of a corpse when done just right the spear would either take a life or bounce off a shield or armour and return to my hand like a magical thing ah the man from halicarnassus doubts me hand me that spear the heavy one im not so old that my hand cannot hold a spear watch my children three times into the old beam in as many heartbeats no man can block all three unless the gods give him strength ah you interrupted me with your doubts young man listen then my first blow went into the bridge of a mans nose and before he fell to the deck my second blow went deep into his mate to the right and the man fell to the deck clutching my spear i stepped forward into the moment of time created by the kills and twisted my spear in his guts ripped it clear and killed a third man with my sauroter as the spike rotated up just like that by the will of heracles my spear didnt break and i threw it forward again on my wrist thong and missed and my bronze spike slammed into an unarmoured man my right side was naked and every heartbeat i waited for the spear in the ribs that would end my fight i had boarded confident that we would break the persians in a moment and now i was fighting for my life but nothing came into my right side a man threw his arms around my aspis seeking to break my arm i thrust forward with both legs into the press and he tripped and my sauroter went into his mouth and out again his limbs loosened and he fell brasidas tapped his aspis against me on my right to tell me that he was there i whirled my spear over my head changing the sauroter for the spear point roared my war cry heracles they all came at us at once and there was a long time there that i remember nothing except that i killed men and no man killed me they were soft and unarmoured and i was covered in bronze they were not warriors and i was trained from boyhood and yet they almost had me again and again desperation makes all men equal a small man in a phrygian cap caught my spear arm and tore my spear away broke my balance dragged me forward and a dozen blows fell on my armour and helmet one a spear punched that small hole in the backplate of my thorax see i got the sword out from under my arm my fancy longbladed xiphos was too damned long hard to draw in a press i couldnt get it clear of the scabbard and i almost died trying two men were trying to press me to the deck brasidas killed one i saw his spearhead but he had his own dozen opponents i went to one knee something cold was in my right side and something hot was trickling down the middle of my back a woman screamed i thought i knew that woman and that scream i got my foot under me and pushed my right hand gave up on the xiphos and went instead to the stout dagger i always wore at my right hip like a beautiful thought it rose from its scabbard and my hand buried it in my immediate grappling adversarys arm he had to let go i must have stabbed twenty times punching with a dagger over and over as i cleared the space around me i was blind sweaty and my helmet twisted just a fraction on my head but it didnt matter and any man i could touch i cut or stabbed i felt an aspis press into my back i heard darius shout im here lord i rotated my hips and let him step forward only then did i discover that the little rat with the cap had dislocated my left shoulder and my shield hung at my side like a dead thing its odd what your body can do when it is life or death we had ten marines aboard by then doing what they did best they had to fight to get into a formation and we lost one but when brasidas and nine hoplites were formed in a rough line five wide and two deep they were unstoppable on a ship i got my helmet off only then did i see that my right hand was pouring with blood apparently at some point i grabbed a blade i dropped the aspis off my left arm leukas came onto our deck he had good armour and a gaulish helmet and carried a long sword he led a dozen of our deck crewmen who were better armoured than many poorer hoplites his sword whirled id never seen him fight he was full of fury and i remember thinking that he should be trained an odd thought to have in a fight but his noholdsbarred approach was ideal for facing down a crowd of badly armed men and when the deck crew crossed behind him the fight began to be a massacre i stood and breathed and bled of course and then i turned and walked over the pile of corpses towards the persians i had no aspis and one of them the youngest by ten years id guess had an arrow on his string i knew one of these persians greetings brother i said to cyrus i reached up my bleeding hand and tipped my helmet back cyrus was the centre persian he was a superb swordsman and a fine archer ive mentioned him before and his brother darius and their friend arynam the world is truly very small at least among fighting men cyrus laughed and his teeth showed white in his oldwood face ari he shouted in persian he said brothers we are saved this one is my friend my sword brother we embraced and i bled on his armour and apologized tell your women they dont have to stab themselves i said i slapped cyrus on the shoulder i felt alive behind me the desperate oarsmen threw down their weapons and begged for mercy the persian woman by cyrus dropped her weapon and threw back her shawl and stepped forward into my arms sometimes i think that we are mere playthings of the gods and sometimes that they mean us to be happy men were dying at my back there was blood running over my sandals a friend of my youth stood at my shoulder i saw none of them because the woman in my arms was briseis epilogue my voice is gone and ive talked enough the halicarnassans stylus hand must hurt like fire or be cramped like an oarsmans after a long row and my thugater must be tired of hearing her old man brag eh ill wager youll come back tomorrow because tomorrow ill tell of how we went to aegypt how we explored the erytherean sea how we found dagon but what youll come back for is the fight with the persians at artemesium where the greeks showed persia we could fight at sea and at thermopylae where the spartans showed us all how much like gods we could be i was thirtyone and i thought the adventure was over it was just beginning
