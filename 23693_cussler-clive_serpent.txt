clive cusslers serpent introducing a friend when i was asked to introduce kurt austin joe zavala and their friends who serve the national underwater and marine agency i accepted with great pleasure and enthusiasm ive had the privilege of knowing kurt and joe for many years we first met when they joined numa at admiral sandeckers invitation not long after al giordino and i came on board although weve never had the opportunity to work on the same project together kurt and joes escapades above and underwater have often fired my imagination and left me wishing id done that in some ways kurt and i are similar hes a few years younger and we hardly look alike but he lives in an old remodeled boathouse on the potomac river and collects antique dueling pistols a wise choice when you consider how much simpler they are to maintain and store than the old cars in my aircraft hangar hes also into rowing and sailing which sends me into exhaustion just thinking about it kurt is resourceful and shrewd and he has more guts than a white shark on steroids hes also a genuine nice guy with two tons of integrity who believes in the flag mothers and apple pie to my chagrin the ladies find him very attractive even more attractive than they find me the only obscure conclusion i can reachit pains me deeply to say sois that between the two of us hes better looking im happy that kurt and joes exploits are finally being chronicled from the numa files there is not the slightest doubt that you will find them entertaining as well as an intriguing way to while away the time i know that i have dirk pitt acknowledgments with appreciation to don stevens for taking us down to the andrea doria without getting our feet wet and for the work of two fine writers alvin moscow and william hoffer whose books collision course and saved so vividly describe the human side of that great sea tragedy and for the tenacity of that intrepid explorer john l stephens who braved mosquitoes and malaria as he trekked through the yucatan discovering the wonders of the lost mayan civilization prologue july south of nantucket island so quickly did the pale ship appear she seemed to spring whole from the depths gliding like a ghost across the silver pool of luminescence cast by the near full moon tiaras of porthole lights glittered along her bonewhite sides as she raced eastward in the warm night her sharply raked bow knifing through the flat seas as easily as a stiletto cutting through black satin high in the darkened bridge of the swedish american liner stockholm seven hours and miles east of new york city second mate gunnar nillson scanned the moonlit ocean the big rectangular windows that wrapped around the wheelhouse gave him a panoramic view as far as he could see the surface was calm except for a ragged swell here and there the temperature was in the seventies a pleasant change from the heavy humid air that weighed over the stockholm that morning as the liner left its berth at the fifty seventh street pier and headed down the hudson river remains of the woolly overcast drifted in tattered shrouds across the porcelain moon visibility was a half dozen miles to starboard nillson swept his eyes to port where the thin dark horizon line became lost behind a hazy murkiness that veiled the stars and welded the sky and sea for a moment he was lost in the drama of the scene sobered by the thought of the vast and trackless emptiness yet to be crossed it was a common feeling among mariners and it would have lasted longer if not for the tingling in the soles of his feet the power produced by the massive twin horsepower diesels seemed to flow up from the engine room through the vibrating deck and into his body which swayed almost imperceptibly to adjust for the slight roll dread and wonder ebbed to be replaced by the omnipotent sensation that comes with being in command of a swift liner racing across the ocean at top speed at feet sterntostern and feet in the beam the stockholm was the smallest liner in the transatlantic trade yet she was a special ship sleek as a yacht with racy lines that swept back from her long forecastle to a stern as softly rounded as a wine glass her gleaming skin was all white except for a single yellow funnel nillson luxuriated in the power of command with a snap of his fingers the three crewmen on watch would jump to his orders with a flick of a lever on the ships telegraphs he could set bells clanging and men scurrying to action he chuckled recognizing his hubris for what it was his fourhour watch was essentially a series of routine tasks aimed at keeping the ship on an imaginary line that would bring it to an imaginary point near the stubby red lightship that guarded nantuckets treacherous shoals there the stockholm would make the northeasterly turn onto a course that would take its passengers past sable island on a straight shot across the atlantic to the north of scotland and finally copenhagen harbor even though he was only twenty eight and had joined the stockholm barely three months earlier nillson had been on boats since he could walk as a teenager hed worked the baltic sea herring bats and later served as an apprentice seaman with a huge shipping company then came the swedish nautical college and a stint in the swedish navy the stockholm was one more step in achieving his dream to be master of his own ship nillson was an exception to the common tall blond scandinavian stereotype there was more of venice than viking in him he had inherited his mothers italian genes along with her chestnut hair olive skin smallboned stature and sunny temperament darkhaired swedes were not unusual at times nillson wondered if the mediterranean warmth lurking in his large brown eyes had anything to do with his captains frostiness more likely it was a combination of scandinavian reserve and the rigid swedish maritime tradition of strict discipline nevertheless nillson worked harder than he had to he didnt want to give the captain a single reason to find fault even on this peaceful night with no traffic near flat seas and perfect weather nillson paced from one wing of the bridge to the other as if the ship were in the teeth of a hurricane the stockholms bridge was divided into two spaces the twentyfootwide wheelhouse in front and the separate chartroom behind it the doors leading out to the wings were left open to the light southwest breeze at each side of the bridge was an rca radar set and a ships telegraph at the center of the wheelhouse the helmsman stood on a wooden platform a few inches off the polished deck his back to the dividing wall hands gripping the steering wheel eyes on the face of a gyrocompass to his left directly in front of the helm below the center window was a course box the three wooden blocks in the box were printed with numbers to keep the helmsmans mind focused on the heading the blocks were set at nillson had come up a few minutes before his eightthirty watch to look at the weather reports fog was forecast for the area hear the nantucket lightship no surprise there the warm waters of the nantucket shoals were a virtual fog factory the officer going off duty told him the stockholm was just north of the course set by the captain how far north he couldnt tell the radio positioning beacons were too far away to get a fix nillson smiled no surprise here either the captain always took the same course twenty miles north of the eastbound sealane recommended by international agreement the route wasnt mandatory and the captain preferred the more northerly track because it saved time and fuel scandinavian captains did not do bridge watch customarily leaving the ship in charge of a single officer nillson quickly settled into a series of tasks pace the bridge check the righthand radar glance at the engine telegraphs on each wing of the bridge to make sure they were set full speed ahead scan the sea from a wing make sure the two white masthead navigation lights were on stroll back into the wheelhouse study the gyrocompass keep the helmsman on his toes pace some more the captain came up around nine after having dinner in his cabin directly below the bridge a taciturn man in his late fifties he looked older his craggy profile worn around the edges like a rocky promontory ground smooth by the unrelenting sea his posture was still ramrod straight his uniform razorcreased icebergblue eyes glinted alertly from the weathered ruins of his ruddy face for ten minutes he paced behind the bridge gazing at the ocean and sniffing the warm air like a bird dog catching the scent of pheasant then he went into the wheelhouse and studied the navigation chart as if in search of an omen after a moment he said change course to eightyseven degrees nillson turned the oversized dice in the course box to read the captain stayed long enough to watch the helmsman adjust the wheel then returned to his cabin back in the chartroom nillson erased the ninetydegree line penciled in the captains new course and figured the ships position by dead reckoning he extended the track line according to speed and time elapsed and drew in an x the new line would take them about five miles from the lightship nillson figured strong northerly currents would push the ship as dose as two miles nillson went over to the radar set near the right door and switched the range from fifteen miles to fifty miles the thin yellow sweep hand highlighted the slender arias of cape cod and the islands of nantucket and marthas vineyard ships were too small for the radar to pick up at that range he returned the range to its original setting and resumed his pacing around ten the captain returned to the bridge ill be in my cabin doing paperwork he announced ill make the course change north in two hours call me to the bridge if you see the lightship before then he squinted out a window as if he sensed something he couldnt see or if there is fog or other bad weather the stockholm was now forty miles west of the lightship close enough to pick up its radio beacon the radio direction finder indicated that the stockholm was more than two miles north of the captains course currents must be pushing the stockholm north nillson concluded another rdf fix minutes later showed the ship nearly three miles north of the course still nothing to be alarmed about hed simply keep a close eye on it standing orders were to call the captain in case of drift off course nillson pictured the expression on the captains seamed face the hardly veiled contempt in those seabitten eyes you called me up here from my cabin for this nillson scratched his chin in thought maybe the problem was with the direction finder the radio beacons still might be too far away for an accurate fix nillson knew he was a creature of the captains will yet he was after all the officer in command of the bridge he made his decision steer eightynine he ordered the helmsman the wheel moved to the right taking the ship slightly south closer to the original course the bridge crew changed posts as it did every eighty minutes lars hansen came in from standby and took over the helm nillson grimaced not altogether pleased with the change he never felt comfortable sharing a shift with the man the swedish navy was all business officers talked to the crewmen only to give orders pleasantries simply were not exchanged nillson sometimes broke the rule quietly sharing a joke or wry observation with a crewman never with hansen this was hansens first voyage on the stockholm he came on board as a lastminute replacement when the man who signed on hadnt shown up according to hansens papers hed kicked around on a number of ships yet nobody couldplace him which was hard to believe hansen was lanternjawed tall broadshouldered and his blond hair was cropped close to the scalp the same description could apply to a few million other scandinavian men in their early twenties it would be hard to forget hansens face a fierce white scar ran from his prominent cheekbone nearly to the righthand corner of his mouth so his lips seemed turned up on one side in a grotesque smile hansen had served mostly on freighters which might explain his anonymity nillson suspected it was more likely the mans behavior he kept to himself spoke only when he was spoken to and then not very much nobody ever asked him about his scar he turned out to be a good crewman nillson had to admit jumping smartly to orders and carrying them out without a question which was why nillson was puzzled as he checked the compass on past shifts hansen had shown himself to be a competent helmsman tonight he was letting the ship drift as if his attention were wandering nillson understood that it took a while to get the feel of the helm except for the current though steering was undemanding no howling wind no giant seas breaking over the deck just move the wheel a little this way a little that way nillson checked the gyrocompass no doubt about it the ship was yawing slightly he stood close to the helmsmans shoulder keep a tight line hansen he said with gentle humor this isnt a warship you know hansens head swiveled on the muscular neck the reflected glow from the compass imparted an animal glitter to his eyes and accentuated the deepness of the scar heat seemed to radiate from his glare sensing a quiet aggressiveness nillson almost stepped backward in reflex he stubbornly held his ground though and gestured at the course box numerals the helmsman stared at him without expression for a few seconds then nodded almost imperceptibly nillson made sure the course was steady mumbled his approval then escaped into the chartroom hansen gave him the creeps he thought shivering as he took another radio fix to see the effect of the drift something didnt make sense even with the twodegree correction to the south the stockholm was north of the course by three miles he went back into the wheelhouse and without looking at hansen he ordered two degrees to the right hansen eased the wheel to ninetyone degrees nillson changed the course box numbers and stayed by the compass until he was satisfied hansen had brought the ship onto the new tack then he bent over the radar the yellow glow from the scope giving his dark skin a jaundiced tinge the sweep hand illuminated a blip off to the left side of the screen about twelve miles away nillson raised an eyebrow the stockholm had company unknown to nillson the stockholms hull and superstructure were being washed by unseen electronic waves that rippled back to the revolving radar antenna high atop the bridge of a ship speeding toward it from the opposite direction minutes earlier inside the spacious bridge of the italian line passenger ship andrea doria the officer manning the radar scope called out to a stocky man wearing a navy beret and a uniform of evening blue captain i see a ship seventeen miles four degrees to starboard the radar had been monitored constantly at twentymile range since three oclock when superior captain piero calamai walked onto the bridge wing and saw gray wisps hovering over the western sea like the souls of drowned men immediately the captain had ordered the ship rigged for running in the fog the man crew had been on full alert the foghorn was blowing automatically at hundredsecond intervals the crows nest lookout was reassigned to the bow where hed have a clearer view the engineroom crew was put on standby primed to react instantly in an emergency the doors between the ships eleven watertight compartments were sealed the andrea doria was on the last leg of a mile nineday voyage from its home port of genoa carrying passengers and tons of freight despite the dense fog pressing down on its decks the doria cruised at dose to its full speed its massive horsepower twinturbine engines pushing the big ship through the sea at twentytwo knots the italian line did not gamble with its ships and passengers nor did it pay captains to arrive behind schedule time was money no one knew this any better than captain calamai who had commanded the ship on ail its transatlantic crossings he was determined that the ship would arrive in new york not one second beyond the hour it had lost in a storm two nights earlier when the doria had rolled by the lightship at tentwenty pm the bridge could pick the vessel up on radar and hear the lonely moan of its foghorn but it was invisible at less than a mile away with the lightship behind them the dorias captain ordered a course due west to new york the radar pip was heading east directly at the doria calamai bent over the radar screen his brow furrowed watching the blips progress the radar couldnt tell the captain what hind of ship he was looking at or how big it was he didnt know he was looking at a fast ocean liner with a combined speed of forty knots the two ships were dosing on each other at the rate of two miles every three minutes the ships position was puzzling eastbound ships were supposed to follow a route twenty miles to the south fishing boat maybe under the rules of the road ships coming directly at each other on the open sea are supposed to pass porttoport left side to left side like cars approaching from opposite directions if ships maneuvering to comply with this rule are forced into a dangerous crossover they may instead pass starboardtostarboard from the look of the radar the other vessel would pass safely to the right of the doria if the two vessels held their same course like autos on an english highway where drivers stay to the left calamai ordered his crew to keep a close eye on the other ship it never hurt to be cautious the ships were about ten miles apart when nillson switched on the light underneath the bial maneuvering board next to the radar set and prepared to transfer the blips changing position to paper he called out whats our heading hansen ninety degrees the helmsman replied evenly nillson marked xs on the plotting board and drew lines between them checked the blip again then ordered the standby lookout to keep watch from the port bridge wing his plot line had shown the other ship speeding in their direction on a parallel course slightly to the left he went out onto the wing and probed the night with binoculars no sign of another vessel he paced back and forth from wing to wing stopping at the radar with each pass he called for another heading report still ninety degrees sir hansen said nillson started over to check the gyrocompass even the slightest deviation could be critical and he wanted to make certain the course was true hansen reached up and pulled the lanyard over his head the ships belt rang out six times eleven oclock nillson loved hearing ships time on a late shift when loneliness and boredom combined the pealing of the ships bell embodied the romantic attachment he had felt for the sea as a youngster later he would remember that clanging as the sound of doom distracted from his intended chore nillson peered into the radar scope and made another mark on the plotting board eleven oclock seven miles separated the two ships nillson calculated that the ships would pass each other porttoport with more than enough distance in between he went out on the wing again and peered through binoculars off to the left maddening there was only darkness where radar showed a ship to be maybe the running lights were broken or it was a navy ship on maneuvers he looked off to the right the moon was shining brightly on the water back to the left still nothing could the ship be in a fog bank unlikely no ship would move that fast in dense fog he considered decreasing the stockholms speed no the captain would hear the jangle of the ships telegraph and come running hed call that frostyassed bastard after the ships had safely passed at radar on both vessels showed them four miles apart still no lights nillson again considered calling the captain and again dismissed the idea nor did he give the order to sound warning signals as required by international law a waste of time they were on open ocean the moon was out and visibility must be five miles the stockholm continued to cut through the night at eighteen knots the man in the crows nest called out lights to port finally later analysts would shake their heads in puzzlement wondering how two radarequipped ships could be drawn together like magnets on the open ocean nillson strode onto the left bridge wing and read the other ships lights two white pinpoints one high one low glowed in darkness good the position of the lights indicated that the ship would pass off to the left the red portside light came into view confirming that the ship was heading away from the stockholm the ships would pass porttoport radar put the distance at more than two miles he glanced at the clock it was pm from what the andrea dorias captain could see on the radar screen the ships should pass each other safely on the right when the ships were less than three and a half miles apart calamai ordered a fourdegree turn to the left to open up the gap been them soon a spectral glow appeared in the fog and gradually white running lights became visible captain calamai expected to see the green light on the other ships starboard side any time now one mile apart nillson remembered how an observer said the stockholm cold turn on a dime and give you eight cents change it was time to put that nimbleness to use starboard two points he ordered the helm like calamai h wanted more breathing room hansen brought the wheel two complete turns to the right the ships bow went twenty degrees to starboard straighten out to midships and keep her steady the telephone rang on the wall nillson went over to answer it bridge nillson said confident of a safe passing he faced the wall his back to the windows the crows nest lookout was calling lights twenty degrees to port thank you nillson replied and hung up he went over and checked the radar unaware of the dorias new trajectory the blips were now so dose to each other the reading didnt make any sense to him he went to the port wing and without arty urgency raised his binoculars to his eyes and focused on the fights calmness deserted him my god he gasped seeing the change in the masthead lights for the first time the high and low lights had reversed themselves the ship no longer had its red portside light to him the light was green starboard side since hed last looked the other ship seemed to have made a sharp turn to its left now the blazing deck lights of a huge black ship loomed from the thick fog balk that had kept it hidden and presented its right side directly in the path of the speeding stockholm he shouted a course change hard astarboard spinning around he gripped the levers of the ships telegraph with both hands yanked them to stop then all the way down as if he could bring the ship to a halt by sheer determination an insane jangle filled the air full speed astern nillson turned back to the helm hansen stood there like a stone guardian outside a pagan temple damn it i said hard astarboard nillson shouted his voice hoarse hansen began to turn the wheel nillson couldnt believe his eyes hansen wasnt rotating the wheel to starboard which would have given them a chance even a slight one to avoid a collision he spun it slowly and deliberately to the left the stockholms bow swung into a deadly turn nillson heard a foghorn knew it must belong to the other ship the engine room was in chaos the crew was frantically turning the wheel that would stop the starboard engine they scrambled to open the valves that would reverse power and stop the port engine the ship shuddered as braking took hold too late the stockholm flew like an arrow at the unprotected ship in the port wing nillson hung on grimly to the ships telegraph like nillson captain calamai had watched the masthead lights materialize reverse themselves saw the red portside light glowing like a ruby on back velvet realized the other ship had made a sharp right turn directly into the dorias path no warning no foghorn or whistle stopping was out of the question at this speed the ship would need miles of room to skid to a halt calamai had seconds to act he could order a right turn directly toward the danger hoping that the ships would brush each other maybe the speeding maria could outrun the attacking ship calamai made a desperate decision all left he barked a bridge officer called out did the captain want the engines shut down calamai shook his head maintain full speed he knew the doria turned better at higher velocity in a blur of spokes the helmsman whipped the wheel around to port using both hands the whistle shrieked twice to signal the left turn the big ship struggled against its forward momentum for a half mile before it heeled into the start of the turn the captain knew he was taking a big risk in exposing the dorias broad side he prayed that the other vessel would bear off while there was still time he still couldnt believe the ships were on a collision course the whole thing seemed like a dream a shout from one of his officers snapped him back to reality shes coming right at us the oncoming ship was pointed at the starboard wing where calamai watched in horror the sharp upturned bow seemed to be aimed directly at him the dorias skipper had a reputation for being tough and in control but at that moment he did what any sane man would have done in his position he ran for his life the swedish ships reinforced bow pierced the metal skin of the speeding andrea doria as easily as a bayonet penetrating almost a third of the liners ninetyfoot width before it came to rest with a weight of tons more than twice that of the stockholm the italian liner dragged the vessel with it pivoting around the point of impact below and aft of the starboard bridge wing as the stricken doria plunged ahead the stockholms crumpled prow pulled free ripping open seven of the liners ten passenger decks like a raptors beak tearing into the flesh of its victim it scraped along the long black hull in a bright shower of sparks the gaping wedgeshaped hole that yawned in the dorias side was forty feet at the top and narrowed to seven feet below sea level at the bottom thousands of gallons of seawater rushed into the massive wound and filled empty outboard fuel tanks tom open in the collision the ship tilted to the right under the weight of five hundred tons of seawater that flooded into the generator room an oily river poured through an access tunnel and manholes and began to rise through the floor gratings of the engine room the struggling engine crew slid on the oilslicked decks like circus clowns taking pratfalls more water gushed in surged around the undamaged empty fuel tanks on the port side and buoyed them up like soap bubbles within minutes of being hit the doria had heeled over into a severe list nillson expected to be flung to the floor by the impact the jolt was surprisingly soft yet strong enough to jar him from his paralysis he dashed from the wheelhouse into the chartroom and lunged for the alarm button that would close the stockholms watertight doors the captain roared onto the bridge what in gods name happened nillson tried to mouth an answer the words stuck in his throat he was at a loss to describe the scene hansen ignoring his order to go to starboard the blurred spin of the wheel to port hansen leaning forward into the wheel hands tightly clutching the spokes as if frozen in time no fear no horror in his eyes only a glacial blue coldness nillson thought it was a trick of the light at first the illumination from the gyrocompass housing catching the ugly scar there was no mistake as the ships hurtled toward certain disaster the man was smiling there was no doubt in his mind hansen had deliberately rammed the other ship aiming the stockholm as if he were riding a torpedo no doubt too that nobody not the captain or anyone else on the ship would ever believe such a thing could happened nillsons anguished eyes shifted from the captains angry face to the helm as if the answer lay there the deserted wheel spun madly out of control in all the confusion hansen had vanished jake corey was shocked from his slumber by a doomful metallic thunderclap the hollow boom lasted only an instant before it was followed by the tortured shriek of steel against steel and a terrifying crumple and crunch as if the upper deck cabin were imploding coreys eyes blinked open and he stared fearfully at what looked to be a moving grayishwhite wall only a few feet away carey had drifted off to sleep minutes before he had kissed his wife myra good night and slipped beneath the cool sheets of a twin bed in their firstclass cabin myra read a few pages of her novel until her eyelids drooped she switched off the light pulled the blanket dose around her neck and sighed with pleas ant memories of the sunbaked tuscan vineyards still in her head earlier she and jake had toasted the success of their italian sojourn with champagne in the firstclass dining room carey had suggested a nightcap in the belvedere lounge but myra replied that if she heard the band play arrivederci roma one more time shed swear off spaghetti forever they retired shortly before tenthirty pm after strolling handinhand past the shops in the foyer deck they took the elevator one level up and walked forward to their large upperdeck cabin on the starboard side they put their luggage out in the corridor where the stewards would collect it in anticipation of the ships arrival in new york the next day there was a slight roll to the ship because the vessel had become more topheavy as fuel in the big hull tanks was used up the motion was like being naked in a giant cradle and before long myra carey too fell asleep now her husbands bed lurched violently he was catapulted into the air as if hed been launched from a siege machine he floated in free fall for several lifetimes before splashing into a deep pool of darkness death stalked the decks of the andrea doria it roamed from the posh cabins on the higher levels to the touristclass accommodations below the waterline fiftytwo people lay dead or dying in the wake of the crash ten cabins were demolished in the firstclass deck where the hole was at its widest the hole was at its narrowest at the bottom but the cabins below the waterline were smaller and more crowded so the effect was even more devastating passengers died or lived according to the whims of fate a firstclass passenger whod been brushing his teeth ran back to the bedroom to find the wall gone his wife vanished on the deluxe foyer deck two people were killed instantly twentysix italian immigrants in the smaller cheaper cabins of the lowermost deck were right in line with the collision and died in a mass of crushed steel among them were a woman and her four young children there were miracles as well a young girl scooped out of a firstclass cabin woke up in the stockholms crumpled bow in another cabin the ceiling crashed down on a couple but they managed to crawl out into the corridor those from the two lowest decks had the toughest struggle fighting their way up the slanting smokefilled passageways against a stream of oilslicked black water gradually people began to work their way to the muster stations and waited for instructions captain calamai was at the far side of the undamaged bridge when the ships hit recovering from his initial shock he pulled the ships telegraph lever to stop the ship eventually came to a halt in the deep fog the second officer strode to the inclinometer the instrument that measured the ships angle eighteen degrees he said a few minutes later he said nineteen degrees cold fingers brushed the captains heart the list should be no more than fifteen degrees even with two compartments flooded a tilt of more than twenty degrees would overwhelm the watertight compartments logic was telling him the situation was impossible the designers guaranteed that the ship would remain on an even keel with any group of two compartments flooded he called for damage reports from each deck especially on the status of the watertight doors and ordered an sos sent out with the ships position officers rushed back to the bridge with damage reports the engineroom crew was pumping the starboard compartments but water was coming in faster than they could get it out the boiler room was flooded and water was flowing into two more compartments the problem was at a deck supposed to serve as a steel lid over the transverse bulkheads that divided the ship into compartments water was flowing down those passenger stairways into the other compartments the officer called out the new reading twentytwo degrees captain calamai didnt have to look at the inclinometer to know the list had passed the point where it could be corrected the evidence was in the slant of the chartlittered floor right at his feet the ship was dying he was numb with grief the andrea doria was not just any ship the twentyninemilliondollar queen of the italian line was the most magnificent and luxurious passenger vessel afloat barely four years old it was launched to show the world that the italian merchant marine was back in business after the war with its graceful black hull and white superstructure the rakish red white and green funnel the liner looked more like the work of a sculptor than a marine architect moreover this was his ship he had commanded the doria on her trial runs and in a hundred atlantic crossings he knew her decks better than the rooms of his own home he never tired of strolling from one end to the other like a spectator in a museum breathing in the work of thirtyone of italys finest artists and artisans glorying in the renaissance beauty of the mirrors gilt crystal rare woods fine tapestries and mosaics surrounded by the massive mural that lionized michelangelo and other italian masters he would pause in the firstclass lounge before the massive bronze statue of andrea doria second only to columbus in greatness the old genoese admiral stood ready as always to draw his sword at the first sign of a barbary pirate all this was about to be lost the passengers were the captains first responsibility he was about to give the order to abandon ship when an officer reported on the lifeboat situation the lifeboats on the port side were unlaunchable that left eight boats on the starboard side they were hanging far out over the water even if they could be lunched there was room enough for only half the passengers he didnt dare give the order to abandon ship panicstricken passengers would rush to the port side and thered be chaos he prayed that passing ships had heard their sos and could find them in the fog there was nothing he could do but wait angelo donatelli had just delivered a trayful of martinis to a raucous table of new yorkers celebrating their last night aboard the doria when he glanced toward one of the draped windows that tookup three walls of the elegant belvedere lounge something a flicker of movement had caught his eye the lounge was on the front of the boat deck with its open promenade and in the daytime or on dear nights firstclass passengers normally had a wide view of the sea most passengers had given up trying to see anything through the soft gray wall that enclosed the lounge it was only dumb luck that angelo looked up and saw the lights and rails of a big white ship moving through the fog dios mio he murmured the words had barely left his lips when there was an explosion that sounded like a monster firecracker the lounge was plunged into darkness the deck shifted violently angelo lost his balance fought to regain it and with the circular tray clutched in one hand did a tolerable imitation of the famous greek statue of a discus thrower the handsome sicilian from palermo was a natural athlete whod kept his agility tuned to a fine edge weaving in and out of tables and bang drinks the emergency lights kicked in as he scrambled to his feet the three couples at his table had been thrown from their chairs onto the floor he helped the women up first no one seemed seriously hurt he looked around the beautiful lounge with its softly lit tapestries paintings and wood carvings and its glossy blond paneling was in a turmoil the shiny dance floor where seconds before couples had been gliding to the strains of arrivederci roma was a jumble of squirming bodies the music had stopped abruptly to be replaced by criesof pain and dismay band members extricated themselves from the tangle of instruments there were broken bottles and glasses everywhere and the sir reeked with the smell of alcohol vases of fresh flowers had spilled onto the floor what in gods name was that one of the men said angelo held his tongue not sure even now of what he had seen he looked at the window again and saw only the fog maybe we hit an iceberg the mans wife ventured tentatively an iceberg for chrissakes connie youre talking the coast of massachusetts in july the woman pouted well then maybe it was a mine he looked over at the band and grinned whatever it was it got their to stop playing that goddamn song they all laughed at the joke dancers were brushing their clothes off the musicians inspecting their instruments for damage bartenders and waiters rushed about weve got nothing to worry about another man said one of the officers told me they built this ship to be unsinkable his wife stopped checking her makeup in the mirror of her compact thats what they said about the titanic she said with alarm tense silence then a quick exchange of fearful glances as if theyd heard a silent signal the three couples hastily made for the nearest exit like binds flying off a clothesline angelos first instinct was to dear the table of glasses and wipe it down he laughed softly youve been a waiter too long he said under his breath most of the people in the room were back on their feet and they were using them to move toward the exits the lounge was quickly emptying out if angelo didnt leave hed be all alone he shrugged tossed his dish towel on the floor then headed for the nearest doorway to find out what was going on black waves threatened to drag jake carey under for good he fought against the dark current tugging at his body crawled onto the slippery edge of consciousness and hung on grimly he heard a moan and realized it was coming from his own lips he moaned again this time on purpose good dead men dont moan his next thought was of his wife myra he called out he heard a faint stirring in the gray darkness hope surged in his breast he called his wifes name again over here myras voice was muffled as if coming from a distance thank god are you all right a pause yes what happened i was asleep i dont know can you move no ill come help you carey said he lay on his left side arm pinned under his body a weight pressing on his right side his legs were locked tight icy fear gripped him maybe his back was broken he tried again harder the jagged pain that shot up from his ankle to his thigh brought tears to his eyes but it meant he wasnt paralyzed he stopped struggling hed have to think this thing through carey was an engineer whod made a fortune building bridges this was no different from any other problem that could be solved by applications of logic and persistence and lots of luck he pushed with his right elbow and felt soft fabric he was under the mattress he shoved harder angling his body for leverage the mattress gave then would move no more christ the whole bloody ceiling could be on top of him carey took a deep breath and using every ounce of strength in his muscular arm he pushed again the mattress slid off onto the floor with both arms free he reached down and felt something solid on top of his ankle exploring the surface with his fingers he figured out it was the chest of drawers that had been between the twin beds the mattress must have shielded him from pieces of the wall and ceiling with two hands free he lifted the dresser a few inches and slid his legs out one at a time he rubbed circulation gently back into his ankles they were bruised and painful but not broken he slowly got up on his hands and knees jake myras voice again weaker im coming sweetheart hold on something was wrong myras voice seemed to issue from the other side of the cabin wall he flicked on a light switch the cabin remained in darkness disoriented he crawled through the wreckage his groping fingers found a door he cocked his head listening to what sounded like surf against the shore and gulls screaming in the background he staggered to his feet cleared rubble from around the door and opened it on a nightmare the corridor was crowded with pushing and shoving passengers who were cast in an amber hue by the emergency lighting men women and children some fully dressed some in their nightclothes under their coats some barehanded others lugging bags pushed shoved walked or crawled as they fought their way toward the upper deck the hallway was filled with dust and smoke and tilted like the floor of a fun house a few passengers trying to get to their cabins struggled against the human river like salmon swimming against the current carey glanced back at the door he had just come through and realized from the numbers that hed crawled out of the cabin adjoining his he must have been thrown from one cabin to the other that night in the lounge he and myra had talked to the cabins occupants an older italianamerican couple returning from a family reunion he prayed that they hadnt followed their usual practice of retiring early carey muscled his way through the throng to his cabin door it was locked he went back into the cabin hed just come out of and pushed through the debris toward the wall several times he stopped to move furniture and push pieces of ceiling or wall aside sometimes he crawled over the wreckage sometimes he wriggled under it driven by a new urgency the tilted deck meant the ship was taking on water he got to the wall and called out his wifes name again she replied from fine other side frantic now he groped for any opening in the barrier found the bottom was loose and pulled until he made a hole big enough for him to squeeze through on his belly his cabin was in semidarkness shapes and objects awash in a faint light he stood up and looked toward the source of the illumination a cool salty breeze blew against his sweaty face he couldnt believe his eyes the outside cabin wall was gone in its place was a gigantic hole through which he could see moonlight reflected on the ocean he worked feverishly and minutes later he was at his wifes side he wiped the blood off her forehead and cheeks with a corner of his pajama top and tenderly kissed her i cant move she said almost apologetically whatever it was that had sent him hurling into the next cabin had ripped the steel frame of myras bat from the floor and pushed it against the wall like the spring in a mousetrap myra was in a near upright position luckily cushioned from the pressure of the tangle of bedsprings by the mattress but jammed against the wall by the frame to her back was the steel shaft of a ships elevator her one free arm dangled at her right side carey wrapped his fingers around the edge of the frame he was in his midfifties but still strong from his days as a laborer he pulled with the considerable power of his big body the frame yielded slightly only to spring back in place soon as he let go he tried to pry the frame with a length of wood but stopped when myra called out in pain he tossed the wood aside in disgust darling he said trying to keep his voice calm im going to get help ill have to leave you just a little while ill be back i promise jake you have to save yourself the ship youre not getting rid of me that easily my love dont be stubborn for godsakes he kissed her face again her skin normally so warm to the touch felt clammy think about sunshine in tuscany while youre waiting ill be back soon promise he squeezed her hand and unlocking door from the inside went out into the corridor without the slightest idea what he was going to do a strong looking heavyset man came toward him jake grabbed the mans shoulder and started to ask for help outtamyway with a whiteeyed stare the man shouldered jake aside despite careys size he tried frantically to recruit a couple more men before giving up no samaritans here it was like trying to snag a steer out of a thirstcrazed herd of cattle stampeding for a water hole he couldnt blame them for running for their lives hed be dragging myra for high ground if she were free he decided his fellow passengers would be useless he had to find someone from the crew struggling to keep his footing against the slant of the deck he joined the throng heading for the higher decks angelo had made a quick survey of the ship and didnt like what he saw especially on the starboard side which was dipping ever lower toward the sea carrys soiled pajama top so he wouldnt lose him they dashed down one staircase to the upper deck where most of the firstclass cabins were by then only a few oilcovered stragglers were making their way along the hallways angelo was shocked when he saw mrs carry she looked as if she were in a medieval torture rack her eyes were dosed and for an instant he thought she was dead but at her husbands gentle touch her eyelids fluttered told you id be back darling carry said look angelo here has come to help angelo took her hand and gallantly kissed it she gave him a melting smile both men grabbed the bed frame and pulled grunting more with frustration than exertion ignoring the pain from the sharp metal edge cutting into the flesh of their palms the frame gave a few inches more than it had earlier as soon asthey let go it sprang back into place with each attempt mrs carey clamped her eyes and lips tight carry cursed hed gotten his way so often with simple strength hed become used to winning but not this time we need more men he said panting angelo shrugged with embarrassment most of the crew is already on the lifeboats jeezus carry whispered it had been hard enough finding angelo carey thought for a moment liking at the problem from an engineers point of view we could do it just the two of us he said finally if we had a jack what the waiter looked puzzled a jack carey struggled for the right word gave up and made pumping motions with his hand for an automobile angelos dark eyes brightened with understanding ali he said a lever for an auto thats right carey said with growing excitement look we could put it here and pry the frame away from the wall so well have space to pull myra out si the garage i come back yes thats right the garage carry glanced at his wifes stricken face but you must hurry carry was never a man to take things for granted angelo might bolt for the nearest lifeboat as soon as he left the cabin carey wouldnt blame him he gripped angelos elbow i cant tell you how much i appreciate this angelo when we get back to new york ill make sure youre rewarded hey signor i dont do this for money he grinned blew a kiss at mrs carey and disappeared from the cabin grabbing a life jacket on the way out he ran down the hallway descended a staircase to the foyer deck and got no farther the stockholms bow had penetrated almost to the chapel leaving the foyer a mess of twisted metal and shattered glass he moved away from the main damage area and followed a central corridor that took him toward the stern then went down another set of stairs to a deck again many of the starboard cabins had simply vanished once more he made his way down to the next deck using a circuitous route angelo stopped and crossed himself each time before he descended to another deck the gesture gave him comfort even though he knew it was futile not even god would be crazy enough to follow him down to the bowels of a sinking ship he paused to get his bearings he was on b deck where the garage and many of the smaller cabins were located the fiftycar grande autorimessa was sandwiched between the forward touristclass cabins the airconditioned garage stretched the width of the ship doors on both sides allowed cars to drive directly onto the pier angelo had only been below once before one of the garage men a fellow sicilian wanted to show him the wonder car chrysler was shipping back from italy the streamlined norseman had taken a year to design and ghia of turin had spent another fifteen months handbuilding the hundredthousanddollar machine he could see the breathtakingly beautiful modern lines through openings in the crate that protected it the two men were more interested in a rollsroyce that a rich american from miami beach was shipping home from his paris honeymoon angelo and his friend took turns pretending they were the rollss chauffeur and passenger angelo remembered being told that there were nine cars in the garage maybe one would have a jack he could get at he wasnt hopeful after seeing the extent of the starboard damage the other ship would have ripped right through the garage wall he paused in the gloom to catch his breath and wipe the sweat from his eyes now what flight mamma mia what if the lights go out hed never find his way fear tugged at his legs tried to set them in motion wait the day he visited the garage his friend showed him another vehicle an oversized armored truck in a far corner away from the impact side no markings had been visible on the shiny black metal body when angelo asked about it his friend simply rolled his eyes and shrugged gold maybee he only knew that it was guarded day and night even as they talked angelo had seen a man in a dark gray uniform watching them until they left the cargo space the deck trembled under his feet the ship listed another degree or so angelo went beyond fear and was now in the throes of genuine terror his heartbeat ratcheted up several notches slowed as the ship settled he wondered how close it was to rolling over he looked at the life jacket hed been carrying and laughed the vest would not do much good if the ship capsized and sank with him deep in its belly five minutes thats all hed give it then it was up to the top deck as quick as a rabbit he and carey would work something out they had to he found the entrance to the garage he took a deep breath opened the door and stepped through the cavernous space was black except for yellow puddles from the emergency lights in the high ceilings he glanced toward the starboard side and saw rippling reflections on the floor where the garage was taking on water water surged around his ankles seawater must be pouring in and if the garage t filled yet it would be so in minutes chances were that any cars in the way would have been crushed by the knifing bow he wouldnt have much time he started along a wall toward the far corner he could see the boxy shape in the shadows and the glint of light off its dark windows logic was telling him it would be a dangerous waste of time to go any farther get out of the hold and to the top deck pronto before the garage became a fish tank the image came to him of mrs carey pinned against the wall like a butterfly the truck was her last chance yet no chance at all most likely the jack would be locked inside he had convinced himself he would have to leave emptyhanded and stopped to take one last longing look at the truck thats when he discovered he wasnt alone a pencilthin beam spit the darkness near the truck then another flashlights then portable lamps flared and were placed on the floor so as to illuminate the truck in their light he could see people moving around there appeared to be several men some wore gray uniforms others black business suits they had the side and back door of the truck open he couldnt see what they were doing except that they seemed to be very intent on their work he was about twothirds of the way across the garage and opened his mouth to call out signores the word never left his lips something was moving in the shadows grayclad figures appeared suddenly like actors on a darkened stage vanished into the darkness appeared again four of them all wearing engineroom coveralls moving across the breadth of the hold something about their furtiveness like the stealth of a cat stalking a bird told angelo to remain quiet a guard turned saw the approaching figures shouted a warning and reached for the holstered gun at his hip the men in coveralls dropped to one knee with military precision and raised the objects theyd been carrying to their shoulders that smooth and deliberate motion told angelo hed beenmistaken about the tools you didnt grow up in the home of the mafia not knowing what a machinegun looked like and how it was aimed four muzzle barrels opened fire simultaneously concentrating on the immediate threat the guard who had his gun out and was aiming it the fusillade ripped into him and his gun went flying his body virtually disintegrated in a scarlet cloud of blood flesh and clothing from the impact of hundreds of softnosed bullets the guard gyrated caught in a grotesque slowmotion death dance by the stroboscopic effect of the whitehot muzzle blasts the others tried to scramble for cover only to be brought down by the merciless hail of lead before they could take a step the metal walls echoed and reechoed with the ugly chatter and the mad whine of bullets ricocheting off the armored truck and the wall behind it even after it was quite clear that no one could have survived the men with the guns continued to move forward firing at the supine bodies suddenly all was silent a purple pall of smoke hung in the air which was thick with the smell of cordite and death the killers methodically turned over each body angelo thought he would go mad he stood flat against the bulkhead frozen with fear cursing his luck he must have stumbled onto a robbery he expected the killers to start removing sacks of money from the truck instead they did a peculiar thing they lifted the bleeding bodies out of the rising water dragged them one by one around to the back of the truck then they stuffed them inside slammed the door and bolted it shut angelo felt a coldness at his feet that had nothing to do with fear the water had risen to where he stood he backed away from the truck staying in the shadows as he neared the door hed come through the water rose to his knees before long it was up to his armpits he put on the life jacket hed been clutch ing like a childs security blanket quietly breast stroking he made his way to the door he turned around in the water for one last look one of the killers stared briefly in angelos direction then he and the others cast their weapons aside waded into the water and began to swim angelo slipped out of the garage praying they hadnt seen him the corridor was inundated and he kept swimming until he felt steps under his feet his shoes and clothes were leaden with water with a strength born of unbridled terror he vaulted up the stairs as if the dark thinfaced killer who seemed to sense angelos presence were right on his heels moments later he burst into the careys cabin i couldnt get a lever he sputtered breathlessly the garage he stopped short the bed frame had been pried away from the wall and carey was gently easing his wife out with the help of the ships doctor and another crewman carey saw the waiter angela i was worried about you shes gonna be all right angela said with concern mrs careys eyes were shut heir nightgown was wet with blood the doctor was taking the womans pulse she passed out but shes still alive there may be internal injuries carey noticed the dripping clothes and empty hands these guys found me i got a jack sent over from one of the rescue ships guess you didnt find anything in the garage angelo shook his head my god man youre soaked im sorry you went through all that angelo shook his head it was nothing the doctor jabbed a hypodermic needle into the womans arm morphine for the pain he explained he tried to hide the worry in his eyes weve got to get her off the ship as soon as possible they wrapped the unconscious woman in a blanket and carried her up to the promenade deck on the lower side the fog had miraculously disappeared and a small flotilla surrounded the ship blazing lights reflected in the sea coast guard helicopters hovered above like dragonflies a steady stream of lifeboats plodded back and forth between the stricken liner and rescue ships most of the lifeboat traffic was between the doria and a huge passenger ship with the words ile de france on its bow searchlights from the ile were trained on the doria word to abandon ship had never come down after waiting for two hours passengers simply went over the side on their own women and children and older people were being taken off first progress was slow because the only way they could get off the boat was with ropes and nets mrs carey was strapped onto a stretcher that was carefully lowered with lines down the side of the ship to a waiting lifeboat where friendly hands reached up to receive her carey leaned over the rail watching until his wife was safe then turned to angelo better get your butt off this ship my friend shes gonna go down angelo looked sadly around him pretty soon mr carey i help a few more passengers first smiling he said remember what i say about my name when angelo first met the careys hed joked that his name meant angel someone who serves others i remember carey enveloped the waiters hand in his thanks i can never repay you if you ever need anything i want you to come to me understand angelo nodded grazie i understand please say goodbye to the beta signora carey nodded heaved himself over the side and slid down a rope into the lifeboat angelo waved goodbye he hadnt told carey or anybody about the wild scene in the garage this wasnt the time there might never be a right time nobody would believe a fantastic story told by a lowly waiter he remembered a sicilian saying the bird who sings in the tree ends up in tie cooking pot the death watch was almost over the last survivors had been taken off the ship in the pinkish light of dawn the captain and a standby crew stayed on the ship until the last minute to keep the liner from being claimed as salvage now they too slid down ropes into lifeboats as the warm morning sun climbed into a cloudless sky the ships list became ever sharper by am she lay on her starboard side at a fortyfivedegree angle the bow was partially submerged the stockholm hove to about three miles away her prow a twisted mass of metal debris littered the oily water two destroyer escorts and four coast guard cutters stood by planes and helicopters circled overhead the end came around ten oclock eleven hours after the collision the doria rolled completely onto her right side the empty lifeboats that had defied all the crews efforts to launch them floated away on their free of their davits at last foamy geysers exploded around the perimeter of the ship as air trapped in the hull blew out under pressure through the portholes sunlight glinted on the huge rudder and the wet blades of the twin nineteenfoot propellers that had sent her steaming proudly across the ocean within minutes water engulfed the bow the stern lifted at a steep angle and the ship slid beneath the sea as if shed been sucked under by the powerful tentacles of a gigantic sea monster as she sank more seawater rushed into the hull and filled compartments and staterooms the pressure tearing apart metal and rivets produced that spooky almost human moaning that used to send chills up the spines of submariners who had just sunk a ship the ship plunged toward the bottom in almost the same angle and position at which she sank two hundred twentyfive feet below she came to a jarring stop then settled levelly onto her sandy bier on her starboard side bubbles seething from hundreds of openings transformed the normally dark water around the wreck to a light blue rubbish whirled around a tremendous vortex for at least fifteenteen minutes as the water returned to normal a coast guard boat moved in and dropped a marker buoy where the ship had been gone from the worlds sight was the twomilliondollar cargo of wines fine fabrics furniture and olive oil gone too was the incredible artworkthe murals and tapestries the bronze statue of the old admiral and locked deep in the ships interior was the black armored truck with the bulletriddled bodies and the deadly secret they had died for the tall blond man came down the gangplank of the ile de france onto pier and made his way to the customs shed wearing a black wool sailors cap and a long overcoat he was indistinguishable from the hundreds of passengers who swarmed onto the deck discharging its humanitarian duty had put the french liner thirtysix hours behind schedule it arrived in new york on thursday afternoon to a tumultuous welcome stayed long enough to unload seven hundred thirtythree doria survivors after accomplishing its historic rescue the ship did a quick turnaround steamed back up the hudson river and out to sea time was money after all next the customs officer said as he looked up from his table the officer wondered for a second if the man in front of him had been injured in the collision and decided the scar had healed long ago state departments waiving passports for survivors just sign this blank declaration card all i need is your name and us address the customs inspector said yes thank you they told us on the ship the blond man smiled or maybe it was just the scar im afraid my passport is at the bottom of the atlantic ocean he said his name was johnson and that he was going to milwaukee the officer pointed follow that line mr johnson the public health service has got to check you for communicable diseases shouldnt take long next please the health inspection was brief as promised moments later the blond man was through the gate the crowd of survivors relatives and friends had surged from the steamship dock onto the street there was a traffic jam of slowmoving hornhonking trafficcars buses and taxis he stopped at the curb and scanned the faces around him until a pair of eyes met his then two more and another he nodded to acknowledge that he had seen his comrades before they headed off in different directions he moved away from the crowd toward fortyfourth street and flagged down a taxi he was weary from the nights exertions and looked forward to the chance to rest their work was done for now june the moroccan coast nina kirov stood at the top of the ancient stairway eyes sweeping the nearly stagnant green waters of the lagoon thinking she had never seen a coast more barren than this isolated stretch of moroccan shoreline nothing stirred in the oppressive ovenlike heat the only sign of human settlement was the duster of puttycolored barrelroofed tombs that overlooked the lagoon like seaside condominiums for the departed centuries of sand drifting through the arched portals had mingled with the dust of the dead nina grinned with the delight of a child seeing presents under the christmas tree to a marine archaeologist these bleak surroundings were more beautiful than the white sands and palm trees of a tropical paradise the very awfulness of the mournful place would have protected it from her biggest fear site contamination nina vowed to thank dr knox again for persuading her to join the expedition she had refused the initial invitation telling the caller from the university of pennsylvanias respected anthropology department that it would be a waste of time every inch of moroccan coastline must have been explored with a finetooth comb by now even if someone did discover an underwater site it would have been buried under tons of concrete by the romans who invented waterfront renewal as much as nina admired their engineering skills she considered the romans johnnycomelately spoilers in the grand scheme of history she knew her refusal had more to do with sour grapes than archaeology nina was trying to dig herself out from under a mountain of paperwork generated by a shipwreck project off the coast of cyprus in waters claimed by the turks preliminary surveys suggested the wreck was of ancient greek origin triggering conflicting claims between these old enemies with national honor at stake the fs from ankara and athens were warming up their engines when nina dove on the wreck and identified it as a syrian merchantman this brought the syrians into the mess but it defused the potential for a bloody encounter as the owner president and sole employee of her marine archaeological consultancy firm maritime research all the paperwork ended up in ninas lap a few minutes after she told the university she was too busy to accept the invitation stanton knox called my hearing must be going bad dr kirov he said in the dry nasal tones she had heard a hundred times issuing from behind his lectern i actually thought i heard someone tell me you were not interested in our moroccan expedition and of course that cant be true months had passed since she had talked to her old mentor she smiled picturing the snowy shock of hair the near manic gleam behind the wirerimmed spectacles and the roues mustache that curled up at the ends over a puckish mouth nina tried to blunt the inevitable charm offensive she knew was coming with all due respect professor knox i doubt if theres a stretch of the north african coast that hasnt been overbuilt by the romans or discovered by somebody else brava im glad to see that you recall the first three lessons of archaeology dr kirov nina chuckled at the ease with which knox donned his professorial robe she was in her thirties owner of a successful consulting business and held almost as many degrees as knox did yet she still felt like a student within his aura how could i ever forget skepticism skepticism and more skepticism correct he said with obvious joy the three snarling dogs of skepticism who will rip you to pieces unless you present them with a dinner of hard evidence youd be surprised at how often my preaching falls on deaf ears he sighed theatrically and his tone became more businesslike well i understand your concern dr kirov ordinarily i would agree with you about site contamination but this location is on the atlantic coast well beyond the pillars of melkarth away from roman influence interesting knox used the phoenician name for the western end of the mediterranean where gibraltar bends low to kiss tangier the greeks and romans called it the pillars of herakles nina knew from bitter classroom experience that when it came to names knox was as precise as a brain surgeon well im terribly busy dr kirov i might as well admit it knox interjected i need your help badly im up to my neck in land archaeologists who are so timid they wear galoshes in the bathtub we really need to get somebody into the water its a small expedition about a dozen people and youd be the only diver knoxs reputation as a skilled fly fisherman was not undeserved he dangled the phoenician connection under her nose set the hook with his sympathetic appeal for help then reeled her in with the suggestion that as the only diver she would get sole credit for any underwater finds nina could practically see the professors pink nose twitching with glee she shuffled the folders on her desk ive got a ton of paperwork to finish knox cut her off at the pass im well aware of your cyprus job he said congratulations by the way for averting a crisis between nato partners ive taken care of everything i have two highly competent teaching fellows who would love to gain experience in dealing with the red tape that is such a substantial part of archaeology these days this is a preliminary survey well only be a week or ten days and by then my trusted young myrmidons will have dotted all the is and crossed all the ts you dont have to decide this minute ill fax you some material take a peek at it and get back to me how long do you need dr knox an hour would do cheerio nina put the phone down and laughed out loud an hour almost immediately paper began to spew from the fax machine like lava from an erupting volcano it was the project proposal knox submitted with his funding request he wanted money to survey an area for grecoroman or possibly other ruins the standard knox sales pitch a tantalizing mix of facts and possibilities designed to make his project stand out in bold relief from all the others competing for funds nina breezed through the proposal with a practiced eye and shifted her attention to the map the survey locus was between the mouth of the draa river and the western sahara on the moroccan coastal plain that stretched from tangier to essaouria tapping her teeth with the tip of her ballpoint pen she studied an enlarged section of the area the coastal indentation looked as if the cartographer had hiccupped while drawing the shoreline noting the sites proximity to the canary islands she leaned back in her chair and thought how she needed to get out into the field before she went insane she picked up the telephone and dialed knox answered in midring we leave next week now as nina surveyed the lagoon the lines and squiggles on a map translated themselves into physical features the basin was roughly circular embraced by two pincers of blasted brick red rock beyond the entrance were shallows that at low tide revealed rippling mud flats thousands of years ago the lagoon opened directly onto the ocean its naturally sheltered waters would have attracted ancient mariners who commonly anchored on either side of a headland to wait for good weather or daylight nearby was a dry riverbed what the locals called a wadi another good sign settlements often grew near a river from the lagoon a narrow sandy path led through the dunes and eventually terminated at the ruins of a small greek temple the harbor would have been too tight for roman ships and their massive jetties she guessed the greeks used the inlet as a temporary anchorage the steep shoreline would have discouraged hauling goods inland she had checked the old maps and this site was miles from any known ancient settlement even today the nearest village a sleepy berber encampment was ten miles away over a rutted sand road nina shielded her eyes from the sun and stared over the water at a ship anchored offshore the vessels hull was painted from waterline to superstructure in turquoise green she squinted just making out the letters numa the acronym for the national underwater and marine agency emblazoned on the hull amidships she idly wondered what a vessel belonging to a us government agency was doing off a remote shoreline in morocco then she picked up a large mesh bag and descended a dozen worn stone steps to where the water gently lapped the bottom stair as she removed her upenn baseball cap sunlight glinted off braids the color of ripe wheat woven together behind her head she slipped out of an oversized tshirt the floral bikini she wore underneath revealed a strong longlegged body nearly six feet tall nina inherited her first name her golden hair her slightly roundish face and a peasant stamina that could put male counterparts to shame from her greatgrandmother a sturdy farm worker who found true love in a ukrainian cotton field with a tsarist soldier from ninas georgian mother came the bold almost asian eyes of stormy gray high haughty cheekbones and lush mouth by the time the family emigrated to the united states the genetic airbrush had slimmed the kirov female silhouette narrowing thick waists and wide hips leaving a pleasing width and a healthy bustline from the bag nina took a nikon digital camera in a custombuilt ikelight plastic housing and checked the strobe light next came an air tank and us divers buoyancy compensator a blackandpurple henderson wetsuit booties gloves hood weight belt and mask and snorkel she suited up and on her head attached a niterider cyclops light that would keep her hands free then fastened the quickrelease buckles of her bc and snapped on her weight belt finally she strapped a seveninch divex titanium knife to her thigh after dipping a collection bag to a utility hook she set the time on her latest toy an aqualand dive watch with a depth display with no dive buddy to check her equipment nina went through the routine predive inspection twice satisfied with the results she sat on the stair and worked her feet into her fins then she slipped off the step before the blistering north african sun cooked her inside the wetsuit the tepid water seeped between her skin and the neoprene wetsuit and quickly warmed to body temperature she tested her main and extra regulators then pushed away from the stairs turned and slowly breaststroked into the pondlike lagoon there was virtually no wave motion and the slimy water was slightly brackish but even with the surface scum nina reveled in her freedom she glided along with gentle fin flutters pitying the expeditions land archaeologists as they crawled on sore knees wielding trowels and whisk brooms eyes stinging with sweatcaked dust nina could maneuver in comfortable coolness like a plane making an aerial survey a lowlying island topped by an anorexic scraggle of stunted pines guarded the entrance she planned to swim directly toward the island and bisect the lagoon she would explore each half separately making a series of parallel runs at right angles to the baseline the search pattern was similar to that used to find a wreck in the open ocean her eyes would take the place of a sidescan sonar or magnetometer precision measurements came later she simply wanted to get a feel for what lay underwater once below the clouded surface the water was relatively clear and nina could see to the bottom a depth of no more than twenty feet this meant she could snorkel and conserve air a series of intersecting straight lines materialized and formed into rectangles created by carefully fitted stone blocks the stairway had continued down underwater to an old quay it was a significant discovery because it indicated the lagoon was once a real port and not a temporary anchorage the bottom was likely to be covered with layers of civilization over a long period of time instead of junk tossed over the side by transient sailors soon she picked out thicker lines and piles of rubble building ruins bingo storage sheds housing or headquarters for a dock and harbormaster definitely not an overnight anchorage darkness loomed and she thought she was at the end of the quay she passed over a large square opening and wondered if it could be a fish tank what the ancients called a piscine far too big the size of an olympic swimming pool nina spit out the snorkel bit down on the regulator mouthpiece and dove straight down she moved along one side of the yawning cavity coming to a corner she turned and followed another edge swimming until she had covered the entire perimeter it was around one hundred by one hundred fifty feet nina flicked her headlamp on and dove into the opening the muddy floor was perfectly flat and about eight feet below the quay level the lights narrow beam picked out broken pottery and debris using her knife she pried potsherds from the mud and put them into the collection bag after carefully marking their positions she discovered a channel and followed it seaward until it broke out into the lagoon the opening was easily big enough to allow for the passage of an ancient ship the space cut into the quay had all the characteristics of an artificial harbor known as a cothon she discovered several slipways each big enough to accommodate ships more than fifty feet long and a true piscine which confirmed her theory about the cothon leaving the quay she continued on her baseline course using the land spit to her right as a reference point she swam between the island and the mainland until she found a submerged mole or breakwater a few yards below the surface constructed of parallej stone walls filled with rubble in a drier time it would have connected the mainland and the island coming to the island she shed her dive gear and walked across thorncovered slabs of rock to the other side the island was more than fifty feet wide almost twice as long and mostly flat the trees she had seen from shore barely came up to her chin near the lagoon entrance were piles of stones probably foundations and a circle of blocks it was the perfect spot for a lighthouse or a watchtower offering a sharpeyed sentinel a panoramic view of ship traffic defenders could be summoned from the mainland whenever a sail was sighted stepping inside the circle nina climbed onto a fragmented stair and looked out at the anchored ship she had seen earlier again she wondered what would bring an american government vessel to this arid and lonely coast after a moment she retrieved her scuba equipment the cooling and weightless environment back in the water was refreshing and she decided her fishy ancestors had made a big mistake when they crawled from the sea onto dry land nina swam across the lagoon entrance the other peninsula started low from the land gradually widening as it rose to a knobby crag the sheer reddish rocks dropped straight into the water like the ramparts of a fortress nina dove until she was at the base of the blank wall looking for a footpath finding none she continued underwater to the seaward end of the promontory which terminated in a rocky shelf a perfect defensive position where archers could set up a murderous cross fire to rake the decks of any invader entering the harbor a horizontal slab protruded like a stone age awning from the rock face near the platform beneath the slab was a rectangular opening the size and shape of a doorway drifting closer nina squinted through her face mask lens and tried to pierce the menacing blackness she remembered her headlamp and switched it on the shaft of light fell on a whirl of ghostly movement she drew back in alarm then a laugh bubbled from her regulator the silverscaled school of fish that had made the tunnel its home was more startled than she was as her pulse returned to normal she recalled dr knoxs warning dont risk your neck for a nugget of knowledge that would end up in a dusty tome read by a few with fiendish delight hed relate in grim detail the fates of scientists who went too far furbush was devoured by cannibals rozzini was consumed by malaria oneil dropped into a bottomless crevasse nina was convinced knox made the names up but she took his point she was alone without a lifeline to unreel behind her nobody knew where she was the very element of danger that should have repelled her was seductive in its appeal she checked her pressure gauge by snorkeling shed used her air supply sparingly and still had time left she made a pact with herself to stop just inside the opening and go no farther the tunnel couldnt be very long primitive tools not diamond drills had been used to cut through the rock she shot some pictures of the entrance then moved forward incredible the floor was almost perfectly flat the walls smooth except for shaggy marine growth she went in deeper forgetting her pact and knoxs sage advice as well the tunnel was the most beautiful artifact she had ever seen it was already longer than a similar passageway at the submerged city of apollonia the smooth sides ended abruptly becoming a roughsided cave that narrowed and widened meandering in more or less of a straight line with smaller passages branching off sconces for lamps were set into the carbonblackened walls the tunnel borers had extended the natural cave by making an artificial one nina marveled at the skill and determination of long dead bronze age sandhogs the passageway once again became wider and more polished nina squeezed over the top of a pile of rubble encouraged by a greenish glow in the distance she swam to the light which became brighter the nearer she came in pursuit of knowledge nina had crawled through piles of bat guano and lairs guarded by badtempered scorpions as wondrous as the tunnel was she was anxious to be out of it and drew a sigh of relief when the passage ended she floated up a stairway and through an archway emerging into an open space surrounded by crumbled foundations nina suspected dr knox had an idea of what she might find in the lagoon but he couldnt have known the extent of it nobody could hold on girl order your thoughts assess the details start acting like a scientist not like huckleberry finn she sat underwater on a waisthigh stone block and pondered her findings the port was probably a combined military and trading post that kept out foreign traders and guarded commercial shipping there was a growl in her ear the dogs of skepticism were hungry for their dinner of solid scientific fact before she made her findings definitive every square foot of the port would have to be explored and evaluated she ventured a guess that the port had sunk from a shifting of tectonic plates maybe during the big earthquake of ad quakes were not as common here as in the mediterranean but it could happen growl i know i know no conclusion until all the evidence is in she watched the bubbles from her exhalations rise to the surface thinking there might be a quicker way to get to the truth nina had a talent that went beyond the ordinary and the explainable she had discussed it with only a few dose friends and then in forensic terms comparing herself to an fbi criminal scene profiler who reads a crime scene like an eyewitness nothing psychic about it she had convinced herself only a superb command of her subject combined with a photographic memory and a vivid imagination something like the way dowsers find water veins with a forked twig she discovered her talent accidentally on her first trip to egypt she had pressed her hands against one of the huge foundation blocks on the great pyramid of kufu it was a natural gesture a tactile attempt to comprehend the enormity of the incredible pile of stones but something strange and frightening happened her every sense was assaulted by images the pyramid was only half as high its leveled summit crowded with hundreds of dark men in breechcloths hoisting blocks with a primitive scaffolding the sweat on their skin gleamed in the sun she could hear shouts the squeak of pullies she yanked her hand away as if the rock had turned red hot a voice was saying camel ride missy she blinked her eyes the pyramid soared in a point toward the sky again the dark men were gone in their place was a camel driver grinning broadly he leaned onthe pommel of his saddle camel ride missy i give you good price shukran thank you not today the driver nodded sadly and loped off nina pulled herself together and went back to the hotel where she sketched out the block and pulley arrangement later she showed it to an engineer friend he had stared at her drawing muttering damned ingenious he asked if he could steal the idea to use on a crane project he had been working on since giza there had been similar experiences it wasnt something she could turn on and off at will if she got a long distance call from the past every time she picked up an artifact shed be in an insane asylum she had to be drawn to something like an iron filing to a magnet at a smaller version of the coliseum located at an imperial resort outside rome the images of pain and terror were so strong the bloodsoaked sand severed limbs and cries of the dying so vivid that she retched for a while she thought she had lost her mind she didnt sleep for several nights maybe thats why she didnt like the romans this was no roman amphitheater she rationalized before she talked herself out of it she swam to the edge of the quay placed her palms on the fitted stones and closed her eyes she could picture the longshoremen hauling amphorae filled with wine or oil and the slap of sails against wooden masts but these were only imaginings she breathed a sigh of relief served her right for trying to shortcut the scientific process nina shot a few photographs disappointed only that she hadnt found a shipwreck she collected more pottery found a halfburied stone anchor and was taking a few last shots when she saw the roundish protuberances rising from where the bottom was sandy she swam over and brushed the sand away the lump was part of a larger object intrigued she got down on her knees and cleared more covering from a large stone nose part of a huge carved face about eight feet from its blunt chin to the top of the scalp the nose was flat and wide and the mouth broad with fleshy lips the head was covered by a skullcap or closefitting helmet the expression could best be described as a glower she stopped digging and ran her forgers over the black stone the fleshy lips seemed to curl as if in speech touch me have much to tell you nina drew back and stared at the impassive face the features were as before she listened for the voice touch me fainter now lost in the metallic burble of her breath going through the regulator girl youve been underwater way too long she pressed the valve on her bc air hissed into the inflatable vest heart still pounding she ascended slowly back to her own world the swarthy thickset man saw nina approaching the circle of tents and ran over with his hand extended in his thick spanish accent raul gonzalez said may i help you carry your bag dr kirov im fine nina was used to hauling her gear around and in fact preferred to keep a tight rein on it it would be no trouble he said gallantly displaying his painted on grin to the fullest too weary to argue and not wanting to hurt his feelings nina handed the load over he took the heavy bag as if it were full of feathers you had a productive day he said nina wiped the sweat out of her eyes and downed a swig from a warm bottle of lime gatorade nina was no absentminded professor in a field where a bead or a button can be a major discovery an archaeologist is trained to look for the tiniest of details she couldnt figure gonzalez she had noticed little things about him especially when he thought nobody was looking she had caught him studying her the bigtoothed grin absent the eyes under the fleshy brow as hard as marbles nina was an attractive woman and often drew sidelong glances from men this was more like a lion watching a gazelle finally there was just the way he was always there looking over your shoulder not only her he seemed to be stalking everyone on the expedition ninas elation at her discoveries overcame her normal caution yes thank you she said it was productive very productive i would expect no less of such a knowledgeable scientist im very much looking forward to hearing about it he carried the bag over to her tent and placed it out front then wandered about the encampment as if he were an inspector general making his rounds gonzalez told people he had retired early on the money he made selling southern california real estate and was indulging his lifelong amateur love of archaeology he looked to be in his midforties or early fifties shorter than nina by several inches with a thick powerful blacksmiths body his slicked down hair was as shiny and black as a bowling ball he had joined the expedition through timequest an organization that placed paying volunteers on archaeological digs anybody with a couple of thousand dollars could get a weeks worth of spooning dirt through a sieve with a childs plastic shovel the third degree sunburn was thrown in at no extra cost counting herself and dr knox there were ten people in the party gonzalez of course and mr and mrs bonnell an older american couple from iowa who had come in with another payasyougo organization and to ninas regret there was the insufferable dr fisel from the moroccan department of antiquities who was said to be a cousin of the king completing the party were fisels young assistant kassim a cook and two berber drivers who did double duty working on the dig the expedition had assembled from various parts of the world in tarfaya an oil port on the southern coast the moroccan government arranged for the lease from an oil company of three ninepassenger renault vans to carry people and equipment the vehicles had made their way along dusty but serviceable roads following the coastal plain for a couple of hundred miles even today much of the country was desolate and uninhabited except for small berber settlements here and there the territory had been largely unexplored until mobil and a few other companies started looking for offshore oil deposits the camp was behind the dunes in a parched field dotted with prickly pear at the edge of a featureless plain that rolled off to a distant high plateau a few pitiful olive trees sucked enough moisture from the dry soil to maintain their wretched existence what shade they cast was mostly psychological the site was dose to piles of masonry and fallen columns where the land excavations were being conducted nina made her way to one of the colorful nylon domes pitched in a circle on a flat sandy area she washed the salt out of her face and changed into dean shorts and tshirt taking her sketch pad to a folding chair she sat outside the tent and in the afternoon light made drawings of her findings she had covered several pages when people began straggling in from the dig dr knoxs khaki shorts and shirt were sweatstained and caked with dust and his knees were scraped raw from crawling on hard ground his nose was shrimp pink and starting to peel the transformation from the halls of academia was amazing in the classroom knox was impeccable in his dress but in the field he literally threw himself into an excavation like a child in a sandbox with his pith helmet his baggy shorts and epaulets on his thin shoulders he looked as if he had stepped out of an old national geographic magazine what a day he fumed slipping his helmet off i truly believe well have to burrow down another twenty feet before we find anything dating back any earlier than the rif rebellion and if you think working with me is a bloody trial i dare you to go a few rounds with that pompous ass fisel the glee in his voice at being on a dig belied the grumbling well you certainly look comfortable he said accusingly how did it never mind i can see it in your eyes tell me quickly nina or ill assign you extra homework knoxs use of her first name recalled her days as a student nina saw her chance to avenge the gentle taunts she had endured in the classroom wouldnt you like to freshen up first she said no i would not for heavens sakes dont be a sadist young lady it doesnt become you i learned my craft from a good teacher she said with a smile dont despair professor while you drag your chair over ill pour us some iced tea and tell you the whole story minutes later knox sat attentively by her side head inclined slightly as he listened she described her explorations from the moment she stepped into the water omitting only the discovery of the sculpted head she felt inexplicably uneasy discussing it later maybe knox was silent during the entire account except when nina paused for breath when hed impatiently urge i knew it i knew it yes yes go on thats the story she said finishing her tale well done conclusion i think this was a very old port she said of course its old he replied with mock annoyance i knew that when i saw the aerial photos of your little pond from an oil company survey every bloody thing within a hundred meters of where were sitting is old but how old remember the hungry dogs of skepticism she reminded him knox rubbed his hands together enjoying the game lets assume the dogcatcher has captured the annoying creatures and for the time being they languish happily in a pound what dear lady is your educated guess as long as you put it that way my guess is that its a phoenician military and trading post she handed over her sketch pad and pieces of the pottery shed found knox studied the potsherds lovingly running his fingers along the ragged edges he put them aside and looked at the sketches puckering his mouth so that the mustache did a little dance on his lip i think he said with obvious and melodramatic relish that we should run your story by the esteemed dr fisel gamiel fisel sat under a large umbrella his round body practically hid the chair it was perched on and with his tan slacks shirt and matching complexion he resembled a large caramel apple on the table in front of him was a scattering of potsherds from the dig he was peering through a sherlock holmes magnifying glass at one fragment at his side was his assistant kassim a pleasant young man supposedly a university student who served primarily as fisels tea boy good afternoon dr fisel dr kirov made some interesting observations today knox said with undisguised pride fisel looked up as if an annoying mosquito had just landed on the tip of his nose he was not unused to women in the workplace many moroccan women worked as professionals he simply had trouble dealing with a female who was his equal in academic rank his superior in the number of degrees held and at least a foot taller as a nondiver fisel was at ninas mercy on the underwater site and he didnt like not being totally in control nina cut right to the chase i think there was a small but important port here and that it was phoenician fisel said more tea kassim the young man hurried over to the camps cooking area fisel turned to knox as if nina were not there your assistant has a vivid imagination youve told her of course that our excavations at the primary site have produced greek and roman artifacts he had a quick nervous way of speaking firing off sentences like bursts from a machine gun nina had deferred to fisel but she could ignore his rudeness no longer first of all im not dr knoxs assistant she said coolly im his colleague and second while i have no doubt of grecoroman influence the main center of activity was in the water not on dry land and it was phoenician the sketch pad plopped onto the table and nina tapped the drawing of the cothon the phoenicians were the only ones who cut artificial harbors like this out of dry land i believe these shards will provide the dating to back me up she dumped out her pottery fragments not caring that they might be mixed with the others taking his time fisel picked up a piece examined it then studied another one after a few minutes he looked up his moist brown eyes boggled behind the thicklensed glasses but he was trying hard not to show his excitement he cleared his throat and addressed knox surely youre not going to accept this as definitive proof of dr kirovs theory of course not dr fisel theres much work to be done and dr kirov knows that as well as we do you must admit its an intriguing beginning however assuming he had detected a crack in knoxs advocacy fisels putative scowl turned into a fourteenkarat smile i am compelled to admit nothing until the case is made kassim arrived with a glass of hot tea fisel nodded and picked up his magnifies the audience with the cousin of the king had ended nina seethed with anger as she and knox walked away from fisels tent imperious little bastard he knows damned well that im right knox gave an avuncular chuckle my guess is that fisel agrees entirely with your findings and will waste no time reporting them she grabbed the professors arm and peered into his dusty face i dont understand why the act oh its perfectly dear he wants to claim the credit for discovering your phoenician port thats it she started back toward fisels tent if he thinks hes going to get away hold on my dear i promised youd get credit for all underwater finds and i meant it remember we hold the important cards youre the only one on this expedition who knows how to dive he can bring in other divers yes he can short plump bald and nearsighted though he may be fisel swings a lot of weight figuratively and literally within his antiquities department he can bring in all the resources he will need in the meantime i want you to finish your sketches classify what youve found and continue your survey using scientific methods she was still unconvinced what if he tries to stop me from diving this is a joint expedition i am equal in command to him he can only go so far until he gets permission it will take days if you think our red tape is formidable remember morocco is heavily influenced by the french who invented the word bureaucrat i will massage his ego but i want you to do a very difficult thing consider giving fisel some credit for this coup if it truly turns out to be phoenician this is his country that were digging up after all he may have some phoenician forebears nina calmed down and allowed herself a laugh youre right im sorry for the outburst its been a long day no need for an apology he is a bastard but ill remind him that if he doesnt have our cooperation in making this a joint find he will have the credit taken from him by one of his own bastards at a higher level nina thanked the professor kissed him on the cheek and returned to her tent she worked on her sketches until the dinner bell rang fisel avoided her eyes at the table the iowa couple who had dug up an intact water jug handle held center stage no one paid attention when nina excused herself and went back to her tent after she finished writing a report of her findings on an ibm laptop computer nina propped up her noted and shot some pictures of the sketches with her digital camera then she fed images from the camera into the computer the photos and sketches were razor sharp okay fisel let me see you try to get a jump on this the computer was hooked up to a small suitcase that contained a satellite phone the solarpowered package cost her an arm and a leg but it put her in touch with her home base from anywhere in the world she punched out a number and sent the electronic packet of words and photos winging through the ether until it bounced off a loworbit inmarsat global communications satellite which inlayed it to a dish that fed the information at the speed of light into the database at the university of pennsylvania nina clicked off her computer satisfied that her reports and pictures were safely in the databank at the university she was unaware that even on the information highway there are such things as dangerous detours san antonio texas on official blueprints the windowless room near the top of the glass office tower overlooking the peaceful waters of the san antonio river did not exist even the city inspectors had no idea it was there the subcontractors who installed the soundproof walls the separate electrical conduits and the voiceactivated security locks were paid well to keep their mouths zipped if they thought it strange to build a secret door through the shower stall of a private bathroom they kept their opinions to themselves the rooms decor was as clinically functional as a laboratory uncluttered beige walls a bank of oversized ibm computer monitors and hard drives a document safe and a center worktable a man sat in front of a computer his hardened face washed by the cold light from the oversized monitor he scrolled down several pages of type and photos and stopped at a series of line drawings with a click of the cursor he enlarged one particular sketch and zoomed in on a section of the screen hard blue eyes taking in every detail satisfied he had seen the entire file he saved it on a floppy disk and pressed the print command as the highspeed printer whirred away he put the disk in an envelope and locked it in the safe he gathered the printed file into a manila folder stepped through the shower stall went through another door into his office and switched on an intercom ill need a few minutes right away he said he has time now a female voice replied ten minutes in between appointments he left his office with the folder and walked through a maze of thickly carpeted hallways he was tall at least six feet no longer young but the only concession to age was his closecropped silver hair and a slight stoop to his muscular shoulders his athletic body was still limber and rock hard thanks to a spartan regimen of diet and exercise because he rarely smiled or frowned his face was relatively unlined around the mouth and eyes as if the skin had been lifted off and stretched over the square jaw and high cheekbones the floor held the companys administrative offices arid could be entered only by those with hand and voice id the work spaces were all on other levels and he saw nobody until he came to the spacious reception area the highceiling space was done in burnt red brown and green earth colors repeating a stylized arrow and square indian pattern on floor and walls behind the receptionist was a semiabstract mural whose brownskinned figures and giant sprouting quetzal feathers were so intertwined it was hard to tell whether the painting depicted a human sacrifice or a cocktail party the receptionist sat at a desk that seemed to float on a carpeted sea of burnt orange unmindful of the painted drama behind her head the man stopped in front of the desk and without speaking glanced toward a thick darkwood door carved with dozens of writhing figures being tormented in a peasant artists depiction of hell mr halcon will see you said the receptionist a middleaged woman chosen for her blandness efficiency and unquestioning loyalty the carved door opened into a corner office that was almost as big as the reception area and repeated the central american theme halcon stood at a floortoceiling window his back to the door sir if you have a moment halcon halfturned displaying the aquiline nose set in a pale narrow face the profile that had earned him his nickname in the bullring come here guzman he said guzman crossed the room as ordered and stood beside the younger man halcon was in his forties taller than guzman by an inch or two he was ascetically lean almost delicatelooking like everything else about halcon appearances were deceiving in a concession to his role as a businessman he had long ago cut off the matadors pigtail trimmed the valentino sideburns and set aside the glittering uniform of the bullring yet under his expensive tailored suit still lurked the cruel body of the matador known as the hawk who had used his quickness and power to dispatch dozens of brave bulls if there had been any complaint from the aficionados who followed his brief but illustrious career it was that the hawks kills were coldly efficient and lacked passion in another age he would have been a deadly swordsman whose blade would have found the beating hearts of men not bulls do you know why i chose to build this particular office in this particular location guzman if i would venture a guess don halcon it offers a good view of many of your companys holdings halcon chuckled at the response an honestly blunt answer as i would expect from my old guardian but hardly a flattering one i am not some burgher keeping an eye on his fields my apologies don halcon i did not mean to offend no offense taken it was a natural assumption but an erroneous one his smile vanished and his words took on the quiet steely edge dangerous people give their voices i chose this office for one reason the view it offers of the mission san antonio de valero it reminds me of what is past what is present and what will be he gestured out at the sprawl of the city visible through the tinted floortoceiling windows i often stand here and think of how history can veer off in unexpected directions drastically changed by the actions of the few the alamo was a defeat for its defenders but it was the beginning of the end for santa anna he was captured at san jacinto and in one decisive engagement texas became independent from mexico the lesson of history is clear is it not it wouldnt be the first time the death of martyrs brought down the powerful precisely nor will it be the last what happened once can happen again the alamo had one hundred eighty three defenders against six thousand mexican troops showing that the determined few can transform the world for the many he paused alone with his thoughts staring out at the sprawling city after a moment he turned to guzman like a man emerging from a dream why did you want to see me theres a matter of some importance sir i just intercepted this transmission from morocco to the university of pennsylvania he handed the file over halcon leafed through the material finally fastening on the sketch and murmured astounding he looked up there can be no mistake our surveillance system is practically foolproof as you know every archaeological expedition in the world sends proposals to our timequest foundation asking for funds and volunteers those with serious potential are assigned priority the computers automatically access all transmissions from the field to their home base and search for preprogrammed keywords or fax telex and email messages los hermanos has a watcher on site yes gonzalez is there excellent halcon said he knows what he has to do guzman nodded and clicked his heels softly as he turned to go his lips seemed to curl in a lopsided smile but it was only a trick of the light and shadow caused by the white scar that ran from his right cheekbone to the corner of his mouth morrocco nina brought the camera up to her face mask framed the foundation wall in the viewfinder and squeezed the shutter release on the waterproof housing the motor drive whirred softly the last shot she needed for the photomosaic finally with a quick sharp expulsion of air she cleared the water from her snorkel using an easy sidestroke she swam toward the stairs mapping the bottom singlehanded had been tedious she first laid out a number of small spherical plastic buoys in a tictaetoe pattern as a guide then it was swim stop shoot again and again she carried a mental blueprint of the port in her head had the water miraculously receded she could have strolled blindfolded on the old quay and not bumped into a wall or fallen into a piscina or cothon the task of assembling dozens of photos into a composite map would be formidable she had tried to match the photos using the buoys coupled with distinctive bottom landmarks a crude system at best but fine for now nina wasnt looking for scientific precision she wanted a dramatic package that would have the tightfisted bean counters who controlled expeditionary money dreaming of frontpage headlines in usa today and feature stories in time and on unsolved mysteries she hoisted herself onto the steps and got out of her dive gear as she toweled her body dry she looked out over the lagoon and decided to put off the buoy removal until the morning shed be as wrinkled as a white raisin if she spent any more time in the water minutes later she was loping along the path to the camp with a discernible jauntiness in her stride there was good reason to be pleased she had accomplished an incredible amount of work in a short time people were still working on the excavation and the camp was deserted well almost as she neared the tents she saw gonzalez at the periphery of the campsite talking to someone in a jeep as she approached the jeep drove off before she got a look at the drivers face who was that she said watching the dust cloud thrown out by the departing vehicle the automatic gonzalez smile clicked on as if somebody had pressed a switch someone who was lost i gave him directions lost what was gonzalez talking about this wasnt like taking a wrong turn off a freeway the camp was miles from anywhere or anything it was lonely country with nothing to attract anyone except a bunch of crazy bonediggers youd have to want to get lost out here when she first saw the man in the jeep she thought he might have been called in by fisel so while she didnt buy the explanation she was relieved to hear it at breakfast dr fisel had announced the expected arrival of moroccan divers within a few days he strongly advised nina to curtail her explorations so as not to disturb the site nina leaned over the table and stuck her chin right in his fare a camera was hardly intrusive she said quietly but with such cold fury in her gray eyes that dr knox complained after breakfast that icicles had formed on his mustache fisel prissily reminded everyone of his responsibility to his cousin the king then retreated into an unconvincing apology about only wanting to preserve the integrity of the site nina had to admit she was being somewhat devious herself she was removing artifacts from the site a big nono and had told neither fisel nor nox nor was fisel aware that her preliminary findings were sent winging off to upenns cybervault the stone head still remained her secret as well she rationalized her uncharacteristic behavior drastic times call for drastic measures kassim feels tea boy gave her a friendly wave dumb as a fencepost but not a bad kid when you got to know him savoring the tranquility nina went into her tent slipped out of her bathing suit and into dry clothes she switched on her computer and saw the email icon blinking the message was from dr elinor sanford the faculty member at upenn to whom she had directed her computer transmission sandy sanford and nina had been undergraduate classmates before branching into their own specialties sandy went into mesoamerican studies explaining that her preferences had more to do with cuisine than with cultures she preferred burritos to couscous her culinary tastes might be open to question but her scholarship was not she had just been appointed a faculty curator at the universitys museum nina scrolled down her message congratulations nina you dont have to bring me hannibals head to convince me youve hit a phoenician port wish i could show tire fabulous stuff you transmitted to the jurassic set here in the hidebound halls of archaeological academia could start another punic war but ill abide by you wishes to keep things quiet what does el grando professoro think cant watt to see you stay dry love say there was more rs re sketch of the big stone head some kind of joke right i get it youre just testing me check your fax line nina called up her fax function a photo of a stone face appeared on the screen at first she thought it was the carving in the lagoon but next to it for comparison was the sketch she had sent she stared at the screen the sculptures were identical she scrolled some more other stone heads came into view they all could have been carved by the same sculptor except for slight details primarily in their headgear they shared the same brooding stare broad nose and impassive fleshy lips below the pictures was another note from sandy hello again welcome to are of the most enduring of all mesoarnerican mysteries in the national geographic society and the smithsonian sent an expedition to mexico to investigate reports of giant basalt heads buried up to their eyebrows they found eleven africantype rock figures like this at three sites in and around la venta sacred center of olmec culture eighteen miles from the gulf of mexico six to nine feet high up to forty tons each not bad considering the quarry site was ten miles away and they were carried overland without the use of the wheel or draft animals all had that funny helmet that makes them look like they belong in the nfl dating figures at to bc say whats a nice girl like you doing messing around in meso nina typed out a quick reply thanks for info most interesting due home next week will fill you in love nina she hit the send key turned the laptop off and sat back in her chair stunned a mexican olmec head calm down lady go over the facts the figure she found had african characteristics big deal this is africa after all of course that didnt explain the match with the mexican figures thousands of miles away a couple of possibilities could explain the similarities the la venta figures might have been carved in africa and transported to mexico unlikely not at forty tons apiece the alternative theory wasnt much better that a la venta figure was carved in mexico and transported to africa with either scenario there was still the problem with the dating the heads were carved hundreds of years before columbus sailed the ocean blue ouch nina thought im thinking like a diffusionist she looked over her shoulder as if someone were eavesdropping on her thoughts admitting to an open mind on diffusionism was a oneway ticket to oblivion for a mainstream archaeologist diffusionists believe cultures didnt evolve in isolation that they diffused from one place to another the similarities between the old and new worlds had always intrigued nina the ufo and atlantis enthusiasts muddied up the waters suggesting that the pyramids and nazca lines were the products of aliens from outer space or beings from lost continents a female diffusionist was a double loser in this business she had enough problems just being a woman in a mans world the diffusionist theory had always faced a major hurdle the absence of scientifically verified evidence that would prove contact between one hemisphere and another before columbus people could yack all they wanted about how egyptian pyramids and cambodian temples and mexican mounds resembled one another but nobody had discovered the artifact to connect them until now and in a phoenician port oh christ this was going to stir up one hell of a mess it could be the biggest discovery since king tuts tomb the archaeological establishment would be turned topsyturvy the thing in the lagoon proved a link existed between the old world and the new two thousand years before christopher columbus conned the spanish royals out of three ships enough nina jammed on her mental brakes before she went over the precipice she needed to think this through with a clear head she swatted a couple of flies and lay down on the cot she tried to put all thoughts out of her mind and concentrate on her breathing the next thing she knew she was being awakened by the dinner bell yawning and rubbing her eyes she stumbled outside a magnificent purple and gold sunset was in the making she walked to the mess tent and sat at the opposite end of the table from fisel who was holding court the same old blahblah she tuned him out and enjoyed a chat with the iowa couple excusing her self before dessert she went back to her tent and plunked down in front of her laptop working late into the night nina typed up a summary to go with her mosaic photos by the time she quit the camp had settled down for the evening she put on a flannel nightie congratulating herself for her prescience in packing it days were hot and dry but at night a cool breeze came in off the ocean she slipped under her blanket and lay there listening to the laughter and arabic conversation as the mess crew cleaned up after dinner before long the voices were silent and the camp was asleep except for nina she lay on the cot wishing she hadnt taken a nap sandys fax had wound her up as well she tossed and turned finally falling into a light slumber only to be awakened by the sharp crackling of the fire her eyes blinked open and she stared into space sleep wasnt meant to be wide awake once more nina wrapped the blanket around her shoulders like a navajo pulled on her teva sandals and slipped outside a branch of burning olive tree exploded in little red spark showers on the smoky fire the only other illumination was from propanepowered lanterns hung outside the tents in case somebody felt the call of nature during the night nina looked up at the black sky the crystal air was so dear that it seemed she could see distant nebulae with her naked eye impulsively nina grabbed a flashlight from her knapsack and set off toward the lagoon the tombs gleamed like pewter in the light of the half moon coming to the staircase she sat down on the top step and gazed out at the moonglade reflection on the lagoon yellow pinpoints glowed on the ocean the numa ship with the turquoise hull must still be offshore she took a deep breath the night smelled of stagnant water rotting vegetation marsh and incredible age she closed her eyes and listened in her imagination clicking reeds became the slap of hide sails against wooden masts and frog snorts the grunts of breechclothclad sailors hoisting amphorae filled with wine and oil before long slivers of cold air penetrated the blanket she shivered realizing she had lost track of time with a parting glance at the still lagoon she started back as she crested the ridge of dunes a strange noise came from the camp it sounded like a bird or animal crying out under the attack of a hunting predator she heard it again this was no bird or animal it was human someone in terrible fear or pain she picked up her pace to a trot emerging from the dunes where she could see the camp it was like a scene out of dante where faceless demons herd new arrivals to their hellish punishment expedition members in their night clothes were being prodded and pushed by guncarrying figures dressed in black the iowa couple came into view the woman stumbled and fell an intruder grabbed her long white hair and she was dragged along the ground screaming in terror her husband tried to intervene only to be dubbed to the ground where he lay bloodied and unmoving still in his flannel pajamas professor knox burst from his tent and looked around nina was dose enough to see the expression on his face he appeared more bewildered than frightened dr fisels unmistakably rotund form appeared and someone pushed him into knox fisel shouted defiantly although nina couldnt hear what he said against the growing background of cries and yells most of the expedition people were outside now crowded into a terrified group nina caught a glimpse of the drivers and cook gonzalez must have been with the others but she couldnt see him the assailants stopped their brutal attack and moved back from the huddled assembly knox had regained his dignity and stood with head high he seemed frozen in stone his face looked a thousand years old fisel saw what was coming he shouted in arabic but his words were lost in the ugly chatter of gunfire the hail of bullers mowed fisel and the others down like a scythe blade through grass incredibly despite the intensity of the killing fire pitiful moans came from the pile of bodies any hope nina had of survivors vanished when two intruders stepped over the carnage seven shots rang out a few seconds apart the groaning stopped the only sound was the faint crackle of the wood fire nina could hardly breathe her mouth felt as if it were full of sawdust her heart hammered madly her dinner rose in her throat and she gagged as she fought her urge to vomit she wanted to run it was only a matter of time before the killers saw her standing at the edge of the clearing yet she was rooted to the spot too scared to save her own life a figure broke from the shadows behind a tent and ran in her direction kassim he must have been outside when the killers struck the killers saw him trying to escape and lifted their weapons they held their fire when one of their number dashed in pursuit of the tea boy mad with fear kassim ran directly toward nina without seeing her he would have bowled her over if he hadnt tripped on a root and fallen he tried to scramble to his feet but his assailant was on him quicker than a falcon on a rabbit he reached under kassims chin and jerked the boys head back light glinted on cold steel like someone cutting a pineapple he drew the knife across the boys throat in a swift slashing motion kassims scream died in a wet gargle as his lungs filled and he drowned in his own blood his murderous deed accomplished the killer stood and saw nina he was dressed entirely in black a turban was wrapped around his head covering everything except eyes that burned with a murderous hate they widened as they saw nina then narrowed just before he lunged the bloodied knife held high above his head nina yanked the heavy blanket from her shoulders and wielding it in two hands like a great woolen club she whipped it across the attackers face he hesitated and put his left arm up to ward off the blow not expecting resistance from this helpless victim nina brought the blanket down like a hood over the killers head and while he was temporary blinded drove her knee into his crotch aaaaiiee the scream told her she was on target she did it again with every intention of driving her knee to his chin she must have nearly succeeded because he crashed to the ground and writhed in pain the other blackclad figure saw their comrade fall and started toward nina but the delay gave her an advantage she bolted like a startled deer and long legs racing feet pounding the ground outdistanced her pursuers she could hear shouts behind her la mujer la mujer a sandal flew off and she kicked the other away barefoot now she was through the dune ridge descending the gradual slope to the water the rise would hide her for a moment as she sprinted toward the lagoon her bare foot came down on a piece of wood or sharp stone a dagger of pain stabbed the tender flesh she went down on one knee for a second bit her lip until it bled stifling the urge to yelp then was up in a limping run as she ran past the darkened tombs she thought of hiding inside but quickly discarded the idea as too obvious shed be trapped if the killers found her she decided instead to run along the shore and backtrack on her pursuers that plan was shredded by the flashlight beams that lanced the darkness behind her her pursuers had anticipated her move taking their time they spread out along the dune ridge to cut off her flanks and catch her in a classic pincers movement she ran straight to the lagoon seconds later she was standing at the top of the stairway the killers were closing in on all sides it was only a matter of seconds before they caught up with her ninas brain worked feverishly she could dive off the steps and swim underwater but it would only delay the inevitable when she came up for air the killers would spray the lagoon until their bullets found her she had to stay submerged until she was safely out of range impossible no way fool of course theres a way she set off along the rocky shore her darting eyes probed the water searching in the moonlight she saw the faint gray splotch of a marker buoy lights seemed to be coming from every direction soon shed be caught in the closing net not this fish she vowed gathering her strong legs beneath her like springs nina leaped off the rocks her arms reaching straight out she hit the water in a distance covering shallow racing dive and swam for the marker buoy with quick hard strokes the buoy flared into orange brilliance as a light from shore found its reflective surface the water all around her was covered with shimmering blobs a few strokes and she was at the buoy a fusillade opened up and the lagoons surface erupted in miniature geysers off to her right side no time to build up her air supply she filled her lungs in a frantic gulp and her supple body jackknifed in a quick surface dive directly under the marker faintly illuminated by the glow of lights from above was the stone arch she wriggled under the arch reached out until she felt a hard vertical edge and pulled herself into the the lightless bowels of tire tunnel as she swam her fingers brushed the smooth wall like a crude tactile sonar making it to the end of the tunnel was a long shot without air and fins but even if this damned hole became her tomb at least shed have the satisfaction of knowing her pursuers would never learn her fate she slowed slightly trying to keep a steady even pace panic would steal oxygen and energy she swam deeper the wall became rough to the touch she was in the cave the going would be trickier here she slowed even more to navigate the twists and turns went down a blind alley and had to back out it felt like hours since she had taken a breath her lungs pressed against her ribs as if her chest were going to explode how long could she hold her breath a minute two maybe if shed had a chance to hyperventilate and build up capacity god how much farther her head slammed into a hard surface she was sure she felt the plates in her skull shift she cried out instinctively and lost more air damn shed forgotten about the pile of rubble she groped over the top of the debris and squeezed her way through the opening she was past the halfway mark the wall became smooth again good she was back in the manmade tunnel only a few dozen meters her lungs were on fire she let out a small breath as if that would relieve the pressure and started making sounds like a pigeon god she didnt want to drown not here she kicked desperately with no attempt to conserve energy the lack of oxygen made her dizzy next shed start to black out and swallow water a painful excruciating death nina stubbornly resisted taking that first fatal breath she groped for the wall nothing then felt for the ceiling again nothing wait she was out of the tunnel she arched her body upward kicked frantically and broke the surface where she sucked in great gulps of air in time her breathing became almost normal again she treaded water looking toward shore where lights moved like fireflies then she struck off around the tip of the promontory and swam parallel to the beach when she could swim no more she angled in toward land weeds brushed her feet and her toes felt the cool mucky bottom she crawled onto the sand but rested only a few minutes before she got to her feet and walked along the beach she came to the old riverbed followed the wadi inland a few hundred meters then climbed the banking and walked across the dunes until she could go no farther she crawled into a thicket of high grass and lay down the horror of the massacre began to play back in her mind dr knox fisel kassim all dead why who were those men why were they after her bandits who thought the expedition had discovered treasure no the concentrated fury of the attack was too organized for bandits it was meant to be a massacre shivering with the cold nina removed her flannel nightie wrungthe water from it and put it back on over her camisole top and underwear the wet fabric raised goosebumps the size of eggs she broke off clumps of grass and stuffed them under the nightie until she looked like a scarecrow the primitive insulation was scratchy but it helped keep the cold air out the shivering subsided somewhat and before long she fell asleep near dawn she was awakened by a murmur of voices coming from the direction of the riverbed maybe help had arrived and they were searching for her she held her breath and listened spanish without a seconds delay she slithered into the tall beach grass like a frightened salamander the sharp brittle grass stems were like a fakirs bed of nails that ripped at ninas nightgown and tore the skin on her bare arms and legs disregarding the pain she dug her knees and elbows into the sand and kept moving she had no other choice if she stood up to run shed be dead the killers had found her too quickly almost as if they had followed a map to her hiding place she cursed in the native tongue of her grandmother they did have a map the harborworks diagram she had painstakingly drawn lay in plain sight on her work table the tunnel had been rendered as two bold lines and dearly labeled once the killers discovered her underwater escape route they had only to search the beach for footprints and follow them into the wadi the voices rose in pitch and volume became more excited coming from where she had climbed out of the riverbed the killers must have found where shed disturbed the banking nina made a sharp turn and crawled parallel to her original route doubling back until she came to the riverbed she peered from between blades of grass no one was in the wadi she slid down the banking and raced with head low toward the beach the riverbed was churned up by footprints which indicated that a sizable party was tracking her down soon she glimpsed the bluegreen of the sea the turquoise ship was still anchored offshore she paused where the waterway once emptied into the ocean the empty beach beckoned like a highway in both directions voices and the crunch of footsteps came from behind again the killers had spread out like hunters trying to flush a quail shed be seen whether she went to the right or the left as on the previous night the watery route remained her only choice nina peeled off her ripped and sandcaked nightgown tossed it aside and sprinted in camisole and underwear across the hardpacked gravelly delta washed out by centuries of river flow she hoped the dune ridge would screen her until she reached the waters edge still no outcry as she splashed into the shallows she was aware how vulnerable she was completely out in the open with no darkness or tunnel to hide her any second the killers would crest the dunes and shed be an easy target for their bullets the kneedeep water covering the salt flats seemed to go on forever slowing her progress but offering no protection she pressed on leaping with long strides and eventually the water got to waist level she dove under just as angry lead bees filled the air the water behind her erupted in a patch of angry foam nina dove under and swam off at an angle for as long as she could surfaced for air and dove again porpoisestyle once beyond the brownish water over the flats and into the deeper blue ocean she glanced back and saw maybe a dozen figures on shore some had waded into the shallows the gunfire seemed to have stopped pivoting nina fixed her eye on the ship concerned that it would weigh anchor and leave her between the devil and the deep blue sea a swim to the canary islands wasnt in her plans rolling onto her back she looked up at the puffy giltedged clouds and caught her breath at least it was a good day for a swim she rested only a minute she had to get the blood moving in her body again pace yourself rest when necessary and count your blessings calm sea and no wind or currents no different from the swim phase of a triathlon except for one thing if she lost this race she would die taking a bead on the ships main mast she threw one arm in front of the other without her wristwatch there was no telling how long she swam the water grew colder the deeper it got and she counted strokes to take her mind off the energysapping chill waving at the ship would be a waste of time her arm would look like tire neck of a floating seabird she tried singing sea chanteys the old shipboard work songs helped keep the rhythm of strokes her repertoire was slim and after shed sung blow the man down for the fiftieth time she simply chopped away at the sea she drew closer to the ship but her strokes were becoming sloppy and she stopped to rest more often at one point she spun around and was pleased to see she was leaving the low brown shore far behind her to give herself courage she imagined climbing aboard the ship and washing away the salty dryness of her mouth with a steaming mug of hot coffee the deep thrumming sound was so faint she didnt notice it at first even when she stopped to listen nina thought it might be water pressure in her head or maybe even the noise of a ship generator she rolled one ear in the water and listened the droning was louder nina slowly wheeled around a dark object was racing in her direction from shore she thought it was a boat at first but as it grew quickly in size nina made out a squat ugly black hull she recognized as that of a large hovercraft an amphibious vehicle that moves across land and sea on a cushion of air it moved back and forth in a series of sharpangled turns but nina sensed this was no rescue boat executing a search pattern its course was too determined too aggressive all at once it stopped zigzagging and came straight at her like a bullet she must have been spotted rapidly it closed the distance and was practically on top of her when she dove as deep as she could go the hovercraft skimmed overhead on its teninch cushion churning the water into a wild frenzy when she could stay under no longer nina surfaced and sucked in air only to cough as the purple exhaust fumes filled her lungs the hovercraft spun around and made another pass again she dove again she was tossed and buffeted only to fight her way back to the surface where she bobbed in the wake the hovercraft stopped settling down into the water with its engines purring facing nina like a big cat toying with a mouse a weary and waterlogged mouse then the engines came to life the hovercraft rose up on invisible legs and charged again nina dove and was tumbled like a rock in a polishing machine her brain was numb blood thundered in her ears she was reacting on pure instinct the game would end soon the damned thing could turn on a dime each time she surfaced she had less time to take in air and the craft was closer than before the blunt hull was coming at her again although she could hardly see it with the exhaust cloud and her eyes bleary and stinging from salt water she was too exhausted to dive and wouldnt have the strength to fight her way up from the sea again she made a pitiful attempt to swim out of the way but after a few strokes she turned to face her attacker as if she could beat it back with her fists the hovercraft was nearly on top of her its flatulent roar filling her ears she clenched her jaw and waited the horror of the past several hours was nothing compared to what happened next the hovercraft was only seconds away when her ankles were clutched in a viselike grip and she was dragged down into the cold depths of the sea arms flailing like a windmill in a gale nina struggled to break free but the iron lock on her ankles never let up even as the maelstrom created by the hovercraft whipped the water around her to a wild frenzy she emptied her lungs in one last defiant gesture an angry frustrated scream that came out as a muted explosion of bubbles the grip on her legs relaxed and a vaguely human form began to take shape in the turbulent cloud of bubbles kicked up by the hovercraft like some alien cyclops from a ufo the amorphous shape came closer and solidified until the plexiglass of a divers mask was only inches from her face peering from behind the lens were piercing light blue eyes that projected strength and reassurance rather than menace a gloved hand came up wagged a regulator back and forth in front of her nose and pressed the purge button so the belching mouthpiece would get her attention nina grabbed the regulator and hungrily bit down no flowerscented breath of summer was ever sweeter than the lifegiving compressed air that flowed into her lungs the leveled hand was moving up and down take it easy slow down nina nodded to show she understood the divers signal and felt a gentle squeeze on her shoulder she continued to breathe off the octopus backup emergency hose until eventually her panic passed and her breathing became more rhythmical another hand signal the forefinger and thumb formed into a vague o okay nina imitated the gesture im okay behind the mask a blue eye winked she didnt know who this aquaman was or where he came from but at least he was friendly the divers head was covered by his closefitting hood and a combined helmetmask arrangement she could see only that he was a big man with wide shoulders nina looked up the light was shredded in the wake of the hovercrafts violent passage and engines rumbled through the water they were still looking for her pressure on her shoulder again aquaman pointed toward the surface and clenched his hand in a fist danger she nodded vigorously the thumb pointed downward she looked below her dangling legs into the gloomy depths even the unknown was preferable to the real dangers that lurked above she nodded again and gave the okay signal he clasped one hand in the other hold hands nina took his proffered glove and slowly they began to descend the water changed from cobalt to indigo as they continued their measured plunge becoming so dark that nina felt the cold bottom muck before she saw it from his belt the diver produced a small but powerful highintensity tektite strobelight and held it above his head she dosed her eyes so as not to be blinded by the intense silverywhite flash she knew was coming when she looked again an undersea firefly was blinking in the distance the diver put his forefingers together swim side by side in that direction again holding hands they swam toward the pulsating light until they neared a second diver he saw the swimmers coming his way switched off the strobe he was holding and his hand went to the microphone button of his aquacom headset i cant take you anywhere he said i let you out of my sight for a minute and you show up with a real live mermaid the first diver let his eyes travel over ninas body and decided the description wasnt far off the mark with her golden tresses long legs and minimal covering nina easily could have passed for a mythical sea sprite except for one thing mermaids are half fish he said i like the new improved model better whats her name good question we havent been formally introduced yet i bumped into her when i went up top to check on the ship she was in a bit of trouble so i gave her a hand two hands actually nina had never used underwater communicators herself but she recognized the equipment and knew they must be talking about her as grateful as she was she wished they would cut their conversation short she was freezing if she didnt move soon shed pass out she crossed her arms in front of her chest i am cold the diver she had dubbed aquaman nodded with the protection of his drysuit he had forgotten how cool it must be for an unprotected body lets get our mermaid back to the ship before she turns into a frozen fish stick the other diver checked his compass and led the way ninas new friend signaled her once more to swim side by side and gently took her hand she assumed they were heading for the ship but in her cold and exhausted condition she wasnt sure she could make it the diver seemed to sense her struggle to follow with no fins on her feet and squeezed her hand several times in encouragement they swam for only a few minutes before they glided down again a pair of yellow objects sat on the bottom they were made of plastic and shaped like fat miniature torpedoes with ears nina recognized them as dpvs diver propulsion units or sea scooters as they were more commonly called the divers each picked up a dpv and squeezed the throttles there were low whines as the batterydriven twin motors in the stingrays kicked their twin propellers into action aquaman pointed to his back nina grabbed onto his shoulders and they ascended to midwater where it was marginally warmer as they glided along ninas diver called the ship and asked if anyone could see a big hovercraft in the vicinity he wasnt one to take chances there was a hovercraft around earlier the message came back it headed for land and seems to have disappeared roger please be prepared for a female visitor there was a slight pause say again never mind just be prepared to treat hypothermia they surfaced near the ship and swam around to the stern a welcome party awaited to help nina aboard and wrap her in towels and blankets ninas face was mottled and her lips were blue she refused the stretcher but was glad for a helping hand as she walked with wobbly legs teeth chattering to the infirmary she limped on the foot shed injured escaping the assassins the two divers eased out of their gear and lost no time getting to the infirmary they waited patiently outside the dosed door like expectant fathers before long the physicians mate an attractive and trim young woman who served as the ships doctor came out into the passageway is she all right the bigger man said the mate smiled thats one tough lady she said admiration in her voice ive put antiseptic on her cuts and bruises she was practically hypothermic so i just want her to stay warm for now she can have a cup of bouillon soon can we see her sure you guys keep her entertained while i see if i can round up some clothes and square away a bunk in my cabin where she can get some rest in privacy whats her name the mate raised an eyebrow you dont know you gentlemen must be spending too much time underwater especially you zavala i thought youd know her telephone number and what kind of flowers and restaurants she likes by now jose joe zavalas reputation had followed him from washington which was not surprising since he had once dated the physicians mate always charming with the ladies he was much in demand by many single women for his young ricardo montalban good looks a slight almost shy smile played around his lips i must be slipping he said thatll be the day she smirked and hurried briskly off on her quest nina was sitting on an examination table when the two men stepped into the room she was wearing a baggy navy sweatsuit and a thick woolen blanket was wrapped around her shoulders although her eyes were redrimmed from saltwater immersion and her long hair was matted color had returned to her face and her lips had lost their bluish tinge her hands were cupped around a ceramic coffee mug enjoying its warmth she looked up and saw the tall man filling the doorway with his husky physique and the contrast between his walnut skin and nearwhite hair color he looked like a norse hero from a wagnerian opera yet his voice was quite gentle when he spoke hope were not intruding he said tentatively nina brushed a long wavy strand out of her face not at all come on in he stepped inside followed by the darkcomplexioned man with a nice smile my name is kurt austin and this is joe zavala im nina kirov nina recognized the aquamans eyes she had seen behind the face mask they reminded her of the color of a coral reef beneath smooth water i think weve already met austin grinned pleased at the recognition how are you feeling not bad thanks ill be better after a hot shower she looked around what ship is this the numa research vessel nereus youre with the national underwater and marine agency thats right im head of the numa special assignments team joe is the teams marine engineer i like to think of myself as the teams propulsionist zavala said joes being modest he is the one who keeps us moving on under and above the sea zavala in fact was a professional in every kind of propulsion he could repair modify or restore any engine be it steam diesel or electric and whether it was in an automobile ship or aircraft zavala never hesitated to get his hands greasy when confronted with a mechanical problem he had designed and directed constriction of numerous underwater vehicles manned and unmanned including some aboard the research vessel his talents extended to the sky as well he had two thousand hours as a pilot in helicopters and small jet and turbo prop aircraft you say youre with a special assignments team thats right four of us form the teams nucleus weve got a deep ocean geologist and a marine biologist but theyre on other assignments basically we handle jobs outside the realm of numas ordinary tasks and outside the realm of government oversight he might have added what on earth is your ship doing here were on a shakedown cruise on our way from the mediterranean austin said the moroccan government is worried offshore oil drilling is affecting its sardine fishery nereus was going to be in the area so we said wed do a quick bottom survey nereus the old man of the sea nina murmured cocking her head in thought theres a quote from hesiod the greek poet a trusty and gentle god who thinks just and kindly thoughts and never lies austin glanced at zavala maybe nina really was a mermaid she was certainly lovely enough i dont know if the ship qualifies as the old man of the sea the nereus was launched only a couple of months ago but hesiod was right about not lying this ship is packed from stern to stem with stateoftheart survey gear the ships designer says we scientific types are only on board as ballast zavala said nina was having a hard time reconciling the broadshouldered austin and his softspoken companion with the scholarly scientists she was used to she sized the two men up with an analytical eye at sixfootone and two hundred pounds none of it fat the broadshouldered austin was built like a professional football player he had the deeply tanned face of someone who spent most of his time outdoors with the metallic burnishing look that comes with constant exposure to the sea except for the laugh lines around his mouth and eyes the skin was unwrinkled even though he was only pushing forty austins hair was a premature steely gray almost platinum white at fivefootten the darkly handsome zavala was less powerfully built than austin yet his onehundredseventyfivepound frame was flexibly muscular particularly around the arms and neck and there were traces of scar tissue around his eyebrows the legacies of having financed his way through college by boxing professionally as a middleweight he won twentytwo fights twelve by knockouts and lost six his straight black hair was combed straight back the humorous slight smile she had seen when he first came into the examination room hadnt left his lips remembering the mates comment she could see how a woman could be drawn to the soulful brown eyes their gentlemanly manners couldnt disguise a roughandready quality the brawnier austin was positively genial now but she remembered his fierce determination when hed yanked her out of the way of the hovercraft behind zavalas gregariousness lurked a flinty hardness she suspected the way the two men meshed like gears in a welloiled machine as they got her safely to the ship demonstrated that they were used to working as a team sorry for being so rude she said remembering her rescue i havent thanked you both my apologies for sneaking up on you with the jaws routine austin said it must have been frightening not half as frightening as having that ugly boat playing water polo with my head i can never thank you enough please sneak up and pull me out of danger any time you want she paused one dumb question though do you normally swim around in the atlantic ocean waiting for damsels in distress dumb luck he said with a shrug joe and i were puttering around below i surfaced to get a bearing on the ship and saw you playing dodge em with the hovercraft my turn to ask a question what was that all about her smile vanished simple they were trying to kill me i think that was fairly obvious but why i dont know she said in a monotone her eyes glazed austin sensed she was trying to avoid talking about something you havent told us where you came from he said gently it was like pulling a plug dear god nina whispered the expedition dr knox what expedition austin said she stared into space as if trying to remember a dream im a marine archaeologist i was with a university of pennsylvania party working an excavation not far from here she related the story of the massacre and her escape the tale was so fantastic austin might not have believed it if he hadnt seen the hovercraft attack or the unmitigated fear in ninas face when the narrative was finished austin turned to zavala what do you think i think we ought to go take a look for ourselves me too well call the moroccan authorities first ms kirov do you think you can give us directions to your camp nina had been fighting off the survivors guilt at being the only one who escaped certain death she needed to do some thing she slidoff the table and stood on unsteady legs better than that she said with a steely edge to her voice ill show you captain mohammed mustapha of the moroccan royal gendarmerie leaned against the sunwarmed fender of his jeep and watched the tall american woman walk slowly back and forth across the sandy clearing her head bent toward the ground like most of the countrys rural policemen the captain occupied his days chasing down truants among the village schoolchildren filling out traffic accident reports or checking papers of strangers of whom there were pitifully few the disappearance of a camel he investigated last year stirred up exciting possibilities of rustling before it was determined to be nothing more than a runaway yet that was the closest hed come to tracking down a vanished archaeological expedition mustapha was familiar with the area the berbers called the place of the dead for the old tombs and he was aware of the nearby ruins it was far off the beaten track in a patrol territory that covered hundreds of square miles he had visited the lonely spot once and stayed only long enough to decide he would not come back unless he had to the woman stopped and stood for a moment hands on hips as if she were lost then she walked over to the jeep i dont understand it she said her brow wrinkled in puzzlement we were camped right here the tents the vans everything has vanished the captain turned to the broadshouldered man whose hair was the color of the snow on the atlas mountains perhaps mademoiselle is mistaken about the location nina glared at the police offices mademoiselle is not mistaken he sighed these people who attacked you bandits she considered the suggestion no i dont think they were bandits mustapha gave a gallic shrug worthy of a parisian boulevardier lit up a gauloise and pushed his visor back over his black hair he was somewhat uncomfortable at being in the presence of a woman who had her legs and arms uncovered but he was not an insensitive man hed have to be blind not to see the lacerations that streaked her skin and she was clearly distraught yet he could observe with his own eyes that there were no tents no pile of dead bodies no vehicles in fact there was nothing to indicate the story was true the officer took a drag from his cigarette and blew the smoke out his nostrils i was notified of course that an expedition was near the place of the dead perhaps they left without telling you great nina snapped of all the cops in morocco i get a berber inspector clousseau ninas frayed nerves had made her irritable austin couldnt blame her for being shorttempered with the policemans obtuseness after all shed been through but decided it was time to intervene nina you said there was a big campfire could you show me about where it was with the police officer trailing leisurely after them nina led the way to the approximate center of the clearing and drew an x in the dirt with the tip of her shoe about here id say do you have a shovel austin asked the policeman yes of course it is a necessary tool for driving in the desert mustapha sauntered over to his jeep and from a tool chest he produced a folding shorthandled armyissue spade austin took the spade and knelt at ninas feet where he began to dig a series of parallel trenches about six inches deep the first two produced nothing of interest but the third hit pay dirt literally austin scooped a handful of blackened earth and smelled it ashes from a fire he placed his palm on the ground still warm he said nina was only halflistening she was staring behind austin at a patch of ground that seemed to be moving there she whispered the dark blot was formed by thousands of tiny swarming creatures with the edge of the shovel blade austin cleared a space in the shiny duster of ants and started to dig half a foot below the surface he turned up a spadeful of dark redstained earth he expanded the hole more reddish stain the ground was soaked with it nina got down on her knees beside him the cloying smell of dried blood filled her nostrils this is where they were shot she said her voice tight with restrained emotion captain mustapha had been staring dreamily off into space wondering when hed be able to get home to his wife and children and a good meal sensing the change in atmosphere he threw his cigarette aside and came over to kneel beside nina his nut brown face turned a shade lighter as he realized the significance of the discolored soil allah be praised he murmured seconds later he was at his jeep talking in rapid arabic into the radio nina was still on her knees her body rigid gazing at the earth as if the horrible events of the night before were gushing out of the shallow hole austin figured that she would fall apart if he didnt tear her away he took her arm and helped her to her feet id be interested in a look around the lagoon if you dont mind she blinked like a sleeper suddenly awakened thats a good idea maybe theres something there she led the way through the dunes the zodiac inflatable that had transported them from the numa ship was pulled up onto the stone stairway nina scanned the lagoon that was so peaceful now i cant believe they even took my marker buoys she said with bitter humor with austin a step behind she walked along the rocky shoreline describing the unseen tunnel and cothon austin pointed out a dozen or so fish floating on the otherwise featureless surface probably oxygen deprivation nina said the lagoon isnt terribly healthy for living things she smiled at the unintentional irony there was something else i didnt mention before she briefly described the stone head she found austin was unable to hide his disbelief olmec here he chewed his lower lip trying without success to think of a polite way to express his doubt not a chance i wouldnt believe it either if i hadnt seen it i bet youll change your mind after a short swim ill show you she kicked off her borrowed sneakers austin wouldnt mind a chance to cool off and the swim would take ninas mind off the grim find back at the clearing their shorts and tshirts would dry quickly in the sun nina dove in and austin followed they swam a short distance until nina stopped to take a bead on a couple of landmarks she breaststroked with her head underwater after a minute or so she jackknifed in a surface dive and went straight down near the bottom she swam in a circle then shot to the surface with austin right behind hex its gone she shouted breathlessly the figure is gone youre sure this is the right spot no mistake i lined up two landmarks when i set a buoy here the damned thing has disappeared cmon ill show you without another word she dove again when austin caught up with her she was swimming back and forth near the bottom pointing at what looked like a moon crater she picked something from the mud and they headed up again to face each other treading water they blew it up she said waving a piece of blackened rock in the air they blew the stone head to pieces she began to swim toward land zavala was waiting for them at the stairway hed been checking the camps perimeter the captain says to tell you he called his brigade headquarters he said theyre going to get in touch with the surete nationale in rabat the surete handles the big criminal investigations nina handed her find to austin its basalt volcanic im sure its from the figure austin studied the rock the edges are ragged and charred this piece has been in a recent explosion he squinted at the lagoon that explains those dead fish it doesnt make sense nina said with a shake of her head they kill everybody try to kill me then instead of running off they go to the trouble of blowing up an artifact why a silence followed in which nobody offered an answer austin suggested they check in with the captain and get back to the ship they started walking back to the campsite with nina taking the lead zavala purposely lagged behind and walked beside austin speaking in a low tone so nina wouldnt hear he said i told the captain that maybe hed like to have someone dig around the excavation austin raised an eyebrow nina said the expedition had been working for several days zavala added yet there was no open excavation every trench had been filled in that suggest anything to you afraid it does it might have been a case of the victims unknowingly digging their own graves zavala handed austin a pair of wirerimmed glasses the round lenses were shattered i found these near the dig austin glanced at the eyeglasses and without a word slipped them into his pocket as the zodiac pulled up beside the research vessel ninas eyes appreciatively appraised the meld of function and form built into the sleek bluegreen hull when i saw the nereus from shore yesterday i thought it was a magnificent ship its even more beautiful up close shes more than beautiful austin said helping nina onto the stern deck shes the most advanced research vessel in the world two hundred fifty feet from stem to stern with miles of fiberoptics and highspeed data communications in between the nereus has bow thrusters so she can turn on a dime or keep steady in a rough sea and the latest in submersible vehicles weve even got a hullmounted sonar system to map the bottom without getting our toes wet austin pointed out the tall cubeshaped structure behind the bridge that high superstructure is the science storage area inside are wet labs with running seawater we keep the submersibles camera sleds and dive gear there the ship was built to run with a small crew around twenty we can accommodate more than thirty scientists with nina still limping from her foot injury of the night before they went up three decks into a passageway and stopped at a cabin door this is where youll bunk for the next couple of days i dont want to put anyone out you wont weve got an odd number of female crew aboard and theres an empty bunk in the physicians mate cabin youre conveniently located right next to the library and close to the most important part of ship cmon ill show you he led the way along the passageway to the galley where zavala sat at a table drinking espresso and reading a faxed version of the new york times the airconditioned sterility was a potent antidote to the desolation at the place of the dead the galley was the standard shipboard decor formica and aluminum tables and chairs bolted to the deck but the aromas coming from the kitchen were not the usual smells of bacon and burger grease that clung to most ships galleys nina sat down happy to take the weight off her sore foot i must be famished she said lifting her chin to inhale it smells like a fourstar restaurant in here zavala put the paper down fivestar we underpaid numa types must endure many hardships the wine list is excellent but youll find only california vintages in our cellar this is a us vessel austin said in exaggerated apology it wouldnt do to have a bordeaux or burgundy aboard though our chef did graduate from cordon bleu if that makes you feel better the dinner choices tonight are steak au poivre and halibut au beurre blanc zavala added i must apologize for the chef hes from provence and tends to go heavy on the basil and olive oil nina looked around at the functional surroundings and shook her head in amazement i think ill survive with nina relaxed austin decided it was a good time to bring up an unpleasant subject first he brought her a tall glass of iced tea if youre okay discussing last night again id like to go over what we know in case we missed something austin said she took a sip of tea as if the brew would fortify her ill be all right she said and began to recount again the story of what happened the night before austin listened eyes half dosed in a sleeping lion imitation absorbing every word and inflection tumbling the facts over in his mind looking for inconsistencies with the first account when she had finished he said i think youre right not going with captain mustaphas bandit theory bandits might have killed some of your people trying to rob them but from what you described this was a deliberate massacre what about muslim fundamentalist terrorists zavala ventured theyve killed thousands of people in algiers maybe but terrorists usually like to advertise what theyve done this bunch went out of its way to hide evidence why would fundamentalists destroy the stone figure thats another thing that bothers me by the way theyd need specialized explosives to do that which means they would have known about the statue ahead of time zavala said thats right they came prepared for underwater demolition impossible nina responded then less sure she said i dont see how they could have known about it me neither zavala said youre certain they spoke spanish she nodded emphatically austin said you can practically walk to spain across the strait of gibraltar from tangier and thats not far from here zavala shook his head doesnt mean a thing i speak spanish but im a mexican american whos never been to spain nina remembered something oh that reminds me i forgot about gonzalez who is gonzalez austin said he was a volunteer on the expedition actually he paid to be on it through a nonprofit organization called timequest i saw him talking to a man a stranger in a jeep yesterday afternoon gonzalez said the man was lost at the time i thought it was peculiar you thought right austin said it could be nothing but well run a check on timequest and see if they have anything on gonzalez i assume he was killed with the others i didnt see him but i dont know how he could have escaped what about the hovercraft that chased nina zavala asked austin maybe theres a lead there from what i could see at water level it looked like a custom model maybe a griffon made in england i called numa earlier and asked them to run a check on the owners of all griffon hovercraft there cant be too many of them in the world my guess is they bought it through a dummy corporation which means theyve made it hard to trace maybe even impossible but its worth a try he stared off into space thinking were still faced with the main question why would anybody want to wipe out a harmless archaeological expedition nina had been sitting with her chin resting on her hand maybe it wasnt so harmless she ventured what do you mean i keep coming back to the olmec figure its at the center of things im still having a problem with the olmec part especially since it was turned into a load of gravel its not just my evaluation youve got to remember it was sandy who idd it shes one of the most respected mesoamerican specialists in the country sanfords done papers and field work on all the big sites like tikal and a lot of lesserknown but important finds okay lets say you and sandy are right why is the figure significant it could shake up the archaeological and historical community for years people have wondered whether there was contact between the old and new worlds before columbus like leif eriksson and the vikings i thought there was pretty conclusive evidence of that zavala said there is but its been begrudgingly accepted im talking about transatlantic contact hundreds of years before the vikings the problem has been the lack of any scientifically proven artifact the olmec head would have been that artifact austin lifted an eyebrow well so what pardon me she said almost affronted say this figure does conclusively prove precolumbian contact fascinating and certainly controversial but how important could it be except to archaeologists historians and the knights of columbus what makes it something to kill for in other words oh i see your point she said somewhat mollified but i cant answer you other than to say i think my discovery precipitated the attack in some way no one in the camp knew about your find no they would have known about it in time ethically i should have told dr knox and fisel the moment i found it i suspected right away that it was mexican olmec but it seemed so fantastic i wanted corroboration before i stuck my neck out thats when i contacted sandy except for you your colleague back at the university was the only other person who had seen evidence of the find yes but sandy would never tell anybody thank goodness the preliminary data are secure in her hands she paused i have to get home as soon as possible were heading to the yucatan peninsula to check out the impact area of the asteroid that may have wiped out the dinosaurs weve got another day of survey here before we leave austin said wed love you to be our guest for that time then we can drop you off at marrakech where you can catch a plane to new york it would give you some time to rest and consolidate your thoughts thank you nina said im still pretty jittery but i feel safe here youll be more than safe youll be well fed there is one thing ive got to notify the university about the expedition and dr knox the anthropology department will be devastated dr knox was an institution everybody loved him no problem zavala said ill take you to the radio room austin got a glass of iced coffee and brought it back to the table he poured in a dollop of halfandhalf and stared at the dark liquid as if the answer to ninas puzzle lay in the swirling curlicues none of the story made much sense and he was no nearer enlightenment when zavala returned with nina a few minutes later that was fast austin said didnt you get through to the university zavala was uncharacteristically somber we got through immediately kurt austin noticed ninas eyes were moist with tears i talked to the administration nina said her face ashen they didnt want to tell me at first but i knew they were holding back something she paused good god what is happening i dont understand austin said although he suspected what was coming and wasnt totally surprised when nina said its sandy shes dead austin lay in his bunk and stared at the ceiling listening with envy to zavalas soft snores from across the cabin as predicted the chef had gone heavy on the herbs and oil but austins stomach was fine it was his brain keeping him awake like a busy file clerk it was sorting out the days events and wasnt about to let him rest the shakedown cruise on the nereus was supposed to be a milk run a chance to take a break from the numa teams more strenuous probes into the strange and sinister enigmas on and under the worlds oceans then nina appeared with the hounds of hell snapping at her heels and practically ran into his arms maybe he was really being kept awake by thoughts of the lovely young woman in the next cabin he glanced at the glowing hands of his chronosport wristwatch three oclock austin remembered a doctor telling him that three am was when most deathly ill people give up the ghost that got him out of bed he pulled on a pair of heavy sweatpants and a nylon windbreaker and slipped into battered boat shoes that fit like gloves quietly leaving zavala to his slumber he stepped into the passageway and went up four decks to the bridge the wheelhouse door was open to admit the night air austin stuck his head inside a young crewman named mike curtis was on the early morning watch he sat in a chair with his nose buried in a book hi mike austin said couldnt sleep how would you like some company the crewman grinned and put the book aside wouldnt mind a bit things get pretty boring up here want some coffee thanks i like mine black while mike poured two steaming mugs austin picked up the geology book pretty heavy reading for the graveyard shift i was just boning up for the yucatan survey do you really think that a meteor or comet wiped out all the dinosaurs when an object as big as manhattan slams into the earth its going to shake things up whether the big lizards were already on the verge of extinction is another question this plankton survey should settle a lot of arguments its ironic in a way having little onecelled animals telling us what happened to the biggest life form ever they chatted until mike went to attend to routine duties austin drained his mug and walked through the radio shack to the chartroom at the rear of the bridge with its big wraparound windows the space doubled as an aft control room the crew could use when maneuvering the ship in reverse austin spread a chart of the moroccan coast on the navigation table and marked an x in pencil to show the ships present position lips pursed in thought he studied the chart letting his eyes travel along the occipital bulge in the skullshaped african continent from gibraltar to the sahara after a few minutes of study he shook his head the chart told him nothing a hovercraft could have come from land or sea he dragged a chair over put his feet up on the table and read the entries in the ships log from the start of the trip it had been a pictureperfect cruise up to now a swift and uneventful voyage across the atlantic a brief stopover in london to pick up a batch of european scientists a pleasant couple of weeks in the mediterranean testing the submersible and then the moroccan stopover two days ago ninas story was bizarre by any measure the hovercraft attack and the bloodsoaked evidence at the campsite had convinced him the tale was true the terrible news about her colleagues death removed all shreds of doubt a car accident convenient these assassins had a long reach they had erased the data nina sent to upenn now nina was the only one who had firsthand knowledge of the mysterious olmec artifact and the veracity to be believed he was glad she was in her cabin safely asleep thanks to the mild sedative provided by her roommate austin walked outside and leaned on the rail of a small platform behind the chartoom the ship was in darkness except for a few floods illuminating sections of the white superstructure and lowlevel runway lights along the decks beyond the range of the lights was a vast velvet blackness the smell of rotting vegetation that came to his nostrils was the only evidence of the great land mass that lay less than a league away africa he wondered how many expeditions like ninas had vanished into the heart of darkness maybe the truth would never be known enough philosophizing austin yawned and pondered whether to go back to the bridge return to his cabin or stay where he was and watch the sun come up he lingered savoring the beauty of the night the nereus was like a behemoth at rest he loved the feel of a sleeping vessel the hum of idling electrical systems and the creaks and groans of a ship at anchor tunk austin leaned forward and cocked his ear the clinking noise had come from below metal on metal tunk there it was again not loud but out of sync against the background of usual ship sounds curious now austin quietly descended to the first level and made his way along the deserted deck his hand running lightly along the damp rail he paused his fingers had hit a hard lump he looked closer and saw the prong of a grappling iron covered in cloth to muffle sound exploring further with his fingers he felt the bare metal of the shaft which must have caused the clinking sound when it hit the side of the ship he stepped away from the light and peered over the rail from down at the waterline came the sound of faint rustlings they could have been caused by ripples of water against the hull he cupped a hand to his ear whispered voices separated themselves from the sea sounds he could see moving shadows austin didnt wait to ask if the boarders were friend or foe the answer was obvious in his mind he sprinted for the nearest stairway and climbed back to the cabin level moments later he was shaking zavala awake his roommate slept as if he were drugged but he had an uncanny ability to snap himself fully alert as if an internal electrical switch were turned on zavala knew austin wouldnt wake him unless it was important grunting to let austin know he was getting ready for action he rolled out of bed and yanked on a pair of shipboard shorts and a t shirt austin had thrown back the cover of his foot locker and was rummaging through his belongings he pulled out a leather holster and a second later the snake wood grips of a ruger redhawk filled his hand with its fat fourinch barrel the magnum revolver custombuilt by bowen was compact yet packed a wallop zavala called the bowen kurts cannon and claimed it used railroad spikes for ammunition actually the gun fired a special load of caliber bullets weve got company austin said as he checked the fiveshot cylinder chamber starboard side coming aboard with grapnels those are the ones i know about there may be others well need weapons zavala glanced around the cabin and grumbled just my luck i recall someone telling me this was going to be like a love boat cruise i didnt even bring a cap pistol i didnt know wed be repelling barbary pirates austin slung the holster over his shoulder neither did i thats why i didnt bring a reload ive got five shots and thats it zavala brightened what about your london purchase austin dug into the locker again and lifted out a shiny flat wooden case my joe manton specials hell why not zavala took a divers sheath knife out of a drawer this toothpick is it for my arsenal he said not exactly what id call overwhelming firepower well have to improvise as we go along it wouldnt be the first time zavala said with a shake of his head austin started for the door my guess is that theyre after nina ill get her and wake everyone on this level you can get below and roust the rest of the crew and scientists well have them squeeze into the bow thruster room forward of the crew quarters thats going to be tight quarters i know but they can secure the watertight door and buy us some time we cant have a bunch of unarmed phds and deck hands running around where they can be hurt or taken hostage unfortunately the nereus is a research vessel not a warship im beginning to wish it was a warship zavala said as swiftly as a thought he disappeared down a stairway that led below a sleepyeyed physicians mate answered austins knock on the door of the adjoining cabin without elaborating austin told her to get dressed while he woke nina she was still groggy from her medication but when she saw the intensity in austins face her fluttering eyelids snapped open like window shades theyre back arent they she said her voice hoarse from sleep austin nodded moments later he and the two women were in the hallway making their way from cabin to cabin soon more than a dozen grumpy people were gathered in the narrow passage they were dressed in a variety of nightwear or hastily pulledon mismatches of clothing no questions now austin said in a tone that showed he meant it he directed the sleepyfaced group down the stairs to the lowest deck level zavala was waiting for him with the others like cowpokes on a cattle drive they herded the reluctant throng into the bow section forward of the crew quarters where crew and scientists jostled for space with the bow thrusters that were used to stabilize the ship in heavy seas austin wasted no time summing up the situation im got to make this short and sweet the ships being boarded by armed attackers dont open this door unless you know its joe or me a researcher piped up what are you going to do damned scientific minds austin thought always asking questions this wasnt the time for his usual blunt honesty dont worry joe and i have a plan he said with confidence well be back he quickly stepped into the bunkroom and closed the door on the frightened faces you sounded like the terminator in there said zavala who was right behind him its good to hear weve got a plan hope you dont mind telling me what it is austin damped a big hand on zavalas shoulder simple joe you and i are going to kick these bastards off our ship thats a plan maybe youd like to ask them politely to leave why do it the easy way okay deal me in where do we start we get up to the bridge in a hurry thats where our uninvited guests will go first i hope theyre not already there how do you know theyll go for the bridge its what ill do they can cut off communications and take control of the ship in one fell swoop austin hustled toward the nearest stairway try to stay out of sight if its the same gang that wiped out the expedition my popgun wont stand a chance against automatic weapons using interior stairways they went up the six decks to the bridge they stopped at each level before proceeding to the next but saw no sign of the intruders at the deck below the bridge they split up zavala went ahead to warn the watch austin woke the captain who was asleep in his cabin under the wheelhouse gave him a condensed account of the status quo and suggested he take cover captain joe phelan was a craggyfaced toughasbarnacles numa veteran in his fifties he answered austins suggestion with a snarl i was there when they laid the keel of the nereus he snapped anger dancing in his hazel eyes i waited thirty years to take the helm of a vessel like this damned if im going to hide in a closet while these guys have the run of my ship phelan could make the nereus move with the agility of a ballet dancer but austin wasnt sure how hed be at close combat which was what things might come down to on the other hand it might be risky now for the captain to get down to the bow section the boarders could be swarming all over the ship phelan zipped up the front of a navy jumpsuit and lifted a pumpaction shotgun off a wall rack only a he apologized never know when youre going to have to put down a mutiny noting austins quizzical frown he chuckled sometimes i shoot skeet off the deck this time around the skeet will be shooting back austin said grimly phelan produced two boxes of shotgun shells and threw them into a canvas bag with the wooden case austin had been carrying then they hurried up to the bridge before they entered the wheelhouse austin called out in a low voice joe its us the warning was well advised because when they stepped through the door they were staring down the barrel of a flare gun zavala lowered the gun mikes sending off an sos the young crewman austin had coffee with earlier stepped into the wheelhouse from the radio room the signal is on automatic and will broadcast our positron until someone shuts it off austin didnt have much hope of the cavalry galloping in for a rescue the ship was many miles from civilization they would have to do what had to be done without outside help guess you wont be bored for a while austin told the wideeyed crewman guess not what should i do its too late for you to go below with the others so im going to put you to work climb up on top of the bridge where you get a good view of the ship captain when i give you the signal i want the news lit up like broadway and fortysecond street but keep the bridge in darkness with a quick nod and no questions phelan went over to a console and put his hand on a panel of buttons austin and mike went onto the starboard wing and zavala took up a position on the port wing as mike started up the ladder to the bridge roof austin said when the fights go on i want you to count every stranger you see and remember where you saw them well do the same down here remember keep your head low as soon as everyone was in place austin called in to the captain showtime skipper the ship was equipped with floodlights at every angle so the crew and scientists could work at night as easily as during the day phelans forgers danced over the console in an instant the nereus lit up like a caribbean cruise ship every deck was bathed in light from one end to another two decks below austin saw a trio of figures freeze then scurry for cover like startled roaches in a pantry cut he called the lights blinked off mike called down i saw three guys on top of the submersible garage heading our way none forward you flatten down and stay put for now austin stepped into the wheelhouse as zavala came in from the other wing three on my side three decks below dressed like ninjas same with me mike saw three coming from the aft deck that makes nine that we know of captain can joe borrow your shotgun hes had a little more experience shooting ah skeet the captain knew there was a big difference between picking off clay targets and shooting to kill he handed the shotgun to zavala safetys off he said calmly at austins suggestion he stepped into the radio room where he would be out of the way austin and zavala stood backtoback in the middle of the darkened wheelhouse the guns pointed toward the open doors on each side they only had to wait a few minutes before their unwelcome company arrived a pair of silhouettes materialized in the starboard doorway where they were framed against the blue darkness one behind the other making no attempt at concealment it was a fatal mistake seizing his opportunity austin lined his sits up on the lead intruder and squeezed the trigger the bowens thunderous roar rattled the wheelhouse windows as it sent a heavy caliber slug smashing into the first attackers sternum shattering it to bony splinters before the bullet burst from his nib cage and ripped through the heart of the second figure the force of the impact threw the intruders back and their bodies crashed over the rail the shotgun boomed austin spun around with his ears ringing and through the haze of smoke saw another attacker step boldly through the portside door zavalas shot had gone off to one side and the shotgun pellets gouged a headlevel chunk from the door jamb zavala rapidly pumped another shell into the chamber and got off a second shot this time the pellets found their mark the intruder yelped and drew back but not before squeezing off a quick unaimed burst of machinegun fire the rounds went wild except for one the bullet grazed austins ribs passing through the flesh under his left armpit he felt as if hed been lashed with redhot barbed wire zavala was shaking his head in disgust and didnt see austin go down on one knee i aimed right at him he said incredulously pointblank range i couldnt miss the captain came out of the radio room and slammed a fist into his palm damn i forgot to tell you that old gun pulls right youve got to aim it an inch left zavala turned and saw that austin was down kurt he said with alarm are you all right ive been better austin said clenching his teeth years at sea had given captain phelan a hairtrigger reflex in emergencies he brought over a firstaid kit and while zavala kept guard pacing from one door to the other the captain fashioned a compress that stemmed the bleeding looks like your lucky day he said rigging a sling they missed the bone too bad i dont have time to play the lottery with the captain helping austin got back on his feet i nailed two with one shot unfortunately they took their guns over the side with them showing me up again zavala said peevishly i think i only wounded my guy my guess is that they figured theyd catch us asleep and unarmed so they got too cocky for their own good it wont happen again theyll test us next time draw our fire to see what weve got theyll see real fast that the ship is mostly deserted and will concentrate all theyve got on the bridge wed better be gone by then we can move around through the ships conduits the captain offered i know them better than my own living room good idea our guerrilla operation will be a lot more effective if we can pop up where they least expect us be careful these guys are dangerous but not invincible they fouled up when they let nina get away twice and just now they got a little overanxious and it cost them so they make mistakes so do we zavala said theres one difference we cant afford our mistakes they secured the wheelhouse doors and went into the radio shack the sos was still broadcasting mindlessly into the night austin wondered who would hear it and what they would make of the message he paused and lifted the bowen with his good arm the weight was too much for one hand and the revolver wavered from side to side my aims shaky youll have to use it he passed the revolver to zavala who tucked the flare gun into his waistband zavala handed the shotgun to the captain and told him to watch the door remember it pulls to the right he hefted the revolver two birds with one stone good shooting with four shots left we can take out eight guys we can do it with one shot if they all line up but i wouldnt count on it austin said he picked up the slim darkwood case hed dug out of his luggage all is not lost weve got the mantons the ends of zavalas lips twitched poor bastards wont stand a chance against your singleshot dueling pistols he said with bleak humor ordinarily i might say youre right but these arent just aiy dueling pistols a matched pair of antique flintlock dueling pistols lay inside the box snugly cushioned in compartments covered with green baize the gleaming brownish barrels were octagonal and the highly polished butts rounded like the head of a cane during the ships stopover in london austin had gone to a brompton street antique dealer whom hed had good luck with before the brace of pistols had come into the shop as part of an estate liquidation said the proprietor an older man named mr slocum from their high finish and lack of ornamentation austin would have known who made the pistols even if he hadnt seen the joseph manton label inside the case manton and his brother john were the most renowned eighteenthcentury gun makers in england where the best dueling pistols were made manton pistols were short on decoration and long on what really counted in matters of honormechanical precision when austin heard the astronomical price he balked i do have mantons in my collection he said slocum was not to be deterred i might point out that these were custommade by mr manton he said using the honorific as if the gunsmith were still living these are just the weapons for a scoundrel austin took no insult from the statement understanding exactly what slocum meant that the pistols had builtin insurance using a creative combination of travelers checks and american express austin walked out of the shop with the brace of pistols when austin first showed off his acquisition zavala held the pistol at arms length and said it feels barrelheavy it is austin had explained gun makers like manton knew there was something about staring down a caliber muzzle that made a fellow nervous duelists tended to shoot high the barrel was weighted to keep their aim down the checkering on the grip and the trigger spur for your middle finger will help you keep it steady how accurate is this thing duels were supposed to be settled by fortune deliberate aiming or barrel rifling were considered unsportsmanlike even cause for murder he removed the other pistol from the case this has blind rifling manton made it so the grooves stopped a few inches short you cant see them by looking into the barrel but its enough rifling to give you the edge at three to five yards it should be right on target for a snap shot standing in the radio room now austin brought the gun up quickly and sighted down the teninch barrel as if it were an extension of his arm just the thing for a onearmed man earlier austin had given zavala a quick lesson in loading so he had the concept down even if he was lacking in execution the flat pearshaped powder flask had a springactivated shutoff that measured out the right amount of load zavala had no problem tamping the heavy lead ball down the barrel but he spilled too much primer in the pan the second pistol took half the time and the loading was a lot cleaner austin told zavala hed make an excellent second in a matter of honor he tucked one pistol in his sling and held the other in his right hand deciding it would be too dangerous to go back through the wheelhouse they went into the chartroom and the captain slowly opened the aft door that led outside with the bowen at ready zavala cautiously peered through the crack all was dear they slipped out into the night austin softly called up to mike and told him to lie low then suggested they go down the exterior ladders and work their way toward the stem to lead the attackers away from where the others were hiding he and the captain cautiously descended the starboard side and zavala went down on the port they came together on the deck that extended to become the flat roof of the science storage section the extension of the bridge superstructure was three levels high and nearly the width of the ships fiftyfoot beam the roof served double duty as a parking lot for the inflatable workboats three attackers had been spotted earlier on the roof austin scanned the shadows thinking that the deck was perfect for an ambush he worried about the attackers having nightvision goggles the roof would have been a dangerous place even if their firepower were not laughable he whispered to zavala do you know any insults in spanish youre kidding my father was born in morales we need something strong enough to draw our visitors out of hiding zavala thought for a second cupped his hands to his mouth and let loose with a torrent in spanish the only word austin recognized was madre repeated several times over nothing happened i dont understand it zavala said hispanics usually go crazy at any insult to their mother maybe ill go to work on their sisters he fired off more insults louder and with more of a sneer in his voice the echoes of the last barbs had hardly faded when two figures stepped from behind the workboats and sprayed the deck with gunfire austin was crouched with zavala and the captain behind a large deck winch the firing stopped suddenly as the shooters exhausted the bullets in their magazines i think they took it the wrong way austin said must be my mexican accent what do you figure ak s the ak was the newer version of the terrorists favorite firearm the venerable ak thats my guess too hard to mistake the sound his words were drowned by the ugly chatter of gunfire the air was filled with the whine of ricocheting bullets being fired at a rate of four hundred rounds a minute again the firing stopped austin and zavala took advantage of the intermission and rose to move to a position where they might have a clear shot they heard a shout from the captain behind you the two men whirled as a shadow dropped noiselessly from the deck immediately above them austin saw him first his good arm came up in a swift motion and he pulled the trigger there was a second of delay as the sparks from the flint ignited the powder pan after what seemed like hours the pistol belched fire like a dragons mouth the figure took a step forward and collapsed the gun he was carrying clattered to the deck zavala made a move to retrieve the gun it was too risky now that the muzzle flash had revealed their position with zavala covering their rear austin and the captain moved toward the nearest stairwell and down to the next deck gunfire was coming from every direction they looked for cover too late the captain cried out clutched his head and fell to the deck zavala grabbed the captains arm and pulled him out of harms way more shots and zavala went down as a bullet plowed through his left buttock they had their backs to the science section austin opened a bulkhead door and without checking to see if it was safe grabbed the captain by the collar and pulled him inside zavala was crawling with one leg dragging limply behind him but with some help he too made it through the portal austin bolted the steel door shut and looked around they were in one of the wet labs so called because of the large sinks and running seawater he knew the room by heart and easily found a flashlight then a firstaid kit inside a storage locket he examined zavalas wound arid breathed a sigh of relief when he saw that the bullet had gone in and out of the flesh as austin worked to bind up the wound not an easy task with only one working hand zavala kept the bowen leveled at the door they had just come in how bad is it he said finally you wont like sitting for a while and you might have to explain that you werent running for the hills when you got hit otherwise youll be okay i dont think they knew where we were just shooting wild zavala looked at austins sling and then at the prone figure of the captain id hate to be around when they were really aiming austin examined the captains head the closecropped saltandpepper hair was matted with blood but the wound looked to be a graze the captain groaned as austin applied antiseptic to the bloodied scalp how do you feel austin asked ive got a hell of a headache and im having a hard time seeing think of it as a hangover without the taste of booze in your mouth austin advised his ministrations finished austin looked at his bloodstained comrades and shook his head so much for guerrilla warfare sorry i lost the shotgun the captain said zavala said you should be i could be using it for a crutch he looked around see anything in here we can use to make an atomic bomb with austin squinted at the rows of chemicals and finally picked up an empty flask maybe we can use these for molotov cocktails he glanced at the door they had just come through we cant stay here theyre going to figure out what happened to us when they see the blood trail austin helped his partner into the next section the highceiling garage that was home to the submersible when it wasnt plumbing the depths what about those molotov cocktails zavala said austins mouth clamped into a tight and not very pleasant smile and a hard gleam of anger flickered in eyes that had shifted in shade from coral blue to ice water for all their wisecracks he and zavala knew that if they failed nina and the others on board were as good as dead the people crowded into the bow would be found and these blacksuited killers would dispatch them with the same coldbloodedness with which they wiped the archaeological expedition off the face of the earth austin vowed that was not going to happen as long as he was able to draw a breath forget the cocktails he said with a quiet ferocity ive got a better idea austin leaned against the metal skin of the submersible and under the unblinking gaze of the vehicles porthole eyes he outlined his plan zavala who was sitting at the edge of a sea sled to give his wounded haunch a rest nodded appreciatively a classic kurt austin strategy depending on splitsecond timing unsupported assumptions and lots of luck given the fact that weve got our backs against the sea i say we go for it the captain shook his head in unison with zavalas grin the man would fall over with a good push yet he acted as if he had a fifth cavalry division behind him with the butt of the dueling pistol sticking out of his bloodsoaked sling the silverhaired austin could have passed for a hollywood buccaneer in an errol flynn movie phelan decided that if he had to fight for his ship against such lousy odds he was glad these two lunatics were on his side their strategy session done they crept through a rear door that led from the submersible garage onto the stern deck just behind the towering science storage structure two portable container vans had been lashed to the deck for use as extra lab space the three men made their way around the vans and across the deck until they were at the very stern of the ship under the massive beams of the aft aframe that was used to lift the submersible in and out of the ocean the deck appeared to be deserted but austin knew they wouldnt remain alone for very long and in fact he was counting on having company what do you want me to do the captain asked austin austin regretted that he ever had any doubts about the doughty old sea dog youre the only one with two whole arms and legs since brainpower doesnt count with this phase of the operation you get to do the grunt work under austins onearmed direction the captain transported four of the gasoline tanks used by the workboats from astorage area and strung them evenly spaced in a line across the deck about halfway between the aframe and the van labs each molded red polyethylene tank held nine gallons the captain felt dizzy after the work and had to rest austin who was lightheaded from the blood hed lost couldnt blame him zavala had located a short wooden paddle to use as a cane and was thumping about the deck like long john silver he said he was fine but he clenched his teeth as he eased himself onto a cable drum of a deck winch guess we wont be giving to a blood bank anytime soon austin said wed better get this show moving before we all keel over its vital that we make them come to us can try greeting them in spanish again that worked the last time remembering the violent reaction zavalas taunts provoked on the upper deck austin said let em have it zavala drew a deep breath and in the loudest voice he could muster let fly a string of insults that called the character of the listeners families into question in every way imaginable fathers brothers and sisters assigning to each an imaginative array of perversions austin had no idea what he was saying but the sarcastic needling tone left no mistake about the meaning of the scornful barbs while zavala threw out the bait austin got a tight grip on one of the deck hoses and signaled the captain to turn on the water the hose jerked as if it were alive austin walked across the deck sweeping the spray back and forth the water hit the deck with a spattering hiss that was drowned out by zavalas insults barely visible in the moonlight a whitefoamed ripple began to advance austin kept the miniature wave moving until it almost reached the gas tanks zavalas taunts failed to work their scatalogical magic this time the enemy had become wary after the last episode austin grew impatient he drew the dueling pistol from his sling pointed it in the air and fired if his scheme failed a single bullet wasnt going to help much anyhow the rise worked before long dusky ghosts that were more spectral than real in the faint light of the moon materialized from the shadows around the cargo containers and began to advance slowly toward them austin again had a scary thought that they might have nightvision goggles but he quickly put it out of his mind the intruders were moving more cautiously than they did in the earlier attacks but they showed no sign of being deterred from their task austin estimated that it would be only seconds before powerful flashlights clicked on and lethal gunfire sprayed the deck the ripple was nearly at the containers red lights glowed in the darkness laser sights that would give the gunmen unerring aim austin gave the signal to zavala now zavala was sitting in the center of the deck favoring his good side his eyes glued on the barely visible line of foam that marked the edge of the advancing water he lifted the bowen revolver in both hands sighted on the tank farthest to his right and pulled the trigger the revolver roared like a miniature howitzer the tank disintegrated as a fountain of gasoline showered the deck zavala quickly moved the leveled pistol to the left three more times he fired three more tanks were blown to pieces the thirtysix gallons of gasoline spread out in an expanding puddle austin ordered the captain to turn up the pressure floating on the surface of the moving water the gasoline surged forward and eddied around the prone forms of the attackers who lay bellydown on the deck where they had flattened out at the first roar of austins oversized pistol they got up and if they thought about the precariousness of wearing gassoaked clothes as a puddle of waterborne fuel lapped at their shoes it was too late to do anything about it all that was needed to turn the deck into an inferno was a spark and zavala was glad to provide one zavala put the empty bowen aside and picked up the flare gun austin had been watching the figures get to their feet now he yelled again zavala pulled the trigger the glowing projectile streaked down at an angle and skipped across the fleck in a phosphorescent explosion of streamers the deck erupted in flames and zavala threw his arm up for protection against the hot blast a moving wall of yellow flame swept toward the blackclad figures who were thrown into relief as the volatile liquid they were standing in ignited like a napalm bomb the fire quickly enveloped them as it fed on the gassoaked clothes and transformed the figures into blazing torches the intense heat sucked the air out of their lungs before they could take a step they crumpled to the deck bullets from the useless guns flew in all directions through the cloud of billowing black smoke austin hadnt foreseen this dangerous byproduct of his plan he yelled out to the captain to grab cover then helped zavala they huddled behind the winch drum until the gunfire ceased the blaze used up the fuel and blew itself out almost as quickly as it started austin told zavala and the captain to stay put and walked forward five steaming corpses lay in fetal position on the deck everything okay zavala called yeah but its the last time theyll come to one of our barbecues zavalas voice rang out watch it kurt theres another one austin automatically reached for his sling only to realize he had left the useless dueling pistol behind he froze as a shadow detached itself from behind the base of a crane off to one side he was out in the open the bowen was empty he was dead he waited for a fusillade of hot lead to cut him down hed be a perfect target against the flames flickering on the waters surface zavala and the captain would be next nothing happened the figure was running away toward the starboard side where austin had first discovered the grappling hooks austin took a step to follow then stopped unarmed wounded and just plain worn out he could only stand there helplessly as an outboard motor coughed into life he waited until the motors buzz faded into the distance then walked back to zavala and the captain guess our head count was off zavala said guess so austin let out the breath hed been holding he wanted to lie down and take a nap but there was one more thing he had to do mike was still on the roof of the bridge and the crew and researchers were barricaded in the bow section you wait here ill tell the others they can come up for air he picked his way around the charred bodies and made his way toward the bow section where the crew and scientists were hiding austin was not a coldblooded man but he reserved his compassion for those who deserved it moments ago the fleshandblood entities that had inhabited these smoking charcoal shells were intent on killing him and his friends and colleagues something he could not let happen under any circumstances particularly to nina for whom he was forming a growing attachment it was as simple as that this was obviously the same team that wiped out the archaeological expedition they had come to finish the job austin and the others had just been in the way the assassins had been stopped but austin knew that as long as nina kirov was alive this wasnt going to be the end of it india the monsoons that sweep across india from the arabian sea drop most of their rain on the mountain range known as the western ghats by the time the moist air currents reach the deccan in southeast india the downpour has diminished to a mere twentyfive inches as professor arthur irwin stood in the mouth of the cave looking out at the sheets of water pouring down from the slatecolored sky he found it hard to believe this was supposedly the same amount of rainfall london gets the afternoon shower that was just ending would by itself have been enough to float the houses of parliament the cave opening was on a sloping hillside that overlooked a narrow valley choked by lush greenery the dense forest south of the ganges river is the most ancient part of india and was once known as a remote and dangerous place haunted by demons irwin was less worried about demons than the welfare and whereabouts of his party it had been six hours since professor mehta had set off for the village with their taciturn guide the village was about an hours hike along a muddy road and across a stream he hoped the bridge hadnt been knocked out in a sudden flash flood he sighed nothing he could do about it he would simply have to wait he had plenty of supplies and much to occupy himself irwin went back into the cave walking between a pair of pillars under a horseshoe arch into the cool central hall or chapel poor mehta this was his expedition after all hed been so excited when he called and said i need a middleaged cantabrigian ethnologist for a small expedition can you come to india at my expense has the indian museum suddenly become less parsimonious no but its not the museum ill explain later the buddhist monks who had carved the cave from sheer rock with pick and ax were following the words of the master who advised his followers to take a rain rest for meditation and study during the monsoon season doorways on either side of the chapel opened into the spartan monks cells the stone couches where irwin and the other men spread their sleeping bags were not the most comfortable of sleeping platforms but at least they were dry the main hall was built like a christian basilica light from the door reached the far end where the altar would be in a church irwin marveled at the artfully sculpted pillars that supported the barrel ceiling along the walls were scenes from the life of buddha and most interesting to irwin court and domestic paintings that portrayed the everyday existence of people and allowed the cave to be dated at about ad the deccan was famous for its cave monasteries and as far as anyone knew all had been discovered then this one was found its entrance hidden behind vegetation on their first visit mehta and irwin were examining the paintings when the guide who had wandered off called out to them from an anteroom come quickly a man they exchanged glances thinking that the guide had discovered a skeleton when they entered the cool dark space and flashed their lights on the comer they saw a stone figure perhaps five feet long the man reclined his head turned to one side on his belly he held a dishshaped receptacle irwin stared for a moment in disbelief then went back into the chapel and sat down mehta followed him out what is it arthur that figure have you ever seen anything like that no but obviously you have irwin tugged nervously at his goatee i was traveling in mexico some years ago we stopped at the mayan ruins at chichen itza theres a larger version of this figure there its called a chac mool that dishlike receptacle the figure is holding was used to catch blood during sacrifices mexico mehta said without conviction irwin nodded when i saw it here it was so out of time and place i understand of course but perhaps youre mistaken there are a great many similarities in cultures maybe weve got to get it back for authentication mehtas sad eyes became even sadder we havent even started our work theres no reason why we cant still do it but this is important of course arthur mehta said with resignation remembering how impulsive irwin was even whey they were students at cambridge they trekked back to the village and retrieved their truck which they drove to the nearest town that had a telephone mehta suggested they call timequest the nonprofit foundation that was funding the original expedition and ask for more money to pay to remove the artifact he explained that the only strings attached were that timequest be notified of any significant find after a lengthy conversation mehta hung up and smiled they said we can hire some villagers but to wait until they get someone to us with the money i told them the monsoon season is almost here they said fortyeight hours they went back to the cave and worked at the site photographing and cataloging two days later mehta and the guide set off for the village to meet the timequest representative then the rains came irwin worked on his notes when the others hadnt arrived by dusk he cooked curried rice and beans it grew dark and it looked as if he would be spending the night alone so he was pleased when he heard a quiet footfall as he finished washing the dishes with spring water from a cistern at last my friends he said over his shoulder im afraid youve missed dinner but i might be persuaded to cook more rice there was no reply he turned and saw a figure standing just out of range of the light cast by the lamp thinking he might be a villager sent by mehta irwin said you startled me did mehta send you with a message in silent reply the figure took a step forward metal gleamed in the strangers hand and in the last terrifying moments of his life irwin realized what had happened to mehta and the guide even if he didnt know why china how far are we from the site chang the wiry man standing at the riverboats long tiller held up two fingers two miles or two hours jack quinn said a gaptoothed grin appeared on the steersmans wizened fare he shrugged and pointed to his ear either the question had exceeded his meager grasp of english or he simply couldnt hear over the racket generated by an antique evinrude outboard motor worn valves defective muffler and a loose housing that vibrated like a drumhead combined in an uproar that echoed off the riverbanks and drowned out all attempts at verbal communication quinn ran his fingers through thinning black hair and adjusted his stocky body in a vain attempt to locate a more comfortable position for his posterior it was a lost cause the lowslung narrowbeamed craft was shaped vaguely like a surfboard and partially covered by a rough deck whose sunsplintered surface discouraged sitting quinn finally gave up he hunched his shoulders and stared with glazed eyes at the passing scenery they had left the rice paddies and tea plantations behind them occasionally they passed a fishing village and a grazing water buffalo but soon only golden fields rolled off to mistshrouded mountains in the distance the beauty of china was lost on quinn he could think only of ferguson his project manager the first message from ferguson had been exciting found many clay soldiers this could be bigger than van quinn knew right away that ferguson was talking about the seventhousandstrong army of terracotta soldiers discovered in an imperial mausoleum near the chinese city of van it was the sort of news quinn liked to relay to the governing board of the east asia foundation which he served as executive director the foundation was set up by a group of wealthy patrons to promote eastwest understanding and atone for the opium trade it was also a tax writeoff so those living comfortably off the fortunes their forebears made hooking hundreds of thousands of chinese on drugs could enjoy their wealth to the fullest as part of its program the foundation sponsored archaeological digs in china these were popular with the board because they cost the foundation nothing being largely subsidized by enthusiastic amateurs who paid money to participate and because they sometimes made the front page of the new york times quinn would visit a site when he could be sure of favorable publicity but it usually took a lot to pry him from the mahogany and leather comfort of his new york office the second message from the field was even better than the first found exciting artifact details to follow quinn had already primed his newspaper and tv contacts when the third message arrived artifact is mayan before taking the foundation job quinn had run a university museum and had a sketchy knowledge of ancient cultures he fired off a reply to ferguson mayan is not chinese impossible a few days later he heard from ferguson again impossible but true no kidding that night quinn packed a bag and took the next flight to hong kong where he caught a train to the interior after a bus ride of several hours he arrived at the river just in time to hitch a ride with chiang in addition to keeping the expedition supplied chiang served as postman running communications to a telegraph office which explained why the messages were so agonizingly slow quinn learned that chiang had visited the site a few days before which must have been when he picked up fergusons last letter quinns anger had been building during the course of his long hard journey it was only a question of whether he would fire ferguson before or after he threw him in the river as they neared the site quinn began to wonder if ferguson had simply gone raving mad maybe it was something in the water quinn still hadnt decided on a course of action when the boat angled in and bumped up against the shore where the banking had been worn down by foot traffic chiang tied up at a post stuck in the ground then he and quinn both grabbed a couple of boxes with supplies and began to walk inland as they followed a path through high yellow grass quinn asked how far one finger quinn figured it to be one hour or one mile he was wrong on both counts one minute later they came upon an area where the grass had been tramped down in a more or less circular shape chiang put down his load and gestured at quinn to do the same wheres the camp quinn said looking for people or tents chiangs face was creased in a puzzled frown tugging at his scraggly beard he pointed emphatically to the ground end of a perfect day quinn fumed he was tired and dirty his stomach was roiling like a boiled pot and now his guide was lost chiang said something in chinese and motioned for quinn to follow after a few minutes walk he stopped and pointed to the ground a couple of acres of dirt had been turned over quinn walked along the perimeter of the disturbed soil until his eye caught a roundish object protruding from the dirt he dug away at it with his hands and after a few minutes revealed the head and shoulders of a terracotta soldier he dug some more and found other soldiers this must be the site but there should be about a dozen people here where the hell was everybody chiang glanced fearfully around him devils he said and without another word trotted back toward the river the air grew colder as if a cloud had passed over the sun quinn realized he was all alone the only sound was the snakelike rustle of the breeze through the grass he took one last look around and dashed toward the retreating figure leaving behind the ranks of silent soldiers entombed in the earth fairfax county virginia in the sultry stillness of the virginia morning austin shoved off from the boat ramp wrapped his thick fingers around the carbonfiber oar handles and with a long smooth pull sent his arrowslim racing scull darting into the sparkling waters of the potomac river sculling on the potomac was a daily ritual austin followed faithfully in between assignments as the doctor ordered he had given his left side a rest once the stitches healed he began his own therapy regimen using the weights and machines in his exercise room and daily swims in his pool he had gradually increased the demands on his body until he considered it safe to row without tearing newly mended muscle the time to test the regimen came on a particularly lovely day when the siren call of the river became impossible to resist he hauled his sleek twentyonefootlong maas aero racing scull from the lower level of the boathouse hed converted into his home just below the palisades in fairfax county jockeying the light shell down the ramp and into the water was not difficult the real adventure was getting into the slender boat without tipping it over his first attempt to row was pure disaster the concept composite oars were featherlight but with their ninefoot length and the weight and pressure of the blades against the water austin took only a few painful strokes before turning back in a cold sweat his side felt as if a meat hook hung off it he deliberately capsized the shell near shore staggered into the house and stood in front of the medicine cabinet looking at his ashen reflection as he popped painkillers that only slightly dulled the agony he waited a few days then tried again he favored his right arm and the uneven strokes tended to send the scull into an unpretty series of connected arcs but at least he was moving within days he could row without gritting his teeth eventually the stiffness lessened today the only reminder of the assassins lucky shot was the twinge he experienced during his warmup stretches he felt good from the moment he slipped into the open cockpit tucked his feet into the dogs bolted to the foot rests and pushed the sliding seat back and forth a few times on its twin runners to limber up his abdominal muscles he adjusted the buttons the collars that rest against the outrigger oarlocks to make sure they were positioned to deliver the maximum power with each stroke leaning forward austin dipped the blades into the water and gingerly pulled the oar handles back letting the weight of his body work for him the scull skimmed over the surface like a water bug this was the best day yet any residual pain was overwhelmed by his joy at being able to row with a normal rhythm he sat straight up hands overlapped for easier pulling rowing slowly at first he used a moderate forward reach and a long pull at the end of each stroke he feathered the oars turning them almost horizontal to reduce wind resistance the blades inches above the water as they came forward he grunted with satisfaction he was rowing well the scull glided upriver as quietly as a whisper past the stately old mansions that lined the shore the misty flowerscented river air that filled his lungs was like the perfume of an old love which in a way was true for austin rowing was more than his main physical exercise with its emphasis on technique rather than power this melding of mind and body was like a zen meditation totally focused now he increased his stroke rate gradually unleashing more of the power in his broad shoulders until the dial of the strokecoach just above his toes showed him rowing at a normal twentyeight strokes per minute sweat rolled down from under the visor of his turquoise numa baseball cap the back of his rugby shirt was soaked with perspiration and his butt was numb despite the seat padding of the bike shorts but his senses were telling him that he was alive the sleek shell flew over the river as if the oars were wings he planned to row the first leg for fortyfive minutes then reverse and let the lazy current give him an easy ride back there was no sense pushing his luck a blinding flash of light caught his eye from the riverbank the sun was reflecting off the glass of a tripodmounted spotting scope a man sat on a folding chair on the shore peering into the scopes eyepiece he had on a white cotton hat pulled down low over his brow and the rest of his face was hidden behind the scope austin had seen the same man for the first time several days earlier and had figured him for a birdwatcher except for one thing the scope was always trained on austin minutes later austin made the planned turn and started downriver as he approached the birdwatcher again he shipped his oars letting the current take him and waved hoping the man would lift his head the eye remained glued to the scope austin studied the birdwatcher as the scull glided silently by then he grinned and with a shake of his head took up the oars again and pulled for home the victorianstyle boathouse had been part of a riverfront estate with its pale blue clapboards and mansard roof surmounted by a turret it was a miniature of the main house except for interior modifications austin steered the shell toward shore climbed out onto the ramp and pulled the scull up and under the boathouse he maneuvered it onto a rack next to another one of his toys a small outboard hydroplane austin had two other boats a twentytwofoot catboat and a fullsized racing hydroplane tied up at a chesapeake bay marina he liked the catboats classic lines and history and the fact that despite its tubby hull and single sail it was fast especially with the modifications hed built into it and could beat the pants off bigger and sleeker craft the cat was weatherly too and he pushed it to extremes of weather and distance just for the thrill of it while austin enjoyed the mental challenges of rowing and could sail a boat almost from the time he could walk he had acquired a taste for speed early in life and raced boats since he was ten his big love on his time off was still racing boats with the scull stowed he climbed an inside stairway to the main level then another short flight to the turret bedroom he tossed his rowing clothes into a hamper and washed away the mornings exertions with a hot shower as he toweled off in front of the mirror he examined the bullet wound it had lost its angry redness and turned pinkish soon it would join the other pale scars that stood out against his walnut skin all souvenirs of violent encounters sometimes he wondered if his body naturally attracted projectiles and sharp instruments the way a magnet draws metal filings dressed in clean shorts and tshirt he went into the kitchen brewed half a pot of strong kenyan coffee and rustled up a pan of bacon and eggs he carried the plate through a slider to the deck overlooking the potomac and watched the river go by as he ate breakfast still enjoying the cholesterol rush he refilled a mug of coffee then went into his combination studyden he put a coltrane cd on the stereo settled into a black leather chair and listened to anton saxs instrument sing in voices its creator could never have dreamed were possible it was not surprising that austin favored progressive jazz in a way the sounds of coltrane oscar peterson keith jarrett bill evans and other artists in his extensive music library reflected austins own personality a steely coolness that masked intense energy and drive the ability to reach deep into his soul when superhuman effort was needed and a talent for improvisation the spacious room was an eclectic collection of the old and the new authentic darkwood colonial furniture and white walls hung with contemporary originals curiously for a man who was raised in and around the sea and who spent much of his life on or under the water there were few nautical items a primitive painting of a sailing clipper done by a hong kong picasso for a china trade skipper a nineteenthcentury chart of the pacific a couple of shipbuilding tools a photo of his catboat and a glassencased scale model of his racing hydroplane his bookshelves held the leatherbound sea adventures of joseph conrad and herman melville and dozens of books of ocean science but the most hand worn volumes were those of writers like plato kant and the other great philosophers he liked to study austin was aware of the dichotomy but saw no oddity in it more than one sea captain had retired inland after a career on the bounding main austin wasnt yet ready to move to kansas but the sea was a wild and demanding mistress and he needed this quiet refuge from its crushing embrace as he sipped his coffee his eye fell on the brace of mantons mounted on the wail over the fireplace austin had nearly two hundred sets of dueling pistols in his collection most of the pairs were stored in a fireproof vault he kept the more recent acquisitions at the boathouse he was fascinated not only by the workmanship and deadly beauty of the pistols but by the twists and turns of history that may have been launched by a wellplaced ball fired on a quiet morning he pondered how the republic might have fared if aaron burr had not killed alexander hamilton the mantons brought his mind back to the nereus incident what a strange night in the days hed been home recovering austin had replayed the attack in his mind again and again fastforwarding freezing action and rewinding like a vcr after the battle the exertion and loss of blood caught up with austin he had barely taken a dozen steps before he could go no farther collapsing in slowmotion and ending up in a sitting position captain phelan had been the one to tell the crew all was safe they came out of hiding scraped austin and zavala off the deck and carried them on stretchers to sickbay on the way they passed the body of the assailant austin had nailed with a single shot from his dueling pistol at austins direction they stopped and a crewman with a strong stomach pulled the mask off the dead man the face was that of a man in his thirties darkcomplexioned with a thick black mustache his features otherwise unremarkable except for the round hole in the forehead zavala sat up on his stretcher and let out a low whistle tell me you had a laser sight on that old blunderbuss a moving target in the dark if i hadnt seen it id say a shot like that was impossible it is impossible austin said with a rueful smirk i was playing it safe with a body shot as he explained to zavala while their wounds were properly bandaged his uncanny accuracy had nothing to do with his aim or the pistols disreputable barrel grooving in his haste austin had turned the small pressure adjusting screw next to the trigger in the wrong direction and set the pistol with a hair trigger thank goodness for mantons barrelweighted idiotproofing a oilcompany helicopter summoned by an emergency radio call plucked the wounded men and nina kirov from the nereus and dropped them off in tarfaya captain phelan refused to leave his ship and after the physicians mate had ascertained hed be able to function on a limited basis within a few days he stayed on to take the nereus to the yucatan within hours austin and zavala were on a numa executive jet that had been diverted to morocco on its way to the united states from rome nina hitched a ride on the plane to dulles airport the painkiller austin was given knocked him for a loop and he slept almost the entire flight his recollections were vague but he remembered dreaming that a blond angel kissed him lightly on the cheek when he awoke he was in washington nina was gone having caught the shuttle for boston he wondered whether hed ever see her again after spending a couple of days in the hospital he and zavala were sent home told to take their medication faithfully and give their bodies a chance to heal the jangle of the phone jolted austin out of his reverie he picked up the receiver and heard a crisp greeting good morning kurt how are you feeling im coming along quite well admiral sandecker thank you for asking although i must admit to being a little bored glad to hear that your boredom is about to come to an abrupt end were meeting tomorrow at nine to see if we can get to the bottom of this moroccan business im bringing zavala in as well hes been seen around arlington in his convertible so i assume he too is bored with inactivity zavala who drove a corvette mostly because it was the last model with a trunk had used his time to tinker in his basement where he liked to restore mechanical contrivances and create new technical underwater devices as soon as he was able to walk without falling over he started working out at a boxing gym joe was never bored when there were women around and hed been making the most of the sympathetic leverage his wound got him austin had talked to zavala numerous times on the phone for all the fun joe was having he was itching for action austin was telling the truth when he said im sure hes eager to get back to work admiral splendid by the way i understand youre well enough to qualify for a spot on the olympic crew team as coxswain maybe one suggestion sir the next time you hire someone to impersonate a birdwatcher you might make sure he isnt wearing dress shoes and knee socks pause i dont have to remind you that numa does not have the same pool of clandestine operatives that your langley neighbors have at their beck and call i asked joe mcsweeney one of numa s bean counters from accounting to quietly see how you were coming along he passes your house commuting to work sounds as if a james bond bug bit him and he took the job more seriously than i imagined hope you dont mind no problem sir i appreciate your concern its better than having daily phone calls from headquarters thought you might think so incidentally mac does know his birds im sure he does austin said see you tomorrow admiral austin hung up chuckling at sandeckers paternalism and his disingenuous shot at the cia whose headquarters were less than a mile from the boathouse the admirals agency was primarily scientific but its operations as the undersea counterpart of nasa were naturally made for intelligence gathering that rivaled or even surpassed the best the company could come up with sandecker envied the cias bottomless budget and limited accountability although he himself was no slouch at prying funding from congress he could muster the support of twenty top universities with schools in the marine sciences and a host of large corporations with its five thousand scientists engineers and others its ongoing studies in deep ocean geology and mining biological studies of sea life marine archaeology and climatology and its farflung fleet of research vessels and aircraft numas reach extended to every part of the globe hiring austin away from the cia had been a major sandecker coup austin came to numa in a roundabout fashion he had studied for his masters degree in systems management at the university of washington and attended a highrated dive school in seattle hed trained as an underwater jackofall trades which meant he was proficient in basics such as welding the commercial application of explosives and mud diving he specialized in flotation lifting heavy objects from the sea and deepsea saturation diving in various environments using mixed air and undersea chambers after working on oil rigs in the north sea a couple of years he returned to his fathers marine salvage company for six years before being lured into a littleknown branch of the cia that specialized in underwater intelligence gathering he was assistant director of the secret raising of a russian submarine and the salvage and investigation of an iranian container ship carrying nuclear weapons that was sunk clandestinely by an israeli submarine he also conducted several investigations into commercial airlines that had been mysteriously shot down over the sea locating salvaging and investigating the incidents at the end of the cold war the cia closed down the undersea investigation branch austin probably would have drifted into another cia section had he not been hired by admiral sandecker for special undersea assignments that often took place outside the realm of government oversight sandecker could cry poor mouth and point at langley all he wanted but he was well acquainted with cloakanddagger operations austin glanced at his watch ten oclock it would be seven in seattle he picked up the phone and punched out a number a voice with a buzzsaw edge answered good morning austin said its your number one son about time you called i talked to you yesterday pop a lot can happen in twentyfour hours austins father replied with goodnatured gruffness oh like what like landing a multimillion dollar contract with the chinese thats what not bad for an old geezer it was from his father that austin inherited his strapping physique and stubbornness now in his midseventies the elder austin had a slight stoop to his wide shoulders but he regularly put in work days that would kill a younger man his seattlebased marine salvage company had made him wealthy but he still drove himself especially since the death of austins mother a few years earlier like many selfmade men it had become the game not the money that was important congratulations pop cant say im surprised but youre hardly a geezer and you know it dont waste your time buttering me up talks cheap when are you coming out so we can celebrate with a bottle of jack daniels thats all i need austin thought a night out with his hard drinking father would land him back in the hospital not for a while im going back to work about time youve goldbricked long enough there was disappointment in his voice you must have been talking to the admiral he said pretty much the same thing now i got better things to do austins father was only half kidding he had a great deal of respect for sandecker at the same time he saw him as a rival for his son and had never abandoned hope that kurt would come to his senses someday and take over the family business austin sometimes thought this hope was what kept hits father going let me see what he wants ill get back to you heavy sigh okay you do what you have to do got to go call coming in on the other line austin stared at the now dead receiver and shook his head in more fanciful moments he wondered what would happen if his bearlike father dashed headtohead with the slightly built but bantamtough sandecker he wouldnt bet on the outcome but he knew one thing he didnt want to be around if it happened the coltrane cd was ending austin replaced it with a gerry mulligan disk and leaned back in his chair with a smile on his face as he prepared to savor the last hours of leisure time he might have for weeks to come he was glad sandecker had called and that his vacation was about to end it went beyond boredom the admiral wasnt the only one who wanted to get to the bottom of what he called this moroccan business hiram yaeger leaned back in his chair hands folded behind his neck and stared through his wirerimmed granny glasses at the threedimensional blackandwhite photograph of the buxom sumatran woman made even more lifelike by the holographic display who was projected on the huge monitor beyond his horseshoeshaped console he wondered how many millions of young males learned their first lesson in female anatomy from the dusky maidens in the pages of national geographic magazine with a sigh of dreamy nostalgia yaeger said thanks for the treat max youre welcome replied the computers disembodied female voice i thought youd enjoy a break from your work the nubile maiden disappeared sent back to where she had been frozen in time by a geographic photographer it brought back fond memories yaeger said taking a sip from his coffee from his private terminal in a small side room the chief of the agencys communications network could in a blink of the eye tap into the vast files of the computer data complex that occupied the entire tenth floor of the numa headquarters building it was numas hardware that usually made world headlines the exploits of the hightech research vessels deepsubmergence submarines and assorted undersea robots were what caught the publics imagination but one of sandeckers greatest contributions was numas unseen jewel in the crown the massive highspeed computer network yaeger had designed with a free hand and unlimited funding thanks to the admiral sandecker had lured yaeger to numa in a raid on a silicon valley computer corporation and assigned him to build what would undeniably be the finest and largest archive of ocean sciences in the world the vast data library was yaegers joy and his passion it had taken years to put together centuries of human knowledge gleaned from books articles and scientific and historical theses everything known to have been written about the sea was available not only to numa but to ocean science students professional oceanographers marine engineers and underwater archaeologists worldwide yaeger was the only person in numa who ignored sandeckers dress code and got away with it which spoke eloquently of his talents with his levis jacket and jeans his long blondishgray hair tied in a ponytail and the untamed whiskers that hid the boyish eagerness of his face the scruffy yaeger could have come off a sixties hippy commune in fact yaeger did not live in a yurt but drove to and from a fashionable maryland suburb in a fully equipped bmw his attractive wife was an artist his two teenage daughters were students at a private school and their main complaint was that yaeger spent more time with his electronic family than his fleshandblood one yaeger was still in awe of the tremendous power at his command he had given up the keyboard and monitor for spoken commands and the holographic display his foray into the more revealing aspect of the geographic articles was an excuse to take a break from the demanding assignment hed been working on at sandeckers request on the surface sandeckers directive had been uncomplicated find out if there were any attacks on archaeological expeditions similar to what happened in morocco it turned out to be a monumental task hed neglected his understanding wife and children even more than usual in his passion to solve the puzzle although the numa system was geared to the oceans max routinely hacked into other systems without authorization to gather information and transfer data among libraries newspaper morgues research libraries universities and historic archives anywhere on the globe yaeger began by compiling a master list of expeditions divided chronologically by decades and going back fifty years there were hundreds of names and dates on the list then he prepared a computer model based on the facts that were known about the moroccan incident he asked max to compare the model to each expedition drawing on various sources such as published academic papers scientific journals and news reports crosschecking the accounts to determine if any of these expeditions had come to a similar unscheduled end always searching for patterns the sources were often fragmentary and sometimes dubious like a sculptor trying to find a figure in a piece of marble he chipped the master list down in size it was still long and complicated enough to daunt the most experienced researcher but the challenge only whetted his appetite after several days he had brought together an enormous amount of information now he would instruct the computers to sift through the data and refine the results into a palatable serving max please print out your findings when youve exhausted your networks he instructed the computer i will get back to you shortly sorry for the delay the soft monotone voice responded why dont you pour yourself another cup of coffee while you wait time was irrelevant to a computer yaeger reflected as he followed maxs suggestion it did what it did at unimaginable speeds but no matter how fast and smart max was it had no concept of what it was like to have sandecker breathing down its circuits yaeger had promised sandecker the results by the following morning while max labored yaeger could have taken a break walked to the numa cafeteria or simply left his sanctum sanctorum for a brisk walk he hated to leave his electronic babies and instead used the time to explore other options he stared up at the ceiling and remembered that nina kirov had said the killers came in the night massacred the party then disposed of the bodies max lets take a look at assassins max was actually a number of computers that like the human brain could work on several complicated tasks at the same time that should be no problem a second later the computer voice said assassins an english analog of the arabic hashshashin meaning one who is addicted to hashish a secret eleventhcentury politicoreligious islamic order presided over by an absolute ruler and deputy masters unquestioning obedience was demanded of sect members known as the devoted ones the actual hit men who murdered political leaders and put their skills out for hire the killers were given hashish and a heavy dose of sensual pleasures and told this was a taste of the paradise that awaited them if they did their job the sect spread terror for more than two hundred years interesting but how pertinent yaeger tugged at his scraggly beard while max described other groups of assassins such as the thugs of india and the japanese ninja these groups didnt quite fit the profile of the moroccan killers but more important they had been out of business for centuries he didnt dismiss them out of hand if he were forming an assassin squad hed look toward the past to see how others had operated dr kirov said the killers destroyed a stone carving that could be evidence of precolumbian contact between the old and the new world if he called up everything on precolumbian culture even with maxs speed it would take ten years to sort things out instead yaeger had established what he called a parallel paradigm basically a set of questions that asked the computer in different ways who would be upset by revelations that columbus had not been the first old world representative to set foot in the new world and vice versa a few days ago he started the computers working on the problem but had been too busy until now to call up the findings with the machines working on the main question posed by sandecker he had some time to review the results he said call up parpar the code name he had given the unpronounceable parallel paradigm parpar is ready hiram thanks max who would be upset at revelations columbus did not discover america some scholars historians and writers certain ethnic groups would you like specifics not now would this belief be dangerous no would you like me to pursue a link to the past yaeger had programmed his computers to give short answers so they wouldnt go off on interminable tangents without exact instruction go ahead yaeger said the spanish inquisition had made belief in precolumbian contact a heresy punishable by burning the inquisitors said columbus was divinely inspired to bring spanish civilization to the new world link to vespucci go ahead when amerigo vespucci proved scientifically that columbus had not reached india but had discovered a new continent he was threatened with heresy too why was this so important admitting someone else had discovered the new world would invalidate claims to its riches and weaken power of the spanish state yaeger pondered the reply spain was no longer a world power and its former lands in the americas were all independent countries there was something there he couldnt see he felt like a child who knows theres a monster lurking in the shadows of his closet can hear its heavy breathing and see the green eyes only to have it disappear when he turns the lights on the computer softly dinged the big ben chimes and a hologram caricature of himself smiling appeared processing and printing are complete his animated doppelganger said whew im going out for a beer yaeger spent so much time with this computer it was inevitable that he would program in a few personality traits thanks max im buying he said wondering what he would do if max ever took him up on his offer yaeger went into an adjoining room and retrieved the lengthy printout hed requested as he studied the parpar report on archaeological expeditions his eyes grew wider and he began to repeat the word incredible under his breath he was only partially through the report when he picked up the phone and punched out a number a crisp voice answered if youve got a minute admiral yaeger said ive got something i think youd like to see at eight fortyfive am austin slotted his standardissue agency turquoise jeep cherokee into the reserved space in the underground parking garage at numa headquarters the imposing solar glass building in arlington virginia that housed two thousand numa scientists and engineers and coordinated another three thousand scattered around the globe joe zavala called austins name as he crossed the atrium lobby with its waterfalls and aquariums and huge globe at the center of the seagreen marble floor austin was glad to see that zavala walked with only a slight limp the elevator rocketed to the top floor where admiral sandecker had his suite of offices as they exited the elevator a pair of men stood waiting to enter one was a tall hardbodied man standing sixfootthree with an oaktanned craggy face he had deep opaline green eyes and wavy ebony hair with a touch of gray at the temples not quite as broadshouldered as austin his body was lean and wiry the other man was a contrast he was only fivefeetfour but built with the massive chest of a bulldog his arms and legs were well muscled his hair was black and curly the swarthy face anti walnut eyes betrayed his italian ancestry the tall man stuck out his hand kurt it must have been three months since weve seen each other dirk pitt numas special projects director and his able assistant al giordino were legends within the agency their exploits in the many years since numa was launched by admiral sandecker were the stuff of which adventure novels were written though pitts and austins tracks seldom crossed they had become good friends and had often gone sport diving together austin matched the firm grip when will you two be free for lunch so we can catch up on your latest escapades not for a couple of weeks im afraid were taking off in an hour from andrews air force base where are you headed asked zavala a project the admiral has laid on us in the antarctic giordino answered did you remember to pack your testicle sock zavala said with a glint in his eyes giordino grinned i never leave home without it how about you and joe asked pitt were meeting with the admiral to find out what he has in mind for us i hope youre going into tropical waters austin laughed so do i call me when you get back said pitt well all have dinner at my place ill do that said austin its always a pleasure to view your car collection the next elevator arrived and the doors opened pitt and giordino stepped in and turned around so long guys giordino said best of luck on wherever youre going then the doors closed and they were gone this has to be the first time i havent seen dirk and al limping bleeding or covered with bandages said austin zavala rolled his eyes thank you for unnecessarily reminding me that working for numa can be hazardous why do you think numa has such generous healthcare benefits austin said as they entered a large waiting room whose walls were covered by photos of the admiral hobnobbing with presidents and other luminaries from the worlds of politics science and the arts the receptionist told them to go right in sandecker lounged behind the immense desk made from the refinished hatch cover salvaged from a sunken confederate blockade runner dressed in razorcreased charcoalgray slacks and an expensive navy blue blazer with an embroidered gold anchor on the breast pocket sandecker would have needed only the addition of a white cap to complete his sporty image but sandecker was no yacht club commander he radiated a force field of natural authority forged by thirty highly decorated years in the navy and tempered in the sometimes bruising job as head of a maritime government empire he had built from scratch washington oldtimers said sandeckers commanding presence reminded them of george c marshall general and secretary of state who could walk into a room and without saying a word make it known that he was in charge compared to the burly general sandecker was short and slight of build from his daily fivemile jogs and strict exercise regimen he leaped up as if he had steel springs for legs and came around to greet the two men kurt joel how good to see you lie said effusively grasping their hands in a knucklecrushing grip youre looking well glad you both could make the meeting sandecker appeared trim and fit as usual looking far younger than his midsixties the sharp edges of a van dyke beard whose fiery red color matched his hair and sometimes his temperament could have been trimmed with a laser austin raised an eyebrow there was simply never any doubt that he and joe would show up the feisty founder and director of numa wasnt known to take no for an answer mustering a grim smile austin said thanks admiral joe and i are fast healers of course you are sandecker replied swift recovery is a prerequisite of employment with numa ask pitt and giordino if you dont believe me the scary thing austin knew was that sandecker was only half joking even more frightening was the fact that austin and zavala were eager to take on a new assignment i will be sure to compare contusions with dirk over tequila on the rocks with lime the next time i see him sir zavala couldnt resist the opportunity to have a little fun keeping a straight face he said a couple of invalids like us cant be of much use to numa sandecker chuckled and gave zavala a hearty slap on the back ive always admired your sense of humor joe you could do well as a comic on the nightclub circuit where i understand youve been spending your evenings in the company of young women i imagine theyve been assisting in your recovery private duty nurses zavala answered with an angelic expression that didnt quite cut it as i said joe you missed your calling bantering aside how is the er backside im not quite ready to run a marathon but i threw my cane away days ago sir glad to hear that before we join the others i wanted to congratulate you both on the nereus affair i read the reports job well done thanks austin said captain phelan deserves a lot of the credit he was born too late he would have looked quite at home with a cutlass in his hand taming the barbary pirates im afraid we left his ship in a mess sandecker affixed austin with his cold blue eyes some things have to be done kurt i spoke to the captain yesterday the vessel is winding up its work in the yucatan he feels fine and tells me the nereus is shipshape and bristol fashion once again sandecker used the old term to describe a tight ship he asked me to thank you again for saving his vessel so are you both ready to get back to work zavala swung his hand up in a grand salute worthy of a gilbert and sullivan character shipshape and bristol fashion he echoed with a grin there was a soft knock and a side door in the darkpaneled wall opened a giant of a figure stepped in ducking his head to clear the door jamb at sixfooteight paul trout looked as if hed be more at home on an nba basketball court than as deep ocean geologist on numas special assignments team in fact trout had been offered scholarships at several universities more interested in his height than his brilliant mind as befitted his new england heritage trout was a man of few words but his yankee reserve couldnt hide the pleasure in his voice hi guys glad to see you back weve missed you around here turning to sandecker he said were ready admiral splendid i wont waste time with explanations now gentlemen the reasons for this meeting will soon be made abundantly dear sandecker led the way into a spacious and comfortably appointed conference room adjoining his office austin knew right away something big was in the air the wiry narrowshouldered man seated at the far end of the long mahogany table was commander rudi gunn deputy director of numa and a master of logistics next to him was the s throwback and computer whiz hiram yaeger across the table from the numa staffers was a distinguishedlooking older man whose craggy profile and bristling white mustache reminded austin of c aubrey smith the old movie actor who often played blustering british army officers the younger man sitting beside him was balding and thickset and had a pugnacious jut of his jaw austin acknowledged gunn and yaeger with a nod of his head his gaze bounced off the other men like a stone skipped on water and settled on the woman seated at the far end of the table her blond hair was braided dose to her scalp an arrangement that emphasized her smoky gray eyes and high cheekbones austin went over and extended his hand dr kirov what a nice surprise he said with genuine pleasure its good to see you nina was wearing a jacket and matching skirt whose soft periwinkle tones set off her honeyed skin in the back of his mind austin was thinking what idiots men are when he first met nina she had been beautiful as a lightly clad mermaid now fully clothed with her hidden curves and contours emphasized under snugfitting silk she was absolutely stunning her mouth widened in a bewitching smile its good to see you too mr austin how are you feeling wonderful now he replied the formality of the polite exchange couldnt mask its quiet intensity they held each others hands seconds longer than they should have until sandecker broke the spell with an exaggerated clearing of his throat austin turned to see the bemused expressions of his numa colleagues and his face flushed he realized he was reacting like a dewyeyed schoolboy caught by his girlloathing pals sandecker made a round of introductions the older man was j prescott danvers executive director of an organization called the world archaeological council the other stranger was jack quinn of the east asia foundation sandecker looked at his watch now that weve dispensed with the formalities shall we get right down to business hiram while yaeger fiddled with the keyboard of a macintosh powerbook austin took a seat next to trout as usual trouts appearance was impeccable his light brown hair was parted down the middle as was the style during the jazz age and combed back on the temples he was wearing a tan poplin suit oxford blue shirt and fine of the large colorfully designed bow ties he was addicted to in contrast to his sartorial correctness trout also favored workboots an eccentricity some thought was homage to his fisherman father in reality it was a habit he picked up at the woods hole oceanographic institution where many scientists wore them the son of a cape cod fisherman trout spent much of his boyhood hanging around the worldfamous institution and was offered weekend and summer jobs by scientists who went out of their way to be friendly to a youngster so fascinated by the ocean his love of the sea later took him to the equally renowned scripps institution of oceanography majoring in deep ocean geology thought you were down in the yucatan with gamay austin said it was unusual to see trout without his wife they had met at scripps where she was studying for a doctorate in marine biology and they were married after graduation rudi gunn an old friend from his high school days persuaded paul to come on board as a member of a special team being put together by admiral sandecker paul accepted but only on the condition that his wife went with him delighted that he was getting two topnotch people sandecker readily accepted trouts chin seemed constantly dipped in thought as was his habit he spoke with his head lowered and although he wore contact lenses he peered upward as if over glasses speaking in the nasal twang and broad a of his native cape cod trout said shed been trying for weeks to make an appointment with a vip from the national anthropological museum in mexico city guy couldnt change the date so im here for the two of us sandecker had taken up a post in front of a large rearprojection screen linked to yaegers computer he nodded to yaeger and a second later a map of northwest africa appeared on the screen indicating morocco and using an unlit managua cigar to point to a blinking red arrow sandecker said all in this room are aware of the attack on dr kirov and the disappearance of her expedition he turned to austin and zavala kurt while you and zavala were recuperating two more expeditions were reported missing taking the cue yaeger projected a map of the world on the screen he pointed to three red blinking arrows mr quinns organization lost a group here in china two scientists and their helper have disappeared from india this one is morocco thank you hiram sandecker said dr danvers if you could tell us a little about your organization id be happy to danvers replied rising his elegant voice still bore its pseudobritish prep school imprint the world archaeological council in washington is a clearing house for information having to do with the world archaeological community at any given moment dozens of projects are under way around the globe he said with a wave at the map they are sponsored by foundations universities governmental entities or combinations of all three our job is to collect all this information and dispense it back to them as needed in controlled quantities perhaps you might give us a specific example sandecker coached danvers thought for a moment one of our members a university in this case recently wanted to do some work in uzbekistan with one call to our computer banks we could tell them about all past current and future work in that country provide all the papers published in recent years bibliographies of reference books and names of experts in the field we would have maps and charts information on practical matters such as local politics sources of workers transportation conditions of roads weather and so on sandecker cut to the chase would you also have records of expeditions that have vanished well danvers furrowed his frosty brow not as such it is up to the various members to provide material as i said were collectors and dispensers our material is primarily academic in the uzbekistan example there would be no mention of a disappearance unless the university provided it perhaps warnings that a certain territory might be hazardous on the other hand the information might be there spread throughout the databank but it would be a question of bringing all that together and that would be a monumental task i understand sandecker said hiram would you help us out here yaeger pecked away at the computer one after another red blinking arrows appeared on the various continents he had added about a dozen new sites to the three on the map these are all expeditions that have vanished over the last ten years he said danverss nostrils flared as if he smelled a bad odor impossible he said where did you get the information to make such a preposterous assertion yaeger shrugged laconically i got it from the files of your organization that cant be danvers said you have to be a member of the wac to access our database and much of the information is privileged not even members can move from file to file they have to be cleared after giving their code name this wasnt the first time yaeger heard somebody suggest his electronic babies could barely walk when in reality they could sprint he had long ago learned not to argue he simply smiled scanning the arrows blinking merrily on the map sandecker said i think we can all agree that this goes beyond the realm of coincidence danvers was still dumbfounded that his database had been violated by someone who looked like a cast member of hair well beyond the realm he said doing his best to preserve his dignity my sincere apologies dr danvers sandecker said when i first heard about the moroccan incident i asked hiram to run a survey of similar cases in press reports and to crosscheck them with other information available that he chose your organization to burglarize in cyberspace is testimony to the wacs importance im afraid however that the news is even worse taking the cue yaeger said i ran a scan of archaeological stories in the major publications compared them with your files then kept refining the search separating the wheat from the chaff the past five years was easy things got harder as i got back to the time before people started using computers this survey isnt complete but what i have is pretty thoroughly documented i kicked out all expeditions that didnt have dead bodies or were wiped out by natural disasters he clicked his mouse there was a gasp from danvers the map was lit up like a tunes square neon sign dozens of little red arrows winked on every continent quinns reaction was one of anger thats crazy he said this isnt indiana jones stuff were dealing with for godsakes archaeological digs dont just disappear off the face of the earth without anyone knowing calmly sandecker said good point mr quinn we too were astonished at the number of expeditions that had simply vanished into thin air the public is not indifferent to these events but the incidents have been spread out over decades and at one time it was fairly commonplace for explorers to disappear from public view for years sometimes permanently would we have known what happened to dr livingstone if the intrepid stanley hadnt gone after him but what about news reports quinn said sandecker said from what hiram has explained to me occasionally somebody at a major outlet with resources like the new york times would dig into his morgue and note a similar happening comparing it to a more recent incident when there was widespread publicity such as in the disappearance of a national geographic expedition into sardinia the incident was simply ascribed to bandits or misfortune we can discount a percentage of them floods and volcanoes for instance he paused what i find disturbing is that the trend is on the increase still unconvinced austin leaned forward on his elbows staring intently at the map communications are a lot more efficient now than they were in stanleys day he said could that have something to do with these vanishings i factored that into the equation kurt said yaeger the curve still shows an upswing rudi gunn removed his hornrimmed glasses and nibbled thoughtfully on the earpiece reminds me of a movie i saw he mused somebody is killing the great chefs of europe only in this case it is not chefs and the incidents arent confined to a single continent sandecker said if dr kirovs experience is any indication someone is killing the great archaeologists of the world danvers sat back in his seat his ruddy face now as white as bread dough good lord he said with a hoarse whisper what on earth is happening what indeed sandeckers blue eyes moved from face to face i asked hiram to codify similar elements these disappearances had nothing presented itself on the surface the expeditions were incredibly diverse they varied in size from three people to more than twenty and took place all over the world they were organized by a wide spectrum of groups or individuals there were common denominators however what the police call the mo was the same in all cases before morocco the expeditions simply vanished dr kirovs experience was traumatic but it may be a stroke of good luck in the long run if it can prevent similar disasters we know now that these expeditions did not simply go into thin air that they were wiped out by teams of trained assassins thugee gunn said quietly whats that mean quinn said its where our word thug came from it means thief in hindi what they called followers of the indian cult of kali they would infiltrate a caravan strangle people at night hide their bodies and steal goods the british broke the cult up in the s and it went out of business for the most part one of these latest disappearances was in india nobody who knew gunn was surprised when he produced arcane bits of information the short slight gunn was a sheer genius number one in his graduating class at the naval academy the former navy commander could be enjoying a top staff job with the navy department he had advanced degrees in chemistry finance and oceanography but preferred underwater science to warfare he served in submarines as sandeckers chief aide and when the admiral resigned from the navy to form numa gunn followed in compiling reports and researching he had absorbed much of the wideranging material from the hundreds of books with which he surrounded himself i checked them out yaeger said ninja and hashshashin too youre right there are similarities sandecker didnt dismiss the suggestion out of hand the idea of a secret society of murderers is certainly interesting he said lets put it on the back burner for now while i discuss that other common element as far as could be documented all expeditions victimized in recent years reported finding precolumbian artifacts in unlikely places he paused for dramatic effect and according to hirams findings all were funded to some extent by timequest do either of you gentlemen know anything about this organization sure quinn said our foundation has used them any number of times totally respectable as far as i know you see their ads in all the archaeological magazines theyre known to be pretty generous with grant money theyll fund your expedition if they like it better still theyll send volunteers people who pay for the thrill of working a dig theyre tied in with some of the environmental and retired persons organizations as i say theyre on the upandup danvers seemed to snap out of a deep sleep yes i agree many of our clients have used timequest we have a file on them if that would be helpful ive already checked them out yaeger said ive pulled info in from other sources too directories of nonprofits state and federal agencies that regulate nonprofits bank statements internet theyve got an impressive web site theyre headquartered in san antonio board of directors is made up of nationally known people austin frowned well meaning people have unknowingly lent their names to everything from right and leftwing extremists to organized crime thinking they were pushing a good cause well put kurt sandecker agreed hiram anything to show timequest is a front for extremists yaeger shook his head all the data say timequest is clean so you found nothing out of the ordinary sandecker persisted his perceptive ear detecting an offkey note in yaegers tone i didnt say that admiral theres a ton of information available on the main organization but most of it is slick pressrelease fluff that doesnt really tell you anything when i tried to probe past the pr image i got nothing they blocked access thats the thing not really this is more sophisticated when access is blocked its like not having the key to get into the room i had the key but when i got into the room it was dark and i couldnt turn on the light switch if your electronic hounds couldnt sniff out the trail it must be sophisticated indeed your work tells us something though the organization would not disconnect its light switch unless there were something to hide nina who had been sitting silently throughout the presentation suddenly said gonzalez i beg your pardon sandecker said ive been thinking about what commander gunn said about thugee there was a man named gonzalez on our expedition i mentioned him to mr austin and mr zavala he had come through timequest he was he was just strange in what way dr kirov its hard to say he was terribly obsequious always around looking over your shoulder whenever anyone asked about his background he always had the same story it never varied hed get evasive when you pressed him for details for instance that last day when i asked him about the stranger hed been talking to she paused her brow furrowed in thought i think that had something to do with the attack i read about the incident in your report sandecker said this gonzalez was killed with the others i assume so there was a lot of confusion he disappeared with everybody else so well check over the identification of the bodies exhumed from the excavation and if hes not there hiram will run a trace on him one question austin said timequest was connected with every expedition that vanished in recent years but did some of its expeditions come home perfectly safe ill answer that sandecker said yes there have been many expeditions where the most serious injuries were from sunstroke again those that disappeared had all reported unusual finds or in more specific cases evidence of precolumbian contact what do you make of that dr danvers the archaeological community would certainly scrutinize such claims with the greatest skepticism danvers replied but to say how they might precipitate murder well im simply at a loss surely it couldnt be a string of coincidences unlikely as that may be nina shook her head just as unlikely a coincidence as the precolumbian artifact i found being destroyed and evidence of its existence being erased from the universitys database she turned to yaeger how could that happen yaeger shrugged not a big problem if you know how sandecker checked his watch again weve done all we can do here for now id like to thank you for coming gentlemen and dr kirov well discuss our next step and keep you informed of our progress as the meeting broke up kurt went over to speak to nina will you be staying in the washington area im afraid not she said im leaving right away to start work on a new project well you never know we might be working together someday austin inhaled the faint scent of lavender coming from ninas hair and wondered how much work they would accomplish perhaps we might zavala came over sorry to interrupt sandecker wants us in his office austin bid nina a reluctant goodbye followed the others into the admirals aerie and took up a seat in one of the comfortable leather chairs sandecker was behind his desk he leaned back in his swivel chair and puffed several times on his giant cigar which he had finally lit he was about to open discussion when his eye fell on zavala who was puffing an identical stogie there was little in the known universe that sandecker was unaware of but one of the most enduring and irritating mysteries in his life had to do with the humidor on his desk for years he had been trying to figure out how al giordino lifted cigars from the box undetected sandecker pinned zavala with a steely eye have you been talking to giordino he said coolly in the elevator he and pitt were leaving for a project in the antarctic zavala replied with cherubic innocence we had a brief chat about numa business sandecker quietly harrumphed he had never given in to giordino and he was damned if hed give zavala the satisfaction of knowing he was irritated or flummoxed some of you may be wondering why an agency whose precinct is the ocean and what lies under it is in any way involved with a bunch of desert diggers he said the major reason is that numa has the best intelligence capacity in the world many of these sites were reached by the ocean or rivers that run out to the sea so technically we have a vested interest well gentlemen ideas austin who had watched the battle of the cigars with interest turned his mind to sandeckers question lets go over what we know ticking the points off on his fingers he said there is a pattern to the disappearances people dont simply vanish but are murdered by wellorganized and equipped assassins the expeditions were all linked to art outfit called timequest that seems to have something to hide yaeger interjected could be theyre just hiding assets from the irs and it has nothing to do with the murders we may well find thats the case sandecker said which is why i want you to keep digging explore every possible angle did you ever get any leads on the hovercraft that tried a hitandrun on dr kirov zavala asked slightly better luck yaeger said from your description i narrowed the manufacturer to an english outfit called griffon hovercraft ltd only so many were built of the model you described this one is especially interesting its called an lcac type navy jargon for landing craft air cushion as i recall gunn said thats right its a soupedup highspeed overthebeach version of a commercial model eightyeight feet long two props and four gas turbines give her a speed of forty knots with payload gun mounts for caliber machine guns grenade launcher and m machine gun weve got a few in the us navy why didnt they use their guns to stop dr kirov zavala said my guess is that they were afraid her body would be found there would have been questions have any orders come in from private parties austin asked yaeger only one an outfit in san antonio austin leaned forward thats where timequest has its headquarters right yaeger replied could be coincidence the hovercraft is owned by an oil exploration corporation but the company could be one of a series of dummies its going to take a while to see if theyre linked careless of them to allow the chance of a connection not really austin said they didnt expect any witnesses if theyd been successful with their attack on dr kirov nobody would have known about the killers those on the nereus noticed the hovercraft but it was too far away to see that it was being used for assault and battery sandecker said kurt is right hiram id like you to keep exploring the san antonio connection any proposals on more direct action yes ive been thinking austin said maybe we can make them come to us the trigger in these incidents is the precolumbian angle what if we set up an archaeological expedition and let timequest know weve found something precolumbian then we put on our kevlar jackets and see what happens zavala said he puffed on his cigar like diamond jim brady a sting brilliant sandecker arched an eyebrow zavalas dry wit aside how would we go about doing that sandecker asked it would take weeks perhaps months to organize wouldnt it rudi im afraid so sir there would be a lot to pull together austin couldnt figure why gunn looked so amused at his proposal and the irritation showed in his voice when he said maybe if we really try we can accelerate the process somehow no need to go hellbent for leather my friend sandecker showed his teeth in his familiar barracuda smile while you and joe were laid up rudi hiram and i came up with the same scheme and started things moving everything is in place for reasons of speed and ease of logistics weve set it up in the american southwest the bait will be an old world artifact found on american soil that should attract someones attention consider this a task for the numa special assignments team assignment accepted austin said what about gamay a marine biologist in the desert might be harder to explain the admiral said i see no need to take her away from her work in the yucatan let her know what were up to if we need her she can be on hand in a few hours shes been working pretty hard lately shes probably enjoying the tropic sun on the beaches of cozumel or cancun even as we speak zavala took along puff on his cigar and blew a smoke ring some people have all the luck he said the yucatan mexico the fourth permanemt member of the numa special assignments team would have been the last person to describe herself as lucky while her colleagues enjoyed their airconditioned comfort gamay morgantrout was drenched with perspiration and her usual good nature was ebbing in direct proportion to the rise of the ambient air temperature which was in the eighties and climbing she couldnt believe the humidity was percent without a cloud in the sky arms folded across her chest she leaned her tall willowy body against the jeep parked on the grassy shoulder of the asphalt ribbon that slashed through the lowlying rain forest shimmering water puddle mirages danced on the mottled gray tarmac the desolate spot reminded her of the lonely highway in north by northwest where cary grant gets chased by a crop duster gamay looked up at the pale sky no crop duster only a couple of turkey vultures making lazy circles bad place for hungry buzzards the roadkill pickings must be slim indeed one vehicle had passed in the last hour she heard the old pickup coming for miles it rattled by with its load of halfdead chickens leaving a trail of white feathers in its wake the driver hadnt even slowed down to see if she needed help thinking it was dumb standing out in the sun gamay climbed back into the shade under the jeeps convertible top and took a slug of cooling water from a thermos for at least the third time she unfolded the map professor chi had faxed her from mexico city the paper was damp and limp from her moist hands earlier that morning she had driven inland from ciudad del carmen where the nereus was anchored following the map to the letter through the monotonous flat yucatan landscape paying strict attention to the neatly written precise mileage notations pulling over exactly where the arrow indicated she studied the carefully drawn lines no mistake x marked the spot she was exactly where she was supposed to be the middle of nowhere gamay was regretting having begged off when she and her husband paul got the call to return to washington for an important meeting of numas special assignments team she had been trying to arrange this rendezvous with professor chi for days and didnt know if she would ever have another opportunity she wondered what merited yanking them back to headquarters on such short notice they had joined the nereus shortly after it arrived in the yucatan to take part in the meteorite project paul would be creating the undersea computer graphics that were his specialty gamay would bring in her expertise as a marine biologist it seemed like a very pleasant assignment indeed no heavy lifting then the call came in from headquarters she smiled to herself kurt austin must be back on the scene things tended to happen when austin was around like the shootout shed heard about on the nereus shed call paul when she got back to the ship to see if she should hop a plane home good god she wondered taking in her surroundings why had the professor asked to meet her in this dismal place the only signs of human habitation past or present were the faint grassgrown tire tracks that disappeared into the forest she waved away an insect that strafed the tip of her nose the cutters bug repellent was wearing thin so was her patience maybe she should leave now no she would wait fifteen more minutes if professor chi didnt show she would pack it in and head back to the numa ship she would have to admit that the two hour drive in the rented jeep had been for nothing damn shed never get a chance like this again she really wanted to meet chi he sounded so pleasant on the phone with his american accent and a spanish courtliness wilted by the heat a strand of the long darkred hair swirled up on her head dropped down over her nose she stuck her lower lip out and tried to blow the wisp out of the way when that didnt work she brushed it away checking from habit in the rearview minor she saw a speck in the road the dot grew larger vibrating in the heat waves she leaned out the door for a better look the object materialized into a blue and white bus obviously lost she concluded she withdrew her head and was taking another swig of water when she heard the hiss of air brakes the bus had stopped behind the jeep the door opened and the tomblike silence was shattered by a blare of mexican music that was heavy on decibels and brass instruments the local bus systems all had speakers that must have been left over from woodstock a lone passenger stepped from the bus he wore the standard indian garb a cotton shirt baggy white pants and sandals on his head was a hard straw hat with a slightly rolledup brim like most mayan men he was short barely over five feet tall there was an exchange of rapidfire spanish between the passenger and the bus driver and a waved goodbye the door clunked shut and with a grinding of gears the bus took off down the road like a large rolling jukebox ouch gamay bent forward to slap a bug that had sunk its fangs into her calf when she looked in the mirror again the man had disappeared along with the bus she checked the side minor only the empty highway odd wait movement to her right she froze eyes like black stones were staring at her from the jeeps passenger side dr morgantrout i presume the man had the same softspoken voice with the american accent she had heard on the call from mexico city tentatively she said professor chi at your service he realized that gamay was staring at the doublebarreled shotgun curdled in his arm and lowered it from sight im sorry i didnt mean to startle you my apologies for being late i was out hunting and should have allowed more time juan our driver is a goodhearted but garrulous man who chats with all the female passengers young and old i hope you werent waiting long no thats quite all right this little brown man with the broad nutbrown face high cheekbones and long and slightly curved nose wasnt exactly what she expected she scolded herself for thinking in stereotypes dr chi had lived in the white mans world long enough to recognize the embarrassed reaction the stony expression didnt change but the dark eyes sparkled with good humor i must have surprised you a stranger coming up suddenly like that with a gunlike a bandito i apologize for my appearance when im home i go native i should apologize for my rudeness letting you stand out there in the hot sun she patted the seat beside her please sit in the shade i carry my shade around with me but i will accept your kind invitation he removed his hat revealing gray bangs over a retreating forehead unslung a canvas game bag and climbed into the passenger side carefully resting the shotgun breech open between the seats with the muzzle pointing toward the rear he placed the game bag on his lap from the looks of that bag id say you had a successful hunt gamay said sighing theatrically he said i must be the laziest hunter in the world i stand at the roadside the bus picks me up and drops me off i walk into the forest poppop i walk out to the road and catch the next bus this way i can enjoy the solitary delights of the hunt and the social rewards of sharing my triumphs and failures with my neighbors the hardest part is timing the buses but yes all went well he lifted the game bag two plump partridges gamay flashed a dazzling smile that displayed a slight space between her upper front teeth like the actress and model lauren hutton she was an attractive woman not gorgeous or overly sexy but lively and vivacious in a tomboy way most men found appealing good she said may i give you and your birds a lift somewhere that would be very kind of you in return i can provide you with some liquid refreshment you must be very hot from waiting out here it wasnt bad gamay said although her hair was dearly out of control her tshirt stuck to the seat and her chin dripped with perspiration chi nodded appreciating the polite lie if you could back up and then follow that track for a bit she started the jeep put it in reverse then shifted into low gear and turned off the road the tires followed the dried mud ruts through dense forest after about a quarter of a mile the trees thinned and the ruts gave way to a sunlit clearing dominated by a native shelter the walls of the but were fashioned of sticks and the roof thatched with palm leaves they got out of the jeep and went inside the only furniture was a metal folding table a camp chair and a woven hammock a couple of propane gas lanterns hung from the rafters be it ever so humble theres no card like me casa chi said sounding very much as if he meant every word scuffing the dirt floor with his toe he said this land has always been in my family dozens of houses have stood on this spot through the centuries and the design hasnt changed since the first one was built at the beginning of time my people learned that it was easier to throw a house together every so often than to try to build one that would outlast hurricanes and damp rot may i get you a drink yes gamay said looking around for a cooler thank you id like that follow me please he led the way outside the but to a wellworn path through the woods after a minutes walk they came upon a cinderblock building with a corrugated steel roof the professor opened the unlocked door and they stepped inside chi reached into a dark alcove and rummaged around muttering in spanish under his breath after a few seconds an engine popped into life i turn the generator off when im away to save gas he explained the air conditioner should kick in momentarily a bare bulb went on overhead they were in a small entryway chi opened another door and hit a wall switch fluorescent lighting flickered on to illuminate a large windowless room with two work tables on the tables were a laptop computer scanner and laser printer stacks of paper a microscope and slides and assorted plastic bags holding hunks of stone larger pieces carefully tagged lay here and there manila folders were piled everywhere the bookshelves groaned with the weight of thick texts on the wall were topographic maps of the yucatan peninsula site photographs and drawings of mayan carvings my lab chi said with obvious pride impressive gamay never expected to see a fully equipped archaeological lab in well the middle of nowhere dr chi was full of surprises chi sensed her astonishment people sometimes wonder when they see the contrast between where i live and where i work outside mexico city i require only the barest essentials to exist a place to sleep and to eat a hammock with mosquito netting a roof to keep the rain out but its a different story when you have to work one must have the tools and here is the most important tool in conducting scientific inquiry he went over to a beatup but serviceable refrigerator stuffed the game bag on a shelf and took out two sevenups and ice cubes which he put into a couple of ail plastic tumblers with a sweep of his arm he cleared space among some files and brought over two folding chairs gamay sat down took a sip and let the cool sweet liquid flow down her parched throat it tasted better than a fine champagne they sat a few moments quietly enjoying their drinks thank you dr chi gamay said after accepting a refill of bottled water this time im afraid i was more dehydrated than i thought its not difficult to lose body moisture in this country now that our energies are restored how may i help you as i said on the phone im a marine biologist im involved in a project off the coast oh yes numa s tektites survey near the chixulub meteor impact site gamay cocked her head you know of it he nodded solemnly bush telegraph seeing her puzzled expression he chuckled and confessed i cant lie i saw an email to the museum from numa headquarters informing us of the survey as a courtesy he reached over to a file cabinet opened a drawer and pulled out a manila folder let me see he said reading from the files contents gamay morgantrout thirty years old resident of georgetown wisconsin born expert diver holds degree in marine archaeology from the university of north carolina changed specialties enrolling in scripps institution of oceanography where she eventually attained a doctorate as a marine biologist puts her talents to work for the worldrenowned national underwater and marine agency not a fact out of place gamay said raising a finely curved eyebrow thank you chi said replacing the file in the cabinet my secretarys work actually after you called i asked her to hook onto numas web site theres a complete description of ongoing projects with brief biographies of those involved in them are you any relation to paul trout the deep ocean geographer whose name was also listed yes paul is my husband the site probably didnt mention that we met in mexico we were on a field trip to la paz otherwise id say you did your homework its my strict academic training im afraid i tend to retain details too lets see if i can remember gamay dosed her eyes dr jose chi born in quintana roo yucatan peninsula father was a farmer excelled in his studies sent by the government to private schools undergraduate studies at university of mexico graduate degrees from harvard university where he is still affiliated with the prestigious peabody museum of archaeology and ethnology curator at mexicos national anthropological museum winner of the macarthur award for his work in helping to compile a corpus of mayan inscriptions now working on a dictionary of the mayan language she opened her eyes to see chis toothy grin he dapped his hands lightly brava dr morgantrout please call me gamay a beautiful and unusual name my father was a wine connoisseur the color of my hair reminded him of the grape of beaujolais well chosen dr gamay i must correct something though im very proud of my work on the dictionary but the corpus is actually the work of many talented people artists photographers cartographers catalogers and so on i contributed my skills as a finder a finder st ill explain ive been hunting since i was eight years old ive roamed throughout the yucatan and in belize and guatemala in the course of my wanderings i frequently stumbled across ruins some people say i must carry a ouija board around in my head i think its a combination of the alertness to his surroundings a hunter must have and simple mileage if you walk long and far enough in these parts youll trip over a remnant left by my busy ancestors now tell me what interest does a marine biologist have in the work of a landbound bonedigger i have an odd request dr chi as you noted in my cv i was an underwater bonedigger before i switched to living things my two areas of interest have combined through the years whenever im in new territory i look for ancient artistic renderings of marine life an obvious example is the scallop the crusaders took it as their emblem you can find paintings and carvings of scallop shells dating back thousands of years to the greeks and romans and even before an interesting hobby chi said its not really a hobby although i find it fern and relaxing it gives me an eye into the past before the age of scientific drawings i look at a painting or a carving and get an idea of what a species looked like hundreds or thousands of years ago by comparing it to the creature as it exists today i can see if there has been genetic evolution or mutation im thinking about doing a book on my collection do you know of any archaeological sites that have depictions of marine life im looking for fish shellfish coral any sea creature that may have caught the eye of a mayan artisan chi had been listening intently what youre doing is fascinating and worthwhile because it proves that archaeology is not a dead science of use to no one too bad you didnt mention exactly what you wanted on the phone it would have saved you from coming way out here it was no problem and i wanted to meet you personally im glad you did but the mayas artistic subjects tended toward birds jaguars and serpents chances are that any renderings of sea life will be so stylized that you wouldnt recognize them as anything youd seen in a biology book like those parrot carvings that some people say look like elephants that just makes the subject more interesting i have some time off from the tektites project if you could point me toward some ruins id be grateful he thought for a moment theres a site perhaps two hours from here ill take you there you can browse around maybe youll find something youre sure its not too much trouble not at all he looked at a dock wed be there about lunchtime spend a couple of hours and be back here by late afternoon you could drive to the research vessel while its still daylight that would be fine we can go in my jeep no need to he said i have a time machine pardon she wasnt sure she heard him correctly theres a bathroom in there why dont you freshen up while i pack lunch gamay shrugged she retrieved her rucksack from the jeep then came back inside and rinsed her face and combed her hair chi was closing an igloo cooler when she came out of the bathroom where do i catch the time machine she asked getting into the spirit of things its in the temporal transport module he said seriously leading the way out the door he took the shotgun with him you can never tell when you might run across some birds they went around behind the lab building to a path that led to another native shelter this one had no walls the roof supported by poles at each comer under the palm roof was a blue humvee fourwheeldrive vehicle gamay let out a whoop this is your time machine what else would you call a contrivance that can take you to cities where ancient civilizations once flourished im aware that it looks very much like the civilian version of a military vehicle used in the persian gulf war but that was done on purpose to discourage the curious he placed the cooler in the rear and opened the door for gamay she got in the passenger seat recognizing the airplanelike dashboard instrumentation she and paul owned a hummer back in georgetown designed to replace the jeep its imposing width made it a formidable force in washington traffic and on weekends they werent remodeling their brick townhouse they liked to drive offroad in rural areas the route we came in with the jeep is actually the back way chi explained theres a track here that leads out to the road he got in and started the engine his head barely made it above the wheel this was going to be some adventure gamay thought she leaned back in her seat and said take it to warp six mr sulu warp six it is he said putting the hummer into gear the vehicle lurched forward but if you dont mind first well take a detour through the twelfth century tucson arizona the rugged peak of mount lennon rising from the santa catalina range was visible out austins window as the jetliner made its approach to tucson international airport the landing was smooth and minutes later he and zavala shouldered their duffel bags stepped from the terminal into the hard arizona sunlight and looked for their ride a dusty silver ford f pickup tooted its horn and pulled up to the curb austin who was nearer the truck opened the passenger door and blinked behind the wheel was the last person he expected to see nina kirov nina had exchanged the dressier outfit of the numa meeting for tan cargo shorts and a pale blue shirt can i give you boys a lift she said in a deep southern drawl i never paid you back for that exciting sea scooter ride austin laughed partly to hide his amazement i could say weve got to stop meeting like this but i wouldnt mean it zavalas mouth dropped open when he saw who austin was talking to hi joe nina said if you and kurt throw your bags in the back we can be on our way as the two men tossed their duffels behind the cab zavala whispered with unveiled admiration howd you arrange this one austin grunted noncommittally and gave zavala a knowing wink they got in the cab and the truck joined the traffic leaving the airport as they turned onto tucson boulevard heading north nina said i really should explain things i really do have a new assignment ill be working with you and your team on this project im pleasantly surprised im just curious why you didnt mention your plans when i saw you in washington this morning admiral sandecker asked me not to say anything zavala chuckled welcome to the weird and wacky world of numa nina went on he said you had been out of the picture for a while and he wanted to introduce you to what was going on one brushstroke at a time also he wanted you focused for the meeting and was afraid you might be uh distracted if you knew i was going to be working with you austin shook his head sandecker could always be expected to do the unexpected hes right i would have been totally distracted she smiled he needed an archaeologist to give the project an authentic ring he asked me if i would help i said yes it was the least i could doher voice hardened i want to catch these people whoever they are i can understand your feelings nina but we dont know what were dealing with this could be dangerous i considered that possibility very carefully and at great length the admiral gave me every chance to pull out please dont take this the wrong way but did it ever occur to you that the admiral asked you to be part of this for reasons other than your technical expertise nina glanced at him with serious gray eyes he made it very clear from the outset then you know youre being used as bait she nodded its the main reason im here to try to draw the people who killed dr knox sandy and the others i want them brought to justice whatever the cost besides theres no certainty that theyre even interested in me anymore ive been back in cambridge for weeks and the most dangerous thing ive encountered is the traffic around harvard square nobody in a black suit has jumped out of a closet i havent had any bodyguards to protect me and im still alive austin decided not to tell nina that the bodyguards hed arranged to keep an eye on her were around she just hadnt seen them there was no mistaking the stubborn jut to ninas chin she was determined to see this thing through my stern paternal tone may suggest otherwise but im very glad to see you again the faint scowl nina had assumed during austins lecture was replaced by a smile before long they turned onto the pioneer parkway going toward oracle junction the tract housing started to give way to desert and saguaro cactus zavala whod been listening patiently knew austins mind was working at a couple of levels his professional concerns and his personal ones with his latin heritage joe was a romantic at heart but he could see that sandecker was right about possible distractions he took the pause as an opportunity to kick off the discussion in a more practical direction now that weve got that matter straightened out maybe we could discuss the sting thanks for the reminder austin agreed ruth filled us in but we should go over the details in case he missed something ill tell you what i know nina said when we first started talking it quickly became apparent that the obstacles to pulling together an elaborate plan in a short time were substantial dont know why austin said all you needed was a promising archaeological site a dummy expedition that would look credible people you could count on to dig an amazing artifact to discover and a way to get word of the find out to friends and enemies alike that about sums it up it was like putting together an offbroadway production nina said only we were expecting to do it without a stage actors or script the admiral had given commander gunn the assignment of organizing the sideshow he suggested we piggyback on an expedition that was already in place but this would present its own difficulties austin nodded you would have to waltz into a legitimate dig say were taking over and oh by the way we want to bury a fake artifact because we want to attract a bunch of armed assassins yes that could be a problem a big problem so the commander came up with a proposal that was really a stroke of genius it often is with rudi austin said his idea was to build on a legend the arizona romans zavala chuckled sounds like the name of a soccer team it could be but it isnt back in near an old adobe kiln at the nine mile hole stagecoach stop some people unearthed what looked like a religious cross made of lead and weighing sixtytwo pounds they thought it might have been left by jesuit missionaries or spanish conquistadors the cross was encrusted in caliche a hard crust of calcium carbonate when they cleaned off the concretion they found true crosses fastened together with lead rivets and there was writing on the metal kilroy was here zavala offered kilroy was writing in latin the university of arizona translated the writing and it told an incredible story how in ad seven hundred men and women led by theodorus the renowned sailed from rome and were blown across the ocean by storms they made landfall abandoned their ships and continued north on foot until they reached a warm desert they built a city called terra calalus that prospered until the indians who had been made slaves revolted and killed theodorus the city was rebuilt but the indians revolted again the romans elder a man named jacobus ordered the story inscribed on the cross the romans had ships big and seaworthy enough to make the trip austin said but it sounds more like something out of an old pulp magazine conan the barbarian or amalric the mangod of thoorana zavala added okay you two nina said with mock irritation this is serious stuff as your reaction so eloquently testifies the story is fair game for a skeptic which is what happened back then but they changed their minds when a roman head engraved in metal was found near the site of the cross also covered with caliche an archaeologist at the university organized a dig they found more crosses nine ancient swords and a labarum an imperial roman standard some people became believers others said the objects were left by mormons they came all the way from utah to bury these things austin said nina shrugged there was worldwide controversy some experts said that the depth of the objects and the caliche crust proved they could not have been a hoax unless it was perpetrated before columbus the skeptics found the written phrases were similar to those in latin grammar books someone said the artifacts could have been left by a political exile from the time of maximilian whom napoleon placed on the mexican throne what happened to the artifacts the university decided the project had become too commercial theyve been stored in a bank ever since no money was available to continue excavations i think i see where were going with this austin said after all this time money has been found for the excavation and my guess is it comes out of the numa budget uhhuh were saying that the expedition is being financed by a wealthy backer who wants to remain anonymous this person has been fascinated by the story since he was a child and would like to see the mystery cleared up once and for all magnetometer readings showed some interesting possibilities at an abandoned ranch near the original excavation site we dug there and found a roman relic quite a story zavala said think anyone will buy it we know they will the papers and tv stations have already run articles that have helped to give us credibility when we got in touch with timequest they knew about the project and were eager to help they gave you money austin said we didnt ask for any we did request volunteers they sent two of them in return they asked as was their custom to be notified before the press of any unusual find which weve already done austin was thinking ahead with all this publicity its going to be pretty hard to make an expedition disappear off the face of the earth the admiral talked about that he thinks the public nature of the dig will discourage assassination attempts theyll try to steal or destroy the relic maybe they wont come in with guns blazing but i wouldnt advise standing in their way if thats the case zavala said when did you tell timequest about the artifact austin asked three days ago they asked us to hold off telling anybody else for seventytwo hours which means theyll make their move tonight nina briefed them on the excavation she was the project archaeologist the numa staffs undersea backgrounds were being tweaked to give them more landoriented credentials trout had easily switched into the role of geologist austin would be billed vaguely as an engineer zavala as a metallurgist the truck continued climbing to the high desert country on the fringe of tucson it was late afternoon when they left the main highway and bumped down a dirt road past stands of mesquite chulo and cactus they stopped where two winnebago rvs and several other vehicles were clustered near a crumbling pile of adobe bricks austin got out and surveyed the location old rock walls more or less defined the abandoned ranch the rays of the afternoon sun filtering through the buildup of clouds gave the desert a coppery tint trouts lank form came striding over hand extended he wore khakis that looked as if they had just come off a clothes rack at the gap a button down pinstriped dress shirt and a paisley bow tie that was smaller and slightly less flamboyant than his usual neckwear the only concession to the grunt nature of an archaeological dig were his work boots although the leather looked as if he had just buffed it with a cloth got in from dc this morning with nina he explained cmon ill show you around he led the way behind the ruins of the old hacienda to a low hill where a patch of ground had been staked out into a grid an older couple was working at a framework made of wood and wire mesh the man was shoveling dirt into the screen and the woman was culling out objects trapped by the wire mesh and placing them in plastic bags trout made the introductions george and harriet wingate were a handsome couple who could have been in their late sixties or early seventies but displayed the fitness and energy of younger people they were from washington they said thats the state of washington mrs wingate corrected with a proud smile spokane clarified her husband a tall man with silver hair and beard nice town austin said thank you the husband said thanks too for coming by to lend a hand this archaeology stuff is slightly harder than eighteen holes of golf cant believe were actually paying to do this work oh listen to him he wouldnt have missed a chance like this for the world george why dont you tell them about the indian jones hat you want to buy her husband pointed to the sun thats indiana jones dear like the state just trying to avoid sunstroke he said with a grin that was almost hidden behind his bushy white whiskers after exchanging further pleasantries the new arrivals were led over to the excavation two men were on their knees in adjoining shallow rectangular pits scraping the dirt away with garden trowels austin recognized them as exnavy seals who had been attached to the numa team on previous assignments sandecker was taking no chances these were two of the top men from numas security division the taller man whom austin knew simply by the name of ned had the classic broad shoulders and narrow waist of a bodybuilder the trowel looked like a toothpick in his hand carl his shorter companion was wirier but austin knew from past experience that he was the more deadly of the two hows it going nina said ned laughed okay but nobodys told me what we do if we actually find something i told him to rebury it carl said laconically that may not be a bad idea austin said beats explaining what a couple of numa divers are doing in the middle of the arizona desert hed been going over in his mind what nina had told him about the moroccan incident did any strangers drop by today trout and the other two men exchanged glances then burst out laughing if you mean strange people weve had more than our share its amazing the type of loonies a project like this attracts dunno if youre being fair carl said one guy suggested i look for traces of ufo atlantis connections all seemed quite reasonable to me by the time i got through talking to him about as reasonable as this whole operation austin said with a wry grin anyone else a couple of people showed up with cameras and notepads trout said said they were reporters or from newspapers did they have id we didnt ask seemed like a waste of time if these guys are as organized as we think they are theyd have phony credentials weve had lots of sightseers and volunteers weve told them were just doing the preliminary stuff took their names and said wed contact them everyones being videotaped by the remote surveillance camera on top of that cactus austin was thinking about the battle aboard the nereus when they had to fend off the group of wellarmed attackers as defenders they had the element of surprise and luck but the scars he and zavala bore testified that events easily could have gone the other way even these tough ersatz ditch diggers would be quickly overwhelmed by an attack in force what kind of backup do we have he asked weve got six men in that old gas station just before the turnoff ned said they can be here less than five minutes after they get the signal weve timed them he touched the pager at his belt i punch a button and theyre on their way austins eyes swept his surroundings then scanned the distant mountains strangely for a man of the sea he always felt at home in the desert there were similarities between the two environments the endless vistas the potential for violent weather changes and the pitiless hostility toward human life what do you think joe what way would you come in if you were attacking zavala who had been giving the subject some thought answered without hesitation the road we drove in on offers the easiest access so the obvious line of attack is from the desert on the other hand they might want us to think desert so they can come in on the road depends on their transportation i havent forgotten they used a hovercraft in morocco neither have i a hovercraft might be hard to hide in the open desert looks can be deceiving carl said ive scouted the area around the ranch the terrain out there has got more wrinkles than sun city arroyos washes natural basins you might not be able to hide an army but you could tuck away a hit team big enough to make life interesting and very short austin said so well take the desert have the boys in the general store set up posts on the road after dark anyone backing them up ned nodded uhhuh chopper and another dozen guys armed to the teeth are camped in a wash about three miles from here fiveminute eta for them too five minutes can be a long time austin thought but overall he felt pretty good about the arrangements he looked over at where the spokane couple were hard at work what about our timequest people trout chuckled if theyre assassins its the best damned disguise ive seen we did background checks and theyre legitimate i wasnt thinking about that austin said there should be some plan to protect them if and when trouble starts no problem trout replied theyre staying in a notell motel out on the highway austin turned to nina would i be able to persuade you to get a motel room as well no she said emphatically why does your answer not surprise me if you insist on staying i want you close to joe and me and do exactly what we tell you to do now where is this incredible artifact thats supposed to provoke the attack nina smiled weve got it in the vault ned and carl went back to their work and nina led the way to a metal shed that had been thrown up next to an rv she opened the padlocked door with a key at her belt there was no electricity so they lit a gas camp lamp two sawhorses had been set up inside with thick planks running crosswise on the planks was an object covered with a painters canvas drop cloth trout said its amazing what modern science can do to add years to somethings age the boys at the numa lab cooked up a batch of caliche that would ordinarily take centuries to accumulate he paused for dramatic effect then whipped the cloth off voila austin and zavala stared for a moment at the object illuminated in the light from the lamp then moved in for a closer look austin reached out and touched the bronze surface is this what i think it is he said trout cleared his throat i believe the term its creators used was artistic license what do you think a broad grin crossed austins face i think its perfect he said the yucatan mexico gamay was regretting her star trek comment the humvee hurtled along the narrow twolane road at warp speed chi seemed to navigate with an advanced type of radar since he was too short to see over the top of the steering wheel there could be no other explanation for the ease with which he whipped the wideframed vehicle around potholes and suicidal armadillos the woods on both sides were a verdant blur trying a ploy to slow him down gamay said dr chi how is your mayan dictionary coming along the professor attempted to talk over the loud whir of the heavytreaded tires and the rush of air around the boxy vehicle gamay cupped an ear with her hand chi nodded his understanding his lead foot came off the accelerator and he switched on the ac refreshingly cool air flowed from the vents dont know why i didnt do this before he said thank you for asking about the dictionary unfortunately ive abandoned work on the project for the time being im sorry to hear that you must be busy at the museum his response was an amused glance my duties at the museum are not what id describe as demanding as the only fullblooded mayan on the staff i rate a sinecure i believe they call them noshow jobs in your country in mexico these are timehonored positions that command great prestige im actually encouraged to be out in the field away from the office i dont understand then the dictionary must play second fiddle to the greater need i spend most of my time fighting the looters who are stealing our heritage we are losing our historical artifacts at an alarming rate a thousand pieces of fine pottery are taken from the mayan region every month a thousand gamay said with an uncomprehending shake of her head i was aware you had problems but i had no idea things were quite so bad not many people do unfortunately it is not only the quantity of the stolen goods that is frightening but the quality the traffickers in contraband dont waste their time on inferior work they take the very best codexstyle ceramics of the late classic period ad to command top dollar beautiful pieces i wouldnt mind having some myself she stared out the windshield lips pursed in anger that is a tragedy many of the looters are chicleros who work the chicle plantations a very tough breed chicle is the sap used to make chewing gum in the past when americans chewed less the chicle market dropped the workers turned to looting and we lost more of our culture but its worse now in what way dr chi the chicle market doesnt make a difference now why break your back working in the fields when you can sell a good pot for two hundred to five hundred dollars theyve become used to the money looting is organized groups of fulltime looters are hired by traffickers in carmelita in guatemala the artifacts are channeled there loaded on trucks and taken across the border to belize then by ship or air to the us and europe the artifacts bring thousands of dollars in the galleries and auctions even more from museums and private collectors its not difficult to provide source documentation still they must know many of these artifacts are stolen of course but even if they suspect this they say they are preserving the past thats a lame excuse for erasing a culture but what can you do about it as i said earlier im a finder i try to locate sites before they can belooted i make their location known only when the government can assure me that the sites will be guarded until we get the artifacts out of the ground at the same time i use my connections in the us and europe the governments of the affluent countries are the ones who can bring the traffickers to jail hit them where it hurts by confiscating their property it seems almost hopeless it is he said gravely and dangerous with the stakes so high violence has become commonplace not long ago a chiclero said instead of sending mayan artifacts out of the country leave them alone where they are and bring the tourists in to see them it would mean more money for all not a bad idea did anyone listen to him oh yes his mouth curled in a dark smile someone heard him loud and clear he was killed whoops he hit the brakes the humvee decelerated like a fighter jet deploying a drogue chute and swung to the right in a twelveg turn sorry chi yelled as they bumped over the shoulder and plunged toward the trees i get carried away hold on were going in he shouted over the din of snapping branches and the roar of the engine gamay was sure they were headed for a crash but chis sharp eye had seen what she hadnt a barely discernible opening in the dense forest with the professor hanging on to the steering wheel like some mad gnome the lumbering vehicle crashed through the woods they bounced along for nearly an hour chi followed a route that was entirely invisible to gamay and she was surprised when he announced they were at the end of the track the professor maneuvered the vehicle around taking down at least an acre of vegetation pointed out and switched off the motor time for a stroll in the woods chi exchanged his straw hat for a harvard baseball cap worn with the visor facing backward so it wouldnt catch on branches while he unloaded the packs gamay changed from shorts into jeans that would protect her legs from thorns and briars chi slipped his arms through the straps of the rucksack holding their lunch slung the shotgun over his shoulder and hung the machete from a scabbard tucked into his belt gamay carried a second pack with the camera and notebooks with a quick glance at the surfs position to get his bearings he set off into the woods in a groundcovering scuttle gamay had an athletic figure with long legs small hips and medium bust she was a tomboy as a girl always running with a gang of boys building tree houses playing baseball in the streets of racine wisconsin as a grown woman she became a fitness nut deep into holistic medicine and running and biking and hiking during family fourwheeling trips into the virginia countryside at fiveten gamay was nearly a foot taller than the professor as lithe and fit as gamay was she had trouble keeping up with chi he seemed to melt through branches she had to push aside his quiet passage through the forest made gamay imagine she must sound like a cow crashing through the bushes only when chi stopped to hack away with his machete at vines barring the way did she get a chance to catch her breath on one such halt after they had climbed up a small hill he pointed to broken pieces of limestone layering the ground this is part of an old mayan road raised paved causeways like this run between cities all over the yucatan good as anything the romans built traveling should be easier from now on his prediction proved true although the grass and bushes were still thick the solid underpinning made for easier walking before long they stopped again and chi indicated a low line of fallen stones that ran through the trees those are the remains of a city wall were almost there a few minutes later the forest thinned and they broke out of the trees into the dear chi slid the machete into its sheath welcome to shangrila they were at the edge of a plain about a half mile in diameter covered with low bushes and broken here and there by trees it was unremarkable except for oddshaped steepsided mounds hidden under dense vegetation that rose from the grass between where she and the professor were standing and the tree line on the far side of the field gamay blinked in the abrupt change from shade to bright sunlight its not quite how i pictured utopia she said wiping the sweat from her eyes well the neighborhood has gone downhill in the last thousand years or so dr chi lamented but you must admit its quiet the only sound was their own breathing and the drone of a million insects i think the term is deathly quiet what you see is the area immediately around the main oneacre plaza of a fairsized settlement buildings stretched out for three miles on each side with streets in between once this place bustled with little brownskinned people like me priests in feathered regalia soldiers farmers and merchants wood smoke hung in the air from hundreds of buts no different from my house the sound of infants crying drumbeats all gone it makes you think doesnt it chis gaze was fixated as if the visions in his mind had come alive well he said pulling himself back into the present ill show you why i dragged you into the wilderness stay right behind me there are holes all over the site that drop down to old domeshaped cisterns some of them ive marked i might have a hard time pulling you out if you keep to the paths youll be fine warily eyeing the waisthigh grass to either side of the rough trail gamay loped after the professor as he made his way across the field they came to the foot of a mound covered with thick tendrils of vegetation it was about thirty feet high and sixty feet at the base this is the center of the plaza probably a temple to a minor god or king the summit collapsed which is what has saved the site from being discovered the ruins are all below tree line and dont stick up out of the forest you really cant see this place unless youre standing right on top of it its lucky you were hunting in the vicinity gamay ventured it would be more dramatic if i stumbled out of the woods onto these ruins in pursuit of a partridge but i cheated i have a friend who works for nasa a spy satellite mapping the rain forest saw a vague rectangular spot i thought it looked interesting and took a closer look that was nearly two years ago ive been back a dozen times on each visit i clear away more paths and vegetation from the monuments and buildings there are other ruins in the surrounding woods i think it might turn out to be an important site now if youll come this way like a guide conducting a museum tour chi led gamay along the path to a cylindrical structure that had been hidden behind a heavily grown mound ive devoted my last two visits solely to clearing away this building they walked around the edifice which was built of finely fitted brownishgray stone blocks gamay peered up at the rounded roof that had partially collapsed in on itself unusual architecture she said another temple talking as he worked dr chi cut away the snaking vines that were boldly trying to reclaim the building no this is actually a mayan celestial observatory and time clock those ledges and window openings are laid out so that the sun and stars would shine in according to the equinoxes and solstices at the very top was an observatory chamber where astronomers could calculate the angles of stars but here this is what i wanted to show you he brushed away new vegetation from a frieze about a yard in width that ran around the lower part of the wall then stepped back and invited gamay to take a look the frieze was carved at mayan eye level and gamay had to bend low it was a nautical scene she ran her long fingers over a carving of a boat the vessel had an open deck and a high stern and bow the stem was elongated into what looked like a pointed battering ram billowing from the thick mast was a large square sail there was no boom the rope braids holding the top of the sail fastened to a permanent yard lines sweeping fore and aft to the overhanging stem a double steering oar seabirds flew overhead and fish leaped from the water near the bow the craft bristled with so many spears it resembled the back of a porcupine the weapons were in the hands of men wearing what looked like football helmets other men rowed with long oars that were angled back along the side of the ship there were twentyfive rowers which meant there would have been a total of fifty counting those on the side not visible what appeared to be a row of shields hung off the rail she used the human figures to estimate the approximate size of the craft at more than one hundred feet moving along the frieze she saw more warships and what appeared to be merchant vessels with fewer soldiers the decks crowded with rectangular shapes that could have been boxes for goods men she assumed were ships crew stood in the yardarm hauling on lines to trim the sail in contrast to the helmeted men they wore odd pointed headgear the motifs were varied but this was clearly a flotilla of merchants being escorted by armed protectors chi watched her walk around the building an amused gleam in his dark eyes and she realized he never intended to show her carvings of marine life he wanted her to see the ship scene she stopped at one ship and shook her head on the bow of the boat was a carving of an animal dr chi doesnt this look like a horse to you you asked me to show you sea life have you dated this he stepped forward and ran his finger along the inscribed border these carved faces are actually numbers this one represents zero according to the hieroglyphics that are carved here these ships were pictured about a hundred and fifty years bc if that date is even remotely correct how could this ship be carved with a horses head horses didnt arrive until the fifteen hundreds when the spanish brought them in yes it is certainly a puzzle isnt it gamy was looking at a diamond shape in the sky over the ships hanging from it was the figure of a man what on earth is this she said im not sure i thought it was some kind of sky god when i first saw it but its none i recognize this is a great deal to absorb all at once are you hungry we can come back and look at this again yes fine gamy said as if coming out of a daze she had trouble pulling herself away from the carvings but thoughts were buzzing around in her head like a swarm of bees a few steps away was a round drumshaped stone about a yard high and a couple of yards across while gamay went behind the monument and changed from her jeans to more comfortable shorts shed brought in her pack chi prepared lunch on the stones flat top the professor took a small woven mat and cloth napkins from the rucksack and spread them out over the carved figure of a mayan warrior in full feathered dress hope you dont mind eating on a bloodstained sacrificial altar chi said with a poker fare gamay was catching on to the professors morbid humor if the sharp stub i just sat on is any indication this was once a sundial of course he said innocently actually the sacrificial altar is over there near that temple he dug into the rucksack spam and tortilla rollups handing gamay her neatly wrapped sandwich chi said tell me what do you know about the maya she unwrapped the clear plastic and nibbled a bite of tortilla before answering i know that they were violent and beautiful at the same time she swept her hand in the air that they were incredible builders that their civilization collapsed but nobody is certain why it is less of a mystery than some suppose the mayan culture went through many changes in the hundreds of years of its existence wars revolutions crop failures all contributed but the invasion of the conquistadors and the genocide that followed put an end to their civilization while those who followed columbus were killing our people others were murdering our culture diego de landa was a monk who came in with the conquistadors and was made bishop of yucatan he burned all the mayan books he could find lies of the devil he called them can you imagine a similar catastrophe in europe and the damage it would have done even hitlers storm troopers were not so thorough only three books escaped destruction that we know of so sad wouldnt it be wonderful if more were found one day gamay surveyed the plain from their perch what is this place i thought at first that it was a center of pure science where research was conducted away from the bloody rituals of the priests but the more i uncovered the more i became convinced that it was actually part of a greater plan an architectural machine if you will i dont think i understand im not sure i do either he produced a bent cigarette from his shirt and lit up saying one is allowed small vices with age he took a puff let me start with the micro the frieze and the observatory and the macro the siting i was talking about i have found similar structures at other sites together with other buildings they remind me of a rather large printed electrical circuit gamay couldnt help smiling are you saying that the maya could add computer science to their other accomplishments yes in a crude way were not looking at an ibm machine with endless gigabytes more like a code machine perhaps if we knew how to use it we could decipher the secrets in these stones their placement is no accident the precision is quite remarkable as a matter of fact those carvings so strange the horses head did the hieroglyphics say anything about the inscriptions they tell of along voyage many years before with hundreds of men and great riches have you ever heard the story elsewhere in mayan lore only at the other sites why here though so far from the coast ive wondered the same thing why not at the monuments at tulum right on the gulf come i can show you something that might offer an explanation they packed up and walked to the far edge of the plain where the woods resumed then through the trees and down a gradual slope the air cooled a few degrees and took on a muddy smell as they descended to the edge of a slowmoving river pointing chi said you can see where the banks are eroded higher up which means the river was wider at one point someone on the research ship said there were no streams or rivers in the yucatan true the yucatan is mostly a big limestone slab lots of caves and cenotes where there are holes in the limestone were more south in campeche where the terrain is a little different as you move into the peten and guatemala the big mayan cities are actually located on waterways thats what i was thinking here that perhaps the boat was a ferry between settlements youre right there was a river but i dont think it was large enough for a vessel of that size with the high bow and sides the rugged stem that vessel was made for the open sea there was something else what i first thought were fish are dolphins saltwater creatures she paused whats that the sun had glinted off something shiny in the distance she walked a few paces downstream with chi coming up behind her a battered aluminum pram powered by an old mercury outboard was pulled up onto shore this must have drifted in from somewhere chi was less interested in the boat than in the footprints in the mud his eyes darted into the surrounding woods we must go he said quietly taking gamays hand in a firm grip he led her on a zigzag course up the hill his head moving back and forth like a radar antenna near the top of the slope he halted and his nostrils flared like a hounds i dont like this he said in a hushed tone sniffing the air whats going on she whispered i smell smoke and sweat chickleros we must leave they skirted the edge of the woods then picked up a path that would take them across the plain they were passing between a pair of squareshaped mounds when a man stepped out from around the corner of one of the hillocks and blocked their way chis hand flew to his scabbard whipped the machete out in a blur of metal and held the long sharpedged blade cocked menacingly above his head like a samurai his jaw jutted forward projecting the defiance that had so amazed the spanish conquistadors who fought a bloody war of subjugation against his ancestors gamay marveled at how quickly this gentle elf of a man transformed himself into a mayan warrior the stranger wasnt impressed he grinned showing great gaps in his yellow teeth he had long greasy black hair and a stubble on his face that didnt quite hide the syphilitic scars of his jaundiced complexion he wore the standard mexican campesino garb of baggy pants cotton shirt and sandals but in contrast to the immaculate appearance of the poorest yucatan native he was dirty and unwashed he looked to be a mestizo a cross between spanish and indian and flattered neither group he was unarmed but didnt seem worried about the upraised machete a second later gamay learned the reason for his equanimity buenos dias senor senora said a new voice two more men had come around the other side of the mound the closer one had a barrelshaped body and short arms and legs a high elvisstyle black pompadour of thick hair surmounted a face that looked as if it could have come off a mayan carving he had slanted eyes a wide blunt nose and cruel lips like two pieces of liver the muzzle of his aged hunting rifle was pointed in their direction the third stranger stood behind elvis he was bigger than the other two put together he was clean and his white pants and shirt looked freshly laundered his long dark sideburns were as neatly trimmed as was his thick mustache his belly was round but the thick arms and legs were muscular he loosely held an m and carried a holstered pistol on the wide belt that supported his large gut smiling pleasantly he spoke to chi in spanish the professors eyes went to the m then he slowly lowered the machete and let it fall to the ground next he slipped the shotgun off his shoulder he put it down next to the machete without warning yellow teeth stepped forward and struck chi across the face the professor weighed about a hundred pounds and the blow practically lifted him off the ground and sent him sprawling into the grass instinctively gamay stepped in between the stricken professor and his assailant to ward off the kick she expected would follow yellow teeth froze staring at her with surprise instead of cowering she skewered him with a warning glance then turned and bent to help the professor to his feet she was reaching for his arm when her head was jerked backward as if her hair were caught in a wringer and for a second she thought her scalp was being ripped off she fought for her balance only to be jerked back again yellow teeth had his fingers wrapped in her long hair he pulled her close to him so close that when he laughed she practically gagged at his fetid oniony breath but her whitehot anger drowned out the pain she relaxed slightly to gain slack and make him think she was no longer resisting her head was at an angle and from the corner of her eye she glimpsed his sandal her sneakered foot came down on his instep and she put her whole weight of one hundred thirtyfive pounds into her heel which she gyrated as if she were grinding out a lighted cigarette butt he let out a swinish grunt and loosened his grip gamay could see the blur of his face out of the corner of her eye her elbow swung back in a short hard arc and caught his nose and cheekbone with a satisfying crunch of cartilage he yelled shrilly and she was free she whirled around disappointed that he was still standing he was holding his nose but anger diffused his pain too and he started for her dirty fingers aimed at her throat he was a miserable excuse for a human being but gamay knew she would still be no match for his weight and male strength when he grabbed her she would feint a knee to his groin a streetfighter move he might expect then shed drive her knuckles into his eye sockets and see how he liked that she tensed as he came at her basta the big man who looked like pancho villa had yelled his mouth was still smiling but his eyes glittered with anger yellow teeth stepped back he rubbed his face where a bruise was forming against the unhealthy skin he backed off and grabbed at his crotch the message was dear i got something to give you too he said in english he retreated when gamay took a quick step toward him setting his companions off into gales of dirty laughter pancho villa was intrigued by the fearless reaction of this slender woman he moved forward who are you he said his eyes boring into hers im dr gamay trout this is my guide she said quickly helping chi off the ground chis knowing expression told her that he understood he might face a bleak future if these men knew his identity he adopted a groveling servile attitude the big man dismissed chi with a contemptuous glance and concentrated his attention fully on gamay whatcha doin here im an american scientist i heard about the old buildings and came out to see what they were i got this man to take me here he studied her for a moment what did you find gamay shrugged and looked around not much we just got here we saw some carvings over there thats all i dont think theres much to see pancho villa laughed and said you didnt know where to look i show you he rattled off an order in spanish yellow teeth nudged gamay with the shotgun but backed away when she gave him a fierce look instead he concentrated his anger on dr chi knowing she didnt like it they trekked to the far side of the plain to where the ground was scarred by a dozen or so trenches most were empty except for one filled with pottery at panchos order elvis retrieved two pots from the trench and stuck first one then the other under her nose this whatcha looking for the big man said she heard a sharp intake of breath from chi and hoped the others didnt notice taking one pot in her hands she examined the figures drawn in black lines on the creamcolored surfaces the scene seemed to represent a historic or legendary event the ceramics were examples of the codexstyle pottery dr chi had mentioned earlier she handed the pot back very nice very nice pancho villa echoed very nice haha very nice after a short and vocal conference the looters marched their captives for a few more minutes pancho villa led the way elvis and yellow teeth rode shotgun behind them they headed toward a grassy mound that was partially exposed to show the stones beneath the vegetation pancho walked through a corbeled arch and seemed to disappear gamay saw that the building housed a large orifice in the ground they descended a flight of irregular roughcut steps into the semidarkness to a dank underground chamber with a lofty roof the big man said a few words to chi then they were left alone are you all right gamay asked the professor her voice echoing he rubbed the side of his face which was still reddish where hed been hit i will live but i cant say the same for the animal who struck me and you rubbing her scalp where it hurt gamay said i needed a perm anyhow for the first time a wide grin broke his stony expression thank you i might have been dead if it werent for your intervention maybe gamay said remembering the upraised machete she guessed the professor would have cut yellow teeth down to size she looked back toward the stairs they had come down what did the big man say he says he wont bother tying us up there is only one way out he will have someone at the entrance and if we try to get away he will kill us he couldnt have been more direct than that its my fault chi said glumly i should not have brought you here i never dreamed looters had found this place from the looks of that pottery theyve been hard at work the artifacts in that ditch are worth hundreds of thousands perhaps millions of dollars the big man is the boss the other two are just hired men pigs he paused it was well that you didnt say who i was i didnt know how far your fame had spread but i didnt want to take any chances they knew who you were she looked up at the high roof which was barely visible in the light coming through the entrance where are we its a cenote a well where the people who lived here came for their water i found it on my second trip come ill show you they went in for about a hundred feet the darkness deepened then lightened as they came to a large pool of water the light streamed from an opening in the rocky roof she estimated was about sixty feet high on the far side of the basin was a steep wall that went up to the ghostly glow of the ceiling the water is pure dr chi said the rainfall collects under the limestone and finds its way here and there to the surface through holes like this and underground caves gamay sat on a low ledge you know this breed she said what do you think theyll do dr chi was amazed at his companions calm manner he shouldnt be surprised he reminded himself she had shown no fear defending him and going after the man who attacked him we have some time they wont do anything until they confer with the traffickers who hired them about what to do with an american then what he spread his hands they have little choice this is a lucrative excavation that they wont want to abandon which is what they will have to do if they let us go so it will be better for them if we disappear from the face of the earth nobody knows where we are although they dont know that people might think wed been eaten by a jaguar he raised a brow they wouldnt have been so free in showing us their loot if they thought wed be around to tell anybody she looked around you wouldnt know a secret way out of here there are passageways off the main chamber they either end or descend below the water table and are impassable gamay got up and walked over to the edge of the water how deep do you suppose this is its hard to say you mentioned underwater caves any chance that this comes up someplace else possible yes there are other water holes in the area gamay stood a minute at the waters edge trying to probe the depths with her eyes what are you doing the professor called after her you heard what that creep said he wants a date with me she dove in breaststroked out into the middle of the basin well hes not my type she said her voice echoing in the chamber and with a splash she disappeared beneath the still water nine mile hole arizona for a time austin thought the thunderstorm would hold off festering dark clouds that had been piling up all afternoon in ominous layers had snagged on a jagged peak as austin and nina strolled around the edge of the ranch property they could have been a relaxed couple out for a walk which was the impression austin wanted to convey to any unseen watchers they stopped under the bluegreen branches of a palo verde tree and looked off into the vast stillness rays from the lowering sun cast the wrinkled faces of the mountains in brilliant tones of gold bronze and copper austin took nina gently by the shoulders encountering no resistance as he pulled her toward him so close he could feel the heat coming off her body are you sure i cant persuade you to leave it would be a waste of time she said i want to see this thing through their lips were almost touching and at any other time the romance of the setting would have concluded in a kiss austin looked into the gray eyes flecked with orange from the setting sun and sensed nina was far away her mind with her murdered friends and colleagues i understand he said thank you i appreciate that she gazed at the darkening desert do you think they will come she asked theres no doubt in my mind how could they resist the bait im not sure theyre still interested in me im talking about the roman bust a stroke of genius it was a collaborative endeavor nina said with a smile we needed a model who looked like a roman emperor pauls a wonder at computer graphics he took a file photo simply removed the beard thinned the hair combed it a la julius caesar and substituted a breastplate for the blazer suddenly alarmed she said you dont think admiral sandecker would be angry if he knew we used his face for a model do you my guess is that hed be quite flattered he might have something to say about being memorialized as a mere emperor and the expression is a bit too benign he glanced at the blackening sky looks like were in for it after all the phalanx of dark clouds had broken free from the mountain peaks and was advancing swiftly in their direction the mountains were now a deep umber faint rumbles echoed across the desert the suns rays were frayed and faded after stopping to turn on the interior illumination of the two rvs parked near the shed they made their way in the yellowing light toward the adobe nuns of the ranch house where trout was manning the command post the wingates tired from digging and sifting had returned to their motel early ned carl and zavala had taken up perimeter posts in outbuildings beyond the old corral their positions gave them a clear view of the desert stretching out to the horizon the backup team would move in to secure the road when darkness fell a gust of wind kicked up sand and giant raindrops slapped the ground as austin and nina ducked inside the ranch house trout was in the kitchen the only part of the house that still had a roof rain leaked in through a few holes and rapidly created rivulets in the dirt floor but otherwise the interior was relatively dry and sheltered the ragged opening where the door had been looked out on the rvs the gaps between the adobe bricks provided views in every direction like the peepholes in a castle wall the wind and rain were mere preliminaries a desert electrical storm doesnt simply sweep in and let loose a few desultory bolts of lightning it picks a spot and hovers over it unleashing torrents of rain and crooked bolts of lightning seconds apart or sometimes in multiples it will pound away with a malevolence more common to humans battering the earth like an artillery barrage whose intent is to eliminate the enemy or break his will the nearconstant stroboscopic light froze the slashing raindrops while trout made visual checks austin kept in touch with the guards with a handheld radio he had to shout to be heard over the thunder boomers and the pounding rain the watchdogs had been instructed to call in at regular intervals or immediately if they encountered something unusual the men on the perimeter identified themselves by their own names the six men posted at the old gas station called themselves the a team the chopper crew simply known as the b team was to listen and maintain silence austins radio crackled with what sounded like static but was really rainfall ned to base nothing roger that austin replied come in carl a second later carl ditto taking to heart austins warning to keep messages brief joe answered dittoditto then from the road a team negative the storm lasted most of an hour and when it moved on the premature darkness it had brought with it lingered broken only by lightning flashes in the distance the freshscrubbed air smelled strongly of sagebrush patrol reports continued to come in all was still quiet until a call came in from the road crew a team to base vehicle coming taking positions the teams plan was to use two men to intercept the vehicle two to cover them one would watch the backs of the coverers and the sixth would keep in touch with the others on the radio austin went to the doorway and squinted toward the road the headlights were pinpoints in the dark a minute later car signaled to stop stopping approaching cautiously austin held his breath there was no mason for anyone to visit the site this time of night he pictured the men advancing from each side of the car with guns cocked he hoped it wasnt a diversion while the real thrust came elsewhere he quickly checked in with the other watchers all was quiet on the desert side the road team reported in after several tense moments a team the voice sounded more relaxed base do you know anybody named george wingate yes austin said what about him hes operating the car older man white hair and beard roger that says hes working on your dig thats correct is his wife with him negative hes by himself whats he doing here says his wife forgot her pocketbook left it in an rv bathroom he would have come back earlier except for the storm instructions austin chuckled okay let him in roger that over and out moments later headlights stabbed the darkness as the car made its way along the road the wingates buick pulled up between an rv and the shed the door opened and a man got out wingates tall figure disappeared around the corner of a winnebago a minute later he emerged carrying something under his arm he stopped and did a curious thing he turned toward the ranch house and waved austin was sum it was no accidental gesture then he got into his car and drove off austin turned to nina whod found an old butcher block to sit on she must have seen the puzzled expression on his face problems she said apprehensively no he said to reassure her false alarm a minute later the road team called in visitor gone a team out thanks good job base out trout shrugged maybe tonights not the night austin was unconvinced maybe he said working a muscle in his jaw nobody was surprised when trouts cell phone rang about fifteen minutes later he had been trying off and on to make contact with gamay and had left word for her to call him he pulled the miniature motorola flip phone from his pocket after a moment he said no word would you ask the nereus to let me know as soon as they hear from her yes id be happy to talk to him hi rudi he listened another minute his brow furrowed okay ill brief kurt and get back to you thats odd he said after he hung up rudi had set up a dummy corporation that was coordinating this project phony name with a telephone number at numa headquarters they got a call not long ago from police in montana seems they picked up an older couple wandering down a highway fantastic story of being kidnapped austin was preoccupied with the nonevents of the night so he was only half listening ufos he said i dont think we ought to pass this one off they said theyd been held a couple of days that they were on their way to an archaeological dig in arizona austins ears perked up do the police have a name wingate austins reflexes had been dulled by a combination of the storm and the boredom of their uneventful watch an alarm bell started jangling in his skull damn he snapped paul get that chopper out here in a hurry and pull the a team into the site he bolted out the door he was halfway between the ranch house and the rvs when the shed went up in a yellowishred ball of flame he hit the ground bellyfirst covered his head with his hands and buried his face in the wet sand the propane tanks on the rvs went off in secondary explosions that rocked the earth and turned night into day glowing pieces of metal fell from the sky but the wind left in the storms wake carried most of it away and only a few hot sparks singed the backs of his hands the patter of falling debris finally halted he raised his head and spit out a mouthful of sand the rvs and the shed had vanished in their place was a crackling fire the ground around the blaze was covered with glowing red embers when he was sure the explosions had stopped completely he got up and walked closer to the burning rubble which was all that remained of the rvs and the shed trout and nina came running up kurt are you all right nina said apprehensively im okay austin looked at the blazing pyre and wiped a few more grains of sand off his tongue but i prefer my fireworks on the fourth of july carl ned and joe arrived seconds later then moving shadows materialized from every direction the a team was running in with no attempt to stay out of sight their confused yells were drowned out by the whupwhup of the helicopter rotors the chopper pilot saw the rotors fanning the blaze and scattering sparks so he hauled off and landed near the ranch house circuits were rapidly connecting in austins brain paul do you have the number of the motel where the wingates are staying yes its on my cell phones memory give the motel a call see if theyre still there trout punched out a number and asked to be connected to the wingates room he turned to austin ive got the night manager he says mr wingate paid up but their car is still there hell go down and knock on the door the manager came on the phone again after a few moments calm down sir trout said calmly listen to me call the police dont touch anything in the room trout clicked off and turned to austin the manager knocked on the wingates unit but didnt get an answer he tried the door it was unlocked and he went in then was a body in the shower a woman mrs wingate austins jaw hardened any sign of mr wingate no the manager says he must have hitched a ride with somebody ill bet he did whats going on nina said cant explain now well be right back leaving zavala to see if he could create some chaos out of order austin and trout dashed for the helicopter a minute later the chopper was airborne again they flew out to the highway followed it to the bright neon motel sign and came down in the parking lot the police had already arrived and were checking the room austin flashed his id identifying himself vaguely as being with a federal agency hoping they would think he was fbi explaining what numa operatives were doing at a murder scene would have been a long story the police didnt look too closely at his id impressed as they were by his sudden arrival from the heavens flanked by a tough looking swat team mrs wingates body was crumpled in the shower stall she was wearing a pink terrycloth robe as if she had just come from the shower when she was killed and shoved back in the stall although there was no blood her head was at an odd angle austin went outside where trout was talking on his phone to numa headquarters again the wingates sent in photos with their original application trout said the motel must have a fax austin said they went to the office and trout introduced himself as the one who had originally called him on the phone the manager said he had a fax practically brand new and gave trout the number he relayed it to numa and within minutes the pictures came through the elderly couple in the photos bore no resemblance to either wingate dead or alive austin and trout quizzed the manager a plump balding man in his fifties he was still shaken but turned out to be a good witness years behind a desk dealing with people had given him a sharp eye for detail saw the wingates come back late in the afternoon and go into their room he said then came the storm wingates car left as the rain was letting up then it came bark after a while wingate went to his room and a short time later dropped by the office and paid cash almost didnt recognize him the manager said why is that austin said hell he had shaved off his beard dont know why hed do that you could see his scar make believe i dont know what youre talking about austin said with his finger the manager drew an imaginary line down his cheek from his eye to the corner of his mouth a long one from here to here austin and trout talked to the manager until the police came in to question him then they got into the helicopter and at austins direction the pilot made a sweep of the roads around the excavation site they saw dozens of headlights but it would have been impossible to know which vehicle wingate was riding in or even whether he was in a vehicle they headed back to the ranch where the glow of the fire could be seen for miles austin filled nina and zavala in on the scene back at the motel mrs wingates murder and her husbands disappearance i cant believe mr wingate was one of them she said thats why he got away with it it only took him a second to plant the bomb in the shed cool customer whoever he is he did it right under our noses she shuddered but who was that poor woman we wont know for a while maybe never he paused ive been thinking about wingate or whatever his name is he gave that come get me wave just before the bomb went off theres something else he didnt have to shave off that beard right away he could have left in his disguise and done it later it was almost as if he were taunting us or showing his contempt zavala tried to put the best fare on the situation at least the admiral wont hear we were playing fast and loose with his noble profile he probably already knows joe yeah i guess youre right zavala put his hands on his hips and surveyed the glowing ashes now what the others can keep an eye on this place well head into tucson and flop somewhere then fly back to washington in the morning these boys were a lot smarter and more organized than we gave them credit for zavala said they learned from the bloody nose we gave them on the nereus tie score austins eyes gained their glacial coldness lets see who picks up the match point the yucatan mexico the pressure against gamays ears told her internal depth gauge she was more than thirty feet under the black water she swam back and forth like an aquarium fish foraging for food moving higher with each zigzag traverse her hands explored the slimy surface of the unseen wall touch substituting for sight the previous year she had taken up free diving as a change from scuba she enjoyed the unfettered feeling of diving without cumbersome scuba gear and had built up her lung capacity to more than two minutes the limestone face was pitted with ruts cracks and small holes no opening big enough to offer a way out she surfaced swam across the pool and pulled herself up on the edge to rest and catch her breath chi read the disappointment in her face nothing mucha nada please pardon my spanish she wiped the water from her eyes and looked around the cavern you said there are some passages off this chamber yes ive explored them they are all dead ends except for one which is blocked by water do you have any idea where the waterfilled tunnel leads my guess is that it is like the others ending in small basins that fill or not according to the water table what were you looking for in the pool gamay pulled her hair back and wrung out a half pint of water i hoped to find an opening that might lead to another cave or come out above the water level ill be right back she rose and padded to the stairway that led to the cave entrance quietly climbed the stairs and disappeared over the top a few minutes later she returned no chance of sneaking up on the guard she said chagrin in her voice theyve blocked up the entrance with boulders nothing we couldnt move but hed hear us if we tried with her hands on her hips gamay again inspected their prison her eyes finally coming to rest on the shaft of light shining through the ceiling hole high above the pool chi followed her gaze the ancients dug that hole to lower buckets into the cenote it saved them going up and down the stairs every time they wanted to whip up a bowl of soup its offcenter she noted and indeed the opening was close to one wall st they had no way of knowing when they dug from above where the exact center of the pool was it didnt make any difference as long as they were able to lower a rope and fill their buckets gamay walked to the waters edge and peered up at the opening vegetation had grown around the hole and worked its way into the chamber cutting back on the light that looks like a vine dangling down chi squinted at the domeshaped ceiling there may be more than one vine my eyesight isnt what it used to be it was gamays turn to squint the professor was hardly ready for a white cane she decided even with perfect vision she could barely see the second vine she lowered her eyes much of the wall was in shadow no reason to assume that it was any different from the underwater wall she had explored its hard to tell in the poor light but from here that wall looks easier than some of the rock faces ive climbed in west virginia too bad we dont have some crampons and a pickax she laughed heck id even settle for a swiss army knife chi stared thoughtfully into space for a moment maybe i have something better than a swiss army knife he reached under his shirt slipped a leather thong over his head and handed it to gamay in the dim light the pendant dangling from the cord looked vaguely like the head of a bird of prey gamay cradled the object in her palm the green eyes sparkled even in the faint cavern light and the white beak seemed to glow beautiful what is it an amulet kukulcan the storm god he was the mayan equivalent of the aztecs quetzalcoatl the feathered serpent the head is made of copper with jadite eyes the beak of quartz i carry it for good luck and to cut cigars the round base fit her hand she fingered the short blunt beak tell me dr chi how hard is limestone its made of calcium carbonate and ancient seashells hard but crumbly as you would expect i was wondering if i could chip hand and footholds in that wall enough to get me within reach of those vines she wasnt sure what she would do once she escaped from the cave but shed think of something its possible quartz is almost as hard as diamond in that case id like to borrow this little birdsnake for a while be my guest he said the power of the gods may be necessary to free us from this dungeon gamay eased back into the water and swam across the pool then along the wall to a slight bulge in the limestone holding on to the ledge with one hand she reached up and found a hole big enough for her fingers using the amulet as a crude adze she chipped away until the space was big enough to give her fingers a grip then she pulled herself up so her knee was balanced on the ledge and chipped another hole somewhat higher once she was able to stand to her full height the work went quicker she inched up the face of the wail clinging to the sheer rock face with her face pressed against the hard surface gave her an intimate knowledge of the limestones character as she suspected the wall was cracked and gouged she used natural handholds or simply enlarged existing holes her hair was covered with powdery white dust she had to stop occasionally to wipe her nose on her shoulder one good sneeze would blast her into space how did spiderman make it look so easy she would have given anything for a couple of spideys webshooting wrist bands hanging on was tough in itself what exhausted her the most was having to work with her arm extended over her head her shoulder ached and often she had to let her numbed arm dangle until the blood came back into it she wondered if she would ever work the kink out of her neck halfway up the wall she looked down the white smudge of chis shirt was barely visible in the gloom hed been watching her progress are you all right dr gamay he said his voice echoing she spit out a powdery gob unladylike but who cares piece of cake damn she wished that yellowfanged cretin hadnt stolen her wristwatch before stuffing them underground she had lost track of time the light coming into the cave was more slanted and dimmer than when she started the sun must be setting the tropical night fell with the swiftness of a guillotine blade soon the cave would be pitch black making a grab for the vines would be tough even with light to see them by in the darkness it would be impossible dr chi must have sensed her doubts again his encouraging voice came from below calmly telling her that she was doing fine that she was almost there and all at once she was there where the ceiling curved into the domed roof she swiveled her head slowly and saw she was level with the tips of the vines she moved higher to give herself the margin of error she needed if her leap was to succeed now she was under the curving wall the strain was telling on her tired fingers she had to move fast or not at all another quick glance the vines hung about six feet out from the wall think your moves through but be fast she mentally rehearsed spring off the wall twist her body in midair grab a vine and hold on as she told the professor pieceacake her fingers felt as if they were being torn from her hands she angled her shoulder away from the wall no more time now she took a deep breath and leaped she spun around as her body described a parabola her hands reaching hungrily for the vine brushed then caught it dry and brittle she could tell from the stiffness that it wasnt going to hold her weight snap grabbed with her free hand for the other vine felt it break and fell still holding the useless pieces of vegetation she hit the water no time to move her feet or head around for a clean dive she landed on her side with a sickening splat when she broke the surface her left arm and thigh stung from the impact she bit back the pain and swam in an awkward sidestroke to the edge of the pool chis hand surprisingly strong took her by the wrist and helped her out of the water she sat for a moment trying to rub die sting out of her thigh are you all right im fine she said between gasps the fall had knocked the air out of her phooey after all that work she handed the amulet back to chi guess the gods had other plans for us from what i saw they would have had to give you wings i would settle for a parachute she broke into laughter i must have been quite the sight flying through the air holding on to these things she tossed aside the useless vine fragments clutched in her hand i dont think tarzan need fear any competition dr gamay nor do i tell me again about the passageway the one with water in it the professor took her hand come he said the chamber was almost totally in darkness and chi could have been leading her into the jaws of hell for all she knew at one point he stopped and a second later the flame from his butane lighter flared and threw grotesque shadows on the rough walls watch your head chi cautioned leading her into a passageway the ceiling gets lower but we dont have far to go after a few minutes the tunnel eventually widened and gave gamay more headroom the passageway sloped down slightly abruptly ending in a blank wall below the wall was a small pool the tunnel dips below the water table here chi explained whether it goes up or down after that i dont know but its not impossible that this tunnel might lead to the surface si the ground of the yucatan is simply a limestone slab honey combed with natural caverns and tunnels carved out over the eons by water action gamay shivered not so much from the cold and damp but at the claustrophobic prospect of swimming into the waterfilled earth she willed her fears away but some lingered professor chi i know this is a long shot im going to see if this leads anywhere i can hold my breath for about two minutes which will give me time to swim a fair distance it is very dangerous not any more so than waiting for those jokers up above to decide when theyre going to wall us permanently into this place after my dentally challenged friend has some fun of course chi didnt argue he knew she was right well she said time for a dip she slid into the pool and started a sequence of noisy hyperventilation exercises to fill her lungs with oxygen when she had absorbed air to the point of dizziness she ducked underwater and scoped out the tunnel opening she rose to the surface and reported her find to chi it angles down but i dont know how far it goes he nodded make sure you allow enough air to return chi leaned over and handed her his butane lighter you may need this where youre going gamay was already into her deep breathing exercises so she tucked the fighter into her shorts gave him the okay sign and dove into the blackness counting seconds off in her headone chimpanzee two chimpanzeelike a child estimating the closeness of lightning she swam just below the ceiling she had decided to push herself to the limit swimming forward for nearly two minutes she could cover thirty or forty yards before having to turn around for a lung bursting dash back as it turned out she didnt have to burst her lungs at all she was barely past her sixtieth chimpanzee when the ceiling angled up sharply and her extended hand broke out of the water followed an instant later by her head she exhaled and took a tentative breath the air was musty but good gamay couldnt believe her good luck about time they got a break the tunnel must dip then come up like the waterseal trap under a kitchen sink she was familiar with plumbing from the almost constant renovation work around her georgetown house she laughed at the thought of swimming in an oversized drain but her mirth was also prompted by relief the sound of her voice echoed in the darkness quickly sobering her with the reminder that she wasnt out of this mess yet not by a long shot she dug chis lighter out of her pocket and held it high statue of liberty fashion after several tries the lighter flint sparked and the flame hissed into life treading water gamay pirouetted and saw that she was at the bottom of a steepsided circular hole she sidestroked around the perimeter thinking this is what it must feel like to be a kitten down a well how on earth would she climb these sides she didnt relish a repeat performance of her icaruslike plunge into the cenote she floated over to a shelflike waterlevel protuberance and raised the lighter there was another ledge a short distance above the first her heart raced with excitement steps there might be a way out of this pit after all losing no time she pulled herself out of the water and climbed the steps that spiraled around the inside of the stone cylinder soon she was over the rim of the well using the lighter again she explored her surroundings she was in a small cave her eye fell on the narrow furrow in the stone floor and she followed it to a low ceiling passageway she held the lighter dose to the opening and watched the flame flutter air was blowing through stale and warm but still air within seconds she was back in the well she hyperventilated a few times then swam back the way she had come surfacing she blurted i think i found a way out the professors voice answered in the hollow darkness dr gamay i was afraid you were gone for good so much time had passed sorry to keep you waiting waitll i show you what i found can you swim i used to do laps every day in the harvard pool he paused how long will i have to hold my breath just the other side of the wall you can do it they found each others hand and chi splashed into the basin with their heads close together gamay instructed him in breathing exercises between breaths he said i wish now my ancestors were incan rather than mayan pardon large lung capacity from the thin mountain air im basically a flatlander youll do fine even for a flatlander ready id prefer to wait until i grow gills but since thats not possible vamanos he squeezed her hand in signal gamay sank beneath the surface quickly found the continuation of the tunnel and practically yanked the professor through the passageway the journey took less than half the time of her earlier trip but the professor was huffing and puffing when they surfaced and she was glad the distance wasnt any greater she flicked the lighter the professors head bobbed a few feet away he was sucking in big gulps of air somehow he had managed to keep the baseball cap on his head steps are over here gamay said towing him behind her she helped him to the top of the well looking around chi said my guess is that the inhabitants of the city used this well as an emergency supply when the cenote and the river dried up after the rainy season chi got down on his knees and peered into the well when the water was high they could simply dip into it with their vessels when the level dropped completely out of their reach they carved the steps like that coffee commercial good to the last drop he stood and traced the track in the floor the marks of many feet he said in wonder gamay was as interested in ancient civilizations as chi but the lighter flame was growing smaller and dimmer when she pointed this out to the professor he picked up several pieces of charred bark from the floor and wove them into a serviceable torch that cast off smoky flames castor oil plant he explained back on his dry land element he took the lead well dorothy shall we follow the yellow brick road he said with an airy wave of the torch glancing back to make sure gamay was behind him chi ducked through the opening in the wall and into a rough tunnel chis head comfortably cleared the low sootencrusted ceiling but gamay had to bend over as she ascended the crooked and steeply pitched passageway after only a few minutes the tunnel ended abruptly at the bottom of a narrow shaft gamay could stand again a crude ladder led up the shaft chi tested the rungs pronounced the ladder rickety but safe and climbed to the top of the shaft where he knelt at the rim and held the torch as a beacon for gamay the ladder miraculously held and gamay joined him at the opening of another passageway this one led to a cavern about twice the size of the cave with the well in it and like that chamber there was only one way out the tunnel was about a yard wide and slightly more than that tall they navigated the twists and turns of the gradually ascending passageway on their hands and knees the enclosed space would have been hot and stifling even without the smoke and heat from the torch and at times gamay found it hard to breathe it was difficult to tell length and direction but she guessed that the tunnel ran for about sixty feet doubling back on itself at one point she had been crawling with her head down glancing upward from time to time to make sure she didnt get too close to chi although that was unlikely he scuttled through the tunnels like a mole rat the torchlight vanished unexpectedly and she bumped into the professors legs she stood to see what the holdup was wait chi said and put his arm back for emphasis he seemed frozen in place in the torchs light gamay quickly saw why the tunnel had ended at a ledge overlooking a yawning chasm three logs had been laid across the abyss the early engineers who built the span had reinforced it with cross supports and thoughtfully attached a pole for a railing on one side ill go first chi said gingerly he put his weight on a log and when it held he pressed forward a quick few steps and he was across its not exactly the golden gate he said apologetically but it seems to be fine the word seems hung in the air and overshadowed the rest of the reassuring sentence gamay balefully eyed the crude span she really didnt have any choice reassuring herself that she only weighed thirtyfive pounds more than the professor she tripped across the bridge like a highwire walker it was steadier than she anticipated and the rough logs didnt roll still she was glad when she reached chis outstretched hand and put her foot back on solid rock well done he said guiding her to another shaft leading upward gamay almost panicked when she didnt see a ladder but chi pointed out the steps worn into the wet and slippery rock they were barely big enough for her toes andfingers and she had to use every bit of rockclimbing muscle and skill the infrastructure around here was made for slightly built mayans not tall anglos she grumbled to herself at the top of the shaft was another low tunnel gamays throat felt like the sahara desert on a hot day her climbing swimming and crawling exertions were catching up with her her eyes stung from cinders and her knees were raw from crawling at one point she and the professor had to squeeze through broken rock gamay might have stopped for good had it not been for an exultant shout from the professor dr gamay were out seconds later they stood in a chamber so large the light from the torch wasnt bright enough to illuminate the high ceiling she rubbed the soot from her eyes were those columns she borrowed the torch only to laugh softly when the light fell not on columns but on huge stalactites the cavern was irregularly circular passages branched off from the chamber one opening was semicircular in shape and twice as tall as a man in contrast to the rough opening they had just come through the portals were smooth and even the surface of the floor unexpectedly flat you could drive a car through this gamay exclaimed there are legends of underground highways that ran between villages i always thought they were simply exaggerations that some of the locals had seen natural tunnels and mistaken them for artificial ones but this they were brought to a halt where a section of fallen roof blocked the way and turned back to the main chamber stopping first to explore a side passage they entered a miniature plaza whose rectangular tiled floor was surrounded by real columns not stalactites the vaulted ceiling was smoothed and plastered as was the wall which was adorned with murals of red figures in profile incredible gamay said is this some sort of underground temple chi walked along the walls squinting at the figures whose paint seemed as fresh as if it had been applied the day before the figures are mayan but then again they are not the professor whispered pictured was a procession of profiled figures carrying goods on shoulders and heads vases baskets of bread gold containers odd shapes that could have been ingots the boats again gamay pointed out merchant ships and war vessels similar to those carved into the walls of the structure chi showed her earlier a whole story unfolded as they walked along the walls ships coming in unloading the goods being taken off in procession even a painting of a man holding a list obviously a teller soldiers standing guard it was an ancient documentary of some great event or events their attention turned to the center of the room and a large round stone pedestal supported by four heavy columnar legs on the table was a cut box of purplish crystalspecked stone similar in appearance to the temple structures on the summits of mayan pyramids gamay bent low and looked through the square opening in the side of the box theres something inside she said she reached in with trembling fingers lifted out the object and set it on the mirrored surface of the table chi had found more castor branches to replenish the torch and it burned brighter than ever the device for that is surely what it was consisted of a boxy wood housing inset with a metal wheel which in turn was strengthened with cross braces within the wheel was a large gear that apparently rotated around a central axle and meshed with its teeth were several smaller gears what is it gamay said a machine of sorts it looks like no it cant be dont keep me in the dark dr gamay well it resembles something ive seen before an artifact taken off an ancient shipwreck made of bronze as this appears to be but terribly corroded it was thought to be an astrolabe a navigational device to determine the attitude of the sun and stars someone did a gamma radiograph they found gear ratios that related to astronomical and calendar data it was far more complex than a simple astrolabe there were thirty gears all enmeshed even a differential gear it was basically a computer a computer where did you see it she paused at the national museum in athens chi stared at the machine impossible professor could you give me a little more light here where these scratchings are chi brought the torch so dose the flames almost singed gamays hair but she didnt care i dont know much about mayan writing but this isnt it it was chis turn to examine the inscription impossible he repeated but with less conviction gamay looked around the chamber this whole thing this cloistered basilica your underground freeway theyre all impossible too we must get this analyzed as soon as we can im with you on that one theres a slight problem oh yes chi said remembering where they were but i think were almost out of the caves gamay nodded i felt the fresh air too chi tied the front of his shirt into a makeshift sack to carry the artifact and they headed back to explore the main chamber an enormous wooden ladder almost perpendicular in its steepness soared into the darkness above the ladder was made of barkcovered saplings logs really about as thick as a mayans thigh and approximately twelve feet wide the saplings were lashed to tree trunks that were braced horizontally at right angles against the face of the rods running up the center of the ladder was a partition that acted as a hand railing the ladder was an impressive engineering feat but time had taken its toll some of the round steps had slipped and hung at angles in places supports had snapped and the ladder sagged the wood seemed sturdy enough to gamay the fact that the steps and bras were lashed together with vines bothered her in her sorry experience vines dried cracked and broke her confidence was not inspired when the bottom step detached itself from the ladder as she put her weight on it chi craned his neck toward the invisible summit of the ladder well have to approach this scientifically he said examining the construction this whole thing could fall at any moment the support up the middle may give it some stability it would be something to hang on to maybe you should go fast if it holds for you there should be no problem with me gamay appreciated chis gesture although she didnt agree with it your chivalry may be misplaced dr chi your dances of making it to the top are better than mine if i go first and the ladder breaks youll never get out of here on the other hand the ladder could break under my weight and wed both be out of hick stubborn mayan okay i promise to go on a diet later gamay stepped carefully over the bottom rung to the second sapling and gradually put her weight on it the rung held reaching up for higher rungs so as to spread her weight she began to climb she purposely avoided looking at the vines fearing that they might part from the pressure of her glance about six rungs up she stopped the air is coming down the ladder she said brightly once were at the top we should be home free she took another step the ties snapped on one side and the end of the sapling came free to hang at a slight angle gamay froze afraid to breathe nothing else fell as slowly and deliberately as a tree sloth she resumed her climb the ties held until she got midway where the ladder sagged putting further stress on the suspension another log snapped free and dangled off to one side one horizontal support came completely loose and crashed to the cave floor she was sure the ladder was about to collapse yet it stayed intact when the swaying stopped she resumed her climb she could have been on the ladder fifteen minutes or fifteen hours it was hard to tell but she made steady progress without mishap until she was only a few rungs from the top good god she thought looking down the ladder must be almost ninety feet high she had left the light from chis torch behind long ago from where she was perched it looked like a distant star gamay reached up and to her great relief felt stone instead of tree bark even more carefully than before not wanting to kick a log free she slithered over the rim to safety she lay on her back and offered thanks to the mayan ladder builders then rolled over on her stomach and called softly down to chi the torch waved back and forth and went out chi was on his way up and would need both hands free she didnt really think hed have any problem until she heard the noise calunk then clunkityclunk in her minds eye she could see the thick loglike saplings break loose and tumble to the bottom of the ladder she expected that would be the end of it but then she began to hear more dull dunks a terrifying sound because it indicated that the incident hadnt ended with one log a chain reaction was under way if she had weakened the vines with her weight it would require only a slight pressure to snap the supports and send the rungs crashing to the floor more thumps and dunks echoed in the darkness the noise grew louder it was evident from the racket that rung by rung the ladder was collapsing she lit the cigarette lighter and held it over the edge maybe the tiny flame would show chi how close he was to the top that is if he werent buried under a massive log pile chis voice called out hard to tell against the racket how far away your hand she reached over the rim and shouted encouragement something brushed her fingers she had no idea he was that close grab hold she yelled again she felt a touch forgers clawing fording her slim wrist and locking on her hand doing the same with his wrist she rolled over using the leverage provided by her body pulling chi up to where he could grab the edge with his free hand something was wring wait wait far what chi was fumbling finally after agonizing moments when she thought she was going to lose him chi gripped her forearm with both hands and got first one leg then the other onto solid rock a choking cloud of dust rose from the cave it cleared several minutes later and they peered over the precipice nothing was visible in the inky pit the ladder collapsed below me when i was about halfway up chi said i was fine as long as i kept ahead of the falling logs but they started to catch up it was like climbing a down escalator why did you tell me to wait he patted the front of his shirt the knot was coming loose i was afraid id lose the artifact chi looked with wonder over the edge they dont make ladders the way they used to gamay broke into a gale of laughter no i guess they dont cooled by a stream of fresh air they dusted themselves off and followed the apparent source of the breeze which got stronger as they headed along a wellbeaten path through a large winding tunnel the buzz of insects grew louder they climbed a short flight of stairs and stepped through a narrow opening into the damp warm night gamay drew air deep into her lungs and let it out expelling the dirt and dust the moonlight cast the old city plaza with its strange slumbering mounds in a pewter light with chi leading they set off to work their way toward the path that would take them to where they left the humvee weeks seemed to have gone by since they had arrived here the pair moved cautiously from mound to mound they were near the edge of the woods when they saw what looked like a convention of fireflies only these pinpoints were not blinking on and off they were steady fanning out across the old city plaza gamay and chi realized simultaneously that their escape had been discovered and that the threesome who had imprisoned them had been joined by others they began to run a gravelly voice growled in spanish and a blinding light flashed in their eyes then they heard a nasty laugh that told gamay she had been reunited with her old friend yellow teeth he sounded highly pleased with himself he ran the beam slowly down the front of gamays body letting it linger on selected spots before bringing it back to the leveled barrels of the professors shotgun which he held at waist level then he yelled in spanish to attract the attention of his confederates there was a shouted answer and beams of light began to move their way gamay couldnt believe it after all theyd gone through crawling through the ground like moles only to be caught within seconds like game panicked by a line of beaters she was ready simply to walk up to the bastard and twist the gun out of his hands chi must have sensed her impetuous mood do as he says dont worry chi stepped off to one side and went along a path yellow teeth barked a command the professor ignored him and kept walking at a slow steady pace yellow teeth hesitated this wasnt supposed to happen people were supposed to jump to his order when he waved a gun around with a quick glance at gamay to make sure she was sufficiently cowed to remain where she was he started after chi yelling in spanish chi stopped but not before he stepped off the path into the grass where he got down on his knees in a begging position arms held high in the air this was more like it weakness was like fresh blood to a hungry animal with a snarl yellow teeth lunged through the grass bringing the gun up so he could crush chis skull with the butt then he vanished the flashlight sailed into the air describing a long arc before it landed in the grass there was a yelp of surprise a loud thud silence chi retrieved the flashlight and directed the beam straight down when gamay approached he warned be careful theres another hole just to your right yellow teeth had fallen through a circular hole and now lay at the bottom of a domeshaped chamber with white plaster walls cisterns chi said you saw how hard it was to get a drink around here the city people used to store their water in these things ive marked them wherever i can i guess he didnt see this he fingered a thin orange ribbon tied to a bush are you going to just leave him chi looked off to where the fireflies were getting closes we dont have much choice you dont really care do you gamay thought about the long hard climb from the wrote i wouldnt mind getting my watch back but to be perfectly honest no i dont give a damn see how he likes being stuck in a gopher hole well have to go toward the river its the only way they sprinted for the woods theyd been spotted gunfire shattered the night they ran faster arlington virginia jose joe zavala lived in a small building that once housed a district library in arlington outside washington his living quarters on the main floor were decorated in a southwest flair with much of the furniture built by his father he liked the decor for its color and warmth but it was a reminder of how far he had come from his humble origins his mother and father born and raised in morales mexico waded across the rio grande west of el paso in the late sixties his mother was seven months pregnant and josh was born and grew up in santa fe new mexico where his parents settled his father being a carpenter who built furniturethe lure of the sea called him from his desert and mountain home having graduated from the new york maritime college as an engineer zavala possessed a mechanical mind that bordered on brilliance and he was recruited right out of college by admiral sandecker austin had suggested regrouping at zavalas place to get away from the overpowering presence of numa headquarters and the demands of its director he had experienced the unpleasant task of calling sandecker the night before to report the stings failure sandecker advised him to get a good nights sleep and return to washington as soon as possible austin and the others conked out for a few hours in a motel near the airport and were on an early flight that had them back in washington before noon the next day nina who still had a consulting firm to run hopped onto a shuttle back to boston austin stopped at his house for a shower and change of clothes and checked in with his office his secretary said she had a packet of information austin asked her to send it by courier to zavalas house trout was late for the meeting which was unlike him while he waited for paul austin sat at a heavy wood dining table and read the file that had come over from numa zavala emerged from the basement where hed been tinkering with machinery austin handed him a blackandwhite photo from the folder this came from the fbi pretty girl zavala said the young blond woman in the photo was not a classic beauty but attractive in a midwestern cornfed way with large innocent eyes and the winning smile she displayed at the arizona digs mrs wingate austin nodded mrs wingate as she looked forty years ago he took the picture back her name was crystal day they thought she might become another dons day she had a measure of film success back in the fifties and sixties reached her pinnacle doing a clinch scene in a rock hudson movie she might have made it big time if it hadnt been for her expensive alcohol and drug habits and her bad taste in men the last few years shes been doing bit parts on obscure tv shows but even those were few and far between what a tragic loss zavala said with a shake of his head howd she end up dead in a shower her agent says he thought of crystal when he got a call supposedly from an independent film company that was looking for a middleaged woman for a small role immediate opening with big money my guess is that whoever hired crystal knew she was desperate and would jump at the chance to do the part even when she found out it wasnt what she expected and she wouldnt be playing before the cameras she was good enough to fool us zavala said yeah and so was her husband mr wingate from spokane the mysterious scarfaced man with the disappearing beard has anything turned up on him he must have worn his gloves to bed austin replied with a frown the lab boys even checked the handle of the shovel he was using for fingerprints nothing smart move having a mole on the project zavala said with unveiled admiration it certainly took the stinger out of our sting look at it as a learning experience austin said his voice gaining an edge weve learned not to underestimate these guys we know theyre well organized he tapped the photo with his finger and that they dont like loose ends weve also confirmed the timequest connection they assign a couple of volunteers to the project then kidnap them while they send in ringers timequest comes out clean pretty clever diabolically so what do you make of wingates friendly wave just before the shed blew up and the offhand comment the guards told me he made nice try you have to admit he had a sense of humor for a murderer you dont see me laughing he was rubbing it in when he didnt have to why he just felt like rubbing it in maybe austin scratched his chin in thought i think it was partly just plain arrogance he was telling us he knows who we are and that he is part of something so big he can treat us as a joke bigger than numa i wish i knew joe austin replaced the publicity photo in the folder i wish i knew any idea where we go next no more stings lucky i was recuperating when that scheme as dreamed up well keep looking into the hovercraft link and the murder not exactly a welllit highway were following zavala said what if i flew down to san antonio and checked out timequest personally might be worth a looksee id be interested in timequests financial backing a soft knock came at the door trout entered ducking his head under the jamb he had a serious look on his face but this was standard with trout sorry im late guys ive been talking to the nereus about gamay clearly worried about his wife trout had called numa frequently as they flew across the country to see if gamay had checked in any word austin asked trout settled his lanky form into a chair and shook his head they confirmed that she got a ride to shore from the ship that she rented a jeep that she left word she was going to meet professor chi the museum anthropologist shes been eager to see and that shed be back that evening did she and this dr chi ever get together trout shifted uneasily i dont know the folks down there are still trying to get a hold of chi seems he spends a lot of time out in the field so they said not to worry but its not like gamay to stay out of touch what do you want to do paul i know you need me here trout said apologetically but id like to get back to the yucatan for a few days to check things out its tough trying to follow gamays track based on second or thirdhand accounts austin nodded joes heading down to texas for a look at timequest ill be in washington working up a report on the arizona fiasco why dont you take fortyeight hours to see what you can learn if you need more time ill smooth things with sandecker thanks kurt trout said brightening ive lined up a flight that will get me down there early tonight ive got a couple of hours before then i can spare for the team any ideas lurking behind that broad intellectual forehead trout wrinkled his brow the one thing weve solidly established is that the trigger in all of these incidents is the discovery of precolumbian artifacts yes thats a given replied austin but we dont know why zavala murmured in fourteen hundred and ninetytwo columbus sailed the ocean blue austin whod been deep in thought looked up with a bemused expression what did you say the first line of a poem from grade school you probably had to learn the same rhyme i did and i dont remember the rest of it any better than you do i wasnt trying to get an a in poetry zavala said i was thinking maybe precolumbian isnt the key maybe its columbus good point trout said it iszavala replied even he wasnt so sure paul is right austin said you cant have precolumbian without columbus zavala grinned in fourteen hundred and ninetytwo exactly that dumb rhyme pretty much sums up what most of us know about columbus the date he sailed and the fact we get a threeday weekend in october because of him but what do we really know about old chris especially as it might apply to these murderous attacks trouts analytical brain was at work i think i see where youre headed we know theres an indirect link between columbus and these incidents ergo keep on ergoing zavala encouraged ergo the question is there a direct link they exchanged glances perlmutter they uttered in unison austin grabbed the phone and punched out a number in a spacious georgetown carriage house the private line gave off a ring like a ships bell the receiver was plucked from its cradle by a plump hand belonging to a man who was not quite as wide as a barn door he wore plummy purple pajamas under a red and gold paisley robe he sat in a chair reading one of the thousands of books that seemed to fill every cubic inch of every room st julien perlmutter here he said through a magnificent gray beard state your business in a brief manner christopher columbus austin said is that brief enough for you my god is that you kurt i heard youve been fighting pirates off the barbary coast just a humble government servant doing my job somebody has to keep the seas safe for american shipping live and learn my friend i was unaware that the us navy had been disbanded in favor of numa weve decided to give them another chance to shape up as you know pirates arent numas usual business ah yes so youre interested in the admiral of the ocean sea you know its a wonder he ever made it west of the canary islands bad navigation heavens no dead reckoning was adequate for the task at hand it would have been hard for him to have missed two continents connected by an isthmus even though thats what happened im talking about the crews food did you know that the basic ration was a pound a day of hard biscuit salt meat salt fish and olive oil beans and chickpeas of course with almonds and raisins for dessert he said with horror in his voice the only bright spot was the availability of fresh fish austin sensed perlmutter was drifting off onto a dissertation on fine food and wines his burning passion for which was equaled only by his interest in ships and shipwrecks perlmutter was the classic gourmand and bon vivant weighing in at nearly four hundred pounds his corpulent figure was a familiar and aweinspiring sight at the most elegant restaurants where he often hosted sumptuous dinners dont forget the weevils that developed in their food austin said trying to move perlmutter away from his favorite subject i cant imagine what weevils would be like ive tried locusts and grubs in africa good sources of protein im told but if i want something that tastes like chicken ill eat chicken youll have to tell me precisely what you want to know why are you so curious about columbus if i may ask perlmutter listened quietly his encyclopedic mind absorbing every detail as austin summarized the story from the moroccan murders to the blunted sting i think i see what you need you want to know why columbus would inspire anyone to kill it wouldnt be the first time columbus excited tempers he was an incredible survivor he was wrong about discovering america yet that is what he is famous for to his dying day he claimed to have discovered china he never acknowledged the existence of an entire continent he started the slave trade in the americas and brought the terrible glories of the spanish inquisition to the new world he was obsessed with gold he was either a saint or a scoundrel depending on your point of view that was then im talking about now why would somebody murder to prevent his discoveries from being discredited all i need is one link his voyages have produced tons of written material and millions of pages what has been written about the old boy could fill an entire library im aware of that which is why i called youre the only one i know who could brush away the dross flattery will get you nowhere ill repay your work with dinner at a restaurant of your choice but food will how could any man resist twin seductions of his ego and appetite ill start digging right after i have lunch perlmutter chewed over austins request along with succulent breast of duck stuffed with grapes on focaccia left over from dinner the night before complemented with a rare marcassin chardonnay austin would rue the day perlmutter tempted him with food there was a new french restaurant in alexandria he was dying to try a bit pricey perhaps but a deal was a deal his blue eyes danced merrily in his ruddy round face in anticipation austin would get his moneys worth perlmutter knew without turning a page that an ocean of literature had been written on the subject of christopher columbus too vast to simply jump in and start swimming he would need a guide and there was none better he could think of after tidying up from lunch he pawed through his card file and dialed an overseas number buena dies came a deep voice on the other end good morning juan ah julien what a pleasant surprise all goes well with you very well and you my old friend older than the last time we talked the spaniard said with a chuckle but let us discuss more agreeable subjects i trust you called to inform me that you have tried my recipe for cordonices emhoja de parra the quail in grape leaves was superb as you advised i stuffed each quail with a fresh fig instead of the thyme and lemon zest the results were spectacular i also used mesquite wood in the grill perlmutter had met juan ortega in madrid at a convocation of rare book collectors they discovered that in addition to an obsession with antique volumes they shared a gourmands fondness for fine dining they tried to get together at least once a year to indulge their gustatory yearnings and traded recipes in between mesquite a stroke of genius i should expect nothing less im glad the recipe pleased you no doubt you have something for me to try perlmutter could almost hear ortega licking his lips yes in a moment but there is another reason for my call i must request the use of your skills not as a master chef but as juan ortega the greatest living authority on christopher columbus you are too kind my friend ortega ducked i am only one of many historians who have written books on the subject but youre the only scholar who is astute enough to help me with a most unusual problem the ghost of senor columbus seems to be at the center of some rather odd goings on allow me to explain perlmutter outlined the highlights of the situation as austin had given it to him a strange story ortega said at the end of the recitation especially in view of a recent incident several weeks ago we had a crime here in seville that had to do with columbus a theft of columbus papers from the biblioteca columbina in the great cathedral of seville a coincidence perhaps perhaps yes perhaps no what was stolen a letter pertaining to the fifth voyage of columbus it was written to his patrons king ferdinand and queen isabella the king really the queen having died by then a shame to lose such a valuable document not really columbus did not take a fifth voyage of course i should have remembered but i dont understand this letter a hearty laugh issued over the phone from three thousand miles away a forgery amigo a fraud how do you say it the papers were phony how do you know it was a forgery from the handwriting oh no the handwriting is quite good so authentic an expert could not tell the difference then how do you know the writing was forged simple columbus died may the log is dated after that date perlmutter paused for a moment thinking could there have been a mistake about the date of his death the house on calle de cristobal colon where he expired has been preserved there is controversy about when he is buried however his remains are said to lie in seville or santo domingo or havana at least eight different funeral urns supposedly contain his ashes omega sighed heavily when you are dealing with this man you swim in murky waters i remember in your book discoverer or demon you said no one is even certain where he was born yes that is correct we dont know for sure whether he was spanish or italian he said he was born in genoa but columbus was not known for his honesty some even contend that he came from the greek island of chios the official version says he was an italian weavers apprentice ethers maintain this was not so that he was actually a spanish mariner named colon we know he married the daughter of a portuguese aristocrat and need in royal circles which world have been a difficult feat for the mere son of a weaver there are no authentic portraits a true man of mystery which is the way he preferred it he did everything he could to obscure his identification that has always puzzled me those were turbulent times julien wars intrigue the inquisition maybe he was on the wrong side of a royal controversy he may have served a country at war with spain or one that would be taken over by spain there were reasons of heredity as well evidence he was born the bastard son of a spanish prince hence cristobol colon the name he was known by later in life truly fascinating juan we must discuss it over glasses of sangria when next we meet but im interested in knowing more about this stolen document you know of the monk las casas yes he transcribed parts of the original columbus log cornet columbus presented the log of his first voyage to his patron queen isabella in turn she commissioned an exact replication which she gave to columbus upon the admirals death this barcelona copy as it was called was inherited by his son diego along with charts books and manuscripts these in turn went to fernando who was the illegitimate child of columbus by his mistress he reminds me very much of you julien its not the first time ive been called a bastard nor will it be the last i did not mean to sully your birthright my friend i meant that he was an archivist and a scholar a lover of books who assembled one of the finest libraries in europe when he died in his possessions books and columbus papers went to luis the son of diego his mother removed most of fernandos possessions to a monastery here in seville when she died in it was a tragedy for the world why is that juan she had managed for twenty three years to keep the collection from her son luis now he had everything it was a disaster he rifled the collection for papers he could sell to support his debauched lifestyle the barcelona copy disappeared and was lost forever probably sold to the highest bidder it would fetch quite a price now if it were to turn up i would imagine indeed but perhaps not in our lifetime fortunately before it disappeared it was seen by a friend of the family the dominican friar named las casas who produced a handwritten abstract of the log he was very protective of columbus omitting anything that embarrassed him but overall it is a good synopsis im not sure what this has to do with the stolen document patience my friend this document of the so called fifth voyage was also said to have been transcribed by las casas again it is an abstract excerpting portions of a longlost log youve seen it oh yes it was considered a curiosity i even went so far as to compare it to the original las casas manuscript which is in the biblioteca nacional in madrid it is an excellent forgery except for the content i would be ninetynine percent certain it was written by las casas do you remember the subject matter unforgettable it read like one of the fantastic stories of long lost cities that were so popular in spain in the fifteen hundreds columbus had sailed his fourth and final voyage in it followed a series of disasters disappointments and a nervous breakdown the royals considered him a crank by then but thought he might stumble onto something useful he was still convinced he had found asia that he would discover vast resources of gold and this voyage would restore his tarnished reputation and did it the opposite his fourth voyage was a disgraceful failure he lost four ships and was marooned on jamaica suffering from malaria and arthritis yet the account that was stolen says he went back to spain secretly outfitted a ship with his own money and returned to the new world to make that final search for the incredible treasure in gold he had heard about from his very first voyage this log does it say what happened the forger used a very clever literary device to keep the reader guessing at a certain point the narration is taken over by a crewman then this narrative ends abruptly we are never told whether the ship succeeds in its mission or if it returned to spain at all of course the ship could have been lost and the log found by other voyagers yes so you see what a lovely tale of the imagination it is what if it isnt a madeup story juan again the deep laughter what makes you say that a number of things why would somebody make such an excellent forgery a simple explanation to use an analogy from your country if you were to sell someone the brooklyn bridge it would be to your advantage to have a deed with many official seals and signatures on it a persuasive argument juan but if i found an idiot stupid enough to give me money for that which i clearly did not own i could sign the deed in my own hand and walk away with the cash forging official signatures would be unnecessary work this document would be submitted to far more scrutiny than your mythical bridge deal exactly my point the document is superbly done as you say as a comparison if you knew the bridge belonged to brooklyn no amount of official paperwork would persuade you it was for sale similarly you wouldnt have to be an expert to know the document was a fraud if you knew it was dated after columbuss death another possibility presents itself ortega said that the hand of las cases actually transcribed this document but the monk did so knowing it was a forgery why would las casas go through all that tedious labor knowing it was a fake you said las casas was very protective of columbuss ravings would someone of that mindset want to give further circulation to a document that conveys the last words of columbus as the ravings of a wild man perhaps las casas never meant for anyone to see it but luis sold the log to bribe his way out of prison or into the bedroom of one of his women maybe perlmutter replied but there is something else the fact that somebody went through a bit of trouble to steal it as i said it is a curiosity enough of a curiosity to risk arrest and imprisonment i see your point julien i am at a loss to offer an explanation if i only had the original log which las casas copied from but alas another columbus mystery then yes we must leave it at that there was a pause you can judge for yourself when i send it to you pardon the document i have made a copy and an english translation hoping to present it at a conference you see i too am fascinated by the odd and bizarre perhaps there was more to it than that juan perhaps you have your doubts as to its spuriousness perhaps my friend as i said it is an extremely good forgery i still have your fax number you shall have it this day id appreciate that and in return and for your magnificent quail recipe i would like to share with you a shrimp gumbo that a chef in new orleans passed on to me with the warning that he would split me open and stuff me like a lobster if i shared it with anyone we must be discreet my very life is at stake you are a true friend julien danger will only enhance its delectability but if you meet such an untimely demise i shall be sure to toast you with a heavenly bon appetit bon appetit to you mi amigo the fax machine hummed and the first pages of neatly typewritten paper began to come through as promised ortega sent along copies of the original written in neat castilian spanish perlmutter cleared a space on his desk to accommodate the paperwork fortifying himself with a cup of cappuccino he began to read the words that may or may not have been written by christopher columbus and transcribed by las casas may in the year of our lord most exalted excellent and powerful prince king of the spains and of the islands of the ocean sea our sovereign high noble lord i sail to the indies once again perhaps never to return for i am mortal old and weakened by illness and the way is hard and fraught with dangers i make this voyage without the permission and blessing of your highness but at my own expense having used my meager fortune to fit out a single vessel the nina which i know to be suitable to the undertaking fire it has served me well on many occasions since my first voyage i go not in my capacity as high admiral of all the ocean sea but as on my first expedition as a humble sailor a captain who sailed from spain to the indies to find new lands and gold fire castile by which the sovereign may undertake the conquest of the holy land which has always been my intention but my story must begin four years before this my sovereign is well acquainted with the trials of my last voyage in the year when having freed me from chains and forgiven me for my errors by your clemency and consolation you and my queen again granted great favors and ennobled me sending me forward with four ships how on this high voyage our fleet survived a terrible storm and found new lands which i claimed with the help of god in the name of the sovereigns even though i had fallen ill often seeming at deaths door commanding the ship from a small cabin i had built on deck this was the most unhappy and disappointing of all my voyages we did not find the strait to the west that we were looking for the natives greeted us not with friendliness as before but with arrows and spears all was against us the biscuits maggoty the weather and wind fearsome until at last our sinking ships came upon a safe harbor where we were marooned for a year and five days in a place i never expected to leave alive until that joyful day we were rescued then the worst ocean crossing of my life but more than any storms or disease or the depredations of the natives was my knowledge that for all my attempt to serve their majesties with as much love and diligence as i might have used to win the gates of paradise and more i have failed in matters that were beyond my knowledge and strength while i charted new lands i lost four ships and found little gold or other treasure even worse my queen who being mortal left her realm free from heresy and wickedness to be well received by the eternal creator i knew of only one way to remedy my sadness and to please my most serene prince and that is to find the goal which had eluded me on my earlier voyages for in my long stay on that most unhappy of islands i learned that which i had long sought was within my grasp i was provided with the key that would open the door to a treasure in gold so fabulous as to make all that has come before which is of no little consequence appear as coins for a beggar and grant for castile the sovereign and your successors the greatness you deserve for all time i have been well provided for by the gold from my voyages and my share of the revenue from hispanola and had much to be thankful for my eldest son diego employed as a royal bodyguard young fernando as a page but still i was saddened by my failure the security of hearth is not for a sailor and i resolved to go to sea once more perhaps for a final time to fulfilll my promise to your highnesses and my obligations as high admiral thus in this month i made out my will confirming diego as my heir and using my own monks in secret outfitted the ship nina hiring a small crew of fifteen loyal men left by night sailing as in my first and greatest voyage of out of palos altering course after dark to the canary islands to the sw and south by west perlmutter paused for a sip of coffee interesting the narrator knew columbus favored the nina of all his ships it was well known that columbus was beset by frustration at his failure to find his way to china at one point he was brought home in chains charged with mismanagement as viceroy of hispanola only to be forgiven by the king and especially his patron the queen and outfitted for his fourth fateful trip inaptly named the high voyage it would have been totally in keeping with columbus who in fact had suffered for his hubris to try to redeem himself and for his obsession with finding gold to be the engine that drove him only one problem as don ortega pointed out columbus started the letter three days after he supposedly died oh well perlmutter read on while the document was written as a personal letter columbus the mariner couldnt help making it a log of his voyage with observations of wind direction and weather conditions the trip across the atlantic was a picturepostcard repeat of his first voyage he picked up the northeast tradewind that begins near madeira making the crossing with day following pleasant day pushed try gentle breezes favored by luck as on his first crossing the winds were very gentle as in april in seville an interesting difference perlmutter knew from his reading that on his first trip columbus navigated by dead reckoning in other words he kept tabs of his compass direction and speed and marked his daily position on the chart the ships speed was measured with a sand glass known as a dutchmans log the pilot threw a woodchip in the water and counted a rhyme to time its passing on his first voyage columbus didnt need pinpoint navigation because he was mainly concerned with maintaining a westerly heading he relied on his compass and his long experience at sea and didnt trust an early sextant like device called a quadrant therefore it was of interest to perlmutter that in several entries columbus not only noted the miles traveled but made frequent celestial observations as well may took fix on north star maintaining southwest direction may stayed on course sw as calculated by quadrant it was almost as if columbus wanted to be precise because he knew his exact destination not as on his first trip when he thought from earlier charts that he would run into the huge land mass of china or india and a few degrees of latitude either way wouldnt make a difference more evidence that columbus was apparently following a predetermined course was his frequent reference to the ships torleta i steered to the wsw more or less steering first one way and then the other for the winds are contrary but still making sixty six miles and sailing according to the torleta of the ancients perlmutter put the document aside and with unerring accuracy navigating by his own kind of dead reckoning made his way to a wall shelf crammed with books and plucked out a volume on medieval navigation he knew that torleta referred to torleta del marteloio the table of the bell the plotting board used to mark each days position the bell was rung as the hourglass was turned the torleta went back to the thirteenth century and was actually an analog computer used to solve trigonomic problems it was made in the form of a grid and kept by the pilot who drew a line between the start and the end of each days travel the pilot factored in his observations of wind and current and leeway and basically took an educated guess perlmutter puzzled over the expression torleta of the ancients maybe it was a loose translation meaning that the plotting board was an old one which would fit if it were the original on the nina he went on with his reading columbus had made a smooth atlantic crossing by june he was south of hispanola one day to become the countries of haiti and the dominican republic with its capital at the settlement of santo domingo which columbus founded perlmutter again saw the problem ortega had with the document columbus was supposedly cruising the caribbean at a time he had been dead for more than a month perlmutter grinned with pleasure he wasnt going to let a small technicality spoil his enjoyment of this wonderful yarn just as things were getting interesting he unrolled a map of the caribbean next to the letter to trace the ships course the nina threaded hispanola and cuba and sailed toward jamaica where columbus had been stranded with his crew on his previous voyage the log jumped back to a description of that unhappy time my ship headed south and west bypassing santo domingo with a good northeast wind in our sails for three days it was on the island here four years before that the people told me of the plan called cigure and its abundance of gold when the women wear pearls and coral and the houses are tiled in precious metal the natives told me then that the ships of these people are large and the inhabitants of this land wear rich clothing and art used to a good living that then are gold nuggets as big and plentiful as beans here was proof that the lord uses the tiniest of creatures to carry out his will because it was in this strange land on my previous crossing farther than any has gone before that the ships of my high voyage came apart from the depredations of the toredo the shipworm we were marooned for more than a year but it was during my confinement on this island prison that the veil was lifted from my understanding and i saw a clear path to the riches that i have sought for castile all these years diego mendez the brother of one of my captains set offf in a canoe to seek help in hispanola five hundred miles away in his absence the indians he had befriended changed in their hearts and refused to trade for provisions as agreed i feared this seas gods retribution his punishment for my part in the deaths of the five for although i did not raise a hand i gave them up to the brothers i got down an my knees and prayed for forgiveness and vowed to make many pilgrimages to the holy land and give up all that i found in his cause he heard my prayer and made me to remember that from my copy of regiomantanus that there should be an eclipse of the moon i told the indians and their chief that my god seas displeased with them and would make the moon die when the moon disappeared in shadow the indians were much afraid and restored our provisions so i should make it live again the chief said he was grateful arid would make sun to please my god by showing me the way to gold he took me to the east end of the island here in a temple as fine as any palace in europe he showed me a talking stone carved with figures which he said showed else way to a great treasure perlmutter had read in ortegas book about the eclipse episode it showed how resourceful columbus could be but what was this equally odd tale of a talking stone the narrator had similar questions for many weeks i puzzled over the meaning of this strange stone i perceived it to be a map of the coast i discovered but the other writings and marks would not yield their secrets once backin spain i took it to learned men who said it was a navigational device but knew not the strange writing then it came to me as a simple sailor that this was a torleta used by the ancients to find their way the stone being unwieldy i had charts made of its markings and set as i said above on my fifth voyage vowing to find some who could understand the strange writing that explained the references to the torleta of the ancients it was apparently a stone tablet a large and heavy one from the description carved in a way to indicate it had been used for navigation since columbus couldnt use the stone without explanation it must not have been a map in the conventional sense the letter returned to the fifth voyage account august we continued westerly favored by good winds as before and now at last we are anchored off a shore more distant than any man has gone the native people we have talked to have said that there is more gold nearby than we can ever imagine l think i am close to the treasure of king solomon i am not wel having been made ill and weak once more by the heat and disease but feel the gold to be near and ask your majesty that when i return with these mountains of gold and precious levels i be allowed to make a pilgrimage to rome and jerusalem i will write no more until i have the gold in my possession the next entry was dated two days later the script was written in a firmer hand the admiral is gone when the crew arose at dawn we found that a small boat had disappeared and that the admirals cabin is empty gone too are his maps i have sent ashore a party to search for him and they found the boat but they were driven back to the ship by group of natives who showered then with arrows alas i fear the admiral is dead killed by these ungodly savages we shall wait safely offshore but unless we see a sign that he lives we must soon weigh anchor and will sail to hispanola to seek help god bless the admiral of the ocean sea signed this day by alonso mendez apprentice pilot perlmutter tapped his plump chin in thought columbus was clearly delirious in his last hours solomons gold indeed he wondered off what shore the nina was anchored he consulted the map again sailing westerly from jamaica would have put him into central america anywhere from mexicos yucatan peninsula down to belize or honduras if he were a few degrees off when he had more time he would go over the daily observations and see if he could plot an exact course to its end columbus took his maps and charts with him but what became of the stone perlmutter shook his head amused at how he had let himself be pulled into the story he was acting as if the document he had just finished reading were real when it might be no more historically meaningful than a challenging crossword puzzle but what if the document were the real thing what relevance might it have to the modernday melodrama austin had told him about with blackclad bands of assassins dashing about killing innocent archeologists what was that odd reference to the death of the five columbus apparently felt so guilty about his involvement in this incident that he thought his marooning was divine punishment perlmutter decided to go through the letter again in case there was something he missed then he would start digging into his own library but first a snack was in order cancun mexico the mood aboard the cancum flight had been one of joyful expectation since the plane took off from washington shortly after the meeting at zavalas place as the pilot made his runway approach vacationbound travelers craned their necks to peer down at the luxury beachfront resort hotels lining the clear bluegreen water and the atmosphere ratcheted up to one of unbridled excitement with his conservative gray suit and flamboyant bow tie and the way his head towered over the seats paul trout would have stuck out from the happy crowd even without the gravity of his expression his nose was buried in a map of the yucatan peninsula his thoughts on gamay and only when he felt the plane bank did he break his concentration to see where they were within minutes the plane was on the ground trout broke off from the stream of passengers flowing toward the waiting hotel shuttle buses and headed for the counter of a small charter airline minutes later he was buckling into the seat next to the pilot of a twinengined beechcraft baron he was the only passenger the other seats in the fourpassenger aircraft having been converted to cargo space as the beechcraft lifted into the sky trout silently thanked the travel experts at numa who had done an incredible job patching together his trip finding an empty seat on the commercial flight on short notice and hitching him up almost immediately with the charter the smaller plane was making a run to campeche to pick up a party of texas oil technicians who were meeting their wives and girlfriends in cancun the trip should take about an hour said the pilot a talkative mexican in his thirties who had a good command of english and a firsthand knowledge of the best bars to meet tourist women in cancun before long his voice merged with the drone of the engines trouts worry about gamay had kept him awake during the overnight stay in tucson he closed his eyes to be awakened at one point when the pilot said they were passing over chichen itza trout looked down as the pilot pointed out tire great foursided pyramid temple and the ball court about halfway to ciudad del carmen the pilot said trout nodded mesmerized by the flat green landscape stretching out to the horizon he closed his eyes again until the pilot nudged him awake theres your ship the sleek bluehulled nereus lying at anchor among the other oil tankers and fishing boats in the harbor was a welcome sight trout found it hard to believe he had left the ship and gamay only a few days before he wished now that he had prevailed upon her to come back to washington she would never have agreed he admitted to himself she was intent on meeting dr chi before leaving washington bout had called the mexican anthropological museum and talked to dr chis secretary she checked the professors calendar and confirmed he was planning to meet gamay the professor spent much of his time out in the field and called in for messages when he happened to be near a phone but he had no set schedule if he were to be found anywhere she said it would be at his lab as the pilot waited for permission to land trout asked him to radio ahead and notify those handling his next ride that he was coming in he didnt want to waste a minute cooling his heels in an airport lounge as soon as the beechcraft taxied to a stop trout bolted from the cabin with his one bag flinging an adios and a gracias over his shoulder in new england spanish a stocky man in a police uniform and reflective sunglasses was waiting in the airport lobby dr trout he said with a toothy smile my name is sergeant morales i am with the mexican federal police the fed ive been asked to act as your guide trout had called in a marker with the drug enforcement agency the dea owed numa for some past favors and was happy to oblige when trout asked to set up a contact with the mexican national police nice to meet you trout said glancing at his watch im ready if you are it is getting late the policeman said i wondered if you would rather go tomorrow trouts answer was softspoken but there was no mistaking the determination in the serious brown eyes with all due respect sergeant i took great pains to get here in a hurry so i could start searching for my wife as soon as i arrived of course senor trout the policeman said nodding in understanding i assure you this is not a case of manana simply common sense i too wish to locate your wife however it will be dark before long how much light do we have one two hours maybe finest kind cap trout said answering in fishermans slang we can cover a lot in two hours morales saw there was no use trying to put off the tall american bueno dr trout the helicopter is this way the bell jetranger helicopter was warming up its rotor and tail blades turning slowly as trout eased into the threepassenger backseat and morales slid in next to the pilot seconds later the turbo motor kicked into action and the runners lifted off the tarmac the helicopter leaped into the air and climbed in two minutes to an altitude of more than three thousand feet they swung out over the water and headed inland from the coast following the railroad tracks that snaked into the interior morales gave the pilot directions frequently consulting from a foldedup map they left the railroad track and picked up a narrow highway running more or less eastwest the chopper kept its altitude cruising at a speed of miles per hour until they were well into the interior the dense woods were broken here and there by a village or occasional town there were few paved roads occasionally they passed over a mayan ruin but for the most part the landscape was the same unbroken flatness trout had noted on the way from cancun the aircraft swung onto a more southerly course morales was a competent and sharpeyed guide recognizing landmarks and relaying the information to the pilot trout anxiously watched the sun lowering in the sky how far trout said with unveiled impatience morales held up five fingers he jabbed a point on the map for the benefit of the pilot aqui the pilot nodded so slightly trout wasnt sure he heard morales until the chopper cut speed and described a wide circle that transformed into an evertightening spiral morales pressed against the plexiglass and pointed down trout caught a glimpse of a clearing and a crude structure before both quickly passed out of view the chopper came around again hovered and began to descend their target was directly under them and trout couldnt see where they were landing as the treetops grew closer the chopper seemed to hang for a second the pilot suddenly gunned the motor and they darted off to one side like a startled dragonfly the pilot and morales had a quick conversation in spanish whats wrong trout strained to see into the forest no room hes afraid hell catch the rotors in the trees trout sat back in his seat and crossed his arms puffing his cheeks out in frustration the chopper moved out until it was above a lonely stretch of arrowstraight road then dropped down and landed lightly in a grassy patch at the edge of the blacktop as the whirling rotors fluttered to a stop trout and morales got out nearby a track led into the woods this goes to professor chis house we must walk trout strode off with the shorter man valiantly trying to keep up without losing his dignity as they moved into the thick woods trout noticed that there were deep tracks made fairly recently by heavy tires set wide apart morales said he had called the local policia and requested that they ask around several locals remembered seeing chi on a bus hed been picked up from hunting and dropped off by the side of the road near where he lived they remembered a jeep waiting for him that fit trout thought gamay had used a jeep to drive in from the coast do you know dr chi he asked morales as they walked si senor i have met him sometimes the museum asks me to carry a message to him he is muy pacifico a gentleman always wants to cook tortillas for me the canopy of trees was becoming as dark as a subway tunnel trout squinted through the branches trying to catch a glimpse of the sun he wondered if they would have any problem finding their way out maybe morales was right they should have waited until morning when theyd have more light why does professor chi have his lab way out here trout asked wouldnt it be more convenient if he had it in a town or village i ask the doctor the same thing morales said with a grin he says he was born in this place my roots are here he tells me you understand what he means trout understood chis attachment to his native soil very well his own family went back more than two hundred years on cape cod spawning several generations of families all tied to the sea through service as lighthouse keepers surfmen in the lifesaving service or fishermen the low slung silvershingled trout homestead was nearly two centuries old but it had been kept up through the years and looked as if it could have been built yesterday his was a salty ancestry he wore with pride met he realized his ties to the past were nothing compared to the maya who had inhabited the same country for many centuries before the spaniards arrived they trudged along for about twenty minutes until the forest thinned out into a clearing the square concrete block building seemed to jump out of the woods but it was more a case of trout simply not expecting such a substantial looking structure in this remote location the professors laboratory morales said he went over and knocked on the door no answer we come back here after we check the house morales suggested the thatchedroof but was similar to those trout had seen dotting the yucatan from the air trout was more interested in the jeep parked next to the simple structure he hurried over and searched the vehicle tucked in the sun visor was the diagram indicating how to get to chis property and a bottle of bug repellent he ran his hands over the steering wheel and dashboard and smelled the faint scent of the body lotion gamay used they searched the house which took about five minutes because of the sparseness of the furnishings trout stood in the center of the dirt floor and looked around hoping to find a due he had missed on his first round well we know from the jeep that she made it this far i have an idea morales said trout followed him past the lab building to another simple but this is the professors garage look his vehicle is gone those would have been the tracks we saw on the way in what does he drive a big car morales said like a jeep only like this he held his hands wide a humvee si he said with a bright smile humvee like the us military uses so it was likely they went somewhere in the hummer but where maybe theres a note in the lab trout said the cinderblock building was pleasantly cooler than outside even without the airconditioning on the door was unlocked and they easily gained entrance trout took in the hightech equipment and shook his head in wonder much as his wife had done the day before morales stood nearby at respectful attention almost as if he were afraid of being caught in forbidden precincts except for the general clutter noting appeared to have been disturbed paul went over to the sink there were two glasses in the drying rack looks they they could have had a drink morales checked to waste basket and found two cans of sevenup further reconstructing events trout surmised that gamay had been waiting for to professor at to highway they came in here drank some soda then took off he checked to refrigerator and found to two dead partridges the binds had yet to be cleaned and gutted chi must have planned to return in a short time from wherever he went is there a village nearby where they could have gone trout asked there is a town si but the people there would have seen dr chi in his big blue car nada trout examined to maps on to wall one appeared to be missing he went over to the table and began looking at the papers on top it took only a moment to find the map and match the pinholes to those on to wall chi could have taken this down to show gamay on the other hand it may have been on the table for weeks he showed to map to morales do you know where this is the police sergeant examined to map and said down south more into campeche about a hundred miles maybe more whats out there nothing woods its outside to biosphere reserve no one goes there trout tapped the map somebody went there my guess is its dr chi the chopper can get us there in an hour or less im sorry senor by the time we walk back to the helicopter it will be dark morales was right they were lucky to find their way out of the woods by the time they returned to the chopper it was pitch black trout hated the thought of gamay having to spend another night wherever she was as the helicopter lifted above the trees he tried to console himself with other possibilities that chi and gamay had fetched up somewhere maybe they were sitting down to a quiet dinner less appealing scenarios intruded an accident that didnt figure gamay was simply not accidentprone she was too savvy too surefooted trout knew tat even to most surefooted person makes a mistake at least once in his or her life he hoped it wasnt gamays turn sergeant morales found trout a room in a small hotel near the airport trout lay on his bed for hours staring at the ceiling fan wondering what gamay was doing before he finally slipped into a few fitful hours of sleep he awoke at twilight and took a shower that was all the more refreshing because there was no hot water he was pacing the tarmac when the pilot and sergeant arrived as the sky turned peach pink in the east the chopper followed chis map in a straight line at its maximum cruising speed flying at an altitude of fifteen hundred feet the forest stretched out below like a rough napped green carpet arriving at the area indicated on chis map the pilot slowed the aircraft and dropped it almost to treetop level the jetranger admirably fulfilled the purpose of its original design as an army observation helicopter trout who was sitting in the front noticed a textural difference in the greenery and asked the pilot to circle morales picked out the barely distinct edges of the rectangular plain after a couple more passes for the pilot to acquaint himself with the lay of the land the jetranger landed at rough center it took paul less than thirty seconds to decide he didnt like this godforsaken place not one damned bit it went beyond the remoteness and the weird mounds and the darkness of the encroaching forest even in daylight something sinister lurked here as a boy he used to feel the same prickly scalp uneasiness when he walked past the deserted house of a sailor who ate his crewmates while becalmed in the sargasso sea maybe gamay had never been here he thought looking around at the desolate spot all he had was dr chis map and the supposition that this was their destination he could be spinning his wheels while gamay desperately needed his help elsewhere no he clenched his jaw this was definitely the place he could feel it in his bones the way his fisherman father sensed a storm brewing the police officer suggested that they fan out in three directions keeping each other in view as much as possible walk to the edge of the woods then return to the chopper a half hour later they straggled back morales was about to speak but paused as his eversearching policemans eye picked out evidence of an earlier visit squatting for a better look morales said see where the grass is broken here and here again he angled his head there when the light is just right footprints thinking he would never want morales on his trail trout followed the sergeants example and saw the faint shadows that had caught the police officers attention the sergeant instructed the pilot to stay with the helicopter and got no argument the early morning sun was already hinting at the blast furnace it would be in the hours to come they set out with morales taking the lead and had gone only a short distance when they saw a mound that had been cleared so the stone blocks on one side were visible at the base of the structure was a reddish patch in his eagerness for a better look trout ignored the sergeants admonishment to stay behind he dashed past the sergeant to the mound and picked up gamays worn maroon l l bean day pack the same one he had given her as a christmas gift two years before with mounting excitement he rummaged inside and found her camera and sketch pads some plastic lunch bags empty soda cans and a bottle of water nearby was another pack made of tan canvas trout held both packs high over his head for the benefit of morales who was walking briskly to catch up this pack belongs to my wife the numa scientist said triumphantly the other has dr chis name on the tag morales inspected the professors bag his face was clouded this is not good what do you wean not good this shows theyve been here you misunderstand senor trout morales said with a quick glance around i found a campfire where there were signs of many chicleros noting trouts blank expression he explained they are bad men who steal antiquities for sale whats that got to do with my wife and the professor the coals were warm and near the river signs of many men i also find these he opened his palm to display three spent bullet cartridges trout put a shell to his nose the bullet had been fired recently where did you find them trouts eyes followed the police officers pointing finger then looked back to where he had found the rucksacks as if he could draw a line connecting the two points thats when he noticed the strange carvings on the wall of the structure he stepped closer and inspected the boats and other figures on the bared stone his guess was that gamay and the professor had lunch then came back to these carvings gamay definitely would have been intrigued by the strange etchings but something must have distracted them he turned back to morales you think my wife and the professor ran into these chicleros si morales said with a shrug it is possible why else would they leave their sacks i was thinking the same thing sergeant would you please show me where you found these shells come this way morales said with a nod be careful where you walk there are holes all over the field they slowly made their way across the plain there were far more of the mysterious mounds than trout first assumed if each one had a stone structure under it this must have been a goodsized settlement at one time here morales said and over there trout saw copper gleaming in the grass and picked up a couple more shells a combination of pistol and rifle casings the grass was trampled all around them his big hand squeezed the hollow copper cylinders as if he would crush them now can i see the campfire and the river they examined the campsite and found empty tequila bottles and many cigarette stubs more shells were found in the woods at the rivers edge trout looked in vain for tracks indicating gamays running shoes but the mud was too messed up he saw marks indicating boats had been drawn up on shore as well as more shell casings this place must have resembled a shooting gallery but trout was hopeful the casings indicated that someone with rifles and pistols had chased somebody to the river that was the bad news the fact that guns were still blazing from the riverside indicated gamay and the professor could have made their escape trout suggested that they get into the air and follow the river through the woods morales agreed they walked briskly away from the river and were about halfway back to the chopper when they heard a disembodied groan they froze exchanging glances morales drew his pistol they listened hearing only the drone of insects the groan repeated off to the right with morales covering him trout moved cautiously toward the apparent source the sound seemed to be coming from practically underfoot trout looked down partially hidden by the long grass was a black hole he knelt at the edge but couldnt see anything in the darkness feeling somewhat foolish at talking into the ground he said whos there another groan followed by a stream of spanish in a weak voice morales who had come over to kneel by trouts side listened a moment its a man he says he fell down the hole whats he doing way out here morales relayed the question then the answer he said he was out walking this is a pretty remote place to be taking a nature stroll trout said lets get him out trout went back to the chopper and found a nylon rope in the emergency kit he dropped a knotted loop into the hole then he the pilot and morales hauled on their end of the rope first the head then the shoulders of a pitifullooking creature appeared in the opening the mans scraggly beard and long greasy hair were covered with a gray dust and the whiteness of his illfitting clothes was a distant memory he sat on the ground alternately rubbing his arms legs and head his nose was bruised the police officer gave him a water bottle he noisily gurgled the water slopping half of it onto his chin refreshed by the water the man showed yellow teeth in a cocky grin and tipped the canteen for another guzzle his sleeve fell as he raised his arm trout kicked the canteen like a punter and sent it flying into the grass his big hand shot out and gripped the mans hairy wrist even morales was shocked by the unexpected move senor trout this is my wifes watch trout slid the expansion band swatch off youre sure i gave it to her anger flashed in the normally calm eyes ask him where he got it morales asked the question in spanish and relayed the answer he says he bought it trout was through playing games tell him that if he doesnt talk well throw him back in the hole and leave the grin vanished the threat of being tossed back into the ground unleashed a torrent of spanish morales listened nodding hes crazy name is ruiz keeps talking about the devil woman and the dwarf who made the earth swallow him devil woman si he says she broke his nose what happened to this woman he doesnt know he was down in the hole he heard a lot of shooting then quiet he says his friends abandoned him i ask if these amigos are chicleros he says no morales grinned without mirth hes a stinking liar tell him were going to take him up in the helicopter and throw him out if he doesnt tell the truth the man looked at the granitehard expression on the face of the giant gringo and decided he wasnt joking no he said i talk i talk you understand english poco the man said holding his thumb and finger slightly apart in halting english using spanish when words escaped him ruiz admitted he was with a gang of chicleros who came here to steal antiquities they found the woman and the little old man and locked them in the ground where there was no way they could escape but they burrowed out of the earth somehow and threw him into the hole the other chicleros gave chase they never came back to look for him he didnt know what happened to the man and woman trout pondered the report briefly okay get him in the chopper morales handcuffed the man gingerly trying not to touch him then used the toe of his shoe to persuade ruiz to stand they stuffed him into the rear bench seat and morales got in beside him the man exuded a stench so vile the pilot complained morales laughed and said if it got too bad theyd throw ruiz over the side ruiz didnt think it was funny and his eyes grew wide in fear as the helicopter lifted off the ground he wouldnt be giving them any trouble they circled the site a couple of times then picked up the gleam of the river it was barely visible through the trees but with three sets of eyes they were able to trace its course trout couldnt wait to tell gamay her new sobriquet devil woman he hoped that she was still alive to hear it the buzz of the ancient outboard motor was so loud gamay didnt hear the helicopter until it was practically overhead even then it was chis upturned face that alerted her to the arrival of company she jammed the tiller over and aimed the pram toward the shore bumping into a grassy bank under a protective canopy of overhanging branches from the air the boat would be almost impossible to see through the thick greenery gamay took out extra insurance and nudged the pram into a huge fern bush she didnt want the early morning sunlight reflecting off the aluminum hull an instant later the air overhead was filled with the slashing of rotors flashes of a shiny redandwhite fuselage came through openings in the dense foliage as the helicopter skimmed the treetops it never dawned on gamay that within hours of learning she was missing her husband would return to the yucatan commandeer a helicopter and now be hovering a few hundred feet above her head since arriving in this place shed had her hair almost pulled out by the roots been threatened with rape been stuffed into a cave to die crawled through dark and practically airless tunnels and been used for target practice there was no reason to believe the people who had treated her so badly had not brought in air support to increase her misery she breathed a sigh of relief as the sound of the helicopter receded in the distance and moments later they headed out into the river again after disposing of yellow teeth gamay and chi had bolted for the woods dodging the bullets that whizzed around them and scrambled down the slope to the river finding three battered aluminum prams lined up side by side on shore they shoved two boats adrift then piled into the third got the outboard motor going and made a dash for safety traveling an entire day without incident they spent a quiet night pulled over to the side of the river and got an early start the next morning the helicopter made gamay realize their smooth escape and peaceful passage had lulled them into a false sense of security now they kept a sharp eye on the sky and gamay steered dose to the rivers edge there was no further sign of the helicopter but the propeller tangled in vegetation and she had to angle the boat into shore to clear the blades of weeds the job should have meant no more than a minute or two of delay when gamay went to restart the motor it played hard to get she couldnt figure it the antique fifteenhorsepower mercury didnt look like much with its sandblasted engine housing yet it worked fine before they turned it off she was trying to figure out what the problem was when they heard voices in spanish coming from upriver nothing on the face of the earth is more frustrating than a cranky outboard motor gamay thought especially when the recalcitrant hunk of metal is all that stands between you and disaster gamay braced her foot against the transom hoping to placate the malevolent spirit inhabiting the machine she smiled prettily whispered please and pulled the starter cord with all her might the motor responded with a soggy poppop an asthmatic gasp a wet sigh then silence broken by gamays cry of pain as she fell back and scraped her knuckles on the hard metal seat she unleashed a stream of blasphemies that turned the air blue as she called down the furies on dumb stubborn machines everywhere professor chi was in the bow clutching an overhanging branch so the pram would not drift out of control with the lazy current while gamay fussed and fumed over the outboard sweat dripped off her chin with her mouth set in a square of anger snakelike tendrils of dark red hair framing her features she could have modeled for an ancient greek sculpture of medusa whats worse she knew how gorgonish she looked primping would have to wait their crude attempt to sabotage their pursuers had apparently failed they couldnt have known that setting the boats adrift wasnt enough that one pram would catch on a mot that the other would drift back to shore now the first of those boats was coming around a bend emerging from the morning mists followed seconds later by the second there were four men in each boat including the two she had dubbed poncho and elvis poncho was leading the assault standing in the bow of the lead boat brandishing a handgun it was clear from his excited shouts that he had caught sight of the quarry the boats were drawing nearer she willed her eyes back to the motor and discovered the choke had been pushed in she pulled out the plastic knob and yanked the cord again the motor stuttered then caught when she adjusted the throttle slightly they pushed off into the river aiming for the middle where it was deepest although it was also where theyd be most vulnerable she looked back again the boat in the lead was breaking away from the other maybe it had more horsepower or possibly its motor could be running smoother it began to inch closer in an agonizing slowmotion pursuit before long it would be close enough for the riflemen kneeling in the bow to pick them off smoked puffed from a gun muzzle pancho had feed off a couple of quick shots more for show than effect either his aim was off or they were out of range because the bullets never came near then she lost sight of their pursuers around a bend it was only a matter of time minutes really before they would be literally dead in the water hack gamay whipped around at the unexpected noise chi had found his trusty machete in the bottom of the pram he was using it to cut down a large branch from the bowers arching low overhead another silvery blur of steel another branch fell into the river chi swung his machete like a madman more branches fell in a great tangle to either side of the boat then drifted together in a floating dam of interlocking branches the improvised floating breastworks fetched up on a midriver sandbar the helmsman on the lead boat didnt see the intertwined boughs until it was too late the pram came around the curve at full tilt he tried to turn aside instead the boat slammed sideways into the blockage a chiclero leaned out to push off and discovered newton was right when he said every action had a reaction his body was stretched between the boat and the branches he splashed into the water there were loud shouts and confusion as the second boat slammed into the first a gun went off sending a wild shot into the forest startled birds darkened the sky in a chittering chattering cloud yes gamay yelped triumphantly nice move professor from the nascent smile on the mayans otherwise poker face it was clear that he was pleased with both the effect of his labors and the praise i knew my harvard education would come in handy one day he said modestly gamay grinned and swung the tiller to avoid the shoaling along the sides of the river but she was far from sanguine it occurred to her after her momentary elation that she had absolutely no idea where they were going or whether they had enough gas to get them there she checked the tank half full or half empty if she were thinking like a pessimist which might be the more prudent frame of mind in their precarious situation after a hurried conference they decided to go flat out for a time to put as much distance as possible between the pram and their pursuers then they would rely on river drift not to put too fine a point on our predicament professor but do you have any idea where this river goes the professor shook his head this stream isnt even on the map my guess is that were headed south simply because as you pointed out there are few rivers in the north they say that when youre lost following a river will eventually bring you to civilization gamay said without conviction ive heard that also that moss grows on the north side of trees its been my experience that moss grows all around a tree you must have been a girl scout i always had more fun playing with boys brownie was as far as i got the only woodcraft i recall is how to cut a stick to toast marshmallows over an open fire you never know when something like that will come in handy actually im not too eager to encounter civilization especially if it comes in the form of more chicleros is that a possibility the ones who are chasing us arrived after we were put in the cave this means they came from not very far away possibly a base camp or they could have been on their way upriver when we ran into their buddies either way i think its best that we prepare for the worst that we will be caught between two unfriendly groups gamays eyes lifted to the patches of blue sky that were beginning to show through holes in the vegetation do you think that helicopter was working with this gang possibly although in my experience these thieves are very much lowtech it doesnt take sophisticated equipment to dig up antiquities and transport them through the forest as you saw from the ease by which we escaped the helicopter the simpler the better we had nature on our side before were coming more into the open and might want to think about what to do if it comes back gamay switched the motor off well drift for a while maybe we can think up a plan if we dont have this thing buzzing in our ears the boat ride was almost idyllic with the outboard silent there were flashes of bright feathers in the impenetrable greenery that d them in the high bankings on either side of the river showed that it was an old waterway that had cut its way through the limestone over a long period as if mindful of its advanced years it snaked through the woods at a slow but steady pace varying in width the water bright billiard table green where the sun struck it dark and spinachy in the shadows it didnt take long for nature to lose its charm once gamays stomach started to rumble she realized they hadnt eaten since the day before and remarked wistfully that it was too bad they hadnt made more spam sandwiches chi said he would see what he could do he had her pull over to the banking and whacked away at a bent bush with his machete the berries were tart but filling the river was covered with a green algae once the scum was brushed away the water was dear and refreshing their idyll was ended by the whine of approaching outboard motors the boats reappeared a couple of hundred yards behind them again one was in the lead gamay started the motor and gave it full speed they were on a straight comparatively wide stretch of river that allowed for no dance at trickery the chase boat inched forward and the distance between them slowly decreased it would be only minutes before they were in easy rifle range the boats grew closer together cutting the distance by a third then half gamay was puzzled the chicleros had not raised their weapons they looked like a bunch of guys on a river cruise chi called out dr gamay gamay turned and saw the professor in the bow staring straight ahead she heard a low rumble in the distance what is it she said rapids the boat was beginning to pick up speed even though she hadnt touched the throttle the air was cooler than before and damp with haze within moments the rumble changed to a roar and through the mists hanging over the river she saw white foam and the sharp points of black shiny rocks she thought of the boats flat bottom and had a vague image of a can opener ripping through thin aluminum the river had narrowed and the tons of water squeezing into this natural funnel spout had essentially transformed a lazy stream into a raging sluiceway she looked back the boats had stopped and were circling in the river their pursuers obviously knew about the rapids thats why they hadnt shot at them why waste ammunition well never make it past those rocks gamay yelled over the earsplitting thunder of rushing water im going to steer for land well have to make a run for it in the forest she pushed the tiller over and the pram angled toward the shore thirty feet from the riverbank the motor coughed and conked out gamay tried to start it again but with no success she quickly twisted off the gas tank top all that was left was vapors professor chi had grabbed a single oar and was trying to scull the boat the current was too strong and jerked the oar from his hand the boats pace accelerated and it began to spin around gamay watched helplessly as the pram was carried like a woodchip toward the toothlike rocks and the boiling white water it was trouts idea to go back along the river moments before the helicopter pilot had tapped the fuel gauge and the dial of his wristwatch sign language saying they were running low and had to head back trouts thoroughness as a scientist came from working as a youngster with his uncle henry a skilled craftsman who built wooden boats for the local fishermen long after plastic hulls came into style measure twice cut once henry would say between puffs on his overripe pipe in other words doublecheck everything you do even years later trout couldnt start a complicated computer task without hearing his uncles voice whispering in his ear it was a natural reaction to suggest through morales that they go back along the river slowly this time in case they had missed something on their first pass they flew at less than one hundred fifty feet cruising at a moderate speed dipping lower when the river opened up the jetranger was highly maneuverable having been designed as a light observation helicopter and in its military incarnation saw duty as the kiowa before long they came up on the rapids he had seen on the way out trout looked down at the stretch of white water then beyond it to the calm river just above the cataract where he saw a curious sight two small boats lay close together back from the rapids apparently sitting there while a third drifted downstream someone in the bow was paddling furiously but the strong current drew the third boat on a path toward the rapids trout spotted the flash of dark red in the boats stern there was no mistaking that hair especially with the sun glinting off it in rusty highlights there was also no doubt in his mind of what was about to happen within seconds the helpless boat would pick up speed and be sucked into the toothy maw and ground to pieces trout yelled at morales tell the pilot to push them back with the helicopters downdraft morales had been watching the unfolding disaster with fascination now he tried to relay trouts statement to the pilot the translation was beyond his grasp of english he shot off a few words in spanish then shrugged in frustration trout pounded the pilots shoulder he pointed emphatically at the helpless boat then twirled his forefinger in a circle and made a shoving gesture to trouts surprise the pilot caught on right away to his crude sign language message he nodded vigorously nosed the chopper into a glide and cut speed to a walk until they had positioned themselves between the drifting boat and the crest of the rapids where the river narrowed the hovering copter descended until the downdraft from the rotors whipped the surface like a giant electric egg beater and created a frothy dishshaped depression waves rippled out in great concentric cirdes the first undulation hit the pram slowed its speed then stopped it completely and began to deflect the light boat toward the shore above the rapids the long whirling rotor was ill fitted for a surgical operation waves produced by the powerful air blast rocked the pram and threatened to capsize it trout whod been leaning out the window could see what was happening he yelled at the pilot and jabbed his thumb upward the helicopter began to rise too late a wave caught the boat and flipped it over the crafts occupants disappeared beneath the surface trout waited for their heads to appear but he was distracted by a sharp rapping noise and a shout from the pilot he turned to see a spiders web of shatter lines in the windshield which had been clear when he last looked at the center of the lacy pattern was a hole they were being shot at a bullet must have passed right between them and hit the bulkhead inches above the head of rutz who was staring bugeyed the chiclero began to shout in rapidfire spanish despite the warnings of morales to shut his mouth morales stopped wasting his breath leaned over and crashed his fist into the mans jaw knocking him unconscious then the mexican policeman drew his pistol and fired away at the boats another sharp rap came against the fuselage as if somebody were banging the metal skin with a ballpeen hammer trout was torn with indecision he wanted to wait and see what happened to gamay but he knew the chopper was a sitting duck the pilot took matters into his own hands cursing angrily in spanish he set his jaw and pushed the throttle ahead the helicopter surged forward and homed in on the other boats like a cruise missile trout could see the men below frozen in disbelief until they were blasted out of the boats by the powerful rotor thrust the down draft tossed the empty prams as if they were balsa woodchips at the last second the pilot pulled the jetranger up in a sharp climb then banked it around for a second sortie the maneuver was unnecessary the overturned boats were sinking heads bobbed in the water as the men struggled fruitlessly against the current that was drawing them into the rapids gamays boat had already started its passage through the foamy hell and a dill went up trouts spine as he thought of what could have happened he was still worried about gamay there was no sign of her or the other figure whom he assumed was professor chi the pilot made a couple of quick circles then pointed to his fuel gauge again trout nodded there was no place to put the chopper down he reluctantly gave the pilot thumbs up and they headed away from the river trout was busy formulating plans in his mind and didnt notice how long they were airborne before he heard the engine cough the chopper lost speed for an instant then seemed to regain it only to have the engine cough again the pilot fiddled with his instruments then put his finger on the fuel gauge empty he leaned forward scanning the unbroken jungle for a place to put down the engine gagged like a cholera victim the hacking stopped then came a sputter followed by the frightening sound of silence as the engine stopped completely and they began to drop out of the sky like a hailstone dont move dr gamay chis voice soft yet insistent penetrated the gauzelike fog gamay slowly rifted her gluey eyelids she had the odd feeling that she was swimming in a quivering sea of green jello the gelatinous blobs became more sharply defined the blurs resolving into leaves and blades of grass senses clicked slowly into place after sight came taste a bitterness in her mouth then touch reaching up to the damp stickiness of her scalp encountering a wet pulpiness as if her brain were exposed her hand jerked back in reflex fingers dug into her shoulder dont move again or youll die old yellow beard is watching us chis voice was calm but tense her arm froze in midair she was lying on her left side chi behind her out of sight but close enough so she could feel his breath in her ear dont see anyone she said her tongue felt thick directly in front of you about fifteen feet quite beautiful in a deadly way remember to be still hardly daring to blink gamay scanned the grass letting her eyes come to rest on a discolored dump that materialized into a pattern of blackedged triangles set against olive gray that marked the slender coils of an extremely long snake the arrowshaped head with the yellowish chin and throat was elevated she was close enough to see the vertical eye pupils the heat sensing loreal pits that looked liked extra nostrils even the long black tongue flicking in and out what is it she said scientific curiosity overriding her fear barba amarilla a big one from the looks of it what some people call ferdelance ferdclance gamay knew enough about snakes to realize she was facetoface with a killer goosebumps rose on her skin she felt extremely exposed what should we do she whispered watching the flat head moving back and forth as if in time to unheard music dont panic it should move soon to get out of the direct sunlight probably into that patch of shade if it comes this way stay where you are and ill distract it gamay was leaning on her elbow a position that had grown uncomfortably painful and she wondered how long she could remain that way she wanted the snake to move but on the other hand she didnt want it heading in her direction the snake made up its mind a few minutes later and began to uncoil to its full length as chi said it was a big one as long as a man was tall it slithered silently through the grass to the shade cast by a small tree and took up residence next to chis faithful machete which was leaning against the trunk you can move now its sleeping sit up slowly she turned to see chi on his knees he put down the boulder he was clutching how long was it there about a half hour before you woke up usually snakes will retreat if you give them a chance but you can never tell with yellow beard especially if you disturb its sleep it can be quite aggressive he can have my machete if he wants it how do you feel okay except that someones been using my head as a football whats this mush where my hair used to be i made a poultice of medicinal leaves the pharmacy was closed how long have we been here she said rubbing the arm shed been leaning on to get the circulation back a few hours you slept off and an the bitter taste you have in your mouth is a motbased restorative you got a nasty bump on a rock when the boat went over vague memories of white roaring water came flooding back the rapids why arent we dead chi pointed to the sky you dont remember the helicopter the fragments of memories were jumbled like a boxful of jigsaw puzzle parts she and the professor were in the pram out of gas the strong current was pulling them toward the rocks then the roar of the deadly water was drowned out by a clatter the redandwhite chopper they had sighted earlier circled above the river gamay remembered thinking that they were dead with the armed chicleros behind them the boiling rapids ahead and the helicopter above then the aircraft swooped down like a valkyrie and hovered just off the water between the pram and the rapids downdraft from the spinning rotors chewed up the river in a big circle and created waves that kicked the pram out of the current and sent it in toward shore but the blast from the chopper dangerously rocked the light aluminum craft with the grassy shoreline only a few yards away the pram pitched over gamay was catapulted out of the boat like a projectile from a siege machine then bang her head hit something hard her vision went squirrely and her teeth dunked together a bolt of white lightning then blissful darkness the helicopter saved us she said apparently so you would have been fine if you hadnt tried to split a rock with your head it was only a glancing blow but enough to knock you out i dragged you onto shore then through the bushes to this place i gathered the roots and leaves to make the poultice you slept fitfully through the night and may have had some strange dreams the tonic i gave you is something of a hallucinogen gamay recalled an odd dream paul was high above her calling out her name the words appearing in a cartoon dialogue balloon before he disappeared into a vapory cloud thanks for everything gamay said wondering how the diminutive middleaged professor managed to haul her from the water and into the forest what about the men who were after us the professor shook his head i didnt pay much attention to them with all the confusion i had my hands full getting us to safety i think i heard some shots but its been quiet ever since maybe they think were dead what do we do now i was pondering the same question when our scaly friend arrived it depends on how long his nap is id like to retrieve my machete in this country it could mean the difference between life and death you rest for a while if yellow beard doesnt wake up well discuss another plan i came across a path probably what the chicleros used to get around the rapids that we can explore later in the meantime we might want to move farther away in case hes grumpy when he awakens that was fine with gamay with chis help she stood her legs were shaky and she felt like a newborn foal she looked around and saw that they were in a small sundappled clearing protected by trees and bushes they moved to the far side of the clearing where chi removed her poultice and pronounced her bumps and bruises practically gone he said he would pluck some berries to fill their stomachs while they waited for the snake to finish his power nap still tired gamay lay back on the grass and shut her eyes she came awake a moment later a branch had snapped chi would never be so noisy she sat up and looked around the professor stood at the edge of the clearing with a berryladen branch in his hand behind him was the chiclero leader gamay had named pancho he was a far cry from the figure whod ordered them imprisoned in a cave the slickeddown hair looked like an osprey nest and his white clothes were dirty and torn his big pale belly showed through the rips and tears the sneering smile was gone too replaced by a mask of rage the pistol in his hand was the same one hed waved around on their first encounter though and it was pointed at the back of the professors head the man put down the pack hed been carrying and snarled at chi in spanish the professor moved next to gamay they stood there side by side the gun barrel shifted from chi to gamay then back again he wants me to tell you that he is going to kill us to avenge his men chi said first me then he will have his way with you on my body what is it with these guys gamay snapped no offense professor but a lot of your countrymen seem to have their brains between their legs the start of a smile started on panchos face gamay gave the big man a coquettish grin as if the proposition appealed to her maybe she could buy time for the professor and get close enough to this goon to do serious damage to his libido chi was a jump ahead of her he turned his head slightly stared at the machete against the tree and leaned his body forward slightly as if he were going to make a dash for it gamay knew chi well enough to see the movement was uncharacteristically clumsy as if he wanted to catch panchos attention the ploy worked pancho followed chis gaze to the long knife leaning against the tree and his mouth widened into its toothy smile still keeping his eyes and gun on the professor he sidestepped across the clearing and leaned over to pick up the machete the ground exploded in a blur of black triangles alerted by the heavy footfall the snake was in striking position when the man reached for the machete it sank its long fangs into his neck then struck swiftly again emptying the rest of its venom sac into his arm the gun barrel came around and the stricken man shot the snake several times turning it into a bloody redandgreen mass then he touched the twin puncture wounds next to his carotid artery his face turned bonewhite his eyes widened in horror and his mouth opened in a silent scream be stated terrified at chi and gamay then staggered into the bushes chi stepped forward careful to avoid the fangs that mere biting at the air in the snakes death throes and followed the chicleros trail moments later gamay heard another shot when chi reappeared the gun in his hand was smoking he saw the expression of revulsion on her face tucking the pistol into his pants he came over and took gamays hand the stony cast to his features had disappeared and his eyes had that kind grandfatherly expression the chiclero killed himself he explained patiently he knew death from the barbas bite is very painful the venom destroys the red blood cells and breaks down vessels there is bleeding from the mouth and throat painful swelling vomiting and spasms as the body goes into shock even with the neck bite it could have been an hour or two remember before you feel too sorry for him he wanted us to die in the cave and later in the river gamay shook her head numbly chi was right the chicleros death was unfortunate but of his own doing what an extraordinary man the professor was how the spaniards ever conquered the maya was a mystery to her her survival reflexes kicked into gear we should move she said glancing around there may be others who heard the shots chi picked up his machete and the dead mans pack the river is our only chance even if we knew where we were it would be risky to try a trek over land he glanced at the bloodied body of the snake as you saw there are creatures in the forest far more deadly than chicleros you lead ill follow gamay agreed with no argument they set off through the thick forest chi maneuvering with his internal compass until they came to a path about a yard wide that was so beaten down that the white limestone was exposed this is the portage trail i told you about wont we risk running into someone if we use it im not so sure remember what the big man said about avenging his men ill play scout stay back and if i signal get off the trail as quickly as you can they set off through the forest the trail running roughly parallel to the river which sparkled through the trees gamay walked behind the professor their progress was uneventful the only sign of life other than the raucous calls of the birds was a tree sloth that looked down with lazy eyes from an overhanging bough chi stopped signaled her with a wave to come forward then disappeared around a curve in the trail when she caught up the professor was standing on a small sandy beach three prams identical to the one they had lost were drawn up under a sapling and palm leaf structure that would have kept them hidden from anyone on the river or in the air in contrast to her last view of the river at its angriest the surface was back to its calm brownishgreen self it looks as if they kept boats on both sides of the rapids chi observed they could carry the goods along the path around the rough water gamay was only half listening she had walked back from the river to examine the cold coals of a campfire and noticed a platform built up on stilts a flatroofed structure like a childs tree house had been constructed on the platform she opened the door which was latched but not locked and peered inside she saw several gasoline tanks and a large metal cooler she pushed back the lid professor chi she called out ive found something important chi came trotting over and when he saw the blue can she was holding the widest grin she had ever seen crossed his face spam he whispered reverently there was more than spam in the cooler chest there were canned vegetables and juices bottled water and tortillas sealed in plastic boxes sardines and canned corned beef for variety the primitive shed had flashlights and tools the waterproof matches were a real treat as was a portable camp stove soap too each taking a different section of riverside they washed their bodies and clothes which dried quickly in the hot sun after their bath and a refreshing meal of improvised hash and eggs chi explored the area while gamay consolidated their food and supplies it was eerily quiet but they decided not to stay long they loaded the boat and sabotaged the others sinking them under rocks then hiding the outboards in the woods after testing to see which motor ran best then they got in the boat and pushed out into the river keeping the motor at low speed above a quiet idle using just enough power to stay ahead of the current they had gone only less than a mile when the river made a sharp dogleg to the right caught in a pocket where the riverbed curved along with weeds and driftwood were two overturned aluminum prams whose hulls were dented and ripped open scattered among them were the stinking bodies of men bloating in the broiling sun chi muttered a prayer in spanish my guess is that this is where we would be if wed gone through the rapids gamay said putting her hand over her nose they were nowhere near the rapids when we last saw them thats what i thought she said with a shake of her head something must have happened while we were dealing with an overturned pram conrads heart of darkness came to her the scene where kurtz the civilized man turned savage whispers on his deathbed the horror the horror with kurtzs words echoing in her head gamay pointed the pram down river and hiked up the throttle gamay wanted to put miles between them and this place of death before night fell even though she had no idea whether new horrors lay ahead washington dc when perlmutter called and asked if they could get together for brunch instead of dinner austin was pleased on two counts the portly archivists willingness to settle for a mere lunch at kinkeads a popular washington dining spot on pennsylvania avenue meant perlmutters research had hit pay dirt and a lunch bill would take a smaller bite out of austins wallet than a sixcourse dinner or so austin thought until perlmutter selected a bordeaux and began picking items off the menu as if he were ordering dim sum in a chinese restaurant i wouldnt want you to think youre taking advantage of me by only having to buy lunch rather than dinner perlmutter said explaining his extravagance of course not austin replied wondering how he would sneak the bill for perlmutters binge past the keeneyed numa expense account auditors he breathed an inward sigh of relief when perlmutter put the menu aside very good well after we chatted on the phone i called my friend juan ortega in seville don ortega is one of the leading experts on columbus and since you seemed in something of a hung i thought he might provide a shortcut through the mass of information available i appreciate that julien ive read ortegas books and found them insightful was he of help yes and no perlmutter said he answered some questions and raised others perlmutter handed austin the documents ortega had faxed from spain read these at your leisure in the interests of time ill recap my conversation with don ortega and summarize what youll find herein perlmutter crystallized his findings stopping only to nibble now and then at a roll a fifth voyage of discovery austin mused that would certainly shake up the historians and call for an update of the history books whats your professional opinion was the letter a fraud perlmutter cocked his head in thought laying a forefinger along his fleshy cheek i read it several times and i still cant give you a definitive answer kurt if it is a forgery it is a damned clever one i compared it to other authenticated columbus documents and las casas writings the style the syntax the penmanship are consistent and as you pointed out why would anybody go through the trouble to steal a phony document why indeed the waiter brought the wine to their table perlmutter held the glass to the light swished its contents around inhaled the bouquet and finally took a sip he closed his eyes superb as i knew it would be he said with a beatific smile truly a legendary year austin tried the wine ill have to agree with you julien he put the glass aside and said you mentioned a reference in the letter about columbus being contrite over the death of the five what do you make of that the blue eyes danced with excitement im surprised you didnt catch that right away i dug through my library and came across a strange story froma source named garcilaso de la vega it may shed light he claimed that seven years before columbus set sail on his historic first voyage a spanish ship was caught in a storm off the canaries and came ashore on a caribbean island of the seventeenman crew five survived they repaired the ship and returned to spain columbus heard of their adventure and invited them to his house where they were entertained lavishly as the festivities wore on they naturally poured out the details of their travails not surprising sailors like to swap sea stories even without a few glasses of vino to loosen their tongues perlmutter leaned his great bulk forward it was much more than a friendly gam this was undoubtedly a wellplanned intelligencegathering operation those simple sailors had no idea they possessed knowledge of incalculable value columbus was trying to organize an expedition and find the funding for it here were eyewitness accounts and navigational information that could open the door to vast riches the crew could provide him with details of current wind direction compass readings latitude the number of days they sailed maybe they had seen the natives wearing gold ornaments think of what that meant their experience not only proved one could sail to china or india which is what columbus thought hed be doing it showed how to get there and back columbus intended to claim new lands for spain he was convinced hed find gold and at the very least meet the great khan and open up a lucrative monopoly trade for spices and other valuable goods he was well aware of marco polos fame and fortune and figured he could do much better no different from the industrial espionage that goes on today austin commented instead of bribes listening devices and prostitutes to gather information on corporate rivals columbus pumped his sources with food and drink he may have pumped them with more than food and drink austin raised an eyebrow all five men died after dinner perlmutter said overindulgence ive been at a few meals that nearly killed me but de la vega had his own ideas he implied that the men had been poisoned he couldnt come right out and say so columbus had powerful connections consider this however it is a historical fact that columbus had a map of the indies on his first voyage he took a sip of wine and paused for dramatic effect is it possible his map was based on what he learned from those unfortunate sailors possible but from what the letter says columbus disavowed their deaths correct he blamed it on this socalled brotherhood los hermanos didnt columbus have a brother yes his name was bartolome but columbus used the word in the plural brothers okay suppose youre right lets give chris the benefit of the doubt he invites these guys to his house to see what information he can get out of them los hermanos take the extra precaution of seeing that they will tell nobody else what theyve seen columbus may be a hustler but hes no killer the incident haunts him a plausible scenario do you have any idea what this brotherhood was julien not a clue ill return to my books after lunch speaking of which ah the thai fish soup perlmutter had spotted the first of many dishes making its way to their table while youre doing that ill ask yaeger to see if he has anything on them in his computer files splendid perlmutter said now i have a question you have a practical rather than a historical knowledge of the sea as i do what are your thoughts on this talking stone columbus mentioned this torleta of the ancients that was described in the letter early navigational techniques have always fascinated me austin said i consider their development to be a huge intellectual leap for mankind our ancestors had to bring abstract concepts such as time space and distance to bear on the problem of getting from one place to another i love the idea of punching a button and having a signal bounced off a satellite tell me exactly where im standing anywhere on the globe but i think we rely too much on electronic gadgets they can break and were less inclined to understand the natural order of things the movement of the stars and sun the vagaries of the sea well then lets put those electronic gadgets aside perlmutter said stand in the shoes of columbus how would you go about using your torleta austin thought about the question for a moment lets back up to his earlier voyage im stranded on an island where im directed to some kind of stone or tablet with strange inscriptions the locals tell me its the key to a great treasure i take it back to spain but nobody can figure out what it is only that it is very old i look at it from a mariners point of view the markings are similar in some respects to the kind of plotting board ive used all my sailing life its too hefty to haul around so i do the next best thing i have charts made based on the inscriptions and set sail only problem is i havent got it quite right theres a gap in my knowledge what sort of gap kurt austin pondered the question its hard to know without an idea of what the torleta actually looks like but ill describe a hypothetical situation suppose im a sailor from columbuss time and somebody gives me a noaa chart the geographical depictions would help me get around but the lines with the longrange navigation coordinates wouldnt make sense to me id know nothing of electronic signals sent out by shore stations or receivers that could translate the signals into pinpoint locations once i was on the water out of sight of land id have to go back to traditional methods a most lucid analysis so what youre saying is that once columbus was at sea he found that the torleta of the ancients was only of limited assistance thats my guess ortegas books say columbus didnt have much faith in the navigational instruments of his day or maybe he simply wasnt competent in their use he was a dead reckoning sailor of the old school it served him fine on his first voyage he knew he needed to be precise on this final trip so he hired someone who could use navigational instruments interesting in view of the last passage in the letter which is written by the ninas assistant pilot there you go austin said its no different from hiring a specialist to do a job today now its my turn to bat a question back to you what do you suppose happened to the stone i called don ortega again and asked him to chase it down his guess is that it was part of the estate luis columbus squandered to raise money to support his degenerate lifestyle ortega will contact museums and universities in spain and if hes not successful he will expand his circle of inquiry to surrounding countries austin was thinking about columbus the sailor how he went back to the nina the doughty little vessel that had served him so well on previous journeys maybe a modernday nina could help carry them to a solution of the mystery the tablet originated on this side of the atlantic austin observed after brunch ill call my archaeologist friend dr kirov and ask if she has ever heard about an artifact like it he chuckled odd isnt it were looking for clues to contemporary murders in events that possibly happened centuries ago not so unusual in my experience the past and present are often the same wars famine tidal waves revolutions plague genocide these happen over and over again only the faces change but enough of such morbid considerations let us turn to happier pursuits perlmutter said beaming i see another course is on its way san antonio texas while austin enjoyed his expensive gourmet lunch joe zavala was sixteen hundred miles away munching a honeyglazed doughnut at a coffee shop on the paseo del rio or riverwalk the picturesque tourist district on the banks of the san antonio river zavala checked hiswatch gulped down the last of his coffee and head away from the river to the business district where he entered the lobby of a tall office building after wrapping up the strategy session zavala had packed an overnight bag and flown to texas hitching a ride on an air force flight to lackland air base from the base he caught a taxi to a downtown hotel yaeger could do wonders with his computer babies but even he admitted timequest was a tough nut to crack sometimes a human eye and brain with their capacity to sense and analyze nuance were far more efficient than even the most sophisticated machine zavala looked up timequest on the lengthy directory of occupants moments later he stepped from the elevator into a spacious lobby whose walls were covered with oversized sepia photographs of the archaeological wonders of the world directly in front of a picture of the great pyramid was a black enamel and steel desk that seemed out of time and place in contrast to the pictorial antiquities even more so was the brunette in her late twenties who sat behind the desk zavala introduced himself handing the receptionist a business card printed that morning at kinkos oh yes mr zavala the travel writer she said you called yesterday she consulted her daybook punched a button on her phone and murmured a message ms harper will see you in a moment youre very lucky to get an appointment on such short notice it would have been impossible if she hadnt had an unexpected cancellation i really appreciate this as i explained i would have called earlier but this was a lastminute thing im out here doing a piece on san antonio night life and thought i could double it up with another travel piece she gave him a friendly smile stop by after you talk to ms harper and i may be able to suggest some hot spots the receptionist was young and darkly attractive and zavala would have been surprised if she didnt know the citys fun places thank you very much he said in his most charming manner that would be a great help the public affairs director of timequest was a handsome and smartly dressed woman in her forties phyllis harper emerged from a corridor and shook zavalas hand with a firm grip then she guided him along thickly carpeted corridors to an office with big windows that offered a panoramic view of the sprawling city and its centerpiece tower of the americas they sat informally on either side of a coffee table thank you very much for your interest in timequest mr zavala i must apologize for only being able to give you a few minutes melody probably told you that i had a brief appointment slotted yes she did i appreciate the fact that you were able to give me any time at all you must be very busy ive got fifteen minutes before my meeting with the executive director she rolled her eyes hes a stickler for promptness in the interests of brevity perhaps i can simply rattle on for ten minutes and allow five minutes if you have any questions the press kit on the organization is quite informative from his jacket pocket zavala extracted a sony minitape recorder he bought at a discount outlet and a notepad picked up that morning in a drugstore fair enough rattle away she gave him a dazzling smile that reminded him how a mature woman with class could often be so much sexier than a young unformed beauty like melody the receptionist timequest is a nonprofit corporation we have a number of goals we wish to promote an understanding of the present and prepare for the future by studying the past we are educative in that we support learning about our world particularly through our inschool programs for the young and our field work we give the ordinary person a chance at an unusual vacation adventure many of our volunteers are retired people so for them we are the fulfillment of lifes dream she paused for breath and went on in addition we support many archaeological cultural and anthropological expeditions we are known to be a soft touch she said with her pleasant smile universities are always calling us for support usually we are glad to give it we use money paid by our volunteers so many of these expeditions are selfsustaining we provide experts or help pay for them we have sponsored expeditions to every corner of the globe in return we ask mainly that we be informed of special discoveries before anyone else most people consider it a small demand for what they get any questions how did the organization start she pointed to the ceiling above her head we are a nonprofit subsidiary of the company that occupies the six floors immediately above us which is halcon industries halcon the spanish word for falcon or bird of prey he shook his head dont know it its an umbrella corporation with many divisions were one of them most of its revenue comes from a diversified portfolio that includes mining mainly but also shipping livestock oil and mohair that certainly is diversified is the company publicly traded no it is wholly owned by mr halcon quite a leap from digging mines to digging in old tombs zavala said it is rather an odd juxtaposition but not really when you think of it the ford foundation has funded esoteric projects that have nothing to do with manufacturing cars mr halcon is an amateur archaeologist from what im told he would have liked to have been a scholar but he was much better as an industrialist he nodded halcon sounds like an interesting person would there ever be a chance of interviewing him perhaps if i gave you advance notice youd have a better chance of interviewing henry ford the dazzling smile again i dont mean to be flip but mr halcon is a very private man i understand she looked at her watch im afraid i have to go she slid a thick folder across the desk this is our press kit give it a read and if you have any more questions please call me id be glad to put you in touch with volunteers who could give you a firsthand account of their experience that would be very helpful maybe i could sign up for an expedition myself theyre not dangerous are they she gave him an odd look we pride ourselves on timequests safety record even in the remotest locations safety is our most important consideration you remember i said many retired people participate in our program she paused those are the expeditions we organize the ones we support with partial funding are on their own but overall our record is very good youre safer on one of our adventures than you are crossing the street in san antonio ill remember that zavala said wondering if ms harper were truly aware of all that went on in her organization theres a calendar of events for the upcoming year in that kit if something interests you let me know and ill see what can be arranged she ushered him back to the lobby shook hands and disappeared down a corridor melody smiled how was your interview short and sweet he looked after the retreating figure she reminds me of that old television commercial where the guy talked like a machine gun melody cocked her head coquettishly well there are always the night spots thanks for the reminder im looking for the really outoftheway places where the younger inside group goes if you dont have other plans maybe i can buy you lunch and we can talk about the night life in this town theres a great restaurant not far from here eclectic and very popular i could meet you there around noon zavala scribbled the directions and took the elevator down to the lobby he went over to the directory again and listed the subdivisions of halcon industries in his notebook there were eight in all mainly concentrated around mining and shipping as the pr director had explained he took the elevator up past timequest and stepped out into a big lobby with a receptionist and muralsized wall pictures of ore carriers halcon shipping he told the receptionist he must have the wrong floor and got back in the elevator he repeated his routine at every other company under the halcon aegis the offices were all pretty much the same except for the murals the receptionists were all young and attractive he pressed the button for the very highest office in the halcon tier but the elevator sped right by it when he got out he was in the hushed precincts of a law firm excuse me he asked the secretary who was plain and efficient looking i just pressed the button for the floor below and ended up here that happens all the time the suites below us are for halcon executives you need a special code to make the elevator go there well if i ever need legal advice ill know where to come he returned to the lobby hoping he hadnt stirred the suspicions of security staff in his onagain offagain elevator rides after the destruction of the federal office building in oklahoma city it would not be wise to be seen casing an office building he went down to ground level caught a cab then another to make sure he wasnt being followed and hung around a bookstore until it was time to meet melody the restaurant was called the bomb shelter and it was decorated with a s theme they sat at a booth made with seats from a desoto convertible melody was a texas girl born and bred in fort worth and had been with timequest about a year over lunch zavala said ms harper was telling me about the big guy mr halcon have you ever met him not in person but i see him every day i stay at the office an extra hour after everybody else leaves so i can do some studying im taking law courses she smiled i dont intend to be a receptionist forever mr halcon stays late too and we leave the same time he comes down in his private elevator and a limo picks him up shed heard halcon lived outside the city but beyond that melody didnt know much about him what does he look like zavala said dark thin rich handsome in a creepy sort of way she laughed maybe its just the light down there in the garage melody was intelligent and witty and zavala felt like a cad when he took her number to set up a tour of night spots he made a note to smooth things out with a call when he got back to washington after lunch he found a library and used the internet to read about halcon industries holdings his findings pretty much conformed to the brief description ms harper had given him then he went to an auto rental place where he rented an ordinarylooking midsized car and picked up a tourist brochure on the alamos might as well absorb some texas history while he waited for his rendezvous with the mysterious mr halcon cambridge massachusetts nina kirov smiled as she placed the telephone in its cradle thinking how interesting her life had become since she had met kurt austin when the platinumhaired man with the linebackers physique and remarkable eyes wasnt plucking her from the moroccan sea or running sting operations in arizona he was popping up with the strangest requests like this one see what she could find out about an artifact probably made of stone perhaps removed by columbus from jamaica on one of his expeditions which may have had a navigational function and might still be in spain waitll doc hears this she thought as she dialed the phone doc was dr j linus orville a harvard professor with more letters behind his name than a can of alphabet soup orville made his lair behind the ivycovered walls at harvards peabody museum he had gained international repute as an ethnologist specializing in mesoamerican culture among cambridge academics he was recognized for his brilliance and his reputation as something of a nutty professor zooming around harvard square on a chopped antique harley davidson was not something done by most tenured professors a few years earlier he gained more widespread notoriety by hypnotizing ufo abductees and announcing publicly that he believed they had been kidnapped by aliens his telephone number had gone into the card file of every freak beat newspaper reporter in the city whenever reporters needed a quick quip on any subject in the universe particularly the weird they could rely on good old doc the harvard professor he carefully kept his more esoteric interests separated from his academic specialty you would never find him claiming that aztec temples were built by refugees from the lost continents of atlantis and mu the hierarchy at harvard would tolerate his oddities every university has its resident fruitcakebut in his own field docs credentials had to remain without blemish some who had noticed that the gleam in orvilles eye was one not of madness but of intense amusement suggested docs eccentricities were well calculated so that he would meet women and be invited to all the right parties doc had forsaken his ufo phase by the time nina met him at one such gathering orville spied her across the room brushed aside the attractive female grad student he was entertaining and made a beeline in ninas direction she had never met him before but recognized his mop of long red hair the style referred to by his students as retro einstein within minutes he was going on about his latest passion past lives nina listened attentively then asked why has everyone who has lived a past life been a king or a queen or other royal figure when most people were probably fleainfested farmers trying to scratch a life out of the mud aha he said eyes practically g with glee a dangerous woman a thinker the answer is very simple these people choose whose body they will inhabit in their new life what do you think of that i think its a lot of hooey and i think i need a refill on my wine would you be so kind i prefer red charmed he said and set off to the bar like an obedient puppy returning with a full glass and a plateful of shrimp and caviar lets not talk about past lives he said i only do that to meet fascinating women you do nina said with genuine shock at his frankness and to get invited to parties it works here i am and here you are im disappointed everyone told me you were pixilated i dont even know how to spell that he said with a sigh you know we are such a dull gray stuffy bunch we professors we take ourselves far too seriously harrumphing about as if we were truly wise men and not just overeducated nerds whats wrong with being a little colorful to make oneself stand out from the crowd theres the added advantage of being shunned by those stodgy old fussbudgets the ufo abductees that was all a sham heavens no i truly believe they believe they were kidnapped some of my colleagues do too theyre just jealous because they werent but lets talk about you ive heard good things about your work and talk they did behind the nutty professors mad facade lurked an interesting and interested person they did not become romantically involved as he would have liked even better they were friends and colleagues who respected each other orville came the voice on the phone doc never said hello hi doc its nina he hated what he called banalities so she cut right to the chase i need your help with an odd request odd is my middle name what can i do for you nina relayed austins query you know that sounds vaguely familiar youre not joking doc nononono it was something in my fortean file orville considered himself a modern day version of charles fort the nineteenthcentury journalist who collected stories about odd happenings such as red snow unexplained lights or frogs falling from the sky why does that not surprise me nina said im always reorganizing the file you never can tell when someone will call arid ask a crazy question he hung up orville was not known for saying goodbye either nina shrugged and went back to her work before long the fax hummed and a single sheet slid out at the top was a handscrawled note ask and ye shall receive love doc it was a copy of a newspaper clip from the boston globe dated march mystery italian artifact on its way to america genoa italy apa mysterious stone tablet unearthed in a dusty museum basement may soon yield its ancient secrets the massive inscribed stela carved with lifesized figures and strange writing was discovered in the museo archeologico florence in march of this year preparations are being made to ship it to the united states where it will be examined by experts the museum was planning an exhibition entitled treasures from the basement to bring to light items from its collection that had languished in storage for decades the stone artifact is in the shape of a rectangular slab giving rise to speculation that it might have been part of a wall it is more than six feet tall four feet wide and a foot thick what have puzzled scholars who have seen it and stirred up controversy in the scientific community are the carvings on one side some maintain that the figures and writing are without a doubt of central american probably mayan origin this is not a great mystery says dr stephano gallo head curator at the museum even if it is mayan it could have been brought back from the americas during the spanish conquest why they transported the stone across the ocean is another question the spanish were primarily interested in gold and slaves not archaeology so someone must have seen some value in this artifact to go to the trouble of moving it it is not like some miniature statue a soldier of cortez might have picked up as a souvenir efforts to learn where the artifact came from have met with limited success the museum catalog indicates that the slab was donated by trustees for the alberti estate the alberti family can trace its maternal lineage to the spanish court during the time of ferdinand and isabella a spokesman for the estate says the family has no information available unlike other items in the collection the alberti family was originally from genoa and purchased many christopher columbus papers and memorabilia from luis columbus grandson of the explorer historians who have scoured records of the four columbus voyages can find no mention of the artifact the stone will soon be on an ocean voyage of its own it will be shipped to the peabody museum at harvard university cambridge mass for study by central american experts this time it will be traveling in style aboard the luxury italian liner andrea doria because of its size and weight it will be shipped in an armored truck that is carrying other valuable items to america the article was illustrated with a photo of the slab taken at a distance to include the whole tablet in the frame an unidentified man stood awkwardly next to the artifact where he was dwarfed by its mass the photographer must have grabbed the nearest body to pose beside the object and give it scale the newspaper was printed back in the days of letterpress and the photo reproduction wasnt very sharp nina could make out faint symbols glyphs and figures carved into the stones surface she examined the picture using a magnifying glass no use the enlarged dot reproduction was even fuzzier than the original she called doc well what do you think he said the important thing is what you think youre the expert in this area well youre right of course orvilles modesty could be underwhelming its tough without seeing the actual thing but it looks to me to be similar to the dresden codex one of the few mayan books that the spanish didnt burn im thinking about the calendar pages cycles of the planet venus and so on venus was very important to the postclassic maya the planet represented kukulcan the lightskinned bearded god the toltecs called quetzalcoatl the feathered serpent the maya plotted the travels of venus practically to the second beyond that its difficult to say without seeing the real thing nothing else not unless i come across a good picture or artistic rendition what about professor gallos comment about this thing being no great mystery oh hes absolutely right the fact that a mayan artifact may have been found in italy is not a big deal no more than the fact that you can walk into the british museum in london and find the elgin marbles from the parthenon the important part of the equation is provenance as you know not just where the artifact was found but how it got there what about the columbus letter i told you about it mentions an object similar to this how does that tie in with the mention of the alberti familys columbus collection you cannot jump to conclusions on the basis of an old newspaper article you also told me there are doubts as to the authenticity of this letter even if the letter were the real mccoy wed need more proof that the objects were one and the same tantalizing thought though it was entirely possible for columbus to have shipped it home without anyone knowing he was known as a devious man some believe he falsified his mileage readings on his first voyage so the crew wouldnt know how far they were from land it would have been in character for columbus to hide something unfortunately we have to remember were scientists not writers of popular semifictional archaeological claptrap orville was entirely right it would be unprofessional to jump to conclusions the italian professor made a good point nina pointed out the spanish were interested in plunder not science true cortez was certainly no napoleon who brought along the scientists who discovered the rosetta stone interesting she too had been thinking about the rosetta stone the pivotal discovery that provided with the same message in greek and egyptian the key to translating hieroglyphics id give almost anything to see this thing in the flesh hmm i wish i could take you up on your inviting offer alas our artifact is not easily obtainable of course how dumb of me the andrea doria it was in a collision with another ship correct the stockholm as a result of that unfortunate incident our artifact lies more than two hundred feet underwater at the bottom of the atlantic we can only hope that the fishes appreciate it too bad perhaps it could prove the existence of atlantis something to make for some catchy headlinesnutty professor strikes again and that sort of thing im sure youll find something equally controversial nina said warmly thanks for your help doc i was glad to hear from you youve been away a lot how about lunch this week nina asked him to call in the morning after she had a chance to check her calendar as soon as she hung up she dialed the number of the boston herald and asked for an extension in the newsroom a female voice answered k t pritchard hi kay tee this is your friendly archaeologist calling for a favor do you have a minute ive always got time for you dr kirov youre in luck i just wrapped up a story but as long as i look as if im working no one will bug me with a new assignment what can i do for you pritchard had used nina as a background source on a prizewinning series she wrote when bostons patrician museum of fine arts unknowingly bought a stolen etruscan vase she was always anxious to pay the favor back nina told the reporter she was looking for any mention of an archaeological artifact being transported from italy on the andrea doria ill check out the morgue and call you back the phone rang about an hour later it was pritchard that was fast nina said with amazement stuffs all on microfilm so it scans pretty quickly there were tons of pieces written on the andrea doria at the time of the accident itself then more on the inquiry but i skipped that the ship carried piles of valuable cargo she was apparently a floating art museum no mention of anything like you described so i flipped to the anniversary editions you know how papers like to memorialize disasters so they can write about them ad nauseam on slow news days i found an article on the thirtieth anniversary it was about heroes and cowards some of the crew bailed while the others should have been given medals anyhow there was an interview with one of them a waiter didnt you tell me this thing was being transported in an armored truck thats right according to the associated press article hmm well anyhow this waiter said he saw an armored truck being robbed as the ship was going down a robbery thats right a group of armed men the truck was in the hold of the ship thats incredible what else did he say nothing the story just slipped out as he was telling the reporter how he went into the hold of the ship looking for a car jack to free one of the victims i called the guy who interviewed him charlie flynn a real war horse hes retired now he tried to pry more info from the guy thought he could make this the lead the untold story sinking ship masked men drama below decks and that sort of thing but he said the guy dammed up wouldnt talk about it changed the subject got very upset asked charlie not to use this in the story he went ahead and did it anyhow thats the way it was in the old days what you said got in the paper not like today with libel lawyers breathing down your neck it was buried though way down at the bottom of the story copy editor probably thought it was too thin on the facts to use up in the lead but interesting enough as a tidbit charlie talked to a few daria survivors to see if he could get the story through another source nobody had ever heard anything about it what was the crewmans name ill fax you the clip but hold on here it is he was italian his name was angelo donatelli do you have an address for him he was living in new york at the time charlie says he ran a fancy restaurant there thats all he knew about the guy say dr kirov is there a story here im not sure kay tee youll be the first to know if there is thats all i ask call me anytime after she hung up nina stared off into space for a few minutes trying to connect a massive stone artifact from the time of columbus with a disaster at sea an armed robbery and a moroccan massacre it was no use it would be easier linking sumerian cuneiform with minoan linear b writing she gave up and called kurt austin washington dc angelo donatelli was suprisingly easy to trace austin simply looked up his name on the internet and found fifteen references including a business week article that described the ragstoriches rise from lowly cocktail lounge waiter to owner of one of new yorks most fashionable restaurants the picture of donatelli conferring with his head chef showed a silverhaired and middleaged man who looked more like a distinguished european diplomat than a restaurateur austin called directory assistance in manhattan and a minute later he was talking to the restaurants friendly assistant mr donatelli is not in today she said when is the best time to get him hes due back from nantucket tomorrow you can try calling here after three pm nantucket austin knew the island off the massachusetts coast well having stopped there several times while sailing to maine he tried to get a nantucket phone number for donatelli it was unlisted a few minutes later he was talking to a lieutenant coffin at the nantucket police department austin identified himself as being with numa and said he wanted to get in touch with angelo donatelli he was banking on the fact that smalltown police know everything and everybody in their community the police officer confirmed that donatelli had a summer home on the island but he was wary whats the national underwater and marine agency want with mr donatelli were pulling together some historic stuff on collisions at sea mr donatelli was aboard the andrea doria when it was hit ive heard that met him a couple of times nice guy ive tried calling him but his number is unlisted yeah most of the people out where he lives kinda like it that way they built those big houses so they can have their privacy i may try to get a flight to the island later today and take my chances on hooking up with him tell you what when you get on island drop by the police station on water street and ask for me i can show you where he lives on a map good cop austin thought he wasnt about to dispense information on one of the islands welltodo property owners without checking austin out in person austin never dreamed nina would track down a lead so quickly with zavala in texas and trout in the yucatan maybe austin could squeeze in a quick interview with donatelli he used his government clout to get a seat with a small commuter airline that ran regular shuttles between washington and nantucket a couple of hours later he was on a puddlejumper flying northeast the flight gave him time to look over the file yaeger had dropped on his desk as austin was leaving his numa office austin had asked the computer whiz to scour his electronic marvels for information on the brotherhood the sixteenth century secret society he and perlmutter had discussed over lunch and to run down any links los hermanos might have had to christopher columbus austin glanced out the window at the ocean sparkling far below then opened the file and read yaegers note hi kurt i think ive got it ive been wading through secret societies up to my eyeballs but the columbus angle narrowed it down i followed up one of those stray facts that go floating across your monitor screen from obscure sources a onesentence footnote that columbus was said to be associated with an outfit called the brotherhood of the holy sword of truth they liked long titles back then cant confirm if he was a member probably not the brotherhood was formed in the s during the spanish inquisition by an archdeacon named hernando perez head of a powerful monastery known for its extreme beliefs heavily into selfflagellation and hair shirts perez was slightly to the right of torquemada who was the head honcho of the inquisition perez picked the most fanatical of his followers from his monastery the brothers made up the trusted core of his outfit perez was mad as a hatter unswerving in his convictions quite happy to use violence and murder to achieve his ends he declared absolution for his guys no matter how much blood they shed for his cause which was to wipe out heretics and get rich doing it by the way they split loot plundered from their victims with the inquisition the brotherhood worked behind the scenes identifying the unfaithful so they could be fed into the inquisitions murder machine sometimes it sent out its own hit squads or for a price it might see that you were spared as long as they could bleed you of money heresy covered a lot of ground which brings in another angle back then you could be burned at the stake for saying columbus discovered america the scriptures never said anything about the american continents it messes with the whole idea of adam and eve so when columbus claimed that he reached india or china the powers that be backed him up the real reasons were political though church and state were the same thing when somebody questioned church dogma it threatened the throne once doubts set in about the churchs teachings on geography the hoi polloi might start asking why they were starving and the bishops and kings were all well fed and before long the mobs would be marching on the palace millions were at stake as well spain wanted the riches o the new world to herself if other countries could prove columbus wasnt the first to discover india rivals of spain like portugal might claim the new lands and riches gold meant new warships and raising armies so were really falling about european domination thats why the inquisition which was the terror instrument of the spanish state made it heresy punishable by burning to believe there was a continent with separate civilizations and that they had contact with the old world before columbus to show you how dangerous the idea was amerigo vespucci was sent on a secret mission by the king to check out the columbus discoveries when vespucci demonstrated columbus had not discovered a short route to india that hed found a new continent and may not have been the first to go there he was called a heretic and warned to recant by making this a capital crime the spanish were admitting tacitly that there had indeed been prior contact torquemada was a sly old devil he said that even if the indians had received a visitor from the west whom they named quetzalcoatl the stranger must have been white and spanish that meant spain had dibs on the new lands even before columbus was born i verified that five sailors died after eating at columbuss house cant prove the brotherhood had anything to do with it could have been food poisoning i couldnt find anything on the brotherhood after the s maybe they went out of business with the inquisition source material enclosed hope this helps the rest of the file contained source documents austin read through the pile of papers and decided the computer genius had done a good job encapsulating his findings the account of the brotherhood was fascinating particularly in its mission to suppress knowledge of contact between the new and the old worlds one problem the brotherhood went out of business more than three hundred years ago the pilots voice announced that the plane was passing near marthas vineyard nantuckets porkchop shape was visible to the east of the vineyard an ocean fog nibbled at the windswept moors and long white strands that edged the island it was easy to see why the island attracted the peglegged captain ahab and reallife quaker whaling captains and ship owners who made their fortunes in the whaling trade nantucket had at its doorstep a saltwater highway that would take its whaling vessels to all the seven seas on voyages that often lasted years austin rented a car at tom nevers airport and drove into town past stately brick houses built with riches made from whale oil the car bumping over the wide main street that was paved with cobblestones once used for ballast in the old sailing ships then along water street bordering the harbor until he came to the police and fire station lieutenant coffin was a tall stringbean of a man with high cheekbones and a prominent bony nose that had seen too much sun his mouth dropped open in surprise when austin identified himself you got here in a hurry he said sizing up the husky man with the prematurely white hair you numa guys have private jets some of us do i lucked out in catching a flight it was a good excuse to get out of washington cant blame you for that the islands awfully pretty this time of year youre missing the crowds too the hazel eyes narrowed just so youll know i called numa back after i talked to you cant blame you for that coffin smiled seems like youre on the upandup were pretty easygoing but we cant be too careful nantuckets got a lot of rich folks who own big houses and pay major taxes dont see a burglar asking the police where the house is he plans to rob but you never know good thing you called people out there kinda look after each other theyd give you directions to the other side of the island ill show you how to get to his house he slid a tourist map across the counter take the polpis road till you get to a sand driveway with a ship on the mailbox coffin drew the route with a yellow marker austin thanked the police officer and followed his directions out of town to a narrow winding mad that ran through scrub pine forest and past farms and cranberry bogs at the mailbox which was surmounted by a metal rendering of a blackandwhite ocean liner austin turned onto the sand road and drove through stunted forest that turned into rolling headland the strong smell of the sea was carried on the ropy tendrils of fog he had seen from the air the big house loomed suddenly from the fog it looked deserted no vehicles outside no lights in the windows even though darkness was falling austin left the car in the horseshoeshaped crushed shell driveway followed a walkway bordered by an expansive and wellmanicured lawn to the wide open porch and rang the front doorbell chimes echoed inside no answer maybe the restaurant manager had it wrong or perhaps donatelli changed his plans and went back to new york earlier than expected austin frowned this could be a timewasting wild goose chase hed known from the start that he was grasping at a straw trying to connect a robbery at sea decades before with the killings of archaeologists he wondered if he could catch a flight back to dc oh hell hed get home just as fast if he stayed the night and flew out first thing in the morning with his decision made austin decided to explore the grounds he left the veranda and walked around the house nantucket had become afflicted with a plague of trophy houses so big they looked like small hotels built by wealthy people who saw square footage as a way of oneupping their neighbors donatellis place was large and the builder had managed to incorporate italianate architectural features in with the more traditional silvergray shingles and white trim but it was all done in good taste behind the house was a fairsized vegetable garden and a childrens swing and slide set austin followed the sound of the breaking surf across a wide lawn to the edge of a sandy cliff and stood for a moment at the top of a weatherbeaten stairway that led down to the beach the beach was obscured and ocean sound muffled by the fog but he could hear distant rollers slapping against the shore he turned and looked back at the house in the fog and waning light he could barely see the place figuring he had done all he could austin returned to the car and wrote a note that included his telephone number asking donatelli to call him as soon as possible he trudged back to the front door lowtech communication but it might work he would follow it up with a phone call when he got back to his office he climbed onto the broad porch and tucked the rolledup note under the ornate door knocker thinking the brass weight would keep the paper from blowing away he realized he had more important things than the wind to worry about hard cold metal pressed against the back of his neck then came the unmistakable click of a very large gun being cocked until then there had been no sound not even a footfall hands up a harsh voice said dont turn around the man spoke with an accent austin slowly lifted his hands mr donatelli dont talk the man said emphasizing his order with a hard jab to the neck a practiced hand frisked austin deftly slipping his wallet out of his pocket satisfied austin carried no weapon the man ordered him to climb the outside stairs leading from the porch to a second story deck that wrapped around three sides of the house the fog had closed in with a vengeance and in the dimming light austin would not have seen the figure leaning against a railing if his attention had not been caught by the orange glow of a cigarette and the smell of strong tobacco sit said the man with the gun austin did as he was told plunking into a deck chair that was damp with moisture keeping his gun leveled at austin the man spoke in italian to the smoker they conferred for a minute the figure in the fog spoke who are you my name is kurt austin and im with the national underwater and marine agency pause youre consistent anyhow thats the same story you gave lieutenant coffin the voice had an accent but it wasnt as thick as that of the gun carrier you talked to coffin of course the police try to keep their summer residents happy especially those who are big contributors to their equipment fund ive requested that he let me know if anyone ever asks for me he even offered to come out here with you i told him i could handle the situation by myself then you are mr donatelli ask the questions another sharp jab in the spine who are you really my wallet has identification identification can be forged donatelli was going to be a tough sell lieutenant coffin called numa and verified that i am who i said i am i have no doubt you are who you claim its what you really are that interests me austins patience was eroding make believe i dont understand what youre talking about mr donatelli why would a big government agency like numa want to tally to me i run a restaurant in new york the only thing i have to do with the ocean is the seafood i buy from fulton fish market reasonable question you were on the andrea doria lieutenant coffin said you mentioned the doria thats old news isnt it we were hoping you might have some information bearing on a case were working on tell me about this case mr austin you may put your hands down but remember that my cousin antonio is from sicily and like most sicilians he trusts nobody he is quite good with the lupara especially at close range lupara was the sawedoff shotgun that used to be the choice of the sicilian mafia before they went to automatic weapons and car bombs an antique but still deadly before i start austin said evenly id appreciate it if you told cousin tony that if he doesnt stop sticking me in the neck his lupara is going to end up where the sun dont shine austin had no way to carry out his threat but it had been a long day and he was tired of getting jabbed donatelli translated for the gunman antonio stepped away and stood off to one side the gun still leveled at austin a slit that could have been a mouth opened into what might have been a smile a cigarette lighter flared in the darkness showing donatellis deepset eyes now tell us your story mr austin so he did the whole thing started in morocco austin began from there he worked his way to the present explaining how the trail had led to donatelli one of our researchers came access your name in a newspaper article when i read that you had seen an armored truck robbery on the ship i wanted to talk to you donatelli was silent for a moment then he spoke in italian to his cousin the stocky figure whod been standing next to austin moved silently through the sliders and a second later a light came on inside the house let us go inside and be comfortable mr austin its damp out here bad for the bones i must apologize i thought you were one of them they would never bother to concoct such a fantastic story so it must be true austin stepped inside donatelli gestured to a plush chair next to the large fireplace eased into an opposite chair and clicked a remote control a gas fire huffed on in the hearth the heat penetrating the glass screen felt good austin was covered with moisture that had nothing to do with the dew point his eyes rose to the mantel and rested on a minutely detailed scale model of the andrea doria the model was only part of the collection of memorabilia photos and paintings even a flotation device that was sprinkled around the spacious living room all having to do with the doria donatelli was studying him the flickering light from the fireplace bathed the still handsome features of a man in his sixties the thick head of wavy hair combed straight back was grayer than it appeared in the business magazine photo in general donatelli had aged well he was still trim and in the expensivelooking pale blue running suit and new balance running shoes he looked as if he worked at keeping fit cousin antonio was the exact opposite he was short and squat with a shaved head and watchful eyes set in a face that looked as if it had been used for a punching bag the nose was broken the ears cauliflowered and the sallow skin covered with a lacework of scars he was dressed in a black shirt and black slacks he had reappeared carrying a tray with two brandy glasses and austins wallet on it the waiter image was diminished somehow by the shotgun strapped onto his shoulder grappa donatelli said it will burn the dampness from our bones austin tucked the billfold back into his pocket and tried the liquor the italian firewater seared austins throat it felt good donatelli took a sip and said how did you find me here mr austin i left strict instructions with my office not to tell anyone where i was they said at the restaurant that you were on the island the older man smiled so much for my security measures donatelli took another sip and stared silently into the fire after a minute he affixed austin with his penetrating eyes it wasnt a robbery he said flatly did the newspaper get it wrong i called it that for convenience in a robbery the thieves take something these thieves took nothing except lives with a sharp memory for detail and touches of humor donatelli related the events of that memorable night in even after all these years his voice trembled during his description of the shifting of the dying ship as he made his way deeper in the flooded darkness he told about the murder of the armored truck guards his flight and his eventual rescue you said the truck carried a stone he mused why would people kill over a stone mr austin maybe its not just any stone he shook his head uncomprehending mr donatelli you said earlier that you thought i was one of them what did you mean the restaurateur considered his words carefully in all the years since the ship went down i have said nothing about what happened the newspaper article was a slip of the tongue i have known in my heart there was a reason for keeping this secret after the article appeared someone called and warned me never to say anything about that incident again a man with a voice likee ice he knew everything about me and my family my wifes hairdresser the names of my children and grandchildren where they lived he said if i ever mentioned that night to anyone i would be killed but first i would see my family destroyed he stared into the fire i come from sicily i believed him i gave no more interviews i asked antonio to come and live with me he was in ah difficulties with the authorities in his home and was glad to relocate from the battered looks of tonys face and the ease with which he handled his weapon austin had a good idea of what tonys difficulties might have been but he didnt pursue the matter i assume the man who called didnt tell you his name or who he was speaking for yes and no thats right no name but he indicated that he was not acting alone that he had many brothers brothers could he have said brotherhood yes i think thats what he said youve heard of them there was an organization called the brotherhood of the holy sword of truth they worked with the spanish inquisition but that was hundreds of years ago the mafia had its start hundreds of years ago donatelli replied with an amused glance at his cousin why is this different the mafias continued existence is pretty well established by its continuing activities yes that is true but even though people in the old country knew there was such a thing and that the black hand had moved with the immigrants to america the police here never knew about la cosa nostra until they found somebody by accident who would break the code of muerto silence or death you are saying that an organization might go on operating in secret for centuries donatelli spread his hands the mafia had murders extortion robbery yet the fbi director hoover swore there was no such thing as la cosa nostra as he pondered donatellis words thinking he had a good point austin surveyed the room youve come a long way since your waiter days he said taking in the luxurious wood paneling and brass fittings i had help after the wreck i decided i never wanted to set foot on a boat again he chuckled there is nothing like the unholy terror of being caught in the hold of a sinking ship to take the romance out of the sea the woman i tried to help unfortunately died of her injuries when i went to the funeral her husband thanked me again and said he wanted to do something in return i said it was my dream to have a small restaurant he gave me some money for a place in new york on the condition that i take business and english courses which he would also pay for i named the restaurant myra after mr careys wife i have opened six more restaurants in large cities across the country theyve made me a millionaire and allowed me to live like this i married a wonderful woman she gave me four sons and a daughter all in the business and many marry grandchildren he sipped the last of his grappa and put the glass down on a table i built this paradise here for my family but also i think because it is near to where the ship went down on foggy nights like this it brings back memories you see mr austin the accident was bad for many people like mr carry but it changed my life for the better why are you telling me this now you could have just sent me on my way my wife died last year after i survived the andrea doria i thought i would live forever i saw in her death a reminder that i am mortal like all men i am not a religious man but i began to think more about making things right those men who were killed in the ships hold maybe the others you told me of they need somebody to speak for them his jaw hardened i will be the spokesman for the dead donatelli looked at the wall clock it is getting late mr austin do you have a place to stay i thought id get a room at a bedandbreakfast not necessary you will have your bed here tonight as my guest and breakfast tomorrow for dinner i will prepare a special pasta tomatoes and zucchini fresh from the garden an invitation like that would be impossible to refuse good he poured them more grappa and hoisted his glass high then when we have eaten and drunk our wine we will find a way to show these people what it means to mess with a sicilian san antonio texas as a mexican american zavala had mixed feelings about texass holiest shrine he admired the courage of the alamos defenders men like buck travis jim bowie and davy crockett whose names were listed on the cenotaph on alamo plaza at the same time he felt sorry for the mexican troops who died in the siege under the inept command of santa anna the texans lost men the mexicans lost texas he wandered around the chapel that was all that was left of the oncesprawling fort checked out the museum and used up the nest of the afternoon watching people at a coffee bar by sixthirty he was parking his rented car in the garage below the timequest building he located the parking area marked off for halcon industries nothing was reserved for the ceo zavalas guess was that everybody in the company was well aware the space was forbidden territory and halcon didnt want to advertise himself zavala parked as near to the halcon spaces as he could then walked past two elevators the public one and another door marked private and took up a post nearby in the shadows behind a thick concrete pillar at five past seven melody exited the main elevator and walked to her car zavala again felt a twinge of regret at not being able to go on a date with the lovely woman but he had to put those thoughts aside he wanted a clear head for his first meeting with senor halcon zavalas vigil in the underground garage was about to pay off shortly after melody left a black lincoln limousine quietly pulled up in front of the elevator door marked private almost on cue the elevator door opened and a man stepped out zavala brought his nikon to his eye and focused on the tall dark man who exited the elevator and walked with an easy grace to the waiting vehicle halcon he snapped off several shots before halcon got into the limo then focused on the driver who was holding the door open for him the man was wearing a dark suit and his white hair was cut military short he was tall and broadshouldered his physique muscularly athletic even though he could have been in his sixties at least zavala got off a single shot before the whitehaired man swept the garage with his eyes as if he had heard the quiet whirr of the motor drive zavala melted into the shadows and didnt dare breathe until the car door slammed and the limo moved off in the fleeting second he had framed the whitehaired man in the viewfinder zavala had frozen his likeness on his retinas he leaned against the cold concrete still not believing the evidence of his eyes he had just seen the same man in arizona he was sure of it despite the cleanshaven face and the tailored suit only then the man with halcon was wearing work clothes and had long hair and a thick white beard he had a wife since deceased and he went by the name of george wingate quickly regaining his composure zavala dashed for his rental car he followed the limo onto the street keeping one or two cars between him and his objective they headed out of the city on the expressway in a northwest direction in time the suburbs and shopping malls thinned out the flat terrain gave way to rolling hills and more forested areas zavala pushed the rental car just to stay in sight of the limo which flew along well above the speed limit once they were beyond the more heavily congested neighborhoods they traveled for about an hour leaving the main highway around dusk to follow a sparsely populated twolane road zavala stayed far back before long he saw the flash of brake lights and the limo disappeared zavala slowed until his headlights caught a small plastic reflector nailed to a tree marking an unpaved road he kept going to create the illusion he was bound elsewhere then after a few hundred yards he did a quick uturn and came back to the reflector he switched the cars headlights off as a test and found that he was able to follow the dirt road as long as he kept speed down to a fast walk he wondered what a big shot like halcon was doing in the sticks maybe he had a hunting lodge the thick woods quickly enveloped him where the trees opened up he could see low craggy hills on either side he saw no lights ahead but this didnt surprise him because the road twisted and turned not wanting to run into an unpleasant surprise zavala stopped every few minutes got out of the car and walked ahead like the point on an infantry patrol to watch and listen on one stop he saw a light ahead cautiously he walked toward the glow until he could see that it was a lone spotlight on the gate of a high wiremesh fence he pulled the car off the road and made his way toward the fence under the cover of the woods stopping at the edge of a swath cleared from the perimeter the fence was about twice the height of a man and topped by coils of razor wire a white sign with black lettering was attached to the gate warning trespassers to keep out guard dogs trained to attack his instincts had served him well above the sign was a small box which could serve no other purpose than as a security camera the fence was too high to climb and he had no protection against the wire or the dogs but his guess was that the barricade was attached to an alarm remembering a low hill a short distance back he returned to his car and headed away from the fence in reverse so the backup lights wouldnt be seen then pulled off the road into the bushes he made his way toward the hill then up its side no easy task because he had nothing to light his way he tripped and had to back out of briars a few times but made it to the copse at the hilltop without mishap he selected a cleanimbed tree and climbed to the highest branch that would support his weight the elevation gave him a view over the top of the fence except for the lone floodlight on the gate the area was not illuminated his eyes had become used to the darkness and soon several shapes began to materialize he realized he was looking at a vast complex of buildings some rectangular others cylindrical all dominated by a massive pyramid with a flat top the structures were built of a whitish stone and seemed to glow in the faint light of the moon some hunting lodge he muttered this was crazy an ancient city in the wilds of the texas countryside he tried to call austin but his cell phone failed to pick up a signal after several minutes during which he squinted into the darkness in a vain attempt to make out details he decided he had seen all he was going to see he was about to climb down the tree when a light flicked on and he saw a strange sight he got a new grip on the branch and watched fascinated as a remarkable scene began to unfold raul gonzalez shivered in the darkness and waited for the bullet to smash into his spine wishing it would happen before he froze to death in the cool night air again he cursed that american woman by thwarting his moroccan assignment she was responsible for him being in this place his angry ruminations were cut short a spotlight blinked on and gonzalez saw before him a fantastic creature part human part beast from the neck down the figure was a bronzeskinned man of muscular physique around his waist was a loincloth of rich green yellow and vermilion the hard growths on either hip proved to be on closer look leather padding the face was hidden behind a mask created in a madmans nightmare the jadecolored snout was long and scaly the eyes hungrylooking and the grinning mouth full of jagged razorsharp teeth long quetzal plumes streamed from the back of the head the monster stood as still as a statue brawny arms folded across a broad hairless chest madre mia the pitiful whimper came from off to gonzalezs left silencio gonzalez growled at the hydrofoil captain theyd been ordered to remain silent or be shot gonzalez wasnt about to be killed because a sniveling coward couldnt keep his mouth shut the man standing quietly on his right was more to his liking lean and snakelike in his movements an assassin like himself at another time gonzalez would have talked shop with the man about the murderous skills he learned as a skinny soreplagued orphan in the squalid alleys of buenos aires where hed dodged death squads hired by local businessmen the businessmen considered the street boys as vermin gonzalez was barely a teenager when he approached the shopkeepers and offered to infiltrate the packs he knew so well and quietly dispatch his sleeping peers with knife or garrote as he grew older he obtained bigger jobs competitors politicians unfaithful spouses all sent to an early grave gun knife torture gonzalez earned a reputation for delivering exactly what his employer wanted blink a second circle of light revealed another muscular figure with a different mask the snarling mouth and bloodred tongue of a jaguar gonzalez again swore under his breath standing in the cold while some idiot puts on a costume pageant it wasnt fair all because hed botched a few jobs business had been going to younger killers when the brotherhoods emissary approached him he didnt know the group even existed but they knew everything about him they wanted him for special assignments and the aging hit man signed on eagerly the money was good the work wasnt difficult just like his street days wait for a call infiltrate and kill easy assignments like the one in morocco morocco he wished hed never heard the name a simple job said the caller from madrid unarmed unsuspecting scientists infiltrate the expedition set up the ambush roust the victims from their beds slaughter them like sheep and quickly bury the bodies without a trace if it hadnt been for that bitch with the russian name jesus mary hed had sweet plans for her he would study that slim body hungrily watching as she sat in front of her tent combing hair the color of golden wheat in the afternoon sun when they talked she was politely rude brushing hits off as if he were an ant crawling up one of those slender legs he was going to enjoy making her beg for her life with the only thing she could offer that gorgeous body but she hadnt been sleeping when he burst into her tent and when he and the others gave chase she ran like the wind three times the brotherhood had her in its grasp only to fail in its attempts to bring her down the hovercraft failed to drown her the hit squad sent to finish the job on the numa ship was either shot or incinerated its only survivor the lone commando by his side the order to come to texas wasnt a total surprise gonzalez assumed hed get a sharp reprimand have his pay docked and be reassigned instead men with machine pistols had herded him with the others after dark they were escorted out into the night and told to stand at attention warned they would be shot if they made a move or uttered a peep so they had waited listening to the howl of coyotes in the desert night air until now blink a third figure stood in relief he wore the deaths head with its staring empty eyes and dead grin a voice came out of the night amplified by loudspeakers greetings my brothers it said in aristocratic castilian spanish greetings lord halcon echoed the murmured response from unseen voices we know why we are here three of our number were given tasks to further our noble cause and they have failed us the voice paused the punishment for failure is death here comes the bullet gonzalez thought oh hell its been a good life he braced himself for the hail of lead that must soon come smashing into his body hoping that it would be quick his feet hurt from the unaccustomed standing he was surprised by a round object that flew out of the darkness and hit the ground with a bounce gonzalez thought the blackandwhite sphere was a soccer ball until it rolled to a stop about midway between the two facing lines of men and he saw that its markings were images of skulls the voice again you will be given a chance to win your lives the ball game will determine whether you live or die the spotlights blinked off the three figures vanished but only for a moment a battery of bright lights came on and gonzalez saw that he and the others were standing between two parallel stone walls the three costumed men had removed their masks and stood at the far end of the alley halfway down from the top of each wall was a ring carved with the face of what looked like a macaw in the semidarkness on top of the wall he sensed people moving hundreds from the sound of their voices the ball represents fate boomed the loudspeaker the court is the cosmos the alligator the jaguar and the deaths head symbolize the lords of the underworld your opponents the rules are as they have been for two thousand years the lords will use their feet you may use your hands and feet your goal will be to move the ball to the other end of the playing field if any team moves the ball through a ring that side wins the losers will be vanquished gonzalez was dumbfounded soccer for godsakes they were going to play a game of kickball for their lives gonzalez had played as a street youth and later in an organized amateur team and he had not been bad at it he was dreadfully out of shape from the excesses of booze drugs and women his swarthy body was still powerful but hed grown flabby around the gut and short of wind youve played before he said out of the comer of his mouth a little said the assassin forward i was a goalie the hovercraft operator said tentatively were playing for our lives gonzalez warned there will be no rules anything goes do you understand both men nodded the trio at the far end of the court awaited their move ill kick off gonzalez said his eyes focused entirely on the ball he got a running start brought his foot back then swung it forward the ball was heavier than he expected probably solid rubber the kick sent a painful shock up his leg he got the full power of his body behind the blow but his aim was off and the ball skittered along the wall and back into the court in front of their opponents the point man was on the ball like lightning quickly moving it forward to halfcourt with short skillful steps his teammates flanked him on either side the three men could have been triplets all with the same bronzehard bodies the black hair cut in bowllike bangs just above dark uncaring eyes the ball handler saw gonzalez loping in his direction and snapped the ball off to the man at his left gonzalez was unwavering he had no interest in the ball he wanted to maim he had done the simple arithmetic in his head injure only one man and his opponents would lose thirty percent of their team he lowered his head and charged the man who had passed off the ball his target coolly waited until gonzalez was a hairs breadth away then deftly sidestepped and stuck his foot out gonzalez tried to stop couldnt tripped over the extended leg and slammed against the ground so hard it rattled his teeth ignoring the pain in his cracked ribs he scrambled to his feet and tried vainly to catch up with the fastmoving play his teammate the assassin lunged in an unsuccessful attempt to steal the ball but he jabbed his elbow into the ball handlers sternum eliciting a satisfactory grunt of pain gonzalez followed up slamming into the man with a body block from behind the player went forward onto his knees which is where most men would have stayed but he was up again in an instant hurrying to run interference with the teammate who was moving the ball toward the end zone gonzalez looked on in dismay so soon threeonone only the hovercraft man stood in the way of a goal the ball handler saw his opponent underestimated him and decided to take the ball through instead of passing it off to the side for an easy kick goal he was moving too fast to take a sharp turn without losing the ball so he feinted with the eyes to his left but moved to his right the hovercraft man saw the ploy and moved forward with his forearm lifted his elbow drove into the mans jaw with the force of their combined speed and lifted him off the ground there was a resounding crack as the ball handlers jaw broke and he crumpled to the ground with blood gushing from his mouth gonzalez gasped for air with every breath he took but his teammates skillful move gave him new strength gonzalez got the ball under his heel and kicked it between the two opponents who were double teaming him without a glance at their fallen comrade with a hoarse yell of triumph he followed up on his kick and barreled into the pair like a bowling ball intent on knocking them to either side one man straightarmed gonzalez and might have broken his neck if the palm hadnt been absorbed by the fleshy jowls gonzalez realized that the rule was no hands for moving the bail not for defending it the assassin had the loose ball but it was quickly stolen and was being moved in gonzalezs direction the player saw the hovercraft operator running in to stop him and chose to get past the slower gonzalez again gonzalez concentrated not on the ball but on the man aiming his sharp toe at the mans groin the player sideslipped him turning so the blow glanced off his leather padding then moved the ball toward the end zone again the assassin dashed in from the side reached in with a swipe of his foot and stole the ball away then kicked it back to midcourt before anyone could stop him he scooped the ball up with his hands and tossed it toward the ring the shot might have been true but just before the ball left his hand he was slammed between the shoulder blades and his aim went off the ball struck the top of the ring in a vertical rim shot and thudded back into the court showing its partiality the crowd roared its approval in the darkness it was a new game threeontwo gonzalez was huffing and puffing but tasting victory his opponents stared at them their wide highcheekboned faces as unemotional as granite sculptures the sphere designated as fate rested between them gonzalez was tiring and knew he wouldnt last more than a few minutes at this pace get them he barked newly honed into a team by desperation the two men on the outside went directly for their opponents while gonzalez charged up the middle to take control of the ball taking his time he cocked his foot for a long slam shot that would send the ball high the feel of his foot making contact with the ball was satisfyingly solid the sphere lifted off with seemingly nothing to stop it as the ball left the ground the man being guarded by the assassin sideslipped the attack and did a leaping ballet midair twist turning so that his hip padding deflected the ball it bounced off with a loud thud to the mans teammate who fell to the ground gonzalez thought the man had tripped but the move was deliberate the man picked up the ball in his ankles and using his legs for leverage looped the ball in the air his teammate gave it a boost with his head and the ball flew toward the ring for an instant it looked as if there wasnt enough force to send the ball through the ring but the aim was true and the ball slipped through the opening then bounced onto the court again the game was over there was a wild burst of screaming from the spectators on top of the walls then silence gonzalez and his teammates stood there panting sweatdrenched clothes caked with dirt and grass the ball had been sent through the goal with practiced ease theyd been toyed with gonzalez realized their opponents had truly played like gods and there was never a chance of winning the interior wall of the courtyard was carved with a series of pictures gonzalez had paid little attention to the artwork before but now he followed the eyes of his opponents the carvings showed a series of players facing each other over a ball marked with skulls in one a victor held a knife in one hand arid a head in the other a decapitated victim knelt before him blood flowed from his neck in the form of serpents the crowd closed in forced him and his companions to their knees his hair was grabbed roughly exposing his neck and gonzalez knew his fate three swordlike knives flashed in the air and three heads thumped to the ground almost simultaneously eyes blinking frenetically as they rolled to a stop near the ball that had sealed their fate high in his treetop observation post zavala whispered hoarsely my god he couldnt believe his eyes zavala had watched the ball game more curious than concerned actually enjoying the play even at his distance he could see it was a rough game indeed but it was only at the last minute that he saw how lethal it was for the losers he scrambled down the tree and ran through the chaparral toward his car the room within the pyramid was immense its stone block walls lined with glass display cases holding dozens of priceless jade masks on one wall was a huge screen halcon watched as gonzalez and his teammates played out the last bloody moments of their life then turned to the scarfaced man who sat in a leather chair puffing on a cigar would you like to watch the instant replay guzman ill catch it later on sports highlights if you dont mind sir the scarfaced man replied halcon waved at a hidden sensor and the screen went blank dont tell me youre losing your appreciation of the ball game im not ready for cricket matches yet sir guzman replied taking a sip from his brandy glass but the games are far too short and lack skill and finesse halcon plucked a cigar from a goldembossed humidor of fine leather lit up and surveyed guzman contemplatively through a curtain of smoke unsurprised at the bluntness of the answer he had known guzman from the day he was born when halcons s father appointed his trusted henchman as his sons official protector the man was totally without guile which is why he was so refreshing to a machiavellian schemer like halcon he glanced at the screen youre right he said with disgust a brawl like that demeans the goals of the game to instill fear and obedience in my followers while giving them a pride in their cultural past his hand went to his phone console have the winning ball team line up for their awards where i can see them he ordered with a curt command then went over to a glass cabinet that held several rifles and handguns he pulled a rifle with a telescopic scope off its rack and said come guzman halcon led the way through a door onto a darkened balcony that overlooked the complex the winning ball players stood in a line on the bright green of the ball court halcon brought the rifle butt to his shoulder and squinted through the telescopic sight the rifle cracked three times with halcon smoothly working the bolt when the echoes of gunfire faded three still figures lay on the grass i know you prefer the austrian rifle for your assignments halcon said surveying the deadly result of his handiwork with satisfaction but ive always had good luck with this english la guzman gazed out at the ball court and curled his lips in a sardonic smile i suppose youve just terminated their contracts halcon laughed and they went back inside he carefully replaced the rifle in its case and turned to the scarfaced man my apologies guzman i should have known better than to suggest that the man who singlehandedly sank the most beautiful ocean liner in the world was losing his taste for blood sport i must apologize too for keeping you in the dark about my plans for so long i didnt ask you to my sanctum sanctorum tonight simply to watch that pitiful performance on the ball court you will be the first to hear the details of my grand vision for the future i am honored don halcon guzman said with a slight bow of his head halcon lifted his brandy snifter to a huge giltframed portrait over the massive walkin fireplace to my distinguished ancestor the founder of the brotherhood i dedicate my fondest dream the oil was done in the el greco style except in this painting the subjects long face and pointed ears were not exaggerated the saturnine tonsured man in the simple dark brown monks cassock had pale almost translucent skin in stark contrast to the red voluptuarys lips diamondhard pale gray eyes glittered as if reflecting flames the background was in shadow except for a glow in one corner where a struggling figure was being burned at the stake guzman first saw the painting of hernando perez as a young initiate into the brotherhood halcons father had explained with an ironic grin that perez had the artist put to death as a heretic because he wanted his portrait to be the mans last guzman was the first and only nonlatin member of the order he was the illegitimate son of a german stuka pilot stationed in spain and a danish nursemaid in the halcon household the pilot died in the war and the maid committed suicide the old master raised the boy in his house and provided for his upbringing his motive was not altruistic he recognized that one unquestionable loyal follower was more valuable than a platoon bound only by selfinterest he gave him a new name and sent guzman to the forest schools where he learned to speak several languages and to more specialized tutors who versed him in the martial arts and use of weapons guzman killed his first man during the saber duel that gave him his hideous scar the old masters vision was justified guzman grew into a devoted aide whose natural skills for murder and mayhem proved to be a bonus i remember your father saying that perez was basically a simple man guzman said he was a fanatical nihilist the good archdeacon formed the brotherhood of the sacred sword of truth because he felt torquemada was too soft on heretics fortunately he said with a smile his priestly vows didnt prevent him from enjoyments of the flesh with the female novitiates otherwise the halcon family would not be here nor did his religious zeal stop him from stealing the property of those he condemned his beliefs resulted in the brotherhoods prime directive guzman recited the directive like a recording machine the brotherhoods prime duty is to erase all evidence of prior contact between the old and the new world before columbus it is still our duty but i am about to make some changes changes sir the directive was holy writ in the brotherhood dont be surprised the brotherhood has shifted direction before we evolved from a religious group to a terrorist organization to protect the spanish crown we did our work well the brotherhood stamped out suggestions of precolumbian contact that questioned church dogma and hence the infallibility of royal decisions by defending the belief that columbus was the first european to travel to the new world we kept other countries from claiming our riches thats why doubting his deeds was a capital crime as a youth i remember asking my father why does that still matter king ferdinand and queen isabella are dead spain is no longer a great power it is not the idea itself guzman murmured it is the purity of the idea my father taught you well he drummed the same thing into my head only by obeying our sacred vow to carry out our original mandate can we remain an elite priesthood united in a sacred cause under the brotherhood columbus has achieved near sainthood even today modern scholars who deviate from the premise laid down by our medieval brothers risk their careers the world wonders how generalissimo franco was able to remain in power to his deathbed it was because of the alliances he had forged with the brotherhood the greatest threat to our fraternity was averted thanks to you your father told me the object on board the ship could destroy the brotherhood but he also wanted to show his followers that he was willing to go to any lengths to preserve the raison detre of los hermanos yes he compared that event with cortez burning his ships so his followers had no choice but to stay by his side your father was a wise man wise yes but his obsession with the past would have led to the demise of the brotherhood we were becoming nothing more than a spanish mafia when i took control if the brotherhood is to go on for another five hundred years we must do as cortez burn our ships we no longer work to protect a nonexistent spanish sovereignty but to lay the foundations for a new empire our inspiration will be quetzalcoatl the plumed serpent of the maya who will return in different forms to begin a new era this time quetzalcoatl will be reborn as a hawk i dont understand the reason we continue to conceal precolumbian contact is to give hispanics greater pride in their own heritage if claims were blasted in the media that all the great cultures of mesoamerica came from europe and china or japan it would greatly dim the accomplishments of our people and send them to the backwaters of history thanks to another lusty ancestor i carry the blood of the maya in my veins i am not just a spaniard but an indio i embody the heritage of two great civilizations to suggest that my peoples glorious culture was imported from foreign civilizations across the seas is repugnant to imply that the olmecs the mayans and the incas were little more than savage peoples who created architectural wonders ingenious astronomical science and beautiful art only after being influenced and taught by asians and european intruders cannot be endured the children of latin america and their children must believe their ancestors achieved grandeur and greatness entirely from their own inventiveness this is vital so that we can produce a resurgence of our former glory and take our place as the leading civilization of the twentieth century thats a pretty tall order hear me out said halcon in less time than you can imagine the southern third of the united states will secede and become a latin american nation with all due respect don halcon america fought a civil war the last time someone suggested secession the situation is completely different halcon declared flatly what i propose would happen if i lived or died in fifty years nonlatins will be a minority in the us it is already the case in the border states like new mexico i simply propose to accelerate the process by leading a mushrooming hispanic movement for independence with your help i will do my best as always don halcon it will not be as hard as you might think halcon spun an antique globe on its axis see how different the world has become the ussr east germany vanished he placed his finger on the globe to stop its spinning it is not halcon but the geographers who say belgium one day will split into flanders and wallonia australia will become four separate countries china will break up into a series of autonomous zones like hong kong italy will separate into the prosperous north and the poor south most important are what scientists are saying about north america he guided guzman to a heavy mahogany table where there was a large map laid out and tapped a word covering the southwestern part of the united states angelica guzman read the blending of borders is inevitable even the governments know north america must change the blueprint is being drawn as we speak when canada loses quebec the landlocked maritimes will join the us alaska merges with british columbia and the northwestern states to create pacifica an entity whose common interest lies in the pacific rim mexicos northern state will join with the southwest us states he swept his hand over the map i will unify those of indian and spanish heritage in a new wave that will sweep over territory once owned by mexico how can you go up against the armed might of a superpower the same way cortez and a handful of followers defeated the great empire of the aztecs with its millions by creating alliances pitting one group against another the lines are already being drawn for a military confrontation the border towns will be engulfed in blood none will be spared the greater the atrocities the stronger the reaction the faster it will spread when the violence starts the us will beg me to end it i will take my place as a leader and we will instill the old values and the old ways he chuckled one day the ball game will be as popular as bullfighting and the nfl the bloody rebellion we fomented in chiapas proved it can be done guzman smiled that was as easy as tossing a match into a pail of gasoline exactly the government reacted by massacring indians the mayan zapatista rebels showed the same ferocity as their ancestors in forcing concessions from the government in the united states californians are arming themselves against illegal crossings by immigrants that we are encouraging ranchers want a bigger military role to fight the drug lords whose drug operations we are supervising along the border guzman said ill according to plan the us will lose patience the violence will unite the millions of hispanics and latinos throughout the southwest this is why we cannot afford to have our glorious past rewritten i have spent a fortune to buy territory voting and political influence halcon industries is stretched to the limit i built this new chichen itza to be the capital of the new country but even the vast resources of our cartel cant equip an army to defend itself against a united states that might not recognize the trend of the future this is why it is vital that we find the vast riches that will enable us to carry out our plan it will not succeed without the treasure we are close to assembling all the pieces of the puzzle our agents have acquired documents from a number of sources in spain and other countries has there been any outcry not yet the international herald reported the unexplainable theft of columbian memorabilia from auction houses and museums but nobody has put it together yet not until now halcon said with a sly smile guzman raised a frosty eyebrow our experts have analyzed the old documents halcon went on they have located the key that will open the secret that has baffled us for so long congratulations don halcon im most pleased you wont be when you hear the details you see the key we seek lies on the bottom of the ocean in the hold of the andrea doria guzman was stunned not the artifact how could that be your father ordered me to sink the ship as i said my father was not infallible he thought the artifact could destroy us theres no mistake ive had the documents checked again and again i have read them myself no my friend im afraid there is no doubt the artifact that my father once thought would end the brotherhood will show the way to greater glory i want you to fit out a salvage project right away you will have all the resources of halcon industries at your command this should be done as quickly as possible ill start work as soon as we are through here sir excellent are there any more archaeological expeditions that could derail our plans in the meantime there seems to be a freeze on activities around the world except for the shortlived numa project in arizona of course my compliments for cauterizing that infection so quickly how much of a threat is numa i wouldnt underestimate them you saw what happened in morocco i agree i think it best that you remain in charge of all operations where numa is concerned use all force necessary guzmans cell phone rang and he excused himself to listen yes immediately patch it into don halcons closed circuit a moment later the television screen blinked into life and showed a wooded scene in black and pale green what is it halcon snapped impatiently this was taken with a surveillance camera in the small rise on the north of the complex as they watched the colors were manipulated so that the face of a man running through the woods was enlarged to fill the screen guzman swore under his breath do you know him halcon asked yes his name is zavala and he was with the numa team on the arizona project youre correct about numa not being a toothless dog halcon stared at the screen thinking you said there was another man the leader of the team kurt austin he was running the project theyll do for a start have him and this man killed put the salvage plans off if you have to as you say don halcon halcon dismissed guzman and went back to his map guzman had no illusions about halcon he had known him since he was a boy hovering over him like a guardian angel he thought halcons megalomaniacal scheme had more to do with his selfish pursuit of power and riches than restoring the lost grandeur of those he called his people he was using those of indian blood toward his own ends and would enslave them much as his conquistador ancestors had what he was proposing would mean civil war certain bloodshed possibly the death of thousands guzman knew all this and didnt care when the old master took the young blond boy under his wing he created a being of undiminished loyalty killing highly placed numa operatives could be a big mistake guzman thought as he left the room but he had become bored with his work in recent years and what had become important was the game the numa men would be worthy opponents his mind began to work on an assassination plan the yucatan mexico the yucatan hammock was never meant for a man as long as paul trout the handwoven fiber sling was designed with the diminutive mayan stature in mind when he wasnt swatting mosquitoes trout was trying to find a place for the arms and legs that dangled to the dirt floor of the indian hut dawns first gray light was a welcome relief he extricated himself from the sack smoothed the wrinkles out of his suit as best he could decided he could do nothing about his morning beard and with a bemused glance at morales who lay snoring in another hammock emerged into the morning mists he trekked across a cornfield to the edge of woods where the helicopter lay on its side resembling a big dead dragonfly the pilot had tried to land in the field as the helicopter used up the fuel vapors powering its engine the aircraft plunged into the canopy of foliage that was so deceivingly softlooking from above the fuselage crashed through the treetops accompanied by a horrendous racket of snapping branches and the screech of tortured metal trout had the wind knocked out of him the pilot hit his head and was knocked cold morales was dazed ruiz whod been awakened by the racket sat there in bewilderment with drool on his whiskered chin morales and trout dragged the pilot out of the chopper and he came around in the fresh air everyone had bruised knees and elbows but no serious injuries were noted trout was glad ruiz had survived he might prove a valuable source of information in finding gamay with his hands on his hips trout surveyed the damage and shook his head in amazement the trees had cushioned the copters momentum the runners had collapsed and the main and tail rotors were history but the body remained miraculously intact trout rapped on the mangled fuselage there was a stirring inside the pilot who had chosen to spend the night in the helicopter crawled out stretched his arms and opened his mouth in a bellowlike yawn the noise awoke ruiz who was on the ground with his hands cuffed to the useless runners he blinked sleepily when he saw trout the mosquitoes didnt seem tohave bothered him smelling like a swine pen had its advantages trout guessed he walked around the chopper and thought again that it was a miracle theyd got down in one piece he had counted seven bullet holes in the helicopter including the lucky fuel tank shot minutes after the jetranger hit the ground a figure had approached from across the cornfield an indian farmer who lived nearby had seen the crash he greeted them with a friendly grin from under his straw hat he was unperturbed as if strange men dropped out of the sky every day the pilot did a quick damage assessment and found that the radio was useless they followed the farmer to his hut where his wife offered food and water and four young children eyed them warily from a distance morales questioned the farmer at length then turned to trout i asked him if there is a village or town near here with a telephone he says a priest in a nearby village has a radio he will go there to tell him about us and ask to send help how far is the village morales shook his head its a ways he will spend the night and come back tomorrow thinking of gamay trout chafed at the delay but there was nothing he could do the farmers wife packed food in a cotton sack and her husband climbed onto a grizzled burro waved goodbye to his family and set off on his grand adventure trout watched the burro plod down a trail and prayed the unsteady animal would last the trip the farmers wife offered the use of her home and said she would stay the night with relatives she was back by the time trout and the pilot returned to the but to see if morales was awake then she prepared tortillas and beans for everyone after breakfast trout took some tortillas out to ruiz morales unlocked the chicleros cuffs but kept his legs bound ruiz noisily devoured the tortillas and morales gave him a cigarette he puffed on it gratefully the crash had wiped the cocky sneer off his face and he was more than cooperative when morales asked a series of questions he started working with this gang of looters about six months ago morales translated he says he used to gather chime sap before that but i dont believe him he quizzed the man again more forcefully this time si he said laughing it is as i thought he is a thief he used to steal from the tourists coming to merida a friend told him he could make more money smuggling artifacts the work is harder but the pay is better and there is less risk ask him who he works for trout suggested ruiz shrugged when the question was presented to him morales said he worked for a man who used to be a policeman guarding the ruins there is a small gang maybe a dozen they find a place and dig trenches the jades and the pots with the black lines are the best he says maybe two hundred to five hundred dollars for one pot his boss takes his cut and arranges transport transport to where trout said hes not sure morales translated he thinks his boss was connected with people operating out of the petan just over the border in guatemala how does he get the artifacts there he says they would move the goods down the river in the small boats to a place where trucks come in then maybe they go to carmelita or probably across the border to belize i have heard what happens then the artifacts go on planes or ships to belgium or to the states when people pay big money for them he glanced almost with pity at ruiz if this toothless idiot only knew these people make hundreds of thousands of dollars and he takes all the risks he chuckled ruiz sensing a joke but not understanding with his limited english that he was the butt of it grinned his toothless grin trout turned the information over in his mind gamay and chi must have stumbled onto a smuggling operation they escaped on the river using the same route as the smugglers and were trying to get away when the helicopter found them he asked morales to find out how far the truckloading spot was from the rapids couple of nights on the river he says he doesnt know the distance in miles he says the river goes dry in places sometimes and they work it after the rainy season at trouts request the pilot dug a map out of the helicopter no river was depicted confirming the information from ruiz there was no way to trace the course gamay would take the interrogation was interrupted by a commotion a boy of about ten was running across the cornfield shouting in his highpitched voice he rushed up to the helicopter and announced breathlessly that his father was home they retied ruiz and went back to the hut the farmer said he would have been home sooner but he took the opportunity to visit his brother who lived near the village oh yes he said after a long description of his family reunion he had talked to the priest who no longer had the radio trouts heart fell then rose again a minute later when the farmer said the priest used a cell phone that he kept for emergencies mostly medical the priest had called for help and asked the farmer to relay the following message which he wrote on sheet of paper tell the men in the helicopter that someone will be sent to find them with rescue imminent trout was even more impatient he paced the edge of the cornfield frequently glancing at the cloudless blue sky before long he heard a faint roughrough sound he cocked his ear the noise became louder until he could actually feel the vibration of whiplashed air a huey painted in greenish brown flashed into view above the trees with another right behind it trout waved his arms the helicopters made a tight circle around the field then touched down at the perimeter of the corn rows the doors opened even before the rotors stopped and men dressed in camouflage uniforms spilled from the choppers morales the pilot and the farmer and his family went to greet the new arrivals there were six of them including a captain in the lead helicopter and a medical technician in the second the med tech examined everyone and gave them clean bills of health except for superficial injuries trout and morales went to the downed helicopter but ruiz was gone the chiclero had squirmed out of his hastily tied bonds after a quick parley they decided against a timeconsuming search trout would have liked to see if ruiz had more information to offer although from what the chiclero recounted he was at the bottom of the smuggling totem pole looking at the escape optimistically maybe ruiz would be eaten by a jaguar he would pity the jaguar they thanked the farmer and his family for their hospitality and got into the hueys within minutes they were skimming a few hundred yards over the treetops less than an hour later they set down at an army base the captain said the base had been established near chiapas at the time of the indian uprising a year earlier the captain asked if they would like food and a bath and a change of clothes a shower could wait trout had other priorities he asked to use a phone austin was in his office at numa headquarters examining the photos zavala had taken in halcon s underground garage when the phone rang zavala had just described the trip to halcons complex and the bloody ball game and austin was bringing him up to speed on his nantucket encounter with angelo donatelli a broad smile crossed his face when he heard trouts voice paul good to hear from you joe and i were talking about you a few minutes ago did you find gamay yes and no trout told austin about the near miss on the river the helicopter crash and rescue what do you want to do paul austin said quietly a heavy sigh came from trouts end of the line i hate to let you down kurt but i cant come back not until i find gamay austin had already made his decision you dont have to come back well come down to you what about the job weve been working on the archaeology thing gunn and yaeger can work up an operational plan while were gone you stay put until we get there what about the admiral dont worry ill handle things with sandecker i really appreciate this kurt more than you know the statement was as far as trouts yankee reserve would let him go austin dialed sandecker and told him the story sandecker had a reputation for carrying out a project once started but his loyalty to his staff was equally legendary it took me years to put this special assignments team together im not going to have one of its key members kidnapped by a bunch of damned mexican bandits go get her youll have every resource numa can offer it was the reaction austin expected but one never knew with the unpredictable admiral thank you sir ill start right off with a request for quick transportation to mexico when do you want to leave i want to put together a specialized gear package say two hours you and zavala be at andrews air force base with your toothbrushes a jet will be waiting for you austin hung up gamays in trouble and paul needs our help he sketched out the details sandeckers given the okay well be leaving from andrews in about two hours can you handle that zavala was up and heading for the door on my way a minute later austin was on the phone again after a quick conversation he was out of the office as well and on his way to the boathouse where he threw some gear and clothes into a duffel bag and headed to the airport sandecker was true to his word a sweptwing cessna citation x executive jet painted in numa turquoise blue was warming up its engines on the tarmac he and zavala were tossing their bags to the copilot when an army pickup truck rolled up two husky special forces men got out and supervised while a forklift hoisted a large wooden box from the truck and into the cargo section of the plane zavala raised an eyebrow glad to see you brought beer for the trip i thought the basic austin rescue kit might come in handy austin signed a receipt for one of the special forces men minutes later he and zavala were buckling into their seats in the plush twelvepassenger cabin and the plane was in line for takeoff the pilots voice came over the speaker were cleared for takeoff well be flying at a cruising speed of mach which should put us in the yucatan in less than two hours easy just sit back and enjoy the ride youll find the scotch in the liquor cabinet and soda and ice cubes in the refrigerator minutes later the plane was in the air climbing to its cruising altitude at four thousand feet per minute as soon as they leveled off zavala was out of his seat this is the fastest commercial jet except for the concorde said a mistyeyed zavala who had flown everything under the sun im going to chat with the guys in the cockpit austin told him to go ahead it would give him the chance to think he put his seat back closed his eyes and tried to imagine the events trout had described in their phone conversation by the time zavala came back and relayed the pilots message that they were about to land austin was erecting a mental framework the way a bridge builder extends steel girders into thin air trout was waiting for them as the citation taxied to a stop hed bathed and shaved and had borrowed a camouflage uniform to wear while his suit was being cleaned the uniform was made for the smaller framed mexican gi and emphasized trouts long arms and legs giving him a spidery aspect thanks for coming so quickly guys he said taking their hands we wouldnt have missed seeing you in that uniform for the world austin said with a grin suits being laundered trout replied with some discomfort you look quite fetching in cami austin said sort of a distinguished rambo wouldnt you say joe zavala shook his head slowly dunno i think maybe paul is more the steven seagal type jean claude van damme maybe im so glad you rushed down here at numa expense to evaluate my sartorial splendor no problem at all its the least we could do for a pal trouts face grew somber kidding aside its great to see your ugly faces thanks for coming so quickly gamay needs backup in the worst way shell get more than backup austin replied ive got a plan zavala glanced over at the special forces boxes being unloaded from the plane uhoh he said the greatest asset for a sniper is not aim guzman mused but patience he sat on a blanket in the bushes on the shore of the potomac river his cold eyes fixed on the victorian boathouse exactly opposite he had been there for hours lapsing into a detached yet alert zombielike state that allowed him to ignore the numbness in his buttocks and the biting insects he had watched the sun go down aware of the beauty of the river but not connecting with the changing reflections and shadows in any emotional way he knew austin was not coming even before the automatic nightlight flicked on in the living room of the darkened house he lifted the austrian steyr ssg snipers rifle from his lap and sighted through the kahles zf telescopic sight on the picture of a boat hanging on the wall a squeeze of the trigger would send a bullet winging across the river at feet per second he made a click sound with his tongue then lowered the rifle picked up a cell phone and dialed a number at numa headquarters the answering machines recorded message said mr austin would be away from his office for a few days gave numas office hours and asked guzman to leave a message he smiled there was only one message he wanted to give mr austin he punched another number the phone rang in a car parked outside zavalas house in arlington its off guzman said and hung up the two men in the car looked at each other and shrugged then started the engine and drove off back along the potomac guzman carefully wrapped the rifle in the blanket and set off through the woods as silently as a ghost the pram glided through the eerie mists as if in a dream moist exhalations rising off the river materialized into ectoplasmic wraiths that waved their spectral arms as if in warning go back gamy steered while chi sat in the bow like a carved mahogany figurehead his sharp eyes probing the gauzy haze for obstacles human and otherwise they had been on the move since dawn after overnighting on a small midstream islet chi slept ashore on the oversized hummock the encounter with old yellow beard still gave gamay the shivers chi assured her there was no danger from snakes even a worm would have been unwelcome company she said she preferred the discomfort but relative security of the pram a loud hiss startled her awake and she was relieved to see it was only the camp stove chi was preparing coffee they had a quick breakfast of trail mix and got an early start on the river the chicleros larder would keep them well supplied for days with little room in their pram they had filled another boat with food bottled water and fuel and towed it behind them the added burden slowed their progress but the supplies were vital if they expected to survive the midmorning sun burned the fog phantoms away and visibility was dear once more even though the tradeoff was a suffocating humidity gamay had found a battered straw hat that helped prevent sunstroke and shaded her eyes from the blinding tropical light the river twisted and turned as they approached each bend chi raised his hand and gamay reduced the throttle to an idle for a few minutes they would float with the current and cock their ears listening for voices or the buzz of motors no longer fearful of attack from behind they were wary of surprises from ahead they didnt want to round a bend and bump into a boatload of brigands the jury was still out on the helicopter they still werent sure whether it was friend or foe the chopper had saved them from the rapids yet they hadnt forgotten that it also dumped them into the river sometimes a fish jumped out of the water and the splash was like a gunshot in a barrel otherwise aside from the metallic gurgle past the aluminum hull they heard only the chatter and squawk of birds gossiping in the trees and the drone and whine of insects gamay was grateful for the generous supply of cutters the bug repellent had to be reapplied frequently to replace the goop washed away by sweat or the occasional rain shower chi didnt seem to be bothered by bugs natural selection gamay surmised any mayan susceptible to malaria or other insect borne ailments would have been weeded out of the pack long ago the rivers character changed as the hours passed the waterway was reduced to half its original size squeezing the same amount of river into fifty percent less space made for a strong smooth current the flat countryside had become more rolling the banks steeper and higher covered with impenetrable growth gamay had chafed at their steady but slow african queen pace she wasnt sure she liked the toboggan run aspect any better as their speed picked up there was less margin for error i wonder where we are she murmured eyeing the vinecovered limestone walls that closed in from each side ive been thinking the same thing chi scanned the sky we know that must be east because its where the sun rose we have need of your girl scout training she laughed what we really need is a handheld gps receiver chi reached into his pack and extracted the ancient instrument theyd found in the cave temple the sun glinted off the burnished metal he handed the instrument to gamay know how to work one of these gadgets as a marine biologist i spend most of my time under the water and leave it to others to get me there ive taken a couple of navigational courses though chi took the tiller while gamay examined the instrument it was the first chance for a close look at the device since they discovered it again she marveled at the workmanship of the boxlike wooden case and the circular interlocking gears the lettering was definitely ancient greek spelling out the names of various gods she applied pressure with her forefinger to the largest wheel but like the other moving parts it was stuck fast by corrosion engraved in the largest wheel were depictions of animals sheep goats bear even a lion from their positioning gamay concluded that they represented star constellations it reminded her of the cardboard star charts with the rotating dials that show the night sky at a given time of the year clever whoever put this device together was a genius she said ive only figured out part of its function it tells you what the night sky looks like at a given time of year more important it could tell you from the sky what time of year it was in other words a celestial calendar that would be invaluable in knowing when to expect the rainy season when to plant and harvest and when to sail too also where you are you can use the backside as a sextant that gives you an approximate but fairly accurate suns azimuth what are the other wheels used for they could be a can opener for all i know youll have to ask someone with technical expertise gamay said with a shake of her head too bad the mechanism is corroded i wouldnt mind knowing where we are chi rummaged in his rucksack and pulled out a map which he spread on his knees this river isnt shown he said tracing their approximate route with his finger my guess is its only this big after rainy season when we factor in our direction and speed id venture that if we havent gone over the border to guatemala were very close to it which would make sense the looted artifacts are smuggled through guatemala to belize and points beyond i wasnt planning on a trip to guatemala when i came down here for numa but i guess i dont have much choice look on the bright side chi said we have the chance to put a stop to this terrible business of smuggling antiquities gamay cocked an eyebrow she hoped some of chis optimism would rub off given the precarious state of their minutetominute existence she hadnt thought of them as a smugglerbusting duo her main goal was survival she was getting tired of playing the perils of pauline the fact that they werent dead was probably mostly a result of dumb luck she indicated several penciled xs on the map any idea what these are after a moments study chi said they could be anything dig sites places they stockpiled artifacts or supplies distribution and were heading right into the middle of things from what this handydandy device tells us she hefted the instrument and gave it back to chi interesting chi said thoughtfully as he carefully stuffed the ancient instrument into his pack in our zeal to put this to practical use we have forgotten its archaeological significance ill leave it to others to hash that out im a marine biologist now yet you cant deny that finding an ancient greek artifact in a precolumbian setting raises questions questions im not prepared to answer nor am not yet but i know that i will bring the wrath of the archaeological establishment down on my head at the slightest hint of precolumbian contact with europe this instrument did not get here by itself it was either delivered by europeans to america or transported by americans who went to europe maybe its a good thing we dont have anybody to tell gamay said the strengthening current ended their discussion the river had become even narrower and gorgelike the walls steeper and higher chi was having trouble controlling the boat and gamay took over there was no noisy rushing of water that would indicate they were near rapids not yet but gamay stayed alert our speed is picking up she told chi can you slow us down ive got the motor practically on idle to maintain steering control keep a sharp eye and ear out if it looks like rough water ahead ill steer for shore and well figure out what to do at the foot of the walllike bankings was a muddy beach a couple of yards wide enough space to pull off the river for a breather she was buoyed by another consideration this was fine only way the chicleros could have come which meant the river was navigable for a small boat controlling the towed boat was a problem time to pull up on shore transfer supplies and cut loose the river suddenly narrowed considerably and the water speed doubled she and chi exchanged puzzled glances still no sound of rapids they were rounding a long curve the bankings closing in so that it seemed that they could almost touch them gamay planned to go wide on the turn and simply rum the boat onto the narrow beach the supply boat whipsawed then jerked in the other direction to throw her steering off she knew from experience that when things go wrong on a boat they realty go wrong drastic action is the only way to avoid disaster cut her loose she shouted chi stared at her uncomprehending she made a knifing motion with the edge of her hand cut the supply boat line or it will tangle in our propeller once chi understood he acted quickly he severed the towline with a quick swipe of his machete the loaded pram went into a slow spin and headed right at them gamay and chi were both watching the boat hoping it would pass them a collision in the narrow canyon would be a disaster she was glancing over her shoulder trying to steer so as to avoid a crash and didnt see the wall of limestone that loomed directly in their path until the last second gamay ducked so she wouldnt hit her head as the pram shot through an opening in the wall within seconds the swiftmoving river had sucked them deep into the maw and the vestiges of daylight disappeared we need a flashlight professor she said her voice echoing in the inky darkness the flashlight flicked on and the shaft of light fell on wet rocks that glistened only yards away she swung the tiller to avoid a crash oversteering in her haste and was turned sideways by the current after a few dicey moments she had the boat under control again and was moving with the river flow chi played the flashlight beam ahead and above on rough wet walls and ceilings the underground river reminded gamay of a fun house only she wasnt having any fun especially after the beam picked up what looked like clusters of black leaves covering the ceiling the light reflected on thousands of burningred pinpoints of light she held her breath not so much out of fear but to block out the overpowering ammonia stench i hate bats she muttered gritting her teeth keep still and youll be all right chi cautioned no need for that warning gamay was frozen in place by the thought of leathery wings and sharp pointed teeth the creatures stayed where they were however and in time the bat population thinned out to nothing fascinating chi said ive never seen a river go underground so abruptly excuse me for saying so professor chi but your country has too many caves and holes in the ground for my taste si dr gamay its like swiss cheese im afraid gamay tried to look on the bright side then realized there wasnt one they had been sucked into the bowels of the earth and there was no assurance they would ever come out at best this was the route the chicleros used which meant they might bump into more of the smugglers gamay lifted the propeller out of the water and they used a paddle to steer fending off with their hands and feet when the pram bumped noisily into the sides of the cave gamay grabbed on to a small stalagmite and wrapped a few turns of their severed tow line around it the makeshift cleat held they crawled up onto a rock shelf and lit a camp light gamay expected their errant supply boat to come barreling by but it must have been caught up chi mourned the loss of his spam gamay said maybe they would catch up with it later she wouldnt miss the canned meat but the fuel and water would come in handy over lunch of jerky and cold tortillas they discussed their options and agreed that there was only one they had to go on neither expressed the unspoken fear that the river would come to a dead end or no end at all but the possibility hung over their heads like a black cloud they got back in the boat restarted the motor so theyd have control and traveled another half hour often bending over with fits of coughing from the damp musty air gamay felt as if her lung linings were becoming as mildewed as the rest of her the current seemed to diminish chi whod been lighting the way ahead announced that the river was almost back to its original width above the rapids chi had placed the camp light in the prow of the boat and its yellow glow illuminated what looked like a large cave stop chi shouted over the suddenly echoing sound of the motor gamay cut power and jerked the tiller around narrowly avoiding a collision with the black wall in their way the river had disappeared again it must have gone even deeper she surmised they were in a large pool a narrow tributary extended off the main waterway for want of a better course gamay pointed the pram into what looked like a manmade canal chi shut off the lantern and leaned forward staring into the darkness at a faint orange glow which grew larger and brighter as they neared finally materializing into a flickering kerosene lantern on the piling of a small pier gamay slid the boat in next to two identical prams tied up at the dock and cut the motor they listened intently but heard no sound louder than their own nervous breathing guess this is the end of the ride gamay said they packed chis rucksack with their remaining supplies and made their way cautiously along the pier which was built against a level limestone shelf about as wide as a sidewalk the walkway widened and the rough walls gave way to smooth ones they followed a trail of lights moving from one lantern to another until they were in a large chamber the walls and ceiling were smooth and squarecut chi took in his surroundings this was a quarry probably used by the ancients to cut limestone for their temples and houses were in the middle of mayan activity i dont think the ancients used kerosene lanterns nor do i the good news for us is that there must be an entrance somewhere they explored further and came upon dozens of wooden boxes stacked on pallets chi walked down the row and peered into the boxes incredible he whispered there must be hundreds of mayan artifacts here theyre using thus quarry to store stolen antiquities makes sense gamay agreed the loot is brought in via the river and shipped out from here a light bulb went off in her head theyd need land transportation to move the artifacts out of here chi wasnt listening he was standing in front of a set of wide shelving built against the chamber wall the beam of his flashlight went back and forth over a number of large stone blocks lined up on the shelves like a display at a tombstone store the boats again he whispered gamay stepped closer and saw carvings in the stone these are similar to the carvings we saw back at the ruins yes it seems the looting is far more extensive than i imagined they must have hit other archaeological sites similar to the one we visited they used a diamond edged power saw to cut these sections from the wall he sighed heavily this is a tragedy intellectual curiosity momentarily overwhelmed their survival instinct they might have stayed there all day comparing notes if gamay hadnt noticed a whitish glow at the far end of the quarry daylight at last a way out of this creepy place since theyd climbed out of the boat shed been dogged by the feeling that they were not alone with a quick glance over her shoulder she grabbed chi by the arm and practically dragged him away from the stone artifacts the light was coming through an opening about as wide as a garage door topped with the typical mayan corbeled arch they stepped outside the sudden change from dark coolness to dazzling heat was a shock and they blinked their eyes against the bright sunlight in front of the opening was a crude loading platform and a winch hanging from a crane the earth around the platform was soaked with motor oil and churned up by tire treads gamay stepped forward for a closer look only to stop as she saw something in her peripheral vision she turned to the right then to the left and didnt like what she saw on either side of the quarry entrance which was cut into a hill was a man one had a rifle trained on her the other a shotgun leveled at chi they had pistols tucked in their belts as well gamay and chi agreed with their eyes not to make a precipitous move their only escape route was back the way theyd come and that was blocked a second later when a third armed man stepped from the quarry her instincts about being followed were right on the mark gamay thought ruefully all three men had the dirty unshaven look that she had come to expect from the locals but these chicleros had a harder more disciplined aspect about them than the men who had chased them downriver that would make sense the men back at the excavation site would have been at the bottom of the pecking order the laborers who dug up the antiquities and the mules who transported them these must be the guards the third man issued a curt order to the others they gestured with their weapons for gamay and chi to move along a dirt road that led away from the quarry they followed it for several minutes through the forest until they came to where the trees and brush had been cut away to make a parking space for a dented and mudspattered fourwheeldrive gmc pickup truck the door of a small shed was open revealing the greasy tools hanging inside a man was working on the engine he backed out from under the upraised hood when he heard the others approaching he was a skinny waxenskinned man whose scraggly narrow beard made him look like a poor mans satan he and the head guard talked even without knowing spanish gamay could tell that the mechanic was the one in authority he directed a question at chi who had slipped back into his humble peon mode they talked a minute then the man frowned and shook his head in a thisisalllneed expression gamay noted with relief that there was none of the leering rape threat of her earlier encounters but she wasnt reassured by seeing that the man kept his hand on his pistol grip the whole time he talked with chi after a moments thought he got in the trucks cab and talked in low tones to a squawking radio voice the conversation was heated at times but the mechanic was smirking when he came back and issued an order to the guards they grabbed gamay and chi and roughly plunked them on the ground behind the truck then bound their feet and tied their arms to the bumper what did he say gamay whispered when they were left alone i told him we were lost that you are a scientist and i am your guide that we were drawn into the cave by accident did he buy the story it didnt matter he said he has orders to shoot anyone he finds here but he checked with his bosses on the radio and they told him to bring us in he looked pretty pleased with himself for passing the buck how long do we have the truck has an engine problem when he gets it fixed we vamanos gamay took a deep breath and let it out she wasnt afraid just weary and somewhat discouraged that they had been captured so close to freedom after the last few days struggling down the river for all their efforts they were no better off now than when theyd been stuffed underground looking on the bright side these chicleros didnt leer at her body and make unveiled threats of rape and they wouldnt have to walk out of the forest she focused her thoughts on the truck it could be their ticket out of here if they could figure out how to wrest the ignition keys from four armed men she leaned her head back against the bumper and sorted through their options she realized quickly that as things now stood only one thing could get them out of this bind a miracle she closed her eyes it was going to be a long night zavala saw the bodies in the dawn light from the lead helicopter the huey was flying above treetop level following the serpentine twists and turns of the river when zavala noticed the human flotsam caught in a sharp bend he asked the pilot to go in for a closer look the huey banked over the water and hovered zavala leaned out its big door and inspected the bloated corpses then he radioed the second helicopter which was making a wide lazy circle above paul and kurt from what i can see theres nothing to worry about all the bodies appear to be male in other words gamay wasnt among the dead are you certain trout replied as sure as i can be from up here austins voice cut in thanks this is a good place to make our insertion is our limo ready all gassed up and set to go good lets do it the two helicopters on loan from the mexican army had overflown the old ruins where gamay had first been captured trout wanted his numa teammates to have a total picture of gamay and chis flight from start to finish trout flew over the rapids and continued downriver until the bodies were sighted zavala relayed austins command to the pilot the huey drifted out over the widest part of the river then slowly descended until the large object slung under its belly touched the water zavala hit a release switch and the helicopter lurched upward relieved of the weight it had been carrying the huey moved out of the way and the aircraft carrying austin and trout darted in to take its place austin was out the door first quickly rappelling down a line into what looked like an oversized vaguely bananashaped bathtub he released the rappel line and punched a starter button then maneuvered the strange craft to keep it under trout who was descending the rope a waterproof bag was lowered next trout guided it down it was tricky going directly under the wash of air from the rotor trouts height gave him a firstbasemans edge as he reached for the package holding their vital supplies although his dignified manner reflected his academic background and his lean frame suggested a frail physique trout had built up muscular shoulders and arms from his days as a commercial fisherman he easily hoisted the swinging package off its hook and the huey moved away i dont usually pick up hitchhikers but you have an honest face austin yelled over the engine racket trout smiled despite his worry about gamay he was happy to be doing something at last he unclipped the handheld radio from his belt and talked into it thanks for bringing the limo around joe no problem better give it a test run before you take it for a spin the limo was a twoperson seal one of the smallest hovercraft made the foam and fiberglass grassgreen hull with its rounded stern and sharp pointed nose was only fifteen feet long with the combined kick from its thrust propeller and lift fan the seal could plane along on an air cushion on water or land with its payload at a speed of up to twentyfive miles per hour recalling nina kirovs experience with the giant hovercraft austin had reasoned that the bad guys werent the only ones who should be driving fun boats the seal was designed for hunters and wildlife people who wanted to get into otherwise inaccessible locations the special forces had modified the civilian model adding brackets for a light machine gun spotlight and infrared night sensors austin goosed the twentyhorsepower briggs and stratton engine and felt the craft rise out of the water on its air cushion he tried some circles and loops planing at high speeds and low satisfied that he had the hang of it he turned the controls over to trout while trout got accustomed to the feel of the little craft austin dug through their supply bag and pulled out his pistol and two car s the shortened carbine version of the m in addition to a rate of up to rounds per minute on automatic the weapon could be used as a grenade launcher austin would have been satisfied if no shot had to be fired but he wasnt optimistic he was no longer laughing at trouts cami uniform and had borrowed one of his own and covered his stark white hair with a matching fatigue cap nothing could have prepared them for the powerful stench as they approached the floating bodies the numa men clipped their neckerchiefs in the river and tied them over their noses before moving in closer the bodies looked as if somebody had pumped air into them trouts mouth was clamped in a tight line as he made himself inspect each corpse one by one when he was sure of what he had seen he clicked the radio were okay joe gamay isnt here glad to hear it pal my guess is these are the guys who tried to shoot us out of the sky he shivered remembering gamays close call with the rapids well make a quick sweep down the river she could be waiting just ahead for you and kurt to rescue her thanks again for giving up your seat no problemo amigo there had been a brief discussion the night before over who would accompany austin zavala was eager to go in but he knew trout should be there when they found gamay dead or alive for a more practical reason they needed someone in the command post who could speak spanish and act as liaison with the mexicans an instant later both hueys disappeared over the treetops austin pointed the seal downriver and cranked her up the hovercraft lifted above the water and leaped forward as if out of a slingshot when he asked his special forces pals if they had anything that would get them in and out of tight places austin knew air reconnaissance could cover a lot of ground in a short time but the lowland rain forest would hide anything as small as a human being they took turns at the controls keeping the seal at twenty miles per hour for all their time on the river gamay and chi had barely covered fifty miles since leaving the rapids with the hovercrafts superior speed and no overnight stops they would cover the same distance in a fraction of that time trouts sharp eye caught the glint of sunlight ahead in midstream they pulled up to the tiny islet and trout stepped out chi had been scrupulous about not littering the island but he had dropped a trail mix wrapper without a word trout stepped back into the boat and showed his find to austin who nodded gunned the throttle and notched their speed up to the limit the game was afoot the radio crackled and zavalas voice came on kurt this is crazy we hear you joe whats going on im not sure we were following the river ahead of you it twists back and forth then narrows after a while into sort of a canyon no sign of gamay or chi but were tooling along and all at once the river disappears say again the river just stopped one second it was flowing along the next it was gone where are you now were conducting a search pattern to see if we can pick it up again if not well come upriver and meet you the minihovercraft continued to skim along they too noticed the narrowing of the river and the increasing steepness of the walls zavala came on the radio again nothing kurt were going to have to head back the choppers are running low on gas they had brought extra fuel and left it back at the ruins it wouldnt take them long at their speed to get back fuel up and return to the river search austin said he and trout would go as far downriver as they could and rendezvous with the hueys they waved as helicopters flashed overhead on their way back to refuel and the hovercraft continued on its way they were in the gorge moving even faster with a kick from the current when they saw the pram it was jammed into the mud along the shore austin pulled the hovercraft onto the beach and he and paul jumped out the pram was loaded with cartons and it was probably their weight that kept the current from dislodging the boat and pulling it back into the river what do you think paul id say they were never in this pram my guess is that they were towing it look its so full there isnt room for anyone to sit the outboards in its up position this bow line has been cut austin pulled at a thin rubber hose youre right look the motors fuel hose isnt even connected to the gas tank they shoved the pram farther onto the shore and moments later were back in the hovercraft they were only moving for a few minutes when the river ended austin gave the hovercraft more power to hold it in one place thats the answer to joes disappearing river trout said no mystery it just runs underground he tried to reach zavala on the radio but got no answer and assumed they were out of range or the transmission was blocked by the high rocky walls they decided without hesitation to push ahead they went in slowly coming down from their air cushion trout illuminating the way with his handheld spotlight the vibration and noise created by the thrust propeller unnerved the bats they came off the roof as if blown by a gust of wind a squeaking mass of flapping membranous wings and sharp claws austin doubled their speed the hovercraft was on its air cushion again both men crouched low in the open cockpit hardly able to see through the flying swarm of black furry bodies the craft bounced off the rocky shores several times but as long as he was able to go forward austin kept the pedal to the metal then they were through it and into the clear austin brought the engine down to an idle and the current moved them ahead are you okay he asked my hair will probably go as white as yours but other than that im fine lets keep moving the sound of the motor was horrendous in the close confines echoing and reechoing off the rough walls austin could only hope that any adversaries they met were stone deaf because their arrival would have been announced for miles they moved at a steady dip throwing up waves on either side and before long they emerged into the larger cavern they made a quick circle of the pool to get their bearings and saw that the river ended again but that there was a canal leading off from it the canal ended at a small pier illuminated by a lantern they tied up next to three prams and left the hovercraft with their weapons at ready they proceeded along the walkway into the quarry they stopped to inspect the contents of the boxes then pressed on sunlight was shining faintly in the distance austin stopped under the corbeled archway and listened to the music playing faintly in the distance a latin beat with his back to the wall he edged his way around the corner car held at ready finger on the trigger he stuck his head out scanned the area around the loading platform and seeing no one stepped cautiously into the glare of daylight he signaled trout to follow with austin still at point they moved silently along the narrow dirt road staying close to the foliage on the side near where a rutted track into the woods left the main road they melted into the bushes and got down on their hands and knees they crawled parallel to the track then dropped to their bellies and slithered to the edge of a cleared area austin inched forward and peered through the tall grass trouts hand gripped his shoulder but austin had already seen the mop of hair that was the hue of fine red wine gamay she was tied to the rear bumper of a battered gmc truck her face was the color of boiled lobster skin peeled off her sunburned nose and her crowning glory was a tangle of greasy curls but otherwise she seemed ail right next to her was an indian man who must be dr chi gamay had her eyes closed but she opened them and looked cautiously around as if she sensed their presence austin quickly took in the rest of the scene the source of the music was a portable boom box perched on the bed of the truck sitting on the ground behind the truck were three men engrossed in a game of cards their weapons lay within arms reach and all three men wore pistols austins eye traveled to the front of the truck to where a fourth man was working on the engine he too wore a pistol but more worrisome was the ak leaning up against a tire austin signaled trout to back up paul nodded understanding the need to reconnoiter but the disappointment in his face was obvious minutes later they leaned up against a tree and assessed the situation weve got four armed men who would ordinarily be no problem up against the weapons were carrying austin said but gamay and dr chi are directly in the line of fire i dont like the idea of the fourth man separated from the others hes got an ak right at hand he could still cause damage any suggestions we could call in reinforcements trout said patting the walkietalkie at his belt but even if they got here soon that would mean more shooting more chance of someone getting hurt my sentiments exactly austin scratched the stubble on his chin gamay and chi seem to be okay which means someone wants them kept alive for now at least my guess is that theyll move out as soon as they fix their mechanical problem thats when the situation will get fluid the card game will break up and the guards may move out of the line of fire or maybe we will get our chance when they put gamay and chi in the truck once theyre out of the way we can make our move theres another possibility trout said more of these guys could show up i know that wed be trading a known situation for an unknown and i dont like it any more than you do but i dont think theres anything else we can do except wait trout nodded inreluctant agreement they crawled back to the edge of the clearing the card game was still in progress and the mechanic continued to fiddle around with the engine austin was glad to see that gamay and chi both had their eyes open he suppressed the surge of anger he felt at their plight long after austin had decided he never wanted to hear latin music again the mechanic backed out from under the hood wiped his hand on a greasy rag and got into the cab the engine started on the first try filling the air with an unmuffled rumbling a cloud of purple smoke poured out of the exhaust pipe and enveloped gamay and chi who turned their heads from side to side in a vain attempt to escape the fumes the card game was cut short the players grabbed their money scrambled to their feet and with hands over their mouths and noses moved away from the rear of the truck and their weapons austin noted with pleasure they started yelling at the mechanic who had just hopped out of the cab when he saw that the guards were not showing the proper enthusiasm for his accomplishment he went over and grabbed the nearest one by his collar angrily dragged him to the front of the truck and exhorted him to listen to the motor the remaining guards broke out in laughter and joined the others show time austin said the essentials for a successful ambush are surprise and concealment they could have mowed the chicleros down with a single sweep of their carbines but austin was into rescue not murder he and trout stood up and strode casually into the clearing trout let off short bursts of fire in the air while austin kept the chicleros covered the object was intimidation the gunfire had the desired effect at least partly the three guards saw the two terminators walking toward them glanced at their useless weapons then back at the hardeyed whitehaired man and his towering companion and scattered into the forest like leaves before a wind the mechanic dove into the cab threw the truck into gear and mashed the accelerator the spinning tires gouged trenches in the ground and threw out twin showers of dirt with a roar of the engine the truck started out of the clearing dragging gamay and chi behind like tin cans on a honeymoonbound car music still blasted from the boom box on the trucks bed austin shouted for trout to cover the departing chicleros and drew the bower from his hip with the speed of a dodge city gunfighter holding it in both hands he coolly sighted on the rear of the cab the barrel belched fire five times and the cab window disintegrated in an explosion of glass the last shots were unnecessary because the first bullet had taken off the back of the drivers head the trick went on for another few yards as if it were on auto pilot but it finally lurched to a stop as the engine staled austin ran for the truck but trout got there ahead of him quickly sliced through gamays bonds with a hunting knife and took his wife in his arms cambridge massachusetts a week later a taxi drove past the black castiron fence that surrounded the shaded lawns of harvard yard turned onto a quiet grasslined street and pulled up to a fivestory georgianstyle brick edifice that seemed out of place next to the more modern science buildings keeping it company zavala emerged from the cab and surveyed the sign for the peabody museum of archaeology and ethnology turning to austin and gamay he said reverentially this is a great day for the zavala family my mother always hoped id go to harvard your mother has my husband paul to thank for her little boys success gamay said but congratulations anyhow thank you my mother thanks you too shall we enter the hallowed precincts he said with a gallant sweep of the hand that was entirely in keeping with his character for indeed it was trouts summons to his numa colleagues that brought them to cambridge that morning trout had arrived at the museum by a roundabout route that started in the yucatan jungle after the reunion with his wife trout and the others hitched a ride back to the nereus aboard a mexican helicopter while they waited for the choppers to arrive they took a closer look at the looted antiquities stored in the cave chi had led the way moving down the line of crates and shelves sadly shaking his head as he explained the significance of the artifacts and the damage that had been done by their random exhumation pausing in front of the inscribed stone panels chi lamented i know these stones tell a story an important one but because of the way they were carelessly dug up and thrown into this place it could be months maybe years before we will know what it is chis words echoed in trouts ears as the helicopter flew him and the others to the nereus gamay was checked out and found to be rundown but otherwise in good health with his wife in a real bunk and enjoying the gourmet treats of the vessels galley paul hitched a ride back to the chicleros camp bringing with him a case of photographic equipment the army had established a camp to guard the artifacts and mop up stray looters chi had stayed on to inventory the stolen goods when trout outlined what he had in mind the professor gave him an enthusiastic goahead trout made hundreds of digital photographs of the stones and their inscriptions then he packed up and returned to the research vessel to rendezvous with gamay and fly home back in washington paul worked the data into his computers as a deep ocean geologist trout had developed a high degree of skill using computer graphics for his undersea projects his work went beyond simply probing the ocean bottom with electronic eyes and ears his arcane findings on strata or thermal vents had to be presented so that a phd wasnt needed to understand them archaeology was already using computer imaging to reconstruct everything from ancient cities to skeletal remains he conferred frequently by phone with dr chi who had returned to mexico city after his analysis he called austin and said i know this sounds crazy but this stuff ive been doing for dr chi may tie in with the assignment weve been working on austin didnt need any coaxing he gave nina kirov a brief telephone rundown on trouts findings and asked if she could match paul with a mayanist nina immediately recommended dr orville trout took his computer disks to cambridge and set up shop at the peabody the museums small reception area was dominated by an eskimo totem pole whose grotesque faces looked down at the young college woman at the front desk austin gave their names to the receptionist who punched the intercom button on her telephone an equally attractive guide appeared and led them up the metal staircase past the scowling sculpture of a seated mayan warrior to the fifth level their guide kept up a running commentary the peabody is one of the oldest museums in the world devoted to anthropology she said it was established in with a gift from george peabody construction on the fivestory main building began tit the museum has fifteen million items within its walls but were giving much of the material back particularly artifacts from e h thompsons work at the sacred cenote of chichen itza where they used to sacrifice virgins i can think of better things to do with a virgin zavala murmured fortunately the guide didnt hear his comment she ushered them through a door into a lecture hall nina stood next to the lectern talking to a thin man with wild red hair she smiled brightly when she saw the others especially austin he was pleased to note and quickly came over to take his hand austin felt his blood quicken whenever he set eyes on ninas lush mouth and the bold curves of her supermodels body he vowed to himself that he would take her where they werent surrounded by their friends and colleagues nina introduced the new arrivals to dr orville austin had learned long ago that looks didnt count but he wasnt sure in this case the mayanist wore a rumpled highbutton tweed suit even though the day was warm his widely unfashionable thriftshop tie was decorated with old food stains the manic gleam in the hazel eyes was magnified to incredible proportions by the thick glasses but a burning intelligence kept the creeping shadow of madness at bay just barely austin expected the orbs to spin around at any moment like those of a crazed cartoon character he decided to contemplate the thin line between genius and derangement another time paul is putting the final touches on the presentation and should be with us in a few minutes nina announced the door opened gamay had expected her husbands usual headducking entry her mouth gaped in surprise then widened in a smile extending her hand to the short slight figure she said i hardly recognized you without your machete professor the professors change in appearance went beyond a simple sugar cane knife he had on a customtailored armani suit of bullet gray and a yellow power tie which he wore as naturally as he had his peasants clothes chis classic indian face was as stony as a gargoyle but his dark eyes danced with amusement when in rome he said with a shrug this is a wonderful surprise professor you look well she said and you too dr gamay the last time she saw the professor he was waving from the ground as she ascended into the skies in a helicopter chi appeared none the worse for their river adventure gamay by contrast didnt feel her normal self until she got back to washington the assault by the blistering yucatan sun had taken its toll on her fair skin the trail mix diet and sleepless nights haunted by snake dreams hadnt helped the lecture hall began to resemble a fashion spread from gq when trout stepped through the door befitting his ivy league surroundings trout was in a pseudoenglish mode wearing a hounds tooth custom sports jacket tailored in london to fit his tall frame razorcreased olive slacks and the inevitable bow tie he apologized for the delay and while the professor took over the lectern trout went to the table and slipped a floppy disk into a laptop computer connected to the projection screen the setup was similar to that used at numa headquarters by hiram yaeger nina sat at the table and the rest of the numa team settled into the front row of seats like eager freshmen on the first day of class orville opened the meeting thank you all for coming nina will tell you that i have a reputation for making wild assertions in the local press his mouth stretched into a strange lopsided grin but ill have to admit even my fertile imagination would be hard put to come up with a story more fantastic than the one you are about to hear so without further ado i will turn the meeting over to my esteemed colleague and dear friend dl josh chi the lectern dwarfed chi as he stood beside it with his hands behind his back i would like to thank dr orville for arranging this meeting and allowing us to use space at this institution where i spent many happy hours as a graduate student dr chi said in a voice as crisp as dry leaves as you know dr gamay and i discovered a horde of hundreds of stolen antiquities the artifacts included some intriguing carved stone blocks and stelae cut from temples and buildings with no regard to origin and many were damaged while i would have preferred for the antiquities to have lain undisturbed in the ground and cataloged in situ the people who removed them may have inadvertently been helpful in resolving what i understand from my friends at numa to be a situation of some urgency chi raised his finger and rout punched a computer key an aerial photograph filled the screen this is the looted site chi said the mounds you see are the remnants of buildings clustered around what was once the central square of a mayan city next please another picture came on the screen this is an observatory please note the details on the frieze next construction wasnt confined to the ground level this is a subterranean temple it is only one of the features that make this a highly unusual site austin leaned forward in his chair as if he were trying to put himself into the scene unusual in what other ways dr chi gesturing toward the image behind him the professor said most mayan cities are combinations of administrative religious and residential uses this center was devoted entirely to science primarily the study of time and astronomy ultimately mayan science tied in with religion in much the same way as religion was tied to political power but i have the feeling that more pure science was practiced here than usual its mayan name is sky place for our purposes i am calling it mit like the massachusetts institute of technology zavala said the worldrenowned research and teaching institution was only a few miles from where they sat yes chi replied but in this case mit stands for the mayan institute of technology like a standup comedian in a borscht belt hotel chi waited for the laughter to die down then turned the meeting over to trout and took his place at the table in contrast to the professor trout had to lean onto the lectern to use it from the start dr chi was convinced that the pictures and glyphs inscribed on the stones described a narrative trout said our problem was that everything was jumbled up its as if you tore the pages out of a novel and shuffled them actually several novels because the stones came from different sources this was even tougher because the pages were heavy stones so we made dozens of photographic images and fed the data into a computer where we could rearrange the pictures on a monitor we used common sense and information provided by the mayan writings which dr chi and dr orville translated then we organized the stones into a sequence similar to the story board used for a television commercial the tale they tell as dr orville implied is indeed a strange and unbelievable one trout went back to the projection controls and orville took his place it was fairly easy to categorize the images we simply concentrated on pictures of boats like those on the mit observatory you saw earlier and went from there this is the first one in the chronology austin studied the busy scene for a moment it looks like the spanish armada setting off to sea yes from the number of boats it is definitely a fleet rather than random shipping activity at a port the activity is frenetic but organized here you see boats lining up being loaded then standing by with cargo aboard the photo was replaced by a series of scenes showing the fleet at sea here we have a rather fanciful voyage with all sorts of strange sea creatures orville continued many of these scenes differ only slightly in detail probably an artistic device to give a feeling of time passing any idea how much time gamay said the mayan writings say the voyage lasted one moon cycle about thirty days the maya were precise timekeepers here is the last in the series the boats have arrived at their destination they are being greeted as they unload there is an easy familiarity to the operation which suggests they were known to the inhabitants of this land he turned to trout and said it is time my friend to perform your computer magic trout nodded the blinking computer cursor selected three figures from the scene framed their faces in a heavy white outline then enlarged them one face was that of a bearded man with an aquiline profile and a conical hat the next was wide with full lips and a closefitting skullcap or helmet the third was a man with high cheekbones and elaborate feathered headdress trout moved the images to the left of the screen arranging them top to bottom three new faces appeared to the right looks like they were separated at birth zavala observed of the pairings the similarity is pretty obvious isnt it orville noted lets go back to the full scene again dr kirov as our marine archaeologist we would be pleased to have your opinion using a laser pointer nina highlighted first one ship then another what we have here is basically the same vessel used for dual purposes the features are identical the long and straight flatbottomed hull the absence of a boom the brails or napes used to lower and raise sail hang from a fixed yard the lines sweep back to an overhanging stern three decks fore and aft stays the carved bow the red dot lingered for a second here is the double steering oar the protrusion at this other end is a ram this is a row of shields along the deck so its a warship zavala said yes and no nina said on the top deck of one of these ships are men with spears obviously soldiers or marines there are lookouts in the bows and space for lots of rowers the laser flicked to another ship but here the deck is reserved for a person of quality see this figure of a man reclining in the sunshine the staff has a crescent on top indicating the admirals flagship this thing hanging off the stern could be a decoration a rich carpet maybe that indicates the admiral is in authority how long would this ship be austin asked my guess is that theyre somewhere in the range of one to two hundred feet maybe longer that would put them at around a thousand tons orville interjected nina could you mention that comparison you used with us landlubbers id be glad to this ship is much longer than an english ship of the seventeenth century the mayflower for example was only one hundred eighty tons orville asked so in your opinion nina what are we looking at nina stared at the images as if she were reluctant to vocalize what was in her brain the scientist won out however and she said in my opinion as a nautical archaeologist the ships shown in this rendering reflect the characteristics of phoenician oceangoing vessels if that sounds a little vague yes i am hedging my bets until i have more evidence what sort of evidence would you need nina austin said an actual ship for one thing what we know about phoenician ships we learned mainly from their pictures on coins there have been some reports that they were as long as three hundred feet id take that with a grain of salt but even if you cut that length down by half you still have a substantial vessel for its day substantial enough to cross the atlantic without a doubt she replied these vessels were a lot bigger and more seaworthy than some of the minuscule sailboats that have made the crossing people have rowed across the ocean in a dory for heaven sakes this vessel would have been ideal you cant beat the square sail for an ocean passage with a foreandaft rig youve always got the possibility of a dangerous jibe the boom swinging violently over with a shift of the wind with the brails they could shorten sail in a brisk wind theyd get a roll with that shallow keel but the rowers could help keep her steady and the length of the ship would help a trireme like this could sail more than a hundred miles a day under ideal circumstances short of an actual ship what would you need to convince you this is phoenician im not talking about convincing me gamay said im already convinced could we go back to those fares again paul the six carved heads came up on the screen again the laser dot touched on one depiction of the bearded man then flicked to his twin the pointed hat on these gentlemen is consistent with those worn by phoenician mariners which should come as no surprise orville interjected because the picture on the right came from a phoenician stela discovered near tunisia the gentleman below him is identical to africantype faces found at la venta mexico the third physical type is from the mayan ruins at uxmal i hear a conclusion lurking in there austin said orville sat back in his chair and made a tent with his fingertips basing conclusions on pictorial matching is fine if youre a pseudoscientist trying to sell a paperback book but its not good archaeology orville said he took a deep breath my colleagues would drag whats left of my tattered reputation from one end of harvard yard to the other if they heard me say this marine archaeology is not my forte so i cant assess ninas statements what i do know is that the inscriptions on these rocks show phoenicians africans and mayans together in one place furthermore dr chi and i have translated the glyphs together and independently and weve come up with the same results each time the stones say that those ships arrived in maya country after fleeing a disaster in their homeland whats more they were greeted not as strangers but as old acquaintances did the glyphs indicate a date knowing the mayas obsession with timekeeping id be surprised if there werent one the ships arrived in what would be bc in our calendar nina stared at the projection and whispered in latin seeing all eyes turned in her direction she explained its something you learn in firstyear latin delenda est carthago carthage must be destroyed cato the elder ended every speech he made in the roman senate with the phrase he was trying to whip up public sentiment in favor of a war against the phoenician city of carthage it worked as i recall carthage was destroyed austin said yes in bc which means these ships could have been escaping the romans a date is a date nina said digging in her heels before she got dragged too far into austins theory i simply pointed out the coincidence i made no conclusion as a scientist id be irresponsible to make a statement like that she added but she couldnt hide the excitement building in her gray eyes austin said i understand why as scientists you cant come out and say what youre thinking without more solid evidence but from what ive seen here today im convinced the inscriptions on these stones suggest that ancient voyagers arrived in america long before columbus you know the phoenicians were capable of making the crossing i know they were the worlds greatest explorers up until the fifteenth or sixteenth century they circumnavigated africa and went as far as cornwall on the english coast and cape verde on one voyage they supposedly took thousands of people on sixty ships i rest my case austin said with exaggerated smugness not so fast perry mason the doubters will say these inscriptions are interesting but whos to say they are authentic years ago inscriptions in brazil supposedly described a phoenician expedition in bc the consensus was that they were forged it sounds crazy but youll get people saying the antiquities looters could have been carving this stuff to sell to gullible collectors sure you could make a case that the ships of tarshish undertook transatlantic voyages but you need more substantial and substantiated proof to get anyone in the scientific community to accept it what about the astrolabe you and the professor found even that wouldnt do it kurt they would say someone with cortez or a spanish hidalgo brought this thing in an indian stole it and stuck it in an old temple close but no cigar until you know for sure how it got there did the writing indicate what the ships were carrying weve been saving that for last orville said giggling like a schoolboy oh yes we brow what their cargo was chi said the mayan writing says it was mainly copper jewels gold and silver austin looked like someone shaking off a head punch youre saying the ships were loaded with treasure chi nodded this wasnt a routine trading expedition austin said his green eyes flashing carthage was under siege by the romans the carthaginians would have done everything they could to make sure the romans didnt get their hands on the royal treasury any idea what happened to the treasure zavala asked unfortunately none of the carvings goes beyond the one you saw of the safe arrival of the ships chi said nina frowned all this talk of treasure is exciting she said with impatience but the dazzle of gold and jewels should not keep us from trying to find the answer to the question of why my expedition was massacred in morocco ninas right austin said lets concentrate on the thread that connects these inscriptions to the other discoveries overseas christopher columbus we know that hundreds of years after these stones were carved columbus heard tales of a great treasure he pointed at the screen could this be what he was looking for i hate to throw cold water on your theory orville countered the rumors columbus was following could have had their basis in the real riches held by the aztecs as we know the spaniards hit the jackpot later he paused you say columbus was sailing a definite course do i understand he was following a map not exactly austin said you remember that news clip nina asked you to dig out of your files oh yes the article from my fortean file about the stone artifact columbus mentioned that he was being guided by a talking stone now i remember the carved monolith they found in italy it was being shipped in an armored truck headed right here to the peabody in fact austin said that stone could be the key to this whole mess treasure and assassinations what a shame we cant take a look at it who says we cant numa has tackled deeper and more difficult projects let me see if i follow your line of thinking orville said with disbelief youre planning on diving more than two hundred feet into a wrecked ocean liner in god knows what condition to retrieve a massive stone artifact from a locked armored car zavala winked at austin with any luck we can do it between breakfast and lunch and celebrate at dinner hmm orville said with a smirk he leaned forward and pointed his finger at the two numa men and they say im a nutcake nantucket shoals the minisubmersible was barely a few fathoms below nantucket sounds bluegreen waters and austin was already having second thoughts about diving with zavala his misgivings had nothing to do with zavalas skill as a pilot there was hardly a craft in on or above the water joe couldnt operate it was his offkey singing as the crane lifted the twopassenger craft off the deck and into the water zavala had broken into a spanish rendition of yellow submarine austin barked into his microphone do you know any other songs im taking audience requests how about singing far far away zavalas quiet laughter came over the earphones gee i havent heard that one since i was a muchacho desperate times call for desperate measures no problema it sounds better with a guitar anyway where do you want to go amigo how about down for starters zavalas wave of acknowledgment was visible through the observation bubble that was so close austin could have reached out and touched his colleague on the shoulder if not for the plexiglass that enclosed their heads the twin domes were mounted at the front of the minisub jutting at an angle from its flat green ceramic surface like the bulbous eyes of a frog the deep flight was unlike most deep ocean submersibles and bathyscaphes which tended to be shaped like a fat man rotund and thick around the waist it looked more like a futuristic fighter plane than an undersea vehicle the fuselage was rectangular and flat with the leading and trailing edges tapering like the business end of a chisel the sides were perpendicular to the flat top and bottom with sharp edges as if canvas had been stretched over a frame the wings were stubby and squared off and equipped with fixed running lights thruster fans were mounted behind the wings and observation domes at the front were a pair of manipulator arms and a movable spotlight unlike the crew of a traditional submersible who sat upright as if at a desk austin and zavala lay prone sphinxlike face forward strapped into formfitting pans elbows set into padded receptacles they had dual controls including a joystick for elevation and another for speed zavala handled the sub while austin took care of the other systems such as lights video and the manipulator arms he kept an eye on the headsup digital display that contained compass speedometer and odometer and controls for depth gauge airconditioning strobe unit and sonar the craft was slightly buoyant and dove by moving through the water and adjusting the elevators in its tail section like an airplane their bodies were elevated at a thirtydegree angle to simulate the natural position of a person swimming this attitude also made rapid descents and ascents less frightening the space was adequate for austins sixfootone height but snug around his broad shoulders still he had to admit even with zavalas serenade it was a pleasant way to scout out a wrecked ocean liner the wreck was marked by a red spherical buoy zavala put the sub into a slow series of descending circles around the buoy line which ran down one hundred eighty feet from the surface to a length of chain attached to the third portside lifeboat davit normal descent to the highest part of the wreck took three to four minutes with its fiveknot speed the minisub could make the trip in a fraction of that time but austin wanted to get a feel for the environment they would be working in he asked zavala to ease them to the bottom the deepening water filtered the colors out of the sunlight streaming down from the surface the red tints disappeared first then on through the spectrum at five fathoms all hues had been lost except for a cold bluish green in compensation for the artificial dusk the water became as dear as fine crystal as the sub broke through the warmer layers of thermocline where particles of vegetation were held in suspension the sub corkscrewed lazily into the sea around the anchor line a huge dark mass loomed from the pale bottom sand and filled their vision with the excellent visibility the sub had been running without lights at a depth of one hundred twenty feel zavala flattened their trajectory slowed the minisubs speed to a crawl and switched on the crafts belly light the ship lay on its side the large circle of illumination transformed a section of the hull below them from black to a cadaverish grayish green broken here and there with leprous splotches of yellow and rust stains like dried blood the patina of marine growth made up of millions of sea anemones stretched off into the dimness beyond the reach of the light austin found it difficult to imagine that this huge dead leviathan was once one of the fastest and most beautiful ships afloat it is possible to stand before a building as tall as the doria was long and not be awed by its size but if that same sevenhundredfoot tower is tuned horizontally and placed by itself on a flat empty plain its immensity becomes breathtaking lying on its starboard or right side hiding the fatal gash from the stockholms sharp beak the doria looked like a monstrous sea creature that had simply lain down to rest had fallen asleep and was now being reclaimed by the sea the mini sub switched on its video camera and glided toward the stern staying a short distance above the rows of portholes dwarfed by the massive hull the craft resembled a little bugeyed crustacean checking out a whale near the sixteenton portside propeller zavala made a sharp turn and passed over the sharply etched black rectangles that once served as windows to the promenade deck when open water appeared he dropped the sub down to a depth of two hundred feet and pointed the craft back toward the bow on a path parallel to their earlier course the multitiered decks were a ninetyfoothigh vertical wall off to their left they moved past the three swimming pools that had once cooled passengers according to class on their transatlantic passage scudding along the lifeboat deck whose davits didnt work any better now than they did in dozens of fishing nets had become snagged on the hooklike davits the nets veiled the decks like great shrouds draped over an immense bier the mesh was coated with a hoary cloak of marine growth some nets held aloft from the wreck by their buoys were still snaring fish from the schools of large pollock and cod that darted dangerously close noting the rotting bones caught in the mesh zavala wisely kept the minisub at a respectful distance from the still dangerous nets the ships great redandwhite smokestack had fallen off leaving an immense square shaft down to the engine room other openings marked uncovered staircase wells the superstructure had slipped off and lay in a jumble of disintegrating debris on the sea bottom with its distinctive stack and superstructure gone the andrea doria looked more like a barge than a ship only when they glided by the remnants of the wheelhouse and saw the massive booms winch heads and bollards intact on the foredeck did they began to get the sense that this was a huge passenger liner it was hard to believe a vessel this big could ever sink but thats what they said about the titanic austin reminded himself they had been as reverent as mourners at a funeral but now austin broke the silence thats what thirty million dollars looks like after a few decades at the bottom of the sea hell of a lot of money to pay for an oversized fish catcher zavala said thats just for the hull i didnt count the millions in furnishings and artwork and four hundred tons of freight the pride of the italian navy i cant figure it zavala said i know all about the thick fog but both these ships had radar and lookouts how in all of those millions of square miles of ocean did they happen to occupy the same space at the same time plain lucky i guess they couldnt have done better if they planned out a collision course in advance fifty two people dead a twentyninethousandton ocean liner on the bottom the stockholm heavily damaged millions in cargo lost thats some planning i think youre telling me its one of those unsolved mysteries of the sea do you have a better answer not one that makes any sense he replied with a sigh that was audible over the mike where to now lets go up to gimbels hole for a looksee austin said the minisub banked around as gracefully as a manta ray and headed back toward the bow then cruised evenly about halfway down the length of the port side until it came to a jagged foursided opening gimbels hole the eightbytwentyfoot hole was the legacy of peter gimbel less than twentyeight hours after the doria went under gunbel and another photographer named joseph fox dove on the liner and spent thirteen minutes exploring the wreck it was the start of gimbels fascination with the ship in he led an expedition that used a diving bell and saturation diving techniques the divers cut away the entrance doors into the first class foyer lounge to get at a safe reported to hold a million dollars in valuables amid great hoopla the safe was opened on tv but it yielded only a few hundred dollars looks like a barn door zavala quipped this barn door took two weeks to open with magnesium rods austin said we dont have that long might be easier to raise the whole thing if numa could raise the titanic the doria should be a cinch youre not the first one to suggest that there have been a pile of schemes to bring her up compressed air heliumfilled balloons a coffer dam plastic bubbles even pingpong balls the pingpong guy must have had some cojones zavala whistled austin groaned at the spanish double entendre aside from that astute observation from what youve seen what do you think i think weve got our work cut out for us i agree lets go topside and see what the others say zavala gave him a thumbs up tweaked the motor and lifted the nose of the sub as they quickly ascended with the power from four thrusters austin glanced at the gray ghost receding in the gloom somewhere in that huge hull was the key to the bizarre series of murders he put his grim thoughts aside as zavala broke into a spanish chorus of octopuss garden austin thanked his lucky stars that the trip was short the deep flight broke the surface in an explosion of froth and foam through the waterstreaked observation bubbles a grayhulled boat with a white superstructure was visible about a hundred fifty feet away the minisub was as agile as a minnow underwater on the surface its flat planes were susceptible to the wave motion and it rocked in the slight chop being kicked up by a freshening breeze austin didnt normally get seasick but he was starting to feel green around the gills and was happy when the boat got under way and rapidly covered the distance between them the boats design was typical of many salvage and survey ships whose main function is to serve as a platform for lowering towing and hauling various instruments and vehicles it had a snub tugboats bow and a high forecastle but most of the sixty fivefoot length was open deck at either side of the deck was an elbow crane an aframe spanned most of the twentytwofoot beam at the stern where a ramp slanted down to the sea two men in wetsuits pushed an inflatable down the ramp into the water jumped into it and skimmed over the wave tops to the minisub while one man manned the tiller the other secured the sturdy hook to a grommet at the front of the submersible the line led to a deck winch that pulled the minisub closer the boat maneuvering until the deep flight was on its starboard a crane swung over and lowered tackle that was attached by the men in the inflatable to cleats on the sub the cable went taut the sub and its passengers were lifted dripping from the sea swung over the deck and lowered onto a steel cradle the operation was handled with swisswatch precision and dispatch austin would have expected nothing less than perfection from one of his fathers boats after the revealing session at the peabody austin had called rudi gunn to fill him in and request a salvage vessel numa had dozens of ships involved in its farflung operations that was the problem gunn explained the agencys boats were flung all around the globe most carried scientists who had stood in line for a spot on board the nearest ship was the nereus still in mexico austin said he didnt need a fullblown salvage ship but gunn said the quickest he could get something to austin was a week austin told him to make a reservation and hung up after a moments thought he dialed again the voice like a bear coughing in the woods came on the line austin told his father what he needed hah the older man guffawed chrissakes i thought numa had more ships than the us navy cant the admiral spare you one dinky boat from his fleet austin let his father enjoy his gloat not in the time i need it i could really use your help pop hmm help comes with a price tag lad the old man said slyly numa will reimburse you for any expenses pop i could give a rats ass about money he growled my accountant will find a way to put it down as a charitable donation if he doesnt get sent to alcatraz before then if i get you something that floats does that mean youll wrap up whatever nonsense sandeckers got you involved in and get out here to see me before im so damned senile i dont recognize you cant promise anything theres a good chance of it humph finding a boat for you isnt like hailing a cab you know ill see what i can do he hung up austin laughed softly his father knew exactly where every vessel he owned was and what it was doing down to the smallest rowboat dad wanted to let him wriggle on the hook austin wasnt surprised when the phone rang a few minutes later the gruff voice said youre in luck got you an old scow weve got a salvage vessel doing some work for the navy off sandy hook new jersey not one of your big research vessels but shell do fine shell put into nantucket harbor tomorrow and wait for you thanks pop i really appreciate it i had to twist the captains arm and ill lose money on this job he said his tone softening but i guess its worth it to get my son out here in my declining years what an actor austin thought his father could whup his weight in wildcats true to his word the senior austin had the boat in nantucket the next day the monkfish was hardly a scow it was in fact a mediumsized stateoftheart salvage vessel less than two years old an added bonus was captain john mcginty a hardboned ruddyfaced irishman from south boston the captain had dived on the andrea doria years before and was delighted to work on her again austin was removing the cassette from the minisubs video camera when mcginty strode over well dont keep me in suspense he said with excitement in his voice hows the old gal look shes showing her age but you can see for yourself austin handed over the cassette the captain glanced at the minisub and chuckled thats some hot rod he said and led the way to his quarters he set austin and zavala up with soft chairs and hard drinks then popped the video into his vcr mcginty sat in uncharacteristic silence taking in every detail as the sweptback hull and its patina of anemones rolled across the tv screen when the video ended he punched the rewind button you boys did good work she looks pretty much the way she did when i last dove on her in eightyseven except there are more trawler nets and like you said he sighed shes getting a little worn around the edges its what you cant see thats the problem ive heard the ships interior bulkheads are rotting away wont be long before the whole thing collapses in on itself could you give us an idea what well be dealing with down there ill do my best want a refill not waiting for an answer he poured the equivalent of a double shot of jack daniels into each glass and dropped in a couple of token ice cubes he took a sip staring at the blank tv screen one thing you cant forget the doria may look pretty even with all that scum mucking up her hull but shes a mankiller they dont call her the mount everest of divers for nothing she hasnt killed as many as everest around ten last time i got counting but the guys who dive on the doria are looking for that same adrenaline rush from the danger that mountain climbers get every wreck has its own character austin said what are the major hazards on this ship well shes got all sorts of tricks up her sleeve first of all theres the depth with a twohour decompression you need a drysuit because of the cold sharks come to feed on the fish mostly blues not supposed to be dangerous but when youre hanging on the anchor line decompressing you just hope some nearsighted shark doesnt mistake you for a fat pollock when i first started diving my father told me to remember that in the water you are no longer the top of the food chain austin said mcginty grunted in agreement none of that stuff would be major except for the other problems theres always a wicked current it can be bad all the way down and even runs through the boat sometimes it seems like it will pull you right off the anchor line i felt it pushing against the minisub zavala said mcginty nodded you saw what the visibility was like we could see pretty well today we found the wreck without our lights austin said you were lucky sun was shining sea wasnt stirred up much on a cloudy or foggy day you can be practically on the wreck without seeing it thats nothing compared to inside black as hades silt all over the place just touch it and youre surrounded by a cloud so thick your light wont penetrate it real easy to get confused and lost but the biggest problem is entanglement you can get into real trouble with all the wires and cables hanging down from the ceilings thats if you get past those nets and ropes all over the hull and the monofilament from the party boats that fish the wreck its invisible you dont know its there until its grabbed on to your tank with scuba youve got twenty minutes max to get yourself out of trouble thats not much time to explore a huge ship thats one of the reasons its so damned dangerous fellows want that piece of pottery or dish with the italia crest on it figure theyve spent all that time training and money to get out there they forget they get tired real fast especially if theyre fighting the current and breathing trimix make mistakes get lost forget the plans they memorized equipments got to be working perfectly one guy died because he had the wrong mix in his tanks on my last dive i had five tanks weight belt lights knives i was carrying two hundred twentyeight pounds it takes a lifetime of experience to dive the ship even so its easy to become disoriented youve got the ship lying on its side so the deck and floors are overhead the bulkheads between the decks are vertical the andrea doria sounds like just our kind of place doesnt it joe only if the bar still serves tequila mcginty furrowed his brow ordinarily this kind of cockiness before a doria dive was a oneway ticket to a body bag he wasnt sure about these two the big man with the hair that didnt match the unlined face and the softspoken dark man with the bedroom eyes exuded an unusual confidence the captains worried expression disappeared and he grinned like an old hound dog no it wouldnt surprise him to see them belly up to the dorias firstclass bar and order a drink from a ghostly bartender austin said whats the weather going to be like captain weather tends to be cantankerous as hell out here on the shoals calm one day howling gale the next fog is notorious the guys who were aboard the doria and the stockholm could tell you how thick it gets winds blowing southeast now but it will come around more westerly and my guess is youll have flat seas dont know how many days that will last out here thats okay were in something of a hurry to get the job done austin said we dont have days mcginty grinned yup damned cocky well see still ive got to admit you boys have got brass whats this youre looking for an armored truck in the hold thats going to require some doing especially where you dont know the wreck he shook his head wish i could help you but my diving days are over you could use a guide austin saw a blue hull come into view through a porthole the name myra was painted on the bow excuse me captain he said i think our guide has just arrived georgetownwashington dc gamay do you have a minute trout called out from his study he was bent over the monitor of his computer staring intently at the oversized screen he used for developing graphics for his various undersea projects yrrph gamay answered with a muffled grunt from the next room she lay on her back suspended horizontally above the floor like a yogi in a trance balanced on a narrow plank scaffolding supported by two ladders she and paul were constantly remodeling the interior of their georgetown brick townhouse ruch gunn ordered her to take a few days off to rest before reporting to numa headquarters but the second she got back home she picked up on a project she had left undone painting lifelike flower garlands on the ceiling of their sunroom she walked into the study wiping her hands on a rag she was wearing old jeans and a chambray work shirt her dark red hair was stuffed under a white cap with the words trutest paint on it her face was smudged with green and red splatters except for a racoonish area around her eyes where shed worn protective goggles you look like a jackson pollock painting trout said she wiped a gob of crimson from her mouth how michelangelo painted the ceiling of the sistine chapel is beyond me ive only been at it an hour and ive got a badcase of painters elbow trout peered upward over nonexistent glasses and broke into an easy grin whats with the wolfish smile gamay said warily he put his hand around her slim waist and pulled her closer hed touched her at every opportunity since they had returned home as if he feared she would disappear into the jungle again the days she was missing were a nightmare for him but his yankee upbringing would never allow him to come out and say so just thinking about how sexy you look with paint splattered on your face gamay gently tousled his fine hair and brushed it down over his forehead you perverts really know how to sweettalk a gal her eye caught the images on the screen is that why you called me so much for sudden impetuous romantic gestures he indicated the screen yes tell me what you see she leaned on pauls shoulder and squinted at the monitor no brainer i see beautifully detailed sketches of eight fantasticlooking heads her voice lapsed into the scientific mode like the monotone of a pathologist conducting an autopsy at first glance the profiles appear identical but upon further examination i detect subtle differences mostly around the jaw and mouth but on the cranium as well how am i doing sherlock you not only see but you also observe my dear watson elementary my dear fellow who drew these sketches they are works of art in themselves the esteemed dr chi a man of varied talents i saw enough of the good professor not to be surprised at anything he does how do you happen to have them chi showed them to me when i was at harvard he asked me to run them by you he remembered your background in archaeology before you switched to biology but mostly he wanted a fresh eye trout leaned his long body back and laced his fingers behind his head im an ocean geologist i can take this stuff and make all the pretty pictures i want to but it doesnt make any sense to me gamay pulled a chair up beside her husband look at it this way paul its no different from somebody handing you a rock from the bottom of the ocean whats the first thing youd ask easy where they got it bravo she pecked him on the cheek the same thing applies in archaeology mayan studies wasnt my area of expertise before i switched to marine biology but heres my first question to you where did these glyphs come from trout tapped the screen this one here is from the site chi calls mit where you first ran into the chicleros gamay felt a frisson along her spine at the reminder of beating sun jungle rot and unshaven unfriendly men what about the others all from different locations chi has visited what made him pick these aside from the fact that they are almost identical location each face was from an observatory carved with the frieze showing the boats that may or may not be phoenician intriguing uhhuh the professor thought so the boat theme tied them together whats it all mean i dont know he said with a shrug im afraid thats the extent of my mesoamerican expertise why dont we call professor chi just tried he wasnt in his mexico city office they said he was there earlier but would be unavailable dont t tell me they said he was in the field trout nodded i left a message dont hold your breath now that hes got his humvee back what about orville the nutty professor exactly what i had in mind first i wanted to run this stuff by you in case you had any inspiration call linus orville thats my inspiration trout flipped through his card file and punched out a number when orville answered trout put him on the speaker phone ah mulder and scully orville said referring to the fbi characters in the popular tv program how are things with the xfiles in the most serious tone he could muster trout said weve uncovered solid proof that those mysterious carved boats are from the lost continent of mu youre kidding orville replied breathlessly yeah im kidding i just like to say the word mu well moo to you too mulder now please tell me the real reason you called we need your opinion on those sketches professor chi left with paul gamay said oh the venus glyphs venus yes the series of eight each figure represents an incarnation of the god venus gamay looked at the grotesque profiles with their protruding jaws and foreheads ugh ive always thought of the goddess of love as a delicate maiden drifting out of the sea foam on a scallop shell thats because youve been brainwashed by botticellis vision and wasted your time on classical studies before you got out of the temple of doom game the mayan venus was a male how chauvinistic only to a point the maya were firm believers in equal opportunity when it came to human sacrifice venus symbolized quetzalcoatl or kukulcan the feathered serpent its all tied in the analogy of birth and rebirth like quetzalcoatl venus disappears for part of its cycle only to reappear i get it trout said the maya decorated their temples with representations of the god to make him happy so hed come back there was some of that yeah toadying up to the big guy you have to understand how architecture was worked into theft religion mayan buildings were often fixed on key points like the solstice and equinox or where venus appears and disappears a celestial calculator in other words gamay said professor chi compared the observatory tower at the mit site to a computers hardware the inscriptions on its side to software he felt that it was only part of the whole picture the way one circuit is part of a computer yes he ran that theory by me but your carved tower has a long way to go before it becomes an ibm clone still its possible that the tower and the others were part of a unified plan gamay persisted dont get me wrong the maya were incredibly sophisticated and always manage to surprise they often lined up palace doorways and streets to point to the sun and stars at various times of the year you see predicting the movements of venus would give the priests tremendous power the venus god told the farmers about important dates like planting harvest and rainy season the caracol at chichen itza has windows that line up with venus at various points on the horizon there are no boat inscriptions on the caracol as far as i know gamay said only on those eight temples the glyphs came from venus disappears for eight days during its cycle a scary thing if you were depending on the planet for important decisions so the priests tossed a few maidens into a well did some creative bloodletting and everything was peachy again speaking of bloodletting ive got a class in five minutes can we resume this fascinating discussion later gamay wasnt through you say venus disappears for eight days and that there are eight temples we know of with the boat carvings coincidence chi didnt think so got to go cant wait to tell the class about the musters the phone clicked off paul picked up a yellow legal pad that was edifying lets go over what we have weve got eight temple observatories each one was built to chart the movements of venus trout made a note these structures were also dedicated toward a single theme the arrival of boats that could have been phoenician bearing great treasure a wild guess the observatories and venus have something to do with the treasure gamay agreed she took the notebook and drew eight circles at random say these are the temples she drew lines connecting the circles and stared at her doodles for a moment theres something here she said paul looked at the scribbles and shook his head looks like a flatfooted spider thats because were thinking in earthbound terms look she drew two stars near the edge of the page rise above the earth lets say this is venus at its extreme points on the horizon that temple i saw at mit had two slotlike openings like an archers port in a castle heres what you would see if you drew a line from the window to one extreme of venus now ill do it out the other window satisfied with her artwork she drew lines from each observatory to the venus points she stuck the rough grid shed produced under pauls nose now it looks like the mouth of an alligator about ready to have dinner he said maybe or a hungry serpent still thinking about that snake yes and no dr chi wore an amulet around his neck he called it the feathered serpent thats what this reminds me of the jaws of kukulcan you need the exact locations of the observatories even admitting its possible to make sense from this too bad chi is in the field gamay was half listening i just thought of something that talking stone kurt and joe are out looking for wasnt it supposed to show some kind of grid thats right i wonder if theres a connection trout picked up the phone ill call and leave a message for chi to get in touch with us as soon as possible then well give kurt a ring to tell him you may have something she examined her doodlebug sketches again yes but what nantucket shoals the cabin cruiser that had been circling the salvage boat pulled alongside within hailing distance and cut its engine to an idle the white red and green tricolor of italy fluttered on the signal mast under the american flag the slim silverhaired figure of angelo donatelli stepped out of the pilothouse and waved hallo mr austin ive come on a rescue mission i understand you are running out of grappa may we make a delivery hallo mr donatelli austin yelled back thank you for the resupply until now weve had to drink battery acid captain mcginty cupped his hands around his mouth an entirely unnecessary gesture because his normal voice was a bellow skipper thanks you too and invites you to come aboard on your mission of merry donatelli saluted in acknowledgment and went back into the pilothouse the anchor dropped into the water with a rattle and a splash and the engine died donatelli and his cousin antonio stepped into an outboard launch the yacht had been towing buzzed the short distance to the salvage ship and climbed aboard donatelli handed the captain a bottle of the fiery italian liquor with my compliments he said then turned to austin and swept his hand toward the cabin cruiser how do you like my blue beauty mr austin donatellis continued use of the honorific was old world habit or simply the practiced good manners of a restaurateur used to dealing with a highclass clientele austin figured it was a refreshing change from the phony first name hi my name is bud informality that was one of austins favorite gripes austins eyes swept the cruiser stern to stern and took in its navy hull and creamy superstructure as if he were studying the curves of a lovely woman shes got classically beautiful lines he said how does she handle like a dream i fell in love the first time i saw her abandoned in a boatyard in bristol rhode island ive spent thousands restoring her shes fortyfive feet but the sweep of her bow makes her look even longer a very stable boat perfect for taking the grandchildren out he laughed and a way to escape the family when i need peace and quiet my clever accountant has made the boat part of the business so i have to catch a fish now and again for the restaurants he paused and looked mistyeyed at the sea where a flock of gulls speckled the dark water like snowflakes so this is where it happened austin pointed to the red plastic bubble bobbing in the slight chop the top of the ship lies thirty fathoms under that marker were directly over her there was no need to use the dorias name they both knew what vessel he was talking about i have cruised the waters all around the island donatelli said but i have never never been to this spot he chuckled softly we sicilians are superstitious people who believe in ghosts all the more reason to thank you for helping with this project donatelli affixed austin with piercing deepset eyes i wouldnt have missed this for the world where do we start weve got a set of plans in the captains cabin bene come antonio he said to his cousin whod been imitating a fire plug let us see what we can do for these gentlemen captain mcginty unrolled a sheet of heavy white paper onto a table in his cabin the paper was labeled italian line plano delle sistemazioni passeggeri or plan of passenger accommodation at the top was a photo of the liner cutting its way through the waves in better days below the photo were diagrams of nine decks donatelli tapped the area that showed the belvedere lounge at the front of the boat deck i was working here when the stockholm hit us boom i landed on the floor his finger moved to the promenade deck all the passengers are here waiting for rescue a big mess he said shaking his head in disgust mr corey finds me and we go down to their cabin here on the starboard side of the upper deck poor mrs carey is trapped off i go like a scared rabbit to find a car jack down here his finger retraced his route of that night past the shops on the foyer deck but the way is blocked so i go way back here to the stern then down to a deck donatelli halted his straightforward account remembering the terror that gripped him as he descended into the dark bowels of the sinking ship excuse me he apologized a catch in his voice even now after all these years he took a deep breath and let it out that night i found out what dante went through in his descent to hades he puffed his cheeks and continued so finally i make it to b deck where the garage is everyone knows the rest of the story the others gathered around the table nodded good donatelli said with obvious relief although the cabin was cool his brow glistened with perspiration and a vein throbbed on the side of his head could you tell us exactly where in the garage you saw the armored truck austin said sure it was up here in this corner he borrowed a pencil and made an x i heard there were nine cars in the garage including the fancy one the italians built for chrysler he compressed his lips in a tight smile i never found the jack i was looking for our plan is to go in through the garage doors austin explained donatelli nodded the cars could drive right into the garage from the pier i think its a good plan but i know little of these things he said with a shrug captain mcginty was less equivocal a few minutes earlier hed been diverted by a call on the ships phone now he was back at the table shaking his head hope you boys arent going on a fools errand i see a big problem staring me in the face that may be an understatement id be surprised if the problems werent jumping up and down on our backs like an eighthundredpound gorilla austin said this one is a pisser i know guys whove gotten into that hold coming down through the decks he indicated the starboard wall of the garage everything in that spacecars trucks cargo would have fallen onto this side thats lying in the bottom sand your armored truck could be buried under tons of junk guys whove been in that hold saw that future car chrysler was shipping over but they couldnt get at it because the space is full of twisted beams and busted bulkheads you go in with gym suits like youre planning theres the danger you could get caught up austin was well aware this could be one of the toughest assignments in his varied career more difficult in its own way than raising that iranian container ship or the russian sub thanks for the warning captain my idea is to approach this as if we were looking for a target where the bottoms been littered with wrecks like the east river for example you may be right that the job is impossible but i think its worth taking a look he grinned maybe well even find mr donatellis car jack mcginty let out a whooping laugh well if its a fools errand youre my kind of fool what say we offer a toast to our success donatelli opened the grappa and poured drinks all around using a waiters flourish that hadnt deserted him by the way that was the boys down below calling from the bell mcginty said theyve just about cut through the hull i told them to get things ready for tomorrow then take a rest youd be down first thing in the morning to do the job austin raised his glass heres to lost causes and impossible missions the quiet laughter was cut short as donatelli solemnly raised his glass high and heres to the andrea doria and the souls of all those who have died on her when they tossed their drinks down it was done in silence life is never dull around the andrea doria for the schools of silverscaled fish that claim squatters rights in luxurious cabins that cost their previous occupants thousands of lira but nothing could have prepared the denizens of the blue twilight world for the arrival of two creatures more bizarre than any inhabitant of the depths their plump bodies were covered with shiny yellow skin their backsides protected by a black carapace in the center of their bulbous heads was a single eye twin stumps protruded from the bottoms of their rotund bodies near the top were similar shorter appendages each ending in a claw most curious were the softly whirring fins on each side the creatures hung in the water like balloons in the macys thanksgiving parade the soft laughter of zavalas voice cackled in austins headset have i ever told you how much you resemble the michelin man after the meal with mcginty last night i wouldnt be surprised at anything my gym suit is a little tight around the gut the ceanic hard suit must have been nicknamed by someone with a vision problem the socalled gym suit was actually a bodyfitting submarine the forged aluminum skin was technically a hull vertical and lateral propulsion thrusters on each side were activated by foot controls with its oxygen recirculation and carbon dioxide scrubbing capability the suit was good for six to eight hours of dive time with fortyeight hours of emergency life support it topped the scales at nearly half a ton yet in water the suit weighed less than eight pounds the hard suit provided mobility long dive time and no decompression the suits major disadvantage was its bulkiness penetrating the interior following donatellis route would be suicide they would become ensnared on wires or lines within minutes in formulating a dive plan austin reviewed all past dives on the doria successful or not austin thought the gimbel expeditions had the right idea the attempt tried to use a submersible for reconnaissance but the craft lacked the power to fight the current the diving bell intended for use as an elevator and work station was improperly ballasted and went dangerously out of control what impressed austin was the fact that saturation divers working from the surface with umbilical hoses managed to accomplish a great deal against formidable odds they actually got into the garage the gimbel expedition was better prepared the bell system worked well although it ran into all sorts of problems including nasty weather and a current that tangled the umbilicals divers managed to find the safe and hook it up to a crane in the end austin chose a combination of hand suits and saturation divers he patched together an expedition relatively well equipped for the task his father provided the monkfish and crew gunn combed through the numa expedition and ship schedule and pulled together the diving bell and a decompression chamber on the deck that was equipped with showers and bunks the borrowed minisub with its recon capabilities was an unexpected bonus most important were numas six experienced saturation divers who were flown in from virginia since their arrival on the monkfish they had been worked in roundtheclock shifts to cut a hole in the liners hull the weather on nantucket shoals lived up to its reputation for changeability when austin and zavala crawled out of their bunks that morning the air was transparent the lumpy sea of the previous day had vanished and the ocean was mirror calm reflecting like polished glass the images of the seabirds dotting the surface a pair of black fins cut the water dolphins mcginty said they were a sign of good luck and would keep the sharks away the surface current was about one knot he predicted that a thick fog would later work its way onto the shoals and the current might come up but they could deal with that encased in their heavy suits the numa men were lowered by crane into the water they spent several minutes just under the surface checking out their gear while the crane again swung out over the water and dropped a kevlar cable that was ganged into four short lines ending in sturdy metal dips they gripped the line firmly in their mechanical claws with a hum of vertical thrusters they descended into the indigo sea the monkfish was locked in place exactly over the wreck by four anchor lines two at the bow two at the stern one hundred meters in each direction stability was crucial otherwise the diving bell would swing at the end of its tether like a pendulum although the hard suits were equipped with lights and they brought portable lamps with them no illumination was needed the visibility was at least thirty feet and the shadowy outline of the ship stood out in relief against the paler bottom they headed toward where a section of the hull was illuminated by a cold pulsating glow at the center of the eddying bluish corona two saturation divers clung to the upended port side of the ship like insects on a log one diver knelt on the hull with a cutting torch in his gloved hand while the other tended the kerry cable that conveyed the fuel and kept an eye on things in general they had been transported down earlier by the diving bell which served as an elevator and underwater habitat for the dive team suspended by a thick cable that ran to a winch on the deck of the monkfish the bell hung a few meters above the hull it was shaped like a gaspowered camp lantern the four sides were rounded slightly at the corners the roof sloped down from the hole for the hoisting cable another cable containing communications and power entered the bell from a lower point on the roof fastened to the outside were tanks holding breathing gases and torch fuel the bottom of the bell was open to the sea which was held in abeyance by air pressure from the opening umbilicals snaked to the divers carrying the breathing mixture and hot water to bodywarming tubing in their divex armadillo suits in addition each diver carried an emergency breathing tank on his back the divers were working on a section of steel plating that had been scraped clear of anemones to expose the black hull paint the heat discoloration from the magnesium rods in the highpressure feed oxyarc cutting torch outlined a large rectangle around the garage doors the saturation diver whod been tending the torchman became aware of the twin yellow blimps approaching using the slowmotion movement that comes with working in deep water the diver reached up to take the cable from austin and zavala the numa men could communicate directly with themselves and with the salvage boat but there was no direct link to the saturation divers except through the bell austin was unconcerned because everyone had gone over the plan many times and hand signals were adequate for all but the most complicated message the kneeling diver snapped off his torch when he saw the new arrivals he pointed to each comer of the rectangle where he had cut double holes and gave the thumbsup signal then he and his companion attached the clips from the surface line to the holes the divers moved several meters away and one made a jerking motion with his hand like a locomotive engineer pulling the whistle cord austin radioed the deck crew all clear start hauling the deck crew relayed the message to the crane operator and the kevlar line went as taut as a bow string seconds passed nothing happened the framework around the door had been cut like a dotted line on cardboard austin was wondering if more cutting was needed when there was an explosion of bubbles from the deck the section pulled free with a muffled boom austin directed the surface crew to move the crane over and let the doors drop onto the hull a huge gaping rectangular hole had been opened in the side of the ship at the b deck level the tourist class cabins had been stuffed into fore and aft sections of this deck and c deck the level below it the forward section of deck was where the cabins were split by the autorimessa the deck that housed nine cars and an armored truck zavala powered his suit so he was directly above the newly created opening you you could drive a humvee through this thing why do things halfway think of it everyone who dives on the wreck from now on will think of this as zavalas hole ill pass that honor on to you how about naming it austins aperture how about scouting things out no time like the present ill take the point well go nice and slow watch out for ceiling cables and collapsed bulkheads remember to keep a safe distance apart zavala didnt need to be warned the hard suits resembled space suits worn by the astronauts as with astronauts floating in free fall motions had to be deliberate and unexaggerated even at slow speed a collision between the thousand pound suits would rattle their teeth austin moved in under zavala so that the light from his suit pointed straight into the ship the powerful beam was swallowed by the darkness he gave his vertical thrusters a short blast descended feetfirst into the garage then stopped and rotated the suit three hundred sixty degrees the water was free of loose ends and projections he gave zavala the allclear and watched the bloated yellow figure sink through the bluegreen hole and come to a hovering stop this reminds me of the baja cantina in tijuana zavala said actually its not as dark well stop for shots of cuervo on the way back austin replied the ship is ninety feet wide the cargo would have slid down to the bottom like captain mcginty said everything is at a ninetydegree angle so the floor of the garage is actually that vertical wall right behind you well stick close to the wall so as not to become disoriented as they descended austin went down a mental checklist anticipating obstacles and reactions while he worked on practical problems and solutions his brain was busy on another irrational level probably the survival mechanism that raised the hackles on the unshaven necks of his ancestors he was hearing donatellis voice describing his terrifying descent into the innards of the ship the old man was wrong austin concluded this was worse than anything dante could have imagined austin would take the fire and brimstone of the inferno any day at least dante could see something even if it was only demons and the damned it was hard to believe now that the decks of this vast empty hulk once throbbed with the diesel power of fifty thousand horses and more than twelve hundred passengers basked in the ships sensuous beauty their needs served by a crew of nearly six hundred the first person to dive on the andrea doria after she slid beneath the atlantic said the ship seemed still alive producing an eerie cacophony of groans and creaks the banging of loose debris water rushing in and out of doorways austin saw only decay emptiness and silence except for the sound of their rebreathers this huge metal cairn was a haunted place where a man who lingered too long could go mad the ship seemed to close in on them and austin kept checking his depth gauge although they were only about two hundred feet from the surface it seemed deeper because of the darkness he looked upward the bluegreen rectangle that marked the opening was diffused in the murk and eventually might have become invisible if the saturation divers hadnt placed a strobe light on the edge as a beacon austin glanced at the blinking pinpoint and felt reassured then turned his focus to what lay below under their feet solid objects were looming out of the darkness into the circle of illumination cast by their lights straight lines and edges mysterious rounded shapes tons of debris were jammed into the horizontal space that had once been the starboard bulkhead of the dona when the ship was level the garage was covered with heavy metal mesh and catwalks now these were vertical as well austin and zavala started a search pattern moving in parallel lines back and forth between the vertical partitions formed by the old floor and ceiling of the garage the type of search they would execute if they were on the surface looking for a shipwreck they encountered dangling wires from the old light fixtures but not enough to be dangerous and they were easily avoided their lights caught the glint of metal and glass and vague forms that occasionally resolved into familiar shapes hey kurt is that a rollsroyce i see down there austin directed his light at the distinctive heavy grille sticking out of the debris probably according to the liners manifest a guy from miami was shipping his rolls back from europe goes to show it pays to have a rolls on every continent austin glided over the rolls and saw part of another car with unconventional sweeping lines that looks like the chrysler experimental car built by ghia too bad pitt isnt here hed go through hell and high water to add a oneofakind to his collection hed have to go through a lot of mud too the cars had tumbled on top of one another and now were largely covered by debris and silt austin had briefly entertained thoughts of a plan to excavate the debris but it was an intellectual exercise only too dangerous costly and timeconsuming any effort to dig through the cover would stir up a cloud so thick it would take days to settle from what donatelli said of the trucks position the vehicle should have fallen onto the top of the heap it should have been visible could the old man have been wrong he was under tremendous stress that night maybe the car was in another cargo hold austin groaned it had taken a tremendous effort to cut into the garage they had neither the time nor resources to try again his expeditionary force was made up of assets borrowed for only a few days doubts grew the longer they searched they went over every square yard of visible debris whatever happened to the plan to refloat this thing with pingpong balls zavala said i dont think there are enough pingpong balls in china for the job whats your take i think angelo donatelli was one gutsy guy this must be the biggest sensory deprivation tank in the world hard to believe were still on planet earth i feel like a fly in a molasses jar im beginning to wonder if the truck is in here at all where would it be i wish i knew austin replied nina is going to be disappointed i know what say we go topside and deliver the bad news fine with me my bladder is telling me i drank too much coffee this morning they powered the vertical thrusters keeping a slow but steady pace homing in on the flashing beacon above as they ascended they flashed their lights ahead and above to make sure they werent coming up on unseen obstructions the beam from zavalas light stabbed the blackness in a corner of the garage moved away for a second then came back kurt he called out excitedly theres something in the corner they stopped their ascent austin saw two red eyes glowing in the inky darkness having spent more than an hour in this otherworldly environment his first reaction was that they were looking at a huge sea creature whod made the ship its lair he pointed his light at the twin orbs and his pulse rate ratcheted up a few beats it couldnt be both men moved in for a closer look and put the full force of their lights on the corner well ill be damned they said in unison decades before austin and zavala cut their way into the andrea dorias garage a ships officer presciently pictured the dire consequences of an armored truck weighing several tons crashing around in the hold during a storm at sea to head off that possibility the vehicle was lashed by strong cables passed over the trucks body and bolted to the floor more than fifty years later the cables still held the truck in place at a right angle to the vertical wall that had once been the garage floor the black body was mottled with rust and the tire rubber had softened into an evillooking mush the chrome still held a dull shine though and the truck itself was in one piece after as thorough an inspection as they could make austin and zavala left the hull and went back into the open sea the saturation divers had retreated to the dry comfort of the pressurized bell austin didnt blame them saturated trimix is eight times as difficult to breathe as air from a scuba tank austin called mcginty tell mr donatelli weve located the truck goddamn knew you could do it is it accessible for salvage with a little luck and the right equipment ive got a shopping list austin quickly laid out the gear he wanted no problem theres a fresh crew coming down theyll bring the stuff with them the bell rose to the surface and the divers inside exchanged places with a team living in the decompression chamber when the bell returned the equipment austin ordered was secured to its exterior austin had talked by radio to the replacement divers before they left the ship and outlined the plan the divers popped from the bottom of the bell and swam over to the hole in the hull austin and zavala reentered the ship first the saturation divers followed with their umbilical lifesupport hoses trailing behind one of them carried an oxygen cutting torch austin regretted not having direct contact with the divers he would have liked to hear their comments when they saw the truck hanging from the wall at a right angle their animated arm waving was almost as enjoyable after their initial reaction they got right to work on the trucks rear doors they wouldnt yield to a crowbar or the mechanical claws of the hard suits donatelli had said the assassins who killed the armored truck guards simply slammed the doors they were probably rusted shut rather than locked austin guessed the torch blazed to life and the diver drew its scalpellike flame along the lock and hinges the rust exploding in a shower of sparks they tried the crowbar again both saturation divers putting their backs to it the doors fell off and a brownish cloud of rotting debris flushed out by the intruding seawater enveloped the four men when it settled and the water was somewhat clear again austin edged forward and probed the trucks interior with his light the space was piled with metal strongboxes that had fallen off shelves the swirling water had cleaned away the clothing hair and remnants of tissue so that the grinning skulls caught in the beam of the light looked freshly scrubbed not green with algae as they might otherwise have been the bones had all tumbled in a heap onto one side of the truck with the other debris austin moved aside to make room for his partner zavala was silent for a moment looks like the charnel house you see under the old churches in mexico and spain its more of a slaughterhouse austin said grimly angelo donatellis memory is pretty good those strongboxes are probably for the jewels that were being shipped he willed himself to avoid the sightless eyes well deal with that stuff later he gestured to the saturation divers and they swam closer to inspect the inside of the truck in telling the divers about the stone slab earlier austin had warned youll also come across some human bones i can tell you later how they got there hope youre not superstitious the divers stared into the truck and shook their heads but their stunned reaction was temporary the numa divers were pros they swam into the truck without further hesitation and started moving the boxes and bones aside within minutes they had exposed a solidlooking corner of a blackishgray object the long lost talking stone while the divers tidied up the interior austin and zavala scudded back to the diving bell and returned with a block and tackle attached to the kevlar tow line that went up to the ship the bones had been respectfully placed in a neat pile the strongboxes were stacked out of the way except for one the divers had set aside with great ceremony a diver opened the box to display its contents light glittered off a breathtakingfortune in diamonds sapphires and other precious stones austin heard zavalas sharp intake of breath that stuff must be worth millions maybe billions if the other boxes are as full this confirms that the motive was murder not robbery he signaled the saturation divers to move the box and he set the double block and tackle he was carrying just inside the door zavala had been carrying a metal loop the saturation divers attached this wire collar around a protruding end of the slab then affixed the line to the pulley austin knew that the center of lift should be maintained directly above the center of gravity he also knew this ideal seldom occurred it was like telling someone to lift with his legs not his back good advice but of little use when the load is in the back of a closet or under the cellar stairs the kevlar cable went through the hull then angled to the truck the block and tackle would translate its force into a more lateral pull while doubling the pulling capacity austin was dealing with a number of unknowns one was the weight of the slab an object is buoyed up by the water it displaces austin knew the slab would be lighter in water but since he could only guess at its original weight this didnt do much good hed asked mcginty for two tackles rigged with a continuous fall which can lift twice as much as a single tackle it was revved for a rightangle luff technical jargon meaning that theyd done everything they could to compensate for the awkward pulling system the next problem after theyd yanked the slab out like a dentist extracting a tooth was preventing it from plummeting to the bottom the solution was ocean salvage tubes a fairly new concept the elongated bags of nylon fabric were designed for salvaging boats with a lifting capacity up to one and a half tons each they might be able to hoist the entire armored truck to the surface the saturation divers used the block and tackle to movethe slab to where they could lash an uninflated bag to each side of the stone austin went through and inspected the whole crazy setup especially the fragile cables holding the truck to the wall then gave the signal using a hose coming from the bell the saturation divers pumped air into the tubes which plumped out as quickly as sausages on a skillet they fed the air in gradually to build up positive buoyancy the slab lifted like a magicians assistant floating in midair keeping the lift line attached in case of an emergency the divers nudged the slab out of the trick until it floated through the door austin thought this was one of the strangest sights he had ever seen it was like a painting by dali where everything is askew the black slab floating in space over the abyss like a magic carpet in the immense inkdark chamber the divers dangling like newborn salamanders from their umbilicals the seaworn armored truck hanging off the wall at a right angle flanked by austin and zavala who illuminated the way with their lights the divers swam the slab toward the opening it was delicate work especially with the current running through the wreck but at last the slab was directly under the hole theyd cut in the hull wish i could talk to these guys and tell them what a great job theyre doing zavala said he tried to signal a well done with his mechanical claw but it didnt quite make it guess wed better not highfive until we get out of these suits which i hope will be damned soon shouldnt be more than a few minutes before we can turn the rest of the job over to mcginty hear that cap the conversations between the hand suits were communicated to the deck so the men on the topside could keep tabs on what was going on below bet your ass mcginty harked i heard the whole skinny got a case of bud on ice get that thing out of the wreck and well do the rest the saturation divers had to stay at depth or theyd come down with the bends once the load was out of the wreck austin and zavala would take over and guide it to the surface when the slab was near the surface theyd tend it until the crane could finish the job whats the weather like up there austin asked seas still flat calm but the nantucket fog factory has been going full tilt fog bank is rolling in with stuff so thick you could fry it up like dough both austin and the captain would have been even more concerned if they knew what the fog hid while austin and the others had struggled to pull the stone slab from the armored truck and haul it to the surface a large ship whose gray hull made it practically invisible was approaching the monkfish traveling just fast enough to keep pace with the moving wall of fog the oddly shaped vessel was six hundred feet long with a deep v shaped bow and wide back and it was powered by six water jets that could send it skimming over the sea at fortyfive knots an amazing speed for a ship that size austin responded to mcgintys weather report with a finest kind cap borrowing one of trouts expressions from his fishing days he signaled the saturation divers to put more air into the lift tubes slowly the load began to rise through the hole the saturation divers stayed with the stone making sure it didnt oscillate when it hit the stronger current flowing over the wreck austin and zavala remained just inside the wreck off to one side so they wouldnt be under the slab if it came down in a hurry they had a clear view of both divers one on either side of the slab keeping pace with its ascent with slight flutters of their fins a pictureperfect operation one for the books until all hell broke loose one of the divers jerked in a wild ungraceful dance his arms and legs flailing like an epileptic in a grand mal then he doubled over clawing at his umbilical just as suddenly he regained control of his body floated in place for a moment then jackknifed in a dive that took him back through the hole into the innards of the andrea doria the whole mad sequence took only a few seconds austin had no time to react but as the diver swam closer austin saw what had happened the mans umbilical trailed uselessly behind his suit the diver had switched to his emergency tank what the hell happened the hose couldnt have been cut on the ragged edge of the hole austin had been watching the whole time the diver swam toward him the exposed part of his face white as marble austin cursed himself for not insisting on total underwater communication the man jabbed the water above his head zavala who had been moving in a slow circle yelled over the intercom kurt whats going on damned if i know austin said he squinted up at where the slab was suspended over the opening weve got to get this guy into the bell hes okay on his spare tank but hell freeze to death without the hot water feed ill give him a ride up and take a look at the same time austin held out his thick metal arm as if he were escorting a prom date the diver got the hint and grabbed on to his elbow austin activated the vertical thrusters and they levitated from the wreck the second diver was nowhere to be seen while austin scoured the sea for him something stirred in the murky gloom a fantastic figure moved into the range of the light cast by the diving bell it was a diver wearing a hard suit of burnished metal that reminded austin of the armor made to accommodate henry viiis porcine bulk austin suspected that the stranger had something to do with the saturation divers problems that suspicion was reinforced a second later when the newcomer raised an object in his hand then was an explosion of bubbles and the blurred glint of metal a projectile rocketed past austins right shoulder barely missing him the saturation diver took off and swam toward the bell with wild kicks of his flippers austin watched him disappear through the bottom hatch then turned his attention to more pressing matters other silvery figures had materialized and were heading in his direction austin counted five of them before he nailed the down control on his vertical thruster and plunged back into the doria mcginty was anxiously shouting over the radio what the hells going on someone get back to me or ill come down there and see for myself wouldnt advise it austin shot back six guys in hard suits just showed up for tea and theyre not very friendly one just took a shot at me mcginty erupted like a volcano jesus mary joseph and all the saints at sea another voice cut in near hysteria those sonsofbitches cut jacks line the missing diver was talking from inside the bell austin recognized his texas drawl is he okay yeah hes in here with me scared brainless but hes fine you and jack sit tight austin advised mcginty how soon can you yank the bell to the surface ive got my hand on the switch then start hauling its on its way dyou want me to call the coast guard a squad of navy seals would come in handy but you can call in the bengal lancers for all the good it will do this thing will be over before help gets here well have to deal with it ourselves austin you watch your ass havent been in a donnybrook in ages wish i could get down there and break a few heads so do i dont mean to be rude cap but i gotta go ciao behind the dark plexiglass shielding austins face the pale bluegreen eyes were as hard as turquoise stones most mortals placed inaustins situation would have reacted with alarm austin wasnt fearless he could make a good case that his hair had turned platinum white from the healthy scares hed received in his career had he seen six white sharks bearing down he would have been wishing hed renewed his life insurance the forces of nature were unthinking and relentless despite the fearsome picture the intruders presented austin knew that under their aluminum skins were men with all their frailties a replay flashed through his eyes of the attacks in morocco the only difference was the underwater setting they wanted the talking stone and the numa divers were in the way further intellectualizing was dangerous thoughts could be like slippery banana peels what was needed was cunning rather than intelligence a wolf doesnt think about its prey before it pounces austin let his mind slip into its survival mode letting instincts dictate his moves a spreading warmth chased away the cold chill that had gripped his body when hed first seen the attackers his breathing became regular almost slow his heart beat at an even pace at the same time he wasnt kidding himself a wolf had claws and teeth zavala had heard the radio exchange with mcginty whats the game plan kurt the words were measured but edged with anxiety well let them come to us we know the territory they dont well need weapons my specialty ill see what i can dig up zavala glided toward the back of the armored trick cable cutters what do those guys have i dont know i thought it was a spear gun now im not so sure zavala brandished the loppers if we can get close enough i can cut a few zippers austins mind which had been working at mach speed came to a screeching halt hed been staring past zavala at the open door of the armored truck mesmerized by the bright rectangle of light standing out against the inky blackness he moved closer the portable halogen lamps they had used during the slab removal brightly lit up the interior i may have a better idea austin said the venus flytrap keeping an eye on the hull opening austin outlined his plan for zavala simple yet audacious zavala replied that takes care of one what about the others improvise zavala raised the loppers like an indian brave armed with a tomahawk about to do battle with the rifles of the cavalry and melted into the darkness on the far side of the truck just beyond the engine compartment austin pried the lid open on two more jewelry chests it was like opening boxes full of stars even underwater the glitter of diamonds sapphires and rubies was blinding he arranged the strongboxes neatly in a row just inside the trick where they would be in plain view propping up their backs he added a few shills for dramatic effect then moved away from the truck until he too was cloaked by the artificial night within the great ship he hovered in the vast empty space glancing back and forth between the truck and the hull opening above although the interior of the hard suit was dry and cool he was sweating there was a glow near the hull opening then a pair of divers came into the ship like ferrets entering a rabbit burrow their twin flashlight beams stabbing the murkiness probing this way and that watching their cautious entry austin recalled the tentativeness with which he and zavala had first entered the wreck their nervousness at the unknown and the adjustment to a disorienting topsyturvy world where up and down were no longer useful referents he was counting on that initial confusion and on the natural tendency of the eye to focus on the only visible object in the empty void the armored truck looking out of place and time the divers moved back and forth probably debating a course of action whether they were walking into a trap they approached the truck staying dose to each other adjusting to the current drawing nearer until their burnished suits were semisilhouetted in the doorway austin cursed they were shouldertoshoulder as long as they stayed that way his plan was dead and maybe so were he and zavala then human nature intervened one diver muscled the other aside he was framed directly in the trucks doorway body at a forward slight angle head bent into the truck austins lips curled in a fierce grin pushiness doesnt pay pal he alerted zavala assuming ram speed cutting started zavala shot back austin kicked both thrusters into lateral full speed and aimed for the back of the truck the suit accelerated slowly then gathered momentum as its halfton weight overcame the forces of inertia and water resistance he flew directly toward the truck like a bowling ball trying to pick off the last pin praying that the diver would stay put he didnt want an eternity with zavala reminding him how he spent his last earthly moments imitating an accordion his luck held the diver remained transfixed by the jewels probably trying to figure out how he could carry them off austin focused on the suits wide metal butt just below the hard plastic shell covering the air tanks like a tortoise shell damn he was coming in too low he gave himself a slight vertical lift back on target now austin yelled knowing there was no need to raise his voice as he hurtled forward he brought his feet up like a boy making a cannonball dive trying to imagine himself on an invisible bobsled but the best he could do with the metal joints that restricted his movement was to elevate his knees zavala was working feverishly the pincher jaws had nibbled away at some of the strands of the front cable holding the truck he was afraid of cutting through too soon at austins shouted command he put all the power of his shoulders built up over many hours punching a body bag in his boxing days into the loppers s long handles the center of the cable had some life in it and there was slight resistance at first then the beaklike blades cut through the remaining strands as easily as a raptor ripping apart its prey austin fought to extend his feet straight out but his metal knees slammed into the metal posterior of the diver ogling the jewels without the suit austin would have popped his knee joints like a skier taking a backward spill but the stiffness of the suit saved him the diver was launched forward as if he had been tossed by a brahma bull and flew headfirst into the truck austin bounced back and spun out of control the other frantically tried to back out of the truck but his thrusters were caught on a shelf frame austin had his own problems he tumbled through space trying to figure out the thruster combination that would stabilize him he heard zavala call out bombs away with one cable cut the armored truck had dropped down at its front end and hung precariously off the wall at an angle its headlights pointing almost straight down for an instant it seemed to zavala who had moved a safe distance away as if the vehicle would stay that way then the full weight of the truck proved too much for the remaining cable the restraint snapped and the truck dropped away from the wall it plunged into the darkness joining the automotive graveyard in a big explosion of silt taking with it the bones of its defenders the jewels and the struggling diver the whole sequence involved only a few seconds the surviving diver had glimpsed austins attack and watched with astonishment as the truck disappeared but he recovered quickly from his shock austin had finally regained stability and was fighting off the dizziness when the bright light from the divers flash exploded in his fare he nailed his down thruster knowing that in the time it took to drop a few yards hed be an easy target he gritted his teeth and braced himself against the searing pain he knew would come the blinding light stayed on him then shot off at an angle and he saw the other diver struggling wildly zavala seeing austins predicament joe had come from behind and hooked his arm behind the divers weapon arm throwing him off balance they wrestled in slow motion like two monstrous robots in his left claw zavala clutched the lopper but it soon became clear to him that his opponent was not going to stay still long enough for zavala to cut a zipper as intended the halfbaked arm lock was slipping and zavala was just plain weary from his mornings exertions improvise zavala remembered he jammed the loppers into the gym suits lateral thruster the wire cutters were wrenched from his grip the spinning propeller disintegrated in its housing zavala backed off the diver hit both thrusters to get away but the unequal thrust of one propeller sent him into an undesired spin he whirled off into the darkness on a wobbling crash course weighted for neutral buoyancy the divers weapon floated until austin grabbed it in his claw the device was primitive in design but made of contemporary metals a deadly instrument of death underwater where firearms were useless attached was a cradlelike magazine with room for six bolts the short bolts had fins at one end and at the other four razorsharp blades that could have sliced through his aluminum suit like a can opener the oversized controls were simplified so that even a mechanical claw could string a bolt in place for firing zavala glided closer what is that thing he said panting from his wrestling match looks like a modern version of an old crossbow a crossbow last time it was dueling pistols zavala said with a combination of wonder and disgust next well be throwing stones at the bad guys beggars cant be choosers joe wonder if this thing really works austin held the weapons butt against his chest and aimed lethal but my guess is its not terribly accurate except at close range youre about to get your chance to find out weve got bogies at one oclock twin gossamer lights floated through the open hull and into the ship two more divers both armed and less prone to ambush than their predecessors i dont think we can sneak up on these guys as easily austin said they would have been talking to the others on their radios so theyll have an idea what to expect weve got a couple of points in our favor they dont know were armed and for now they dont know where we are austin sorted through the options they could run and hide but eventually as they became more exhausted theyd screw up the hard suits werent made for the kind of demands being placed on them and eventually they would run out of power or air okay lets show them where we are id flip to see who gets to be bait but i dont have a coin how are you at imitating a firefly you just get your little crossbow ready robin hood the intruders had paused distracted by their spinning comrade who was bouncing erratically around the cargo space zavala turned on every light on his suit and flashed them on and off for effect for a moment he hung suspended in the darkness like a bizarre road sign then he disappeared that caught their attention the attackers moved toward his last sighting only he wasnt there he moved several meters off to the right flash clickclick the chest and head lamps came on and off he shifted again lights on lights off the effect was startling even to austin who knew what was going on zavala clones seemed to be popping up all over the place never thought id end up as a flasher zavala said your mother would be proud of you joe its working theyre coming closer it would be only a matter of time before they were on top of zavala one more time joe said austin im right behind you zavala again blinked on and off like a christmas tree the attackers picked up speed and headed for the last place they had seen him directly toward austin he brought the weapon up to his shoulder five seconds to get out of the line of fire joe he said evenly beat feet going down zavala said in a parody of an elevator operator he dropped several yards austin counted slowly his sights transfixing the darkness behind the nearest approaching light when he was sure zavala was in the clear he squeezed the trigger mechanism and felt the crossbow kick slightly as it loosed the bolt it was impossible to see the missile but the shot must have been true because the light beam on the right jerked crazily austin levered the bowstring back for another shot reloading a new bolt in its cradle swearing at the clumsiness of the mechanism especially in the dark by the time he brought the crossbow to his shoulder for another shot the second attacker had figured out what was going on and snapped off his light austin let off a bolt anyhow but knew just from the feel of things that it had missed i nailed one of them joe missed the other guy lets see if we can find him ive got the weapon so ill take the lead he stared into the darkness useless hed have to take a chance he flicked the lights on the front of his suit and his head lamp and saw a reflection he headed for it hes making a break for the hole i see him zavala said im right behind you they started after their quarry like two blimps on an attack run austin was pumped up with excitement but even as he flew through the water with zavala keeping pace he couldnt help think that this must be one of the strangest battles of all time men encased in metal skins fighting to the death with ancient weapons in the massive cargo space of a mortally wounded ship a shadow flitted through the opening and was gone damn too late joe austin powered down hes in the open you said there were six one went down with the truck you nailed another and the third is imitating a whirlagig that leaves three thats my guess but i wouldnt swear to it youll recall my miscount on the nereus how could i forget it close enough for government work as they say lets wrap this thing up he said wearily im tired as hell i have to take a leak and ive got a date this saturday with a beautiful agricultural lobbyist shes got cactus flower eyes that are blue like youve never seen kurt one day scientists would tap into zavalas libido and unleash one of the strongest forces in the universe austin reflected i wouldnt want to stand between you and your sex drive joe it might be dangerous youre the weapons officer got anything up your sleeve i think i see the torch hose zavala rose several yards and grabbed the dangling torch got it dont know what use it is hey the slab is gone austin rose until they were both almost directly under the huge hole in the ships side where the stone slab had floated earlier on its airfilled pontoons the bluegreen of water was impeded only by nosy fish they hijacked it while we were busy austin pictured the theft in his mind theyd need at least two guys to swim that load through the water theyll have their hands full theyll never expect us to go for them what are we waiting for zavala shot back he threw the useless torch aside and they both hit their vertical thrusters they popped out of the ship into the open ocean they were still deep beneath the cold dark atlantic but austin was happy to escape the claustrophobic darkness inside the dorias corpse the diving bell was gone and the only illumination was the filtered shimmer from the surface the giant hull of the andrea doria stretched out in both directions grayish near them and black beyond their immediate proximity austin saw a metallic glint in the distance but it could have been a fish he wished he could reach up and rub his eyes the best he could do was squeeze them shut then open them no good only the unbroken bluish monotone wait there it was again he was sure of it i think i see them near the bow they moved higher then leveled out and glided toward the bow in fighter plane formation zavala saw a movement and called austins attention to it the slab was being pushed along floating on the pontoons two divers one on either side a tow line stretched off into the gloom ahead probably being pulled by an unseen diver well try to bluff them give them a light show ill take a shot the beams washed the slab and the divers on either side the divers accelerated as if they thought they could outrun their pursuers austin loosed a bolt trying not to puncture a pontoon he thought he saw the projectile bounce off the slab the attackers shot off into the murk the tow line went loose the slab came to a slow stop above the old bridge wing of the doria let them go joe weve got to tend to this thing they swooped down and started to swim the stone back toward the hull opening where mcginty could find them with the bell it was slow going because they were pushing against the current flowing over the ship a voice crackled in austins earphones its mcginty are you okay were both fine got the stone were moving it back to the work area you can drop the bell anytime there was a pause followed by a faint snort that might be a problem the captain said his voice burred with irritation weve lost the bow anchors from the looks of the lines theyve been cut surface currents pushing us around if we drop the bell itll swing like a big pendulum could knock us over looks like our pals covered their escape joe i heard any chance of reattaching the anchor lines austin and zavala were dangerously tired the hard suits were not designed for handtohand combat and the metal skins with all their paraphernalia had become personal prisons its doable but not by us itll be easier just to wrassle this thing up on our own and thats not going to be easy he asked the captain if he could get the boat roughly into the same position and hold it there not exactly but close enough mcginty said they were approaching the hull opening the monkfish should be right above them mcginty did a skillful job the line they had used to lift the hull section dangled a short distance above the wreck they attached the line to the slab not easy without the fingers of the saturation divers to do the detailed work then gave the captain the goahead okay cap austin said were coming up austin had a good view of the impenetrable wall of fog bearing down on the monkfish as he dangled like a hooked flounder over the ocean the crane pivoted and lowered him onto the deck where crewmen helped him out of the dripping gym suit like pages attending to an armored knight hauled aboard a few minutes earlier zavala looked strangely shrunken without the benefit of his formfitting hull like those of an astronaut coming out of free fall austins first steps were wobbly zavala handed him a mug of hot coffee a few sips of the strong brew got his blood circulating then they dealt with their top priority a stifflegged race for the nearest head they came out smiling after changing into warm dry clothes they went back on deck the trip up from the andrea doria wreck had been uneventful but tense especially during the first few moments as the winch eased the strain with slow stopandgo pulls and at the surface where the load lost its buoyancy the skilled monkfish crew attached more floats to make sure they didnt lose the stone got it into a sling then winched it aboard using the stern aframe austin gazed at the innocuouslooking block now lying on a wooden pallet and found it hard to believe it had caused so much trouble and cost so many lives the slab was shaped vaguely like an oversized headstone which was appropriate given all the people whod been killed for its sake the object was a little longer than a tall man almost as wide and as thick austin knelt on the deck and ran his hand over the surface which was going from black to dark gray as it dried he traced the hieroglyphics but they made no sense to him nothing about this case made sense crew members covered the slab with a quilted protective material then wrapped it in a plastic tarp a small forklift transported the slab to a storage space at deck level it didnt seem fragile having weathered nearly half a century in a submerged armored truck and a ride to the surface but he didnt want to take the chance that it would break into a thousand brittle pieces with sad eyes donatelli watched the stone being taken away so thats what all those men died for the killing still hasnt stopped austin answered grimly as he squinted at the fog which now encased the salvage ship in a yellowgray tomb that muffled sound and light the temperature had dropped at least ten degrees he shivered as he remembered angelos description of a similar fog bank that hid the andrea doria from eyes on the stockholm lets check in with the captain he suggested and they climbed to the bridge inside the wheelhouse mcginty motioned for them to come over to the radar screen and pointed to a white blip against the green backdrop austin blinked maybe hed been underwater too long the blips rapid progress across the screen was more like that of an aircraft than a boat is that vessel moving as fast as i think it is zavala said goin like a banshee mcginty growled austin tapped the screen with his finger could be our bad boys mcgintys eyes sparkled when i was growing up in southie the cops would swing the cruiser through the housing project and youd see guys running in every direction cops always found someone wanted for something if you had a guilty conscience all you had to do was see that blue bubble atop the cruiser to get your legs moving same thing here ill bet the guilty flee when none pursueth austin said the blip passed other craft moving in the same direction as if they were stationary my guess is that those folks fleeth at about fifty knots mcginty let out a low whistle this looks like a big ship to me i dont know of any vessels of size that can move like that i do its called a fast ship its a new design company called thornycroft and giles makes them they use a semiplaning monohull with water jets that eliminate propeller cavitation even a fast ship container vessel can cruise at fortyfive knots the newer versions might even be faster cap did you see any big boats around the wreck just before the attack this is a busy place mcginty pushed his cap back on his forehead as if it would help his memory lots of boats fishermen mostly coming or going did we actually see this ship maybe there was a goodsized craft hunkering a mile or so away but we lost it in the fog bank i was busy with dive operations my guess is that if we could cut through the corporate red tape wed find it was owned by halcon industries can we get air surveillance mcginty asked impossible in this fog but what if we do find it wed need a warrant to go aboard zavala had been listening silently his mouth in an uncharacteristic frown somethings been bothering me he said those guys knew where we were and what we were doing how did they know we just decided to go after this thing a few days ago we didnt exactly advertise our plans austin and mcginty exchanged glances this operation involved a lot of people any one of them could have dropped enough of a hint to let the cat out of the bag it was an explanation austin didnt believe himself his attackers were too well prepared before long the wind shifted blowing away the fog donatelli bid goodbye to the numa men and the monkfish captain and he and antonio set off in the yacht austin promised to update the doria survivor on numas every move the monkfish plowed through the fog and rounded cape cod and before long they could see the lights of planes taking off and landing at logan airport they steamed past the boston harbor islands and tied up at a dock near the aquarium austin called an excited dr orville and asked him to arrange for a truck to pick up the stone austin and zavala followed the truck to harvard and saw it safely under lock and key orville said he would work through the night to decipher the inscriptions if he had to and invited them to stay austin declined the invitation he and zavala were exhausted from the days events and wanted to catch an early flight to washington after a light dinner they had a nightcap of irish whiskey with mcginty then crawled into their bunks and fell asleep almost immediately the tubular greenglassed tower of numa headquarters was like the welcome beacon of a lighthouse as the taxi navigated the unpredictable seas of washington traffic austin and zavala had caught the water shuttle to logan airport and were back in washington by late morning mcginty bid him adieu with a lungshaking slap on the back and the highest of praise austin he proclaimed was a chip off his old mans block wonder what the trouts are up to zavalas musings cut into his thoughts austin had called their team colleagues from the salvage ship the night before to tell them about the fight in the doria and the retrieval of the stone gamay said she and paul had new information theyd share with them the next day austin was too tired to ask what it was the trouts were waiting with hiram yaeger in the private conference room where they held their first meeting rudi gunn showed up a minute later and said sandecker was having brunch at the white house the vice president the admiral would have blown off but not the president gamay opened the meeting youve all been briefed so i wont go into the details of my yucatan jungle adventure with dr chi as you know we discovered a stash of stolen mayan artifacts awaiting shipment out of the country the storage was centrally located with respect to roads and water routes we found hundreds of objects taken from a number of important sites known and unknown to legitimate excavators when dr chi inventoried the goods in addition to ceramics he found a number of stone carvings apparently removed from mayan buildings with a diamondedged saw the unusual boat motif on them must have caught the eye of the chicleros his guess was that the carvings were taken from temple observatories similar to a structure he showed me at the mayan site called mit there was only one problem the carvings were not identified as to location she paused as trout passed the pile of folders hed been guarding to the others at the table gamay waited until the rustling of papers died down then continued the paper you see on top has eight sketches drawn by dr chi these profiles are glyphs that represent the mayan god quetzalcoatl who also went by the name kukulcan at first glance the drawings appear identical but if you look closer youll see subtle differences yaeger brought his quick eye for detail to the task jaws a little more prominent on this one he said this ones got a thicker eyebrow gunn squinted at the sketches this guys nose looks as if it ran into a right cross gamay smiled like a proud schoolmarm you catch on fast gentlemen these facial differences indicate a particular place each city or urban center interpreted the god in a way that was peculiar to it like the owl was the symbol of ancient athens austin ventured correct in this case the god also represents the planet venus austin stirred impatiently in his seat his eyes glazing over he was expecting to hear information with a direct bearing on the case not a lecture on mayan theology gamay this is all very interesting he said making no effort to hide his impatience but im not sure where youre going with it she flashed her disarming tomboy grin these glyphs were all incorporated into carvings of the boat motif austins interest was piqued he leaned forward the phoenician boat we dont know yet for sure whether it was phoenician or not but yes the inscriptions apparently marked the event we saw strange boats and strange people being received by mayans paul trout chipped in dr chi had already guessed that the carvings came from temple observatories dr chi used the city glyphs to pinpoint the location of the observatories mayan observatories are scattered all over central america but only eight as far as he knew have that particular boat theme austin said youve got eight identical observatories at separate locations dedicated to venus keyed into its cycles and all having something to do with a mysterious fleet of boats thats right gamay said resuming her explanation and the number eight goes to the heart of the matter noting the blank expressions she said quetzalcoatl and kukulcan were incarnations of the mayas most important god venus the maya plotted the planets course with incredible accuracy they knew there were eight days in the venus cycle when the planet disappeared the mayans believed venus went to the underworld during that time they used architectural features to keep track of venus and other celestial objects doorways sculptures pillars the placement of streets professor chi thinks these observatories were part of a greater plan a map chart even a crude computer meant to solve a problem like the problem of the phoenician excuse me the asyetunidentified boats austin said exactly paul replied page two in your folder is a map showing the locations another rustle of papers gamay said we tried connecting the temples drawing parallel lines from them nothing made sense while we were tearing our hair out we got a call from dc chi he had come in from the field for supplies and heard we were trying to get in touch we told him we were groping in the dark for something we were sure was there and needed his help paul announced page three in your folder gentlemen dc chi had this faxed from the national museum the spanish destroyed all but a few of the mayan books thus is one of the few that survived the dresden codex it has detailed observation tables for venus the data were collected from observatories what bearing does it have on our mystery gunn inquired mainly as an example of the type of information that was so important to the maya gamay replied try to imagine the mayan priests night after night gazing at the stars they collect the information on the movement of the stars then using architectural features built into these same temples forecast what the stars and planets would do ive got it blurted yaeger sometimes it helps to be a nerd youre saying that these eight temples and the carvings are the hardware the codex would be the software that tells the hardware what to do yaeger blinked rapidly behind his wirerimmed glasses carrying the analogy forward the physical form of software can be soft like the floppy disk that contains the program or hard like the hard drive or for our purposes hard as stone austin said bingo gamay said what geniuses we have at numa galvanized now austin ticked the points off on his fingertips one we have eight temples dedicated to the temple venus two the temples are set up in a way that will help us solve a puzzle having to do with those mysterious boats and their cargo three the talking stone tells us how to operate it i wasnt positive until dr orville called this morning he found the same eight glyphs on the stone theres a fax of the tablet in your folder the inscription is composed of three main elements the glyphs and a condensed rendition of the boat landings are the first and second elements any idea why the ship is about to be eaten by the big snake zavala asked looking at the fax thats element number three gamay explained the feathered serpent is the earthly embodiment of quetzalcoatl kuloulcan ali zavala said that certainly clears things up look at it this way gamay said the glyphs tell you where the boat inscription tells you what the serpent tells you how look at the kukulcan tell me what you see feathers mostly gunn said after a moment no yeager said theres something else the feathers are confusing look at the jaws its some sort of grid bravo gamay dapped dearly delighted our computer guru goes to the head of the class i dont know why yaeger said with a shrug damned if i know what im talking about check out the next picture in your folder this shows one of those eight temples pretty typical cylindrical balcony around the top frieze on the bottom part take a close look at those two vertical slit windows we assumed they were used for some sort of astronomical calculation we made an educated guess that the windows lined up with venus at the extremes of its position in the sky it still didnt make sense until paul had the idea of looking down on the temples as if we were in an airplane picking up the explanation paul held up the last sheet in the folder we extended the lines from each window and found that they intersected ill be damned yaeger said its the same grid as in the feathered serpent gamay nodded i started thinking about it when i noticed the grid reminded me of an amulet i once borrowed from dr chi the jaws of kukulcan gunn said werent we talking about columbus depending on some kind of grid thats right paul said orvilles theory is that columbus tried to use this stone but was at a disadvantage to start with he knew there was treasure but couldnt decipher the glyphs he had drawings made from the stone to take on the nina probably hoping to find someone who would translate for him austin had been staring at the diagram back when columbus sailed the ocean blue navigators had maps with straight lines called rhumbs on them someone sailing from spain to hispanola chose the line giving him the most direct route and set a compass course youd end up where you were supposed to be as long as you werent messed up by current and winds columbus may have wrongly thought these lines were rhumbs the maya were a lot more sophisticated than he knew were you able to work this out on a map it didnt make sense at first paul said venus would have been in a different position in the sky a couple of thousand years ago we had to do some recomputing our guess is that the vshaped intersection of the jaws here where you see the boat is where something is located austin had another question how long do you think it will take halcon to figure this out the trouts exchanged glances paul said there have been reports of columbus papers and mayan documents being stolen from various museums i suspect mr halcon has been trying to piece things together but weve got the stone and now we know how to use it wed better get moving on this in case halcons smarter than we think austin said gunn cleared his throat and squared the edges of his papers with all due respect kurt maybe before we go jumping into the jaws of kukulcan we had better figure out what all this is about starting with halcon and why he is causing so much trouble i see your point okay ill start the ball rolling heres my theory like columbus halcon is after the phoenician treasure that was removed from carthage the key to finding the stuff lies in precolumbian evidence he doesnt want anyone else to step on his turf so he destroys the evidence and those who have found it ive considered that theory and think its on the mark gunn said but its only part of the picture i asked yaeger to compile a detailed dossier on halcon tell us about his finances hiram yaeger glanced at a computer printout in front of him between his family fortune and widespread holdings hes worth billions and thats a conservative guess thanks hiram thats what bothers me kurt why would halcon go through all this trouble of killing people attacking you on the andrea doria and trying to steal the socalled talking stone just so he can find a treasure however fabulous he has more money than any normal person could ever want you may have answered your own question austin countered you said a normal person from what zavala told us about the ball court executions halcon sounds like a madman ive considered that possibility too but i think senor halcon is a lot more complicated than a bored rich eccentric who takes up treasure hunting for a hobby hiram would you run through the other material you picked up on the gentleman adjusting his granny glasses yaeger said francisco halcon was born in spain of a family that goes back centuries halcon which means falcon was apparently not the real family name which i was unable to determine he went to expensive private schools in switzerland and attended college in england oxford man yaeger said with a smirk he became a bullfighter known as el halcon and didnt do too badly but left the toro business under a cloud of scandal he was said to have put poison on the tip of his killing sword so even if he didnt hit the bulls vitals it would die hardly seems sporting for an oxford man austin said in a stage british accent cambridge maybe but not oxford zavala said yaeger shrugged from the bullring he went into one of the family businesses the halcons were very thick with the dictator franco and the spanish military before and during the war and made a lot of money on armaments after franco died and the king returned and restored democracy halcons business activities came under suspicion interpol says he was suspected of being tied to a spanish murder inc he left the country and came to mexico where a branch of his family that goes back to the spanish conquest owned a number of businesses halcon took over the us operations used his money and influence to cultivate political connections and in short time became an american citizen hes done pretty well from what i saw of the companies under his aegis in san antonio zavala said the american dream personified gunn added not attempting to conceal his sarcasm in more ways than one said yaeger his legitimate businesses were just a cover for shady operations on both sides of the border hes suspected of largescale drug and immigrant smuggling from mexico that would mean he is close to the ruling party in mexico zavala said no big business legal or illegal escapes their attention fits in with the way the family operated in spain and the united states austin said has anyone ever mentioned the brotherhood as i say he was supposedly tied to a spanish mafia organization yaeger replied they could be one and the same although i dont have confirmation what about that complex i saw outside san antonio zavala asked whats the story on that owned by one of his corporations perfectly legal according to the local licensing authorities hes considered something of a nut but a rich nut so if he wanted to build his own personal theme park whos to stop him by the way the plans for the complex show the ball court as a soccer field that wasnt like any game of soccer i ever saw zavala said soberly the locals have heard explosions from time to time and report an unusual amount of traffic but other than that hes a good neighbor who pays his taxes hiram has saved the best for last gunn said it took time because of the front companies and interlocking corporations and foundations but halcon industries has been spreading all over the southwest and california halcon controls banks real estate political figures newspapers anything thats for sale evidently hes trying to increase his power as well as his wealth austin said no different from any other corporation with its armies of lobbyists interesting that you should use the word army gunn said on a whim i ran some of hirams findings by the atf they immediately caught a whiff of something that smelled very bad they recognized the name of one of halcons companies as an outfit that has been buying arms from the czech republic and china what sort of arms you name it everything from infantry rifles to tanks lots of missiles too sams antitank that sort of stuff the atf got a search warrant for the company that was handling the shipments it was an empty office where has all this stuff been going specifically nobody knows generally northern mexico the southwest states and california arms purchases like the ones youve described cost money big money gunn nodded even a billionaire might become strapped spending enough on arms to start a revolution the room became silent as the last word in gunns statement hung in the air madre mia zavala whispered the treasure he needs the treasure to do what he wants to do that was my take gunn said quietly it sounds loony but he seems to be planning some sort of combined military and political takeover any indication when this is supposed to happen austin said soon is my guess hirams sources have detected a lot of money being moved around europe through swiss bank accounts to arms dealers hes going to have to replace that in a hurry if he wants to stay off the bad credit report which means hell be desperate to find the treasure what about our armed forces on alert even if he is stopped militarily a lot of innocent blood will be shed theres another way to stop him no treasure no revolution zavala said thanks paul and gamay you and dr orville have done a great job of pointing us in the right direction austin said he rose from his seat and glanced at the faces around the table now its our turn he said with a grim smile the elegant dining room was largely in darkness except for the center table where angelo donatelli sat going over the next days menu donatellis restaurant was done in a nantucket motif but unlike other places with a nautical theme the decorations did not come from a mailorder house the harpoons and flensing irons had actually pierced whale flesh and the primitive paintings of sailing ships were all originals antonio sat opposite donatelli an italian newspaper spread out on the spotless white tablecloth occasionally they sipped at a glass of amaretto neither was aware they were no longer alone until they heard the quiet voice say mr donatelli angelo looked up and saw two figures standing just beyond the circle of illumination how the devil did these people get in he had locked the front door himself the afterhours visit itself didnt surprise him the waiting period was weeks for a reservation and people tried all sorts of stunts to shortcut the process the voice was vaguely familiar too which persuaded him that it might be one of his clientele im angelo donatelli he said with his unfailing politeness im afraid youve come too late the restaurant is closed if you would call tomorrow the maitre d will do what he can to accommodate you you can accommodate me by telling your man to place his gun on the table from his lap antonio lifted the revolver he had slipped out of his shoulder holster and slowly placed it on the table if youve come to rob us youre too late for that too donatelli said all our cash has been deposited at the bank we havent come to rob you weve come to kill you kill us we dont even know who you are in answer the figure stepped forward into the light revealing a darkcomplexioned slender man who took antonios gun and tucked it into the belt of his onepiece black suit angelos gaze lingered for a second on the pistol with its barrel extended into a silencer but it was the mans thin dark features that sent a chill down his spine it was a face he had seen in a dream no a nightmare a brief glimpse of an assassin who glanced his way deep in the hold of a dying ship incredibly it hadnt aged in more than forty years i saw you on the andrea doria donatelli said with wonder the mans thin lips curled into a cold smile you have a good memory for faces he said but that was my late father he told me he sensed someone else was in the hold that night you and i too have a more intimate relationship i talked to you once on the telephone now donatelli remembered the call coming late at night waking him out of a sound sleep with the threats against him and his family the brotherhood he whispered you have a good memory for names as well its a pity you didnt remember my warnings about what would happen if you couldnt keep your mouth shut normally i dont micromanage the everyday operations of my organization but youve caused me a great deal of trouble old man do you recall what i said donatelli nodded his mouth too dry to reply good let me imprint it in your mind i warned that if you talked about that night on the andrea doria you would go to your grave knowing that you caused the death of every member of your family we can find sons daughters grandchildren every one the donatelli family will cease to exist except for a collection of headstones in a family plot you cant do such a thing donatelli replied regaining his voice you have only yourself to blame there are great forces at work here no one forced you to talk to numa no antonio spoke for the first time the family was not part of the deal he said angelo turned to his cousin what is he talking about antonios battered face was contorted with guilt the man said your cousin didnt tell you that he was working for me he refused at first but you have no idea of the pull his homeland had on him we told him that in return for keeping us informed through you about numas activities i would solve his problems with the authorities back in sicily si antonio said jutting his jaw out like mussolini but not the family you get me back to sicily that was the deal i keep my word i just didnt say that you would be returning home in a pine box but you first mr donatelli arrivederci antonio rose from his chair with a feral cry of rage and threw himself in front of his cousin the pistol made a thus quieter than a door shutting a red blossom flowered on the front of antonios shirt and he crumpled to the floor the gun coughed again with no one to block it this time the next bullet caught donatelli in the chest and he crashed over backward in his chair as antonio reached back and filled his hand with the sixinch beretta from his ankle holster he propped himself up on his elbows and aimed the gun at halcon magically a neat round hole appeared in the center of antonios forehead and he slumped forward onto the floor his shot going wild the second figure stepped from the shadows the gun in his hand smoking he glanced impassively at the man he had just killed never trust a sicilian he said quietly good work guzman i should have expected treachery sitting in an office has made me rusty when it comes to field operations youre welcome to come along when we take care of the rest of the family guzman said his eyes glittering yes id like that unfortunately it will have to wait we have more pressing business turning his attention to angelo he said too bad you cant hear this donatelli ive decided to spare your family for a little while until we clean up the mess you helped create dont despair youll soon see your loved ones in hell voices were coming from outside the restaurant where antonios shot had caught the attention of passersby halcon took one last look at the still bodies then he and his scarfaced companion melted into the darkness guatemala how old did you say this plane was austin shouted over the cockpit noise from the single engine about fifty years give or take a few zavala yelled back the owner says its got all its original parts too except for the fuzzy dice hanging from the rearview mirror maybe seeing the alarm in austins face zavala grinned just kidding kurt i checked the engines been overhauled so many times its practically new hope well be in as good a shape when we get this old if we get to be this old austin said skeptically glancing out the window at the inhospitable terrain below not to worry old chap the de havilland beaver was one of the finest bush planes ever built this crate is as tough as a tank just what the doctor ordered austin eyed the plastic statue of st christopher attached to the control panel by a suction cup sat back in his seat and folded his arms when he suggested to zavala that they find something unobtrusive to fly he hadnt envisioned the antique beaver with its quaint boxy lines twoblade propeller and blunt unaerodynamic nose he simply wanted an alternative to an army helicopter that couldnt violate the airspace of mexicos neighboring countries without permission even a numa aircraft with its turquoise paint job and big official lettering would have raised eyebrows they found the beaver hidden by a painters canvas drop cloth in the dark corner of a dilapidated outoftheway hangar at the belize city airport zavalas eyes lit up like christmas luminarias he rubbed his hands together itching to get them on the controls only one other plane would have elicited a stronger reaction austin thought luckily the wright brothers invention was in the smithsonian which is where this plane belonged like shakespeares cassius the belizan who owned the plane had a lean and hungry look he talked barely above a whisper and often glanced over his shoulder as if he were expecting unwanted visitors he had been recommended to austin by a former cia colleague who served in clandestine operations helping the contras fight the sandinistas judging from his prudent suggestions about cargo handling and discreet landing areas it was evident he thought his two american customers were drug smugglers given the cias shady operations in central america that came as no surprise he asked no questions and insisted he be paid what he called a security deposit big enough to buy himself a boeing in dollars as he carefully counted every bill to make sure he wasnt being cheated he warned them to keep in mind guatemalas territorial claims over belize and do whatever they could to blend into the background austin observed that might be impossible with the bright mustardyellow paint covering the old plane the man shrugged and disappeared into the shadows with his wad of bills austin had to admit the plane was better suited for the job than a newer and flashier aircraft would have been it wasnt exactly the concorde yet with a cruising speed of one hundred twentyfive miles per hour it ate up distance and was slow enough to serve as an ideal flying observation platform moreover it was designed for short takeoff and landing on water or land zavala was keeping the plane below three thousand feet they were flying over the peten the thickly forested northern part of guatemala that juts squarely into mexico the territory below had started as flat terrain and worked itself up to low rolling hills broken by rivers and their tributaries it was once thickly settled by the maya who used the rivers for intercity commerce and several times they had glimpsed gray ruins through the trees the distant peaks of the maya mountains rose from the haze off to the south austin marked their progress on a clipboard that held a map with the grid overlay on acetate he referred constantly to the compass and the gps finder were coming up on the junction point where the jaws meet he said pointing to the map he glanced at his watch another thirty seconds should put us there austin peered out the window again they were following a squiggle of river that meandered back and forth like blue christmas ribbon candy and widened into the small lake dead ahead seconds later austin pointed at the shimmering water thats it the jaws of kukulcan we should have brought the minisub zavala said lets make a few runs around the lake if we dont run into ackack fire well set her down zavala breathed on his aviatorstyle sunglasses wiped the lenses on a sleeve and adjusted them on his nose he gave the thumbsup sign and banked the plane so the horizon tilted sharply zavala brought the same flying techniquea combination of f jockey and flybytheseatofthepants barnstormer to whatever vehicle he controlled whether it was a submersible or an airplane that was built when harry truman was starting his first term as president the lake looked like a huge staring eye from the air it was oval in shape and had a small island about where the pupil would be it was small about half a mile in length and half as wide the river shot off at a sharp angle and curved around the lake until it intersected with water flowing from an outlet at the other end austin decided the lake must be replenished by springs or streams hidden by the trees the beaver wheeled twice around the lake but they saw nothing out of the ordinary with the way apparently clear zavala pointed the plane down as if he wanted to drill a hole in the water at the last moment he pulled the nose up like a dive bomber and leveled off nicely until the white floats kissed the surface the plane skimmed along like a flat stone throwing off twin rooster tails before finally coming to a rolling halt about midway between shore and island austin kicked open the door as the propeller spun to a choking halt with the engine stopped a palpable silence enveloped the cockpit zavala radioed the ship with a position report and austin scanned the lake the low cliffs and the island with his binoculars taking his time until he was sure as far as possible that they were alone everything looks fine he said lowering the binoculars he squinted toward the middle of the lake something about that island bothers me zavala leaned over austins shoulder and pulled his baseball cap lower over his forehead to shield his eyes against the sun sparkle it looks perfectly okay to me thats the problem the placement is too perfect if you drew lines shoretoshore from north to south and east to west that island would be at the intersection like a target in the crosshairs of a rifle scope exact center zavala restarted the engine and gave the propeller enough power to pull them along at a couple of knots then he cut throttle and let the plane drift closer to the island they threw an anchor over the side and estimated from the length of the tethering line that the lake was more than one hundred feet deep they inflated a rubber raft climbed into it from the planes pontoons and paddled the short distance to the island pulling the raft up onto the grasscovered mud austin estimated the island at about thirty feet across it looked like the misshapen shell of a giant turtle rising quickly from the water to a roundish summit about fifteen feet high undeterred by the thick growth of ferns and succulents zavala climbed up the slope near the top he let out a yell and stepped back as if recoiling from an invisible punch austins body tensed and his hand went to the pistol at his hip whats wrong he shouted his first thought was that joe had stumbled onto a nest of adders zavalas peals of laughter startled a flock of white birds into the air like confetti blown in the wind the island is occupied kurt come up and ill introduce you to the landlord austin quickly climbed the small hill and peered at the toothy skeleton jaw grinning behind the bushes he pushed the leaves aside to reveal a grotesque stone head about twice life size carved into the lintel over a squaredoff opening the opening was set into the side of a blockshaped structure that was buried in loose soil almost to the top of its flat crenelated roof and decorated with a border of skulls similar to but smaller than the one they first saw using a sheath knife austin dug away at the dirt and enlarged the opening so zavala could get his head and shoulders in zavala flashed a light around inside i think i can squeeze in he wriggled through the opening feet first austin heard a loud sneeze then zavala saying bring a dust buster with you austin worked to enlarge the opening then he followed zavala inside he looked around not exactly the hilton his words echoed the boxlike space was the size of a twocar garage the walls were thick enough to repel a direct hit from a cannon austins head almost touched the low roof the plastered walls were plain except for dark blotches that covered most of their surface and four floortoceiling portals like the one they had just come through the doorways were clogged by rootbound earth that was as hard as cement dunno kurt its got a lot to offer water view simple decor this is what the real estate guys call a handymans special comes with a cellar too zavala flashed his light into a comer austin knelt to inspect a massive flagstone in the floor it was perforated by several holes along the edge using their knives they pried it open and slid the flagstone aside to reveal a stairway spiraling down since zavala had been first into the building austin volunteered to investigate he descended the short curving flight of stairs to a passageway that went a few yards before it was blocked by a huge slab austin played the beam of his flashlight over the slab youd better get down here he said quietly sensing the seriousness in austins tone zavala quickly joined him lying on the floor in front of the slab was a pile of bones unlike the deathshead sculpture they had seen earlier the six skulls they counted were once covered with flesh zavala picked up a skull and held it at arms length like hamlet contemplating the remains of yorick sacrificial victims from the looks of that hole in the skull they were put but of their misery so they didnt have to starve to death the executioners were all heart austin said examining the slab for a seam the only way to get around this thing is with a jackhammer or dynamite austin had seen enough they climbed back to the upper chamber where austin noticed several bleached white fragments on the floor he picked one up only to have it crumble to powder in his hand freshwater shellfish he said this place was underwater at one time zavala brushed the dirty walls with his fingers you could be right this looks like dried pond scum they climbed back into the fresh air and explored the perimeter of the structure it was built onto a stone platform that had become the catchall for material floating in the lake seeds probably brought in by birds had sprouted and their roots kept the dirt from blowing away looking straight down into the water at the edge of the island it was possible to see a stone terrace austin kicked off his boots and slipped into the water swam out a few strokes and dove this thing is like the tip of an iceberg he said when he resurfaced it was probably a temple on top of a very big pyramid cant tell how far it goes told you we should have brought a submarine zavala replied as he gave austin a hand back onto dry land so if what we think is true and that building is a temple were at ground zero the jaws all we have to do is figure out how to get into the gullet lovely thought we could try blowing that slab blocking the way yeah we could do that and it might even work but its not exactly a surgical approach our archaeologist friends would never speak to us again lets think about it while we look around they got back in the plane and taxied to the end of the lake where they went ashore and made their way inland the forest was in semidarkness except for the mottled sunlight filtering through the tree canopy the trees discouraged undergrowth making for an easy hike on a carpet of leaves austin followed a babble of water to its source and stopped where the river they had seen from the air was flanked by stone foundations the river bed between the foundations was filled with earth and vegetation but several streams flowed from the substantial reservoir that had built up behind the crude dam and around the old barricade toward the lake the main course of the river turned abruptly just before it hit the foundations and angled off into the forest austin followed the rushing waters away from the reservoir and stopped again at a similar pair of foundations just as i thought he said zavala was impressed howd you know these things would be here would you believe it if i said i was a dam genius zavala winced of course i would now tell me how you really knew austin picked up a branch threw it into the river and watched it disappear from sight in the fastmoving bubble and foam you remember how this river looks from the air i think you said it had more wiggles than a belly dancer just before it comes into the lake it angles off in a perfectly straight line my first impression was that the section was too straight to be natural like that temple in the center of the lake nothing in nature is absolutely perfect maybe it was a canal i thought you know the chesapeake and ohio historical park north above washington one of my favorite places for a cheap first date zavala said with a smile built of fond memories muy romantico whats that got to do with anything think about that temple sometimes its underwater sometimes it isnt austin could almost hear the gears whirring as zavalas brilliant mechanical mind processed the information he slapped his forehead of course the locks austin cleared a bare spot on the ground and picked up a short stick he handed it to zavala be my guest professor z zavala drew a line in the dirt this is the potomac river you cant move boats up and down the river because of the rapids and falls so you cut a canal around the white water here he tapped the ground you build a system of gates and sluices to control the water level in the canal one section at a time lets see if im right he drew an oval representing the lake in its normal state the river comes in here at the top fills the flood plain to create the lake then flows out the bottom keeps going until it comes to the sea good so far professor at some point unknown engineers put a dam here zavala drew a line across the top of the lake this blocks the water into the lake but its got to go somewhere or else it ends up sweeping around the gate he drew a straight line away from the lake you cut this canal and the water is diverted away from the lake to another riverbed he looked up triumph in his dark eyes now you can drain the lake and build the temple here austin drew an x in the dirt with the tip of his boot zavala picked up the narrative after you lay the last stone of the pyramid you close the canal sluice open the lake gate the lake refills in no time and hides the temple ergo ergo ipso facto and voila only problem is the sluice gate is made of moving parts in time the gate deteriorates with no public works department to maintain it whats left of the mayan civilization is being crushed into dust by the spaniards that curve is a natural catchall for anything floating down the river junk builds up in front of the lake gate like a dike the canal sluice rots open and the river is diverted away from the lake again the lake is fed by a few streams but eventually the water level drops exposing the top of the temple which becomes overgrown with vegetation so if we wait long enough zavala said the lake will eventually drop to where the temple is completely exposed again unless the water pressure from that reservoir busts through the old dam and raises the lake level austin pondered zavalas statement and nodded ill tell you the rest of my theory on the way back as they walked through the forest zavala got his revenge youve got to admit thats a damn nice piece of engineering it was austins turn to ignore the pun i agree it allowed them to drain the lake again if they wanted to that leaves open the possibility that they might want to reenter the temple the entryway on top could be a blind like one of the false entrances they built into the egyptian pyramids to fool grave robbers i wouldnt be surprised if thats why they put the skeletons there just for stage props some stage some props zavala said lets call in an air drop when we get back to the plane minutes later from the plane zavala radioed their wish list to the nereus he raised a quizzical eyebrow over one of the items austin requested but asked no questions while they waited they had something to eat then lounged in the shade until the radio crackled with a message coming in boys eta ten minutes exactly on time a turquoise helicopter with numa lettering on the side came in low over the lake hovered near the plane and dropped a large box wrapped in heavy plastic and buoyed by airfilled floats the helicopter crew watched the men below snag the delivery then waved goodbye and clattered off the way theyd come inside the box were two sets of scuba gear and several cartons austin loaded the boxes in the raft and paddled back to the upper end of the lake while zavala moved the plane to an indentation in the shoreline zavala knew better than to ask austin what he had planned kurt would tell him when he needed to know zavala covered the plane with a fishing net and was weaving branches into it when austin showed up in the raft to help him finish the job the cartons were gone satisfied their plane was well hidden they piled their scuba gear into the raft and set off for the island where they swept away traces of their previous visit the raft was deflated and sunk in shallow water with rocks piled on top to hold it under the water was warm so they wore only lightweight black lycra skins rather than the thicker neoprene wetsuits without comment austin tucked the small pouch he was wearing around his neck into a waterproof pocket after a quick check of their equipment they breaststroked away from the island and wasting no time they let the air out of their buoyancy compensators and began to sink into the dark waters of the lake with smooth steady movements of their fins they swam down and away from the temple at an angle until they were at the lake bottom dwarfed by the imposing mass of tapering stone the broad terraced levels spilled down the side of the pyramid like giant steps thats some hunk of rock austin said his awe undiminished by the metallic tone of his underwater communicator good thing were not superstitious i counted thirteen terraces knock wood on that score austin said he glanced at his depth gauge one hundred fourteen feet ready to dive the plan longlived divers remember the mantra plan the dive and dive the plan their strategy was simple explore each of the four sides top to bottom they moved counterclockwise around the pyramid it stood entirely alone which made austin wonder if the pyramid had been built with a single purpose in mind the next side was like the first and they spent only a few minutes exploring it they hit pay dirt on the third try where the other sides were relatively unadorned this face was marked by a broad set of stairs running from the temple at the top down to what would have been ground level in drier days at the foot of the stairs standing in solitary grandeur like a doorman in front of a swank las vegas hotel was a stone slab the stela stood vertically in a foundation on the lake bottom zavala played the sharp white beam of his handheld halogen light across the dark surface after a second he said look familiar austin eyed the carving of a feathered serpent devouring a boat small world its a twin of the stone from the doria he lifted his eyes to the stairway running up the side of the pyramid reminds me of that slab that kept showing up in the movie maybe this little old billboard is telling us something with zavala on his right and slightly behind he drifted up the stairway like a lazy plume of smoke the stairs were bordered with carvings and in addition there were sculpted heads spaced every few risers about halfway up the huge stylized face of a serpent burst from its crown of feathers the mouth large enough to swallow a man was wide open in strike position thick blunt fangs about the size and shape of traffic pylons extended down from the roof of the mouth to meet a matching pair pointing up friendlylooking fellow said zavala you dont suppose he bites meet the feathered serpent known in these parts as kukulcan he looks like a cross between a rottweiler and an alligator ask him if he knows how to get into the pyramid maybe thats not such a dumb idea with a few fin kicks austin propelled himself closer to the yawning maw and probed the shadows with his light say ah he said and headed straight in his air tank bonked and scraped against the thick fangs but once inside there was room to turn around he stuck his head out of the mouth invited zavala in with a wave then headed deeper into the pyramid his light picking out footholds in the slanting floor they swam down at an angle for about two minutes slowly and cautiously until the passageway ended in a chamber big enough for both of them to stand up a set of stairs ascended into another passageway i feel like a load of dirty clothes thats just gone down a laundry chute that was too easy zavala said suspiciously i was thinking the same thing but remember the people who built this thing knew it was going to be underwater they probably figured that anyone trying to get in would waste time breaking through the slab just below the temple and that even if they saw this entrance they wouldnt go into the serpents mouth just the same he added keep a sharp eye for booby traps they rose up the stairs like ghosts in a haunted house austin could hear zavala grumbling wish theyd make up their mind man down up austin sympathized with his partners gripes even an experienced wreck diver cant always put aside those formless claustrophobic fears that the thousands of tons of rock overhead could come crashing down even worse that they could be trapped unable to move doomed to die a painful suffocating death he was glad when his head broke the water zavala popped up a second later they flashed their lights around the circular pool zavala reached up to take his regulator from his mouth austins hand shot out and clamped zavalas wrist wait he warned we dont know if the air is good the atmosphere could be more than two thousand years old austin didnt know if any microorganisms spores or toxins could have been built up in all that time but he wasnt willing to take the chance he pulled himself out of the pool and removed his fins and belt then helped zavala do the same they climbed the stairwell to where the floor leveled the noise of their breath through the regulators sounded unnaturally loud out of the water the long narrow chamber had a high vaulted roof supported by arches built in tire corbeled fashion that the maya favored with levels of horizontally laid blocks austins flashlight beam dropped from the roof and picked out an elongated head with pointed ears and flared nostrils zavala said is that what i think it is a horse is a horse of course of course but what the hell is mr ed doing here austin lowered his flashlight so that the beam illuminated the horses long wooden neck well ill be its a figurehead the wooden sculpture of the horse surmounted the high sweeping bow of a boat with shiny dark red sides the prow was extended into a pointed battering ram the builders of this boat were true artists austin thought as they walked alongside the hull the craft was a doubleender long narrow and flatbottomed sweeping up at each end in graceful curves and tight as a tick from the looks of the wellfitted overlapping planks the mast lay lengthwise on the deck deck planks had fallen in to reveal dozens of amphorae in the hold scattered about were circular metal objects that may have been shields two long oars their blades curled by age leaned against the ships backside as if waiting for the hands of longdead steersmen the boat sailed not on an azure sea but on a stone cradle while most of the timbers were intact some had rotted through so that the ship leaned at a slight angle shes a lot prettier in person zavala murmured austin ran his hand along the wood as if he didnt quite believe his eyes its not just me then this is one of the ships pictured on the stelae and other carvings whats a phoenician boat doing in an underwater mayan temple waiting to overturn every archaeological assumption ever made austin said wait until nina sets her eyes on this lovely lady well have to give her some specs to chew over until we can get a camera in here what do you figure for length more than one hundred feet easy zavala almost bumped into one of four round pillars spaced alongside the boat another quartet of columns ran along the other side heres another spec for you to chew on he said eight pillars eight significant days in the venus cycle austin replied fits in they were at the boats upsweeping sterncastle austin had expected the chamber to end in a blank wall instead there was another corbeled archway and beyond it a stairway leading upward they climbed the stairs to a much smaller chamber whose floor was taken up largely by a rectangular sunken pit in the pit was a sarcophagus whose lid was inscribed with repetitive carvings in the feathered serpent theme they got into the pit and tried unsuccessfully to budge the lid with their knives maybe theres something on the ship we can use to pry it off austin suggested they descended to the large chamber zavala reached up to the boat rail and with a boost from austin pulled himself over the side and into the boat he held on to the gunwale and took a tentative step forward testing his weight the decks holding but ill stay on the cross beam just in case the wood creaked as he made his way across the deck lots of amphorae i jeezus a pause then an excited exclamation kurt youve got to see this zavala came back to the side of the boat and helped austin climb in through the centuries the deck had settled and now the planking slanted down to the middle where most of the amphorae were concentrated austin followed zavala on a cross beam to the middle of the deck although the hull rocked slightly from their weight it remained solidly ensconced in its stone cradle zavala bent over a big jar that had broken apart and came up with green fire sparkling in his hand the elaborate necklace encrusted with emeralds and diamonds had come from a pile of gold and jewels lying in the artificial valley formed by the slanting planks austin took the necklace and decided he had never seen a piece of jewelry more beautiful the intricate settings were painstakingly handcrafted while austin wondered zavala reached into an intact jar and pulled out a handful of loose gems diamonds rubies emeralds zavalas mouth dropped open in astonishment this must be the greatest concentration of treasure in the history of the world austin was squatting by an amphora that had split open it makes the british crown jewels look like play beads doesnt it stones the size of marbles ran through his fingers the international lawyers are going to have a blast figuring out who owns this stuff zavala glanced toward the burial chamber maybe the last owner of record is in that stone coffin austin picked up a couple of spearheads lets see if its anyone we know they climbed out of the boat and went back to the burial chamber the spearheads were strong and the points fit under the lid no combination of leverage even in the hands of two wellmuscled and resourceful men proved equal to the skills of those who had designed and carved the stone coffin guess wed better go back to grave robbers school austin said zavala checked his pressure gauge no time like the present were going to have to switch to our spare tank if we stay much longer weve seen all we need to see maybe the scientists can make sense of all this he started to lead the way back to the boat chamber when the unearthly quiet of the tomb was shattered by a thunderous explosion from above their heads austin had a fleeting vision of what it must be like under an erupting volcano synapses in their brains went crazy as ageold survival instincts clashed with conflicting commands run hit the ground freeze they fought to keep their balance as the floor shook under their feet the explosion forced air up into the enclosed chamber creating a wind tunnel effect the shock wave knocked austin and zavala back into the crypt arms flailing they slammed against the sarcophagus in a wild clatter of tanks and air hoses then slid into the space between the stone coffin and the wall that contained it the fall cost them cuts and bruises but probably saved their lives a piece of ceiling as big as a diesel engine block crashed down on the spot where theyd been standing sharpedged rocks flew through the air as if they had been shot from a strafing fighter plane a choking cloud of dust billowed into the burial chamber and covered everything with a fine whitish coating then a pattering of loose stones and dirt rained down austin spat out a mouthful of dust and asked zavala if he was all right zavala made his presence and condition known first with a coughing fit then a string of curses in spanish yeah im okay he sputtered how about you i think im in one piece wish i could stop the telephone ringing in my head more coughs what happened it sounded like a combination of vesuvius and krakatoa my guess leans toward a few kilos of c plastique explosive austin grunted i like you a lot joe but i dont think were ready to be engaged can you move there was more cursing as they untangled arms and legs and breathing hoses until they were able to stand zavala reached for a halogen lamp which had fallen within arms reach he flashed it on austin then back at his own face their masks were askew but the lenses were unbroken and had protected their eyes from the blinding dust you look like a disreputable mime zavala said with a laugh i hate mimes even reputable ones youre looking a little pale yourself ive got another revelation were breathing without our regulators zavala held the halfmask that contained the microphone and regulator to his face and clamped his teeth on the mouthpiece still works he said mine too looks like we wont need them i feel fresh air coming in that means somebody blew the top off the pyramid time to get moving can you walk zavala nodded and crawled from the pit then leaned in and helped austin out they were covered from head to toe with whitish brown dust that gave them a zombielike look austin flashed his light back into the pit and saw that the heavy stone lid had been cracked open by the concussion austin knew they should be moving but his curiosity got the best of him he aimed the light at the figure inside the face was covered by a jade mask with round eyes and an aquiline nose the corpse was dressed in a shroud of dark material that could have been velvet strands of whitishred hair poked out from under an amorphously shaped hat made out of the same material austin moved the light down the clawlike mummified hands clutched rolls of old parchment austin removed one of the rolls examined it with wondering eyes then tucked it back into the bony hands he noticed a glint of yellow under the chin of the mask the shape was familiar but it seemed out of context austin wanted to take a closer look but there wasnt time the sound of voices was coming from the boat chamber the almost impenetrable cloud in the boat chamber was dissipating rapidly the motes swirling against the sunlight that streamed down from a huge opening that yawned where the ceiling had been great chunks of rock had flattened the stern end of the dark red hull like a potato masher columns had been knocked over and lay in fragments the chamber floor was littered with smaller pieces of rock and coated with limestone dust austin had no time to mourn the boats destruction a rope ladder dropped down from the ragged hole two figures dressed in black were climbing down the ladder into the dusty haze the first one to set foot on the floor reached up and steadied the ladder sorry about the mess don halcon came a voice that was flat unemotional and unapologetic it couldnt be helped guzman said the slenderbuilt darkhaired man surveying the wreckage the important thing is that we reached our goal not how we did it he flicked on a powerful flashlight and pointed it at the ruined boat my god what a fantastic sight the intruders made their way through the rubble and climbed over the splintered stern timbers to the less damaged section of the boat moments later halcon shouted with excitement look at this guzman he said with hysterical joy there are enough jewels in my hand to outfit a whole new army austin stood at the entryway to the boat chamber with zavala and considered their situation they were unarmed except for their sheath knives halcon and his henchman would have sidearms at the very least if he and zavala made a break for the ladder or the water entrance at the far end of the chamber theyd be picked off like ducks in a shooting gallery he whispered his concerns to zavala maybe we can bluff our way through joe had come to the same conclusion as his partner what have we got to lose just our lives and those of many others austin thought weve got to work our way back to where we came in get rid of our main air tanks keep the emergency tank and regulator with you he tapped the pouch around his neck ive got a surprise that might distract them but the timing has to be just right it wont take long for them to find us if we surprise them they may start shooting okay let them know were here ill take my cue from you zavala said austin clapped his colleague on the shoulder took a deep breath and stepped out into the boat chamber hello gentlemen he said in a loud and clear voice the whitehaired man with the scar quickly slipped a pistol from its belt holster and cocked it in austins direction were unarmed there are just two of us austin said quickly staring at the muzzle he had gambled that the man was too much of a professional to let off a panic shot come forward where i can see you austin followed the order he and zavala closing the distance by several paces the whitehaired man climbed out of the boat wreckage cautiously approached and relieved them of their sheath knives the livid scar on his face became more pronounced when he grinned we really have to stop meeting like this he said tossing the knives out of range introduce me to your friends guzman halcon stepped from the wrecked boat a gun in his hand please excuse my rudeness don halcon allow me to introduce mr austin and his numa associate mr zavala whom i met in arizona zavala is the gentleman who was photographed by our surveillance camera of course now i recognize him youll have to send me a copy of the picture halcon zavala said halcon chuckled id be surprised if you resourceful gentlemen didnt know my name guzman told me about you in fact i ordered him to kill you youve been lucky he rarely fails to carry out a task before he now redeems himself i must admit you have me baffled at how you got into the temple we were swallowed by the jaws of kukulcan austin said halcon studied austin like an entomologist examining an insect in a killing jar youre either telling the truth or simply trying to be ironic halcon said either way it doesnt matter you wont be leaving through the jaws anytime soon ill tell you how we got in if you answer the questions of a couple of condemned men im just curious if our theory is correct halcon must have known austin was stalling for time austin looked at it from a different perspective the opportunity to set up an escape he had no intention of dying in this tomb a bargainer to the last halcon said evidently intrigued with the game go ahead first of all how did you find the temple the same way we knew about your andrea doria expedition mr donatellis man the sicilian antonio his name is not important when you told mr donatelli you were headed for central america we ordered our spies to follow you to guatemala that ridiculous little yellow plane was easy to keep track of so much for the beavers unobtrusiveness austin thought ive generously allowed you a bonus question halcon went on im still interested in your theory hows this for starters austin said the phoenicians traded with the americas for thousands of years when the romans besieged carthage a phoenician fleet moved its treasure to the other side of the ocean centuries pass columbus arrives in the new world and hears tales of a fabulous treasure he finds the talking stone concludes it will point the way and sets off on a last voyage to bring home the bacon he misinterprets the information on the stone but comes pretty close almost as close as you have mr austin now will you reveal how you got in we came down that stairway austin said glancing toward the burial chamber halcon smiled and turned to his companion guzman im not done austin interrupted columbus has ties to a mysterious organization called the brotherhood so it is quite likely they knew of the treasure more than likely halcon stayed his henchmans hand im truly impressed mr austin the brotherhood has been one of the bestkept secrets in the world not even when we sank one of the worlds most famous ocean liners did anyone suspect our existence youre telling me that the brotherhood sank the andrea doria austin said guzman really while my father and the others were dealing with the armored truck guards in the hold guzman was taking care of matters on the ships bridge it was an accident austin countered so they say it wasnt as hard as you might think we knew the boats would pass close to each other that night guzman was prepared to kill everyone on the stockholms bridge and ram the swedish vessel into the other ship as it was he only took advantage of the mistakes made by others if what you say is true and the brotherhood knew the talking stone pointed the way to treasure why did they send it to the bottom of the sea unfortunately the stones value didnt become known until fairly recently my father ordered the stone sunk he was carrying out the original mandate of the brotherhood to destroy anything that discredited the discoveries of columbus zavala chuckled and said something in spanish youre quite right mr zavala my father did as you put it screw up but he couldnt have known that i would change the mandate of los hermanos when did it change from sinking ships to starting revolutions austin said a cloud crossed halcons pale thin face then he laughed and clapped his hands bravo mr austin you have bought yourself more time on your death sentence tell me what numa knows of my plan i will after you fill in a few more holes your tongue would loosen if i started shooting holes in your colleagues arms and legs halcon said with a smile you could do that but let me offer another proposal tell me what your plan is and ill reveal a secret known to no other man on the planet but me i give you my word and i accept it austin had judged halcon correctly as a megalomaniac who would want others to know of his mad schemes i can sum up my plan in one word angelica the new country that will be carved out of the southwest states and southern california those of hispanic descent will take back what was stolen from them by force joe chortled good luck pal i know of a certain superpower that might object please give me credit im well aware of the armed might of the us and have no intention of going up directly against it then all those arms youre buying are for sport shooting oh no they will be used for military reasons youre of spanish ancestry mr zavala so you know what i learned in the bullring with a few flutters and flourishes of a cape and deft footwork you can vanquish a much larger and more powerful foe the us isnt exactly a fighting bull austin said the same principle applies i have prepared the groundwork well i have moved millions of illegal immigrants into the old spanish territories now occupied illegally by the united states until they are on the verge of outnumbering the nonhispanics i have used my fortunes to acquire key businesses such as gas oil and mining with my profits i have sponsored candidates pliant to my will for public office and bought and bribed others now i can put my plan into action as soon as i leave here i will give the word the army i have been training will move on the border towns others will conduct raids in the interior there will be a backlash against hispanics much like that against the japanese americans in world war ii although this time we will give them the means to resist against their anglo tormentors and a reason to redeem the national pride that america has so often demeaned youre talking bloodshed and chaos my goals exactly what can the us do free albuquerque and phoenix by nuking them conduct streettostreet fighting in the boulevards of san diego they will know a political settlement follows every armed conflict and i will provide the way out the governors i have elected will sue for peace and suggest that the us turn to one of its citizens of spanish heritage to act as mediator i will negotiate de facto secession from the union theres no guarantee your scheme will succeed in which case hundreds of thousands of people would have been killed for nothing they will have served their purpose as a means to an end many of those people will be latinos zavala said what of it halcon snarled my conquistador ancestors used warring indian factions as their allies to defeat the aztec empire then made them slaves i will offer those who survive the opportunity to relive the greatness of the past as i restore the glories of two great civilizations the indian and the spanish glories like the ball court and the inquisition austin said and more you havent even dreamed of mr austin much more his tone was ominous i tire of this game he said impatiently what of this great secret i wouldnt blame you for lying to me but it wont save you im not lying its in the other chamber halcon exchanged glances with guzman no tricks guzman has a hair trigger lead the way austin went up the stairs first with zavala following then guzman and halcon until they came to the edge of the burial pit you came in this way halcon said looking in vain for an entryway i was lying about that but not this the figure in the sarcophagus had engaged halcons attention who is it halcon said if i may guzmans cold eyes followed every move as austin reached into the stone coffin and removed the shiny object from the bony hands of the mummy he handed it to halcon who examined it frowning with puzzlement i dont understand he said with suspicion consider this austin said youre the maya sitting on a pile of treasure for hundreds of years waiting for the men who brought it to you to return and reclaim it one day a white man from the east shows up on your doorstep and says he wants his gold he dies before you can accommodate him you wonder if he embodies the venus god the feathered serpent kukulcan but youre not sure so you hedge your bets bury him with his treasure and draw a map in stone in a way that only the venus god will be able to understand those rolls of parchment hes holding are drawings of the inscription on the stone but if that isnt enough to convince you then tell me what a christian cross is doing in a mayan temple it cant be halcon said with disbelief don halcon meet the admiral of the ocean sea christopher columbus halcon stared at the mummy a moment then laughed without mirth and tossed the cross back into the sarcophagus keep it you poor fool while all eyes were on the coffin austin squeezed the pouch around his neck seconds later came a distant boom then several others whats that halcon said looking about him guzman moved to the stairway and listened it sounds like thunder while the henchmans attention was diverted austin reached down to the floor and in a single quick motion picked up one of the sharp spear points he and zavala had unsuccessfully used to pry the lid off the coffin he wrapped his brawny arm around halcons slender neck and jabbed the sharp spike deep into the skin guzmans gun swung around back off or this goes into his jugular austin warned he pushed the spear in further blood trickled down halcons neck barely able to speak with his throat crushed halcon hissed do as he says put that gun back in your holster austin commanded he knew guzman would never give up his gun entirely that hed try for a head shot or plug zavala first guzman smiled a hint of admiration in the curve of his thin lips and slid the gun back into its case then austin ordered halcon to drop his weapon with zavala staying close austin backed out of the chamber and dragged his human shield down the stairs into the main chamber guzman followed at a deliberate pace as they stepped over and around the rubble and stopped under the light streaming in from the ceiling hole halcon had recovered from his surprise looks like a mexican standoff he said his voice choked but defiant a brief shower of water splashed down on them from above everyone looked up except austin thats not rain in case youre wondering those booms you heard a few minutes ago were explosives i used a remote detonator to blow up the dam that blocks water into the lake millions of gallons are pouring in i dont believe you halcon snarled perhaps you should don halcon said guzman it seems mr austin was not lying about the detonator you could never have foreseen events halcon said thats right my original plan was to blow the dam after we left to make it tougher for you to find the temple this way at least well all die together they were suddenly drenched by another deluge from above only stronger this time my guess is thats only the first ripple from the explosion the reservoir would have burst by now more will follow it wont take much to breach that hole you blew in the temple i have no idea how long before this chamber fills but i wouldnt stay around too long if i were you guzman looked toward the ladder and seemed to lose some of his steely composure we must leave not without that treasure doesnt make any difference to me austin said like you said were dead men water poured down again but instead of a brief burst it continued to flow in a torrent don halcon there was alarm in guzmans voice hes bluffing you fool halcon replied with disgust the treasure is of use to no one if hes right guzman said halcons eyes filled with hate youve always been nothing but a homicidal cretin from the day my father hired you he said with contempt you cant see the glory a hard smile crossed guzmans lips water was pouring in like a river now directly on top of them so that it was hard to see each other sloshing onto their feet yet nobody moved quite a dilemma isnt it guzman austin taunted raising his voice to be heard loyalty to your crazed boss and the brotherhood or death by drowning i sincerely hope you resolve your family spat but youll have to settle it without me thats the cue joe zavala ran toward the well at the far end of the chamber and dove in austin dropped the spear point grabbed halcons butt and with a powerful bums rush threw him at guzman whod been momentarily distracted by zavalas sprint they went down in a tangle but even as he fell guzman was pulling out the pistol austin dashed for the well guzman was up and got off a shot but austin was a poor target in the dim light and the bullet missed austin dove into the well guzman cursed and went after austin buffeted by the flood swirling around his ankles and knees he had taken only a few steps when he realized it would be suicide to stay in the chamber this conclusion was reinforced when he turned and saw that halcon had deserted him and was heading for the ladder halcons dreams of glory had finally given way to his instincts for selfpreservation he slogged his way against the rising tide until he was under the ceiling hole where the water roared down in a miniature niagara blinded by the force of the cascade he groped for the ladder but his hand slipped he clenched his teeth with determination and tried again this time he got a grip on a rung as he began to climb a hand grabbed him by the ankle and pulled him down guzman wrapped his arms around halcons knees and used the full weight of his body to pull him back into the chamber halcon held on with one hand and with the other pulled his pistol which he had retrieved from its holster and swung it with all the strength he could muster in his awkward position the gun barrel struck flesh and bone but guzman desperately held on halcon raised the pistol again and brought it down twice more on guzmans head with the desired effect guzmans grip loosened he lost his footing and was swept back into the chamber where his body came to rest against a pile of boat wreckage even then he wasnt through he was on his knees struggling to get to his feet when a ships beam as long as a man slammed into his face borne by the current the timber had the effect of a battering ram a fiery pain screamed in his brain dazed and blinded in one eye arms flailing uselessly he gasped for air only to suck in lungfuls of foul water his frantic movements eventually slowed and became more feeble and the current drove him deep into the dark chamber halcon was having his own problems he had climbed only a few yards up the ladder when a wave surged over the lip of the gap in the ceiling and pummeled him like a giant wet fist until he was no longer able to hold on more water poured in and knocked him off the ladder recognizing that escape by this route was impossible he fought his way to the stairs leading to the burial chamber with the water lapping at his heels he crawled on hands and knees up the stairway zavala had been treading water when austin dove into the pool as guzmans bullet whistled overhead they surface dove and swam down into the shaft buddybreathing off one tank minutes later they emerged from the jaws of kukulcan they checked their compass and swam for open water using every muscle in their legs to get beyond the current produced by the flooding temple they surfaced near the cove that hid the plane within minutes they had cleared the branches away and started the engine and were skimming across the water for a takeoff as soon as the plane gained altitude zavala banked it around the lake in a big circle the island that had built up around the temple was gone in its place was a black hole lake water swirled down the hole like a bathtub drain and tugged at the mooring line of a seaplane that must have been halcons they had seen enough they swooped in low over the lake for one last look at the vortex zavala couldnt resist temptation he leaned out the window and shouted goodbye columbus then they headed back to the nereus the stubbymasted sailbat with the single oversized gaffrigged sail cruised over the deep blue waters of chesapeake bay pushed along from directly behind by a steady fifteenknot breeze from the southwest austin lounged in the large open cockpit with one arm on the raised rail the other on an oversized tiller his eyes scanned the boat traffic looking for prey his hunt was interrupted not unpleasantly by nina who emerged from the cuddy with two clinking glasses in her hands pursers rum and juice she said she was dressed in a numa tshirt and highcut white shorts that emphasized her long legs and buttery complexion austin was not oblivious to her charms but he was intent on his task he murmured his thanks and kept his eyes glued on the sea aha my pretty he said like the wicked witch in the wizard of oz he picked up a pair of binoculars and focused on a graceful sloop with a white fiberglass hull about twentyfive feet long like austin it was loafing along mainsail and jib set wingtowing with the wind behind austin sipped his drink set it in a glass holder then moved the tiller so that the catboat came up parallel to the sloop he waved at the two young men in the other boats cockpit jerked his thumb like a hitchhiker then veered off into a broad reach with the wind on his side the sloops crew took up the goodnatured challenge for a race austin pointed the bow closer to the wind and the sloop followed suit they were parallel now maybe separated by a hundred feet maneuvering for a start austin tightened sail putting the rail into the water the men in the sloop did the same with their main and jib and soon the two boats were cutting frothy wakes across the bay the sloop was sleek and fast and the crew were good sailors but before long austin began to pass the other boat he lay back against the rail the picture of relaxation sipping his juice until he left the sloop far behind what did you just do nina said with a smile i taught a couple more sailors that just because this thing looks like a bathtub doesnt mean it sails like one i think its a great boat big deck its amazing the space you have below for a boat only eighteen feet long ive overnighted quite often and as you can see by the cooking and sleeping facilities i like comfort and room to stretch the catboat was originally built as a workboat one person can handle the single sail and its big enough to catch a light wind at the end of the day shes weatherly too in conditions that would sink another boat best of all shes fast and doesnt look it so i can sneak up on unsuspecting chaps like that sloop crew and show them my dust here we are they had sailed off the point of a small island austin threw out the anchor and they dug into the picnic basket enjoying lunch while the boat rocked slightly in the gentle swell after lunch nina sat close to austin and leaned against his shoulder thank you for inviting me for a sail i thought we both could use a pleasant diversion after the last few weeks she stared thoughtfully into the distance i cant stop thinking about those terrible men though what a way to meet the end dont feel sorry for them guzman had murdered hundreds of people in his lifetime not to mention sinking the andrea doria in a way drowning was a fitting death for him if halcons scheme had succeeded thousands more might have died guzman was lucky halcon would have had time to contemplate the error of his ways the air in the burial chamber kept the water out for a while but it was only a matter of hours before it gave out best of all the brotherhood died with him i only wish hed lived long enough to see what happened to his precious treasure my hat is off to admiral sandecker nina said eager to change the subject suggesting that the treasure be put into an international fund to help rid the world of poverty and disease was an act of genius the alternative would have been years of legal wrangling with no winners who were the owners the descendants of the phoenicians the romans the mexicans the guatemalans or christopher columbus nina shook her head ironic isnt it like halcon his obsession with gold killed him he wasnt in very good health even before he set sail according to the autopsy he might have died soon even if he never took his fifth voyage at least this way hes become more famous than ever whether he deserved it or not besides i owe chris one if not for his obsessions we might not have met taking austins hand in hers nina said if he only knew what would come from that voyage retrieving his body and the treasure will be the greatest archaeological project in history with nations and governments all over the world cooperating i cant wait to start work hes done more in death to bring people together than he ever did in life too bad his legacy as the discoverer of america will be flawed it doesnt seem to matter ive seen the plans for the lavish tomb they want to build him in madrid theyre bidding for his body in washington and san salvador too no ones suggested putting up a monument for those nameless phoenicians and africans who were the first to set foot in the new world nina said maybe they werent the first she arched an eyebrow i beg your pardon do you have evidence to support that possibility professor austin maybe i took another look at the boat carvings do you remember the picture of the man hanging from a diamondshaped object yes i thought it might be a god of some kind i came at it from a different way i wondered how the maya managed to get a birdseye view when they were laying out the pointers to the jaws of kukulcan i think they used huge kites flying maya thats a novel theory where would they have learned to do that they were interrupted by the buzzing of austins cell phone he dug it out of his waterproof pack and put it to his ear his frown changed to a smile when he heard the voice on the line he talked for a few minutes before hanging up that was angelo donatelli calling from the hospital he said hell be out in a few days its a miracle he wasnt killed more than a miracle his cousin antonio threw halcons aim off when he went for him im glad mr donatelli sounds like a nice man from what youve told me youll get a chance to see for yourself hes throwing a big family clambake at his nantucket house youre invited paul and gamay will be there too id love to come along good then its a date now would you like to hear the rest of my kite theory nina nodded i think the maya learned from the best kite fliers in the world the japanese she laughed i dont think ill go there where would you like to go then nina picked up the cell phone someplace where you wont need this she dropped the phone over the aide then removing her sunglasses she smiled and her lush lips parted invitingly austin accepted the invitation which was as warm and sweet as promised how would you like to go below and what did you call it stretch nina whispered without a word austin took her hand led her to the spacious cabin and shut the louvered doors on the world at least for a little while
