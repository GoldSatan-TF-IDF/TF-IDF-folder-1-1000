peter robinson in a dry season the tenth book in the inspector banks series for dad and averil elaine and mick and adam and nicola the past is a foreign country they do things differently there lp hartley the gobetween prologue august it was the summer of love and i had just buried my husband when i first went back to see the reservoir that had flooded my childhood village i made the journey only a few months after ronald and i had returned from one of our frequent long spells abroad spells which had suited me well for many years ronald too had suited me well he was a decent man and a good husband quite willing to accept that our marriage was one of convenience i believe he saw me as an asset in his diplomatic career though it was certainly neither my dazzling beauty nor my sparkling wit that snared him i was however presentable and intelligent in addition to being an exceptionally good dancer whatever the reason i became adept at playing the minor diplomats wife it seemed a small price to pay in a way i was ronalds passport to career success and promotion and though i never told him this he was my passport to flight and escape i married him because i knew we would spend our lives far away from england and i wanted to be as far away from england as possible now after more than ten years abroad it doesnt seem to matter very much i shall be quite content to live out the rest of my days in the belsize park flat ronald always a shrewd investor also left me a tidy sum of money enough at least to live on for some years and to buy myself a new triumph sports car a red one with a radio and so singing along with all you need is love itchycoo park and see emily play listening to the occasional news bulletins about joe ortons murder and the closingdown of the offshore pirate radio stations i headed back to hobbs end for the first time in over twenty years for some reason i have never been able to explain i enjoyed the raw naive and whimsical new music the young people were listening to even though i was in my early forties it made me long to be young again young without the complications of my own youth young without the war young without the heartbreak young without the terror and the blood i dont think i saw another car after i left the main road outside skipton it was one of those perfect summer days when the air smells sweet with the perfume of cut grass and wildflowers i fancied i could even smell the warm exhalations of the drystone walls berries shone like polished garnets on the rowan trees tewits soared and tumbled over the meadows and sheep bleated their pitiful calls from the far dalesides the colors were all so vibrant the green greener than ever the blue of the sky cloudless and piercingly bright not far beyond grassington i lost my way i stopped and asked two men carrying out repairs to a drystone wall it was a long time since i had heard the characteristic broad speech of the dales and at first it sounded foreign to me finally i understood thanked them and left them scratching their heads over the strange middleaged lady with the sunglasses the pop music and the flashy red sports car the old lane stopped at the edge of the woods so i had to get out and walk the rest of the way along a crooked dirt path clouds of gnats whined above my head wrens flitted through the undergrowth and blue tits hopped from branch to branch at last i broke out of the woods and stood at the edge of the reservoir my heart started to pound and i had to lean against one of the trees the bark felt rough on my palms for a moment skin flushed and fingers tingling i thought i was going to faint but it passed there had been trees long ago of course but not as many and most of them had been to the north of the village in rowan woods when i had lived there hobbs end had been a village in a valley now i gazed upon a lake surrounded by forest the waters surface utterly still reflected the trees and the occasional shadow of a gull or a swallow flying over to my right i could see the small dam where the old river narrowed as it flowed into harksmere confused unsure what i was feeling i sat on the bank and stared over the scene i was sitting where the old railway branch line used to run the train i had traveled on so often during my childhood a single track that ran to and from harrogate the railway had provided our only real access to the larger world beyond hobbs end during the war dr beeching had done away with it three or four years ago of course and already the lines were overgrown with weeds the council had planted weeping willows on the spot where the old station had stood where many a time i had bought tickets from mrs shipley and waited on the platform with rising excitement to hear the distant chugging and whistling of the old steam engine as i sat there remembering time went by i had started out late and the journey from london was a long one soon darkness infused the woods around me filling the spaces between the branches and the silences between the bird calls a whisper of a breeze sprang up the water caught the fading light in such a way that its slightly ruffled surface looked as if it had been sprinkled with salmonpink powder slowly even this darkened until only a deep inky blue remained then a full moon rose scattering its bonewhite light in which i fancied i could see clear through the water to the village that used to be there like an image preserved in water glass there it was spread out below me darkly glittering and shimmering under the barely perceptible rippling of the surface as i stared i began to feel that i could reach out and touch it it was like the world beyond the mirror in cocteaus orpheus when you reach out and touch the glass it turns to water and you can plunge through it into the underworld what i saw there was a vision of the village as it had been when i lived there smoke curling from chimneys over the slate and flagstone roofs the dark mill on the hillock at the west end the squat church tower the high street curving beside the narrow river the longer i looked the more i imagined i could see the people going about their daily business shopping making deliveries gossiping in my vision i could even see our little shop where i met her for the first time that blustery spring day in the day it all began one adam kelly loved to play in the derelict houses loved the musty smell of the old rooms the way they creaked and groaned as he moved around inside them the way the sunlight shone through the laths casting striped shadows on the walls he loved to leap the gaps between the broken stairs heart in his mouth and hop from rafter to rafter kicking up plaster dust and watching the motes dance in the filtered light this afternoon adam had a whole village to play in he stood at the rim of the shallow valley staring at the ruins below and anticipating the adventure to come this was the day he had been waiting for maybe a onceinalifetime opportunity anything could happen down there the future of the universe depended on adam today the village was a test one of the things he had to conquer before advancing to the seventh level the only other people in sight stood at the far end near the old flax mill a man in jeans and a red tshirt and a woman all dressed in white they were pretending to be tourists pointing their video camera here and there but adam suspected they might be after the same thing he was he had played the game often enough on his computer to know that deception was everywhere and things were never what they seemed heaven help us he thought if they got to it first he halfslid and halfran down the dirt slope skidding to a halt when he reached the red baked earth at the bottom there were still patches of mud around all that water he supposed wouldnt just evaporate over a few weeks adam paused and listened even the birds were silent the sun beat down and made him sweat behind his ears at the back of his neck and in the crack of his bum his glasses kept slipping down his nose the dark ruined cottages wavered in the heat like a wall behind a workmans brazier anything could happen now the talisman was here somewhere and it was adams job to find it but where to begin he didnt even know what it looked like only that he would know it when he found it and that there must be clues somewhere he crossed the old stone bridge and walked into one of the halfdemolished cottages aware of the moist cool darkness gathering around him like a cloak it smelled like a bad toilet or as if some gigantic alien creature had lain down to die in a hot fetid swamp sunlight slanted in through the space where the roof had been lighting the far wall the dark stones looked as slick and greasy as an oil spill in places the heavy stone flags that formed the floor had shifted and cracked and thick gobbets of mud oozed up between them some of the slabs wobbled when adam stood on them he felt poised over a quicksand ready to suck him down to the earths core if he made one wrong move there was nothing in this house time to move on outside he could still see no one the two tourists seemed to have left now unless they were hiding lying in wait for him behind the ruined mill adam noticed an outbuilding near the bridge the kind of place that had perhaps once been used to store coal or keep food cold he had heard about the old days before electric fires and fridges it might even have been a toilet hard to believe he knew but once people had to go outside to the toilet even in winter whatever it had been the destructors had left it largely alone about seven feet high with a slanting flagstone roof still intact it seemed to beckon him to come and vanquish it here at least was a structure he could mount to get a clear view if the pretendtourists were hiding nearby he would see them from up there adam walked around the outbuilding and was pleased to see that on one side a number of stones stuck out farther than others like steps carefully he rested his weight on the first one it was slippy but it held fast he started to climb every step seemed solid enough and soon he was at the top he pulled himself onto the roof it only slanted at a slight angle so it was easy enough to walk on first he stood near the edge cupped his hand over his eyes to shield out the harsh sun and looked in every direction to the west stood the flax mill and the strangers were now nowhere in sight the land to both the north and south was covered in woods so it was hard to see anything through the dense green foliage to the east lay the teardrop shape of harksmere reservoir on the edge which ran along the south side of harksmere a couple of car windscreens flashed in the sun other than that there was hardly any movement in the world at all hardly a leaf trembling satisfied he wasnt being watched adam struck out over the roof it was only about four or five feet wide but when he got to the middle he felt the faintest tremor then before he could dash the short distance to the other side the thick stone slabs gave way beneath him for a moment he hung suspended in air as if he might float there forever he stuck his arms out and flapped them like wings but to no avail with a scream he plunged down into the darkness he landed on his back on a cushion of mud his left wrist cracked against a fallen flagstone and his right arm stretched out to break his fall sank up to the elbow as he lay there winded looking up at the square of blue sky above him he saw two of the remaining roof slabs tilt and fall toward him each one was about three feet square and six inches thick enough to smash him to a pulp if it hit him but he couldnt move he felt trapped there spellbound by the falling slabs they seemed to drift down in slow motion like autumn leaves on a windless day his mind emptied of everything he felt no panic no fear just a sort of acceptance as if he had reached a turning point in his short life and it was out of his hands now he couldnt have explained it if hed tried but at that moment lying on his cot of warm mud watching the dark stone flags wheel down across the blue of the sky young as he was he knew there was nothing he could do to avoid whatever fate had in store for him whichever way it went he could only go with it this must be the seventh level he thought as he held his breath waiting for the impact waiting to feel his bones breaking grinding against one another one slab fell to his left embedded itself in the mud and tilted against the wall like an old gravestone the other fell to his right and cracked in two against one of the floor flags one half tipped toward him just grazing his upper arm which was sticking out of the mud and raising a few drops of blood adam took a few deep breaths and looked up through the roof at the sky no more slabs so he had been spared he was alive he felt lightheaded there was nothing seriously damaged he thought as he started to move his limbs slowly his left wrist hurt a lot and it would probably come up in one hell of a bruise but it didnt feel broken his right arm was still thrust deep in the mud and the slab chafed against his grazed elbow he tried to wiggle his fingers under the mud to find out if he could still feel them and they brushed against something hard it felt like a cluster of smooth hard spindles or a bundle of short rods curious he pushed his arm in deeper and grasped it tightly the way he used to hold his mothers hand in town when he was very small and frightened of all the crowds then he leaned his weight back over to the left gritting his teeth as the pain seared through his injured wrist and tugged inch by inch he dragged his arm free keeping a firm grasp on his prize the mud made sucking slurping sounds as he pulled finally he was able to free the object he was holding he rested it against the slab and edged back toward the far wall to study it the thing lay against the flagstone in the dim light fingers hooked over the top as if it were trying to pull itself out of the grave it was the skeleton of a hand the bones crusted with moist dark earth banks stepped back to survey his handiwork whistling along with the habanera from carmen which was playing loudly on the stereo maria callas past her best but still sounding fine not bad for an amateur he thought dropping the paintbrush in a bowl of turpentine and a definite improvement over the mildewed wallpaper he had stripped from the walls of his new home yesterday he particularly liked the color the man at the doityourself center in eastvale said it was calming and after the year banks had just suffered through he needed all the calming he could get the shade of blue he had chosen was supposed to resemble that of oriental tapestries but once it was on the wall it reminded banks more of the greek island of santorini which he and his estranged wife sandra had visited during their last holiday together he hadnt bargained for that memory but he thought he could live with it pleased with himself banks pulled a packet of silk cut from his top pocket first he counted the contents only three gone since morning good he was trying to restrict himself to ten a day or less and he was doing well so far he walked into the kitchen and put on the kettle for a cup of tea the telephone rang banks turned off the stereo and picked up the receiver dad brian is that you ive been trying to get in touch with you yeah well weve been on the road i didnt think youd be in why arent you at work if you didnt expect me to be in why did you call silence brian where are you is anything wrong nothings wrong im staying at andrews flat where wimbledon look dad isnt it about time your exam results were out more silence christ banks thought getting more than a few words in a row out of brian was as tough as getting the truth out of a politician brian yeah well thats why i was calling you you know i thought id just leave a message i see banks knew what was going on now he looked around in vain for an ashtray and ended up using the hearth go on he prompted about the exams like how bad is it what did you get well thats it i mean you wont like it you did pass didnt you course i did well its just that i didnt do as well as i expected it was really hard dad everyone says so what did you get brian almost whispered a third a third thats a bit of a disappointment isnt it id have thought you could have done better than that yeah well its more than you ever got banks took a deep breath it doesnt matter a damn what i did or didnt get its you were talking about your future youll never get a decent job with a thirdclass degree what if i dont want a decent job what do you want to be then another statistic another cliché another unemployed yobbo thanks a lot dad nice to know you believe in me anyway as a matter of fact im not on the dole were going to try and make a go of it me and the band youre what were going to make a go of it andrew knows this bloke who runs an indie label and hes got a studio like and hes said we can go down and make a demo of some of my songs you might not believe it but people actually like us weve got gigs coming out of our ears have you any idea how tough it is to succeed in the music business the spice girls did it and look how much talent theyve got so did tiny tim but thats not the point talents got nothing to do with it for every one that makes it theres thousands who get trampled on the way were making plenty of money moneys not everything what about the future what are you going to do when youve peaked at twentyfive and you dont have a penny in the bank what makes you an expert on the music business all of a sudden is that why you got such a poor degree because you were too busy wasting your time rehearsing and going out on the road i was getting pretty bored with architecture anyway banks flicked his cigarette butt in the hearth it scattered sparks against the dark stone have you talked to your mother about this well i sort of thought maybe you know you could do that thats a laugh banks thought him talk to sandra they couldnt even discuss the weather these days without it turning into an argument i think youd better ring her yourself he said better still why dont you pay her a visit shes only in camden town but shell go spare serves you right you should have thought of that before the kettle started whistling thanks a lot dad brian said his voice hardedged with bitterness i thought youd understand i thought i could depend on you i thought you liked music but youre just like the rest go see to your fucking kettle brian but brian hung up hard the blue of the living room did nothing to soothe bankss mood pretty sad he thought when you turn to diy as therapy housedecoration to keep the darkness at bay he sat for a moment staring at a brush hair stuck to the paint above the mantelpiece then he stormed into the kitchen and turned off the kettle he didnt even feel like a cup of tea anymore money isnt everything what about your future banks couldnt believe he had said those things not because he thought that money was everything but because that was exactly what his parents had said to him when he told them he wanted a weekend job in the supermarket to earn some extra money it frightened him how deeply instinctive his whole response to brians news was as if someone else his own parents had spoken the words and he was only the ventriloquists dummy some people say that the older we get the more we come to resemble our parents and banks was beginning to wonder if they were right if so it was a frightening idea money isnt everything his father had said though in a way it was everything to him because he had never had any what about your future his mother had said her way of telling him that he would be far better off staying home studying for his exams than wasting his weekends making money he would only use to go hanging around billiard halls or bowling alleys they wanted him to go into a nice respectable secure whitecollar job like banking or insurance just like his older brother roy with a good degree behind him they said he could better himself which meant he could do better than they had done he was bright and that was what bright workingclass kids were supposed to do back in the sixties before banks had a chance to think any further the phone rang again hoping it was brian ringing back to apologize he dashed into the living room and picked up the receiver this time it was chief constable jeremiah jimmy riddle must be my lucky day banks thought not only was it not brian the new call also meant that banks couldnt even dial to get brians wimbledon phone number which he had neglected to ask for only worked for the last one call you received he cursed and reached for his cigarettes again at this rate hed never stop bugger it extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures he lit up skiving off again are you banks holiday said banks its official you can check doesnt matter ive got a job for you to do ill be back in the morning now banks wondered what kind of job jimmy riddle would call him off his holidays for ever since riddle had had to reinstate him reluctantly after dishing out a hasty suspension the previous year banks had been in career siberia his life a treadmill of reports statistics and more reports everything short of going around to the schools giving roadsafety talks not one active investigation in nine months he was so far out of the loop he might as well have been on pluto even the few informers he had cultivated since arriving in eastvale had deserted him surely the situation wasnt going to change this easily there had to be more to it riddle never made a move without a hidden agenda weve just got a report in from harkside riddle went on a young lad found some bones at the bottom of thornfield reservoir its one of the ones that dried up over the summer used to be a village there i gather anyway theres nothing but a section station in harkside and all theyve got is a lowly ds i want you down there as senior investigating officer old bones cant it wait probably but id rather you get started right away any problem with that what about harrogate or ripon too busy dont be such an ungrateful bastard banks heres the perfect opportunity for you to drag your career out of the slump its fallen into sure banks thought and pigs can fly he hadnt fallen into the slump he had been pushed and knowing jimmy riddle this case was only going to push him even deeper into it human bones we dont know yet in fact we know nothing at all so far thats why i want you to get down there and find out harkside no thornfield bloody reservoir youll find the local ds already at the scene cabbots the name banks stopped to think what the hell was going on here riddle was clearly not doing him any favors he must have got tired of confining banks to the station and thought up some new and interesting way to torture him a skeleton in a driedup reservoir a detective chief inspector would not under normal circumstances be dispatched to the remote borders of the county simply to examine a pile of old bones also chief constables never assigned cases to detectives that was a job for the superintendent or chief superintendent in bankss experience ccs usually restricted their activities to waffling on the telly opening farm shows and judging brassband competitions except for bloody jimmy riddle of course mr handson himself who would never miss an opportunity to rub salt in bankss wounds however busy harrogate and ripon were banks was certain they could spare someone qualified to do the job riddle obviously thought the case would be boring and unpleasant or both and that it would lead to certain failure and embarrassment otherwise why give it to banks and this ds cabbot whoever he was was probably as thick as pigshit or he would have been left to handle things himself besides why else was a detective sergeant stuck in a section station in harkside of all places hardly the crime capital of the north and banks sir dont forget your wellies banks could have sworn he heard riddle snicker like a school bully he dug out a map of the yorkshire dales and checked the lie of the land thornfield was the westernmost in a chain of three linked reservoirs built along the river rowan which ran more or less east from its source high in the pennines until it turned south and joined the river wharfe near otley though thornfield was only about twentyfive miles away as the crow flies there was no fast way only minor unfenced roads for the most part banks traced a route on the map with his forefinger he would probably be best heading south over the moors and along langstrothdale chase to grassington then east toward pateley bridge even then it would probably take an hour or more after a quick shower banks picked up his jacket and tapped his pockets by habit to make certain he had car keys and wallet then walked out into the afternoon sunshine before setting off he stood for a moment resting his hands on the warm stone wall and looked down at the bare rocks where gratly waterfalls should be a quote from a t s eliot poem he had read the previous evening came to his mind thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season very apt it had been a long drought everything was dry that summer including bankss thoughts his conversation with brian still nagged on his mind he wished it hadnt ended the way it had though banks knew he fretted more about his daughter tracy who was at present traveling around france in an old van with a couple of girlfriends that didnt mean he wasnt concerned about brian because of his job banks had seen so many kids go wrong that it was beyond a joke drugs vandalism mugging burglary violent crime brian was too sensible to do anything like that banks had always told himself he had been given every possible middleclass advantage more than banks had ever got which was probably why he felt more hurt than anything by his sons comments a couple of ramblers passed by the front of the cottage heavy rucksacks on their backs knotted leg muscles shorts sturdy hiking boots ordnance survey maps hanging in little plastic holders around their necks in case it rained some hope banks said hello remarked on the good weather and got into the cavalier the upholstery was so hot he almost jumped out again well he thought fumbling for a cassette to play brian was old enough to make his own decisions if he wanted to chuck everything in for a shot at fame and fortune that was up to him wasnt it at least banks had a real job to do jimmy riddle had made a mistake this time no doubt he believed he had given banks a filthy deadend job full of opportunities for cockups no doubt the dice were loaded against him but anything was better than sitting in his office riddle had overlooked the one overriding characteristic banks possessed even at his lowest ebb curiosity feeling for a moment like a grounded pilot suddenly given permission to fly again banks slipped loves forever changes in the cassette player and drove off spraying gravel the booksigning started at half past six but vivian elmsley had told her publicist wendi that she liked to arrive early get familiar with the place and have a chat with the staff there was already a crowd at quarter past still it was only to be expected all of a sudden after twenty novels in as many years vivian elmsley was a success though her reputation and her sales had grown steadily over the years her detective inspector niven series which accounted for fifteen of the twenty books had recently made it to the small screen with a handsome lead actor glossy production values and a big budget the first three episodes had been shown to great critical acclaim especially given how bored many television critics had become with police dramas recently and as a result vivian had become over the past month or so about as familiar a face to the general public as a writer ever is she had been on the cover of night amp day had been interviewed by melvyn bragg on the south bank show and featured prominently in womans own magazine after all becoming an overnight success in ones seventies was quite newsworthy some people even recognized her in the street adrian the event organizer gave her a glass of red wine while thalia arranged the books on the low table in front of the settee at half past six on the dot adrian introduced her by saying that she needed no introduction and to a smattering of applause she picked up her copy of the latest inspector niven story traces of sin and began to read from the opening section about five minutes was enough vivian reckoned anything less made her look as if she couldnt wait to get away anything more risked losing the audiences attention the settee was so soft and deep that it seemed to enfold her as she read she wondered how she would ever get out of it she was hardly a spry young thing anymore after the reading people formed an orderly queue and vivian signed their books pausing to chat briefly with everyone asking if they wanted any specific sort of dedication and making sure she spelled their names right it was all very well if someone said he was called john but how were you to know it wasnt spelled jon then there were the more complex variations donna or dawna janice or janis vivian looked down at her hand as she signed talonlike she thought almost skeletal dotted with liver spots skin shriveled and wrinkled over the knuckle joints puffs of flesh around the wedding ring she could never remove even if she wanted to her hands were the first to go she thought the rest of her was remarkably wellpreserved for a start she had remained tall and lean she hadnt shrunk or run to fat like so many elderly women or generated that thick hard matronly carapace steelgray hair pulled back tightly and fastened at the back created a widows peak over her strong thin face her deep blue eyes networked with crows feet were almost oriental in their slant her nose was slightly hooked and her lips thin not a face that smiled often people thought and they were right even though it had not always been so a steely unblinking gaze into the depths of evil one reviewer had written of her and was it graham greene who had noted that there is a splinter of ice in the heart of the writer how right he was though it hadnt always been there you used to live up north didnt you vivian looked up startled at the question the man appeared to be about sixty thin to the point of emaciation with a long gaunt pale face and lank fair hair he was wearing faded jeans and the kind of gaudy shortsleeved shirt you would expect to see at a seaside resort as he held the book out for her to sign she noticed that his hands were unnaturally small for a mans something about them disturbed her vivian nodded a long time ago then she looked at the book who would you like me to sign this to what was the name of the place where you lived it was a long time ago did you go by the same name then look i excuse me sir it was adrian politely asking the man to move along he did as he was asked cast one backward glance at vivian then he slapped her book down on a pile of john harveys and left vivian carried on signing adrian brought her another glass of wine people told her how much they loved her books and she soon forgot about the strange man and his prying questions when it was all over adrian and the staff suggested dinner but vivian was tired another sign of her advancing years all she wanted to do was go home to a long hot bath a gin and tonic and flauberts sentimental education but first she needed a little exercise and some air alone ill drive you home said wendi vivian laid her hand on wendis forearm no my dear she said if you dont mind id just like a little walk by myself first then ill take the tube but really its no trouble thats what im here for no ill be perfectly all right im not over the hill yet wendi blushed she had probably been told that vivian was prickly someone always warned the publicists and media escorts im sorry i didnt mean to suggest anything like that but its my job a pretty young girl like you must have far better things to do than drive an old lady home in the london traffic why dont you go to the pictures with your boyfriend go dancing or something wendi smiled and looked at her watch well i did tell tim i wouldnt be able to meet him until later perhaps if i phoned him now and went to queue at the halfprice ticket booth we could get some lastminute theater tickets but only if youre sure quite sure my dear good night vivian walked out into the warm autumn dusk on bedford street london she still sometimes found herself unable to believe that she actually lived in london she remembered her first visit how vast majestic and overwhelming the city had felt she had gazed in awe at landmarks she had only heard of read about or seen in pictures piccadilly circus big ben st pauls buckingham palace trafalgar square of course that was a long time ago but even today she felt that same magic when she recited the names or walked the famous streets charing cross road was crowded with people leaving work late or arriving early for the theaters and cinemas meeting friends for a drink before getting on the tube vivian crossed the road carefully waiting for the pedestrian signal and strolled around leicester square a small choir was singing men of harlech just beside the burger king how it had all changed the fast food places the shops even the cinemas it wasnt far from here on haymarket that she had been to her first london cinema the carlton what had she seen for whom the bell tolls of course that was it as she walked back to the leicester square tube entrance vivian thought again about the strange man in the bookshop she didnt like to dwell on the past but he had pushed her into a reminiscent mood as had the recent newspaper photographs of the driedup thornfield reservoir the ruins of hobbs end were exposed to the light of day for the first time in over forty years and the memories of her life there had come crowding back vivian shuddered as she walked down the steps to the underground two banks paused for breath after his walk through the woods from where he stood on the edge of thornfield reservoir the entire elongated bowl of ruins lay open below him like a cupped hand about a quarter of a mile wide and half a mile long he didnt know the full story but he knew that the site had been covered with water for many years this was its first reappearance like an excavated ancient settlement or a sort of latterday brigadoon he could see tangles of tree roots sticking out of the slope on the opposite embankment the difference in soil colors showed where the waterline had been beyond the high bank rowan woods straggled away to the north the most dramatic part of the scene lay directly below the sunken village itself bracketed by a ruined mill on a hillock to the west and by a tiny packhorse bridge to the east the whole thing resembled the skeleton of a giants torso the bridge formed the pelvic bone and the mill was the skull which had been chopped off and placed slightly to the left of the body the river and high street formed the slightly curving backbone from which the various ribs of side streets branched off there was no road surface but the course of the old high street by the river was easy enough to make out it eventually forked at the bridge one branch turning toward rowan woods where it soon narrowed to a footpath and the other continuing over the bridge then out of the village along the harksmere embankment presumably all the way to harkside it struck banks as especially odd that there should have been a fully intact bridge there under water for all those years below him a group of people stood by the other side of the bridge one of them in uniform banks scampered down the narrow path it was a warm evening and he was sweating by the time he got to the bottom before approaching the group he took a handkerchief from his pocket and mopped his brow and the back of his neck there was nothing he could do about the damp patches under his arms he wasnt overweight or even especially unfit he smoked he ate lousy food and he drank too much but he had the kind of metabolism that had always kept him lean he didnt go in for strenuous exercise but since sandra left he had got into the habit of taking long solitary walks every weekend and he swam half a mile at the eastvale public baths once or twice a week it was this damn hot weather that made him feel so out of shape the valley bottom wasnt as muddy as it looked most of the exposed reddishbrown earth had been caked and cracked by the heat however there were some marshy patches with reeds growing out of them and he had to jump several large puddles on his way as he crossed the packhorse bridge a woman walked toward him and stopped him in the middle excuse me sir she said arm extended palm out this is a crime scene im afraid you cant come any further banks smiled he knew he didnt look like a dci he had left his sports jacket in the car and wore a blue denim shirt open at the neck with no tie light tan trousers and black wellington boots why isnt it taped off then he asked the woman looked at him and frowned she was in her late twenties or early thirties by the look of her longlegged tall and slim probably not much more than an inch shorter than bankss five foot nine she was wearing blue jeans and a white blouse made of some silky material over the blouse she wore a herringbone jacket that followed the contours of her waist and the gentle outward curve of her hips her chestnut hair was parted in the middle and fell in layered casual waves to her shoulders her face was oval with a smooth tanned complexion full lips and a small mole to the right of her mouth she was wearing blackrimmed sunglasses and when she took them off her serious almond eyes seemed to appraise banks as if he were a hitherto undiscovered species she wasnt conventionally goodlooking hers wasnt the kind of face youd find on the pages of a magazine but her looks showed character and intelligence and the red wellies set it all off nicely banks smiled do i have to throw you off the bridge into the river before i can cross like robin hood did to little john i think youll find it was the other way round but you could try it she said then after they had scrutinized one another for a few seconds she squinted frowned and said youll be dci banks then she didnt appear nervous or embarrassed about mistaking him for a sightseer there was no hint of apology or deference in her tone he didnt know whether he liked that ds cabbot i presume yes sir she smiled it was no more than a twitch of one corner of her mouth and a brief flash of light behind her eyes but it left an impression many people banks mused probably thought it was nice to be smiled at by ds cabbot which made him all the more suspicious of jimmy riddles motives for sending him out here and these people banks pointed to the man and woman talking to the uniformed policeman the man was aiming a video camera at the outbuilding colleen harris and james ogrady sir they were scouting the location for a tv program when they saw the boy fall through the roof they ran to help him seems they also had their camera handy i suppose itll make a nice little item on the evening news she scratched the side of her nose wed run out of crimescene tape sir at the section station to be honest im not sure we ever had any in the first place she toyed with the sunglasses as she spoke but banks didnt think it was out of nervousness she had a slight west country burr not very pronounced but clear enough to be noticeable theres nothing we can do about the tv people now banks said they might even be useful youd better explain what happened all i know is that a boy discovered some old bones here ds cabbot nodded adam kelly hes thirteen where is he i sent him home to harkside he seemed a bit shaken up and hed bruised his wrist and elbow nothing serious anyway he wanted his mummy so i got pc cameron over there to drive him and then come back poor kidll be having nightmares for months as it is what happened adam was walking on the roof and it gave way under him lucky he didnt break his back or get crushed to death she pointed at the outbuilding the rafters that helped support the flagstones must have rotted all those years under water it didnt take much weight i should think the demolition men were supposed to pull the whole place down before it was flooded but they must have knocked off early that day banks looked around it does seem as if they cut a few corners why not they probably thought no one would ever see the place again who can tell whats there when its all under water anyway the mud broke adams fall his arm got stuck in it and he pulled up a skeleton of a hand human dont know sir i mean it looks human to me but well need an expert to be certain ive read that its easy to mistake bear paws for human hands bear paws when was the last time you saw a bear around these parts why just last week sir banks paused a moment saw the glint in her eye and smiled there was something about this woman that intrigued him nothing in her tone hinted at selfdoubt or uncertainty about her actions most junior police officers when questioned about their actions by a senior generally either let a little of the did i do the right thing sir creep into their tone or they became defensive susan gay his old dc had been like that but there was none of this with ds cabbot she simply stated things as they had occurred decisions as she had made them and something about the way she did it made her sound completely selfassured and selfpossessed without being at all arrogant or insubordinate banks found her disconcerting right he said lets go have a look ds cabbot folded up her sunglasses slipped them in her shoulder bag and led the way banks followed her to the outbuilding she moved with a sort of looselimbed grace the way cats do whenever its not feeding time on his way he stopped and talked briefly to the tv people they couldnt tell him much except that theyd been exploring the area when they saw the lad fall through the roof they rushed over immediately and when they got to him they saw what hed pulled up out of the earth he hadnt seemed particularly grateful for their assistance they said or even pleased to see them but they were relieved he wasnt seriously hurt true to their profession they asked banks if he would mind giving them a comment for the tape he declined politely citing lack of information as soon as he had turned away the woman was on her mobile to the local news channel it didnt sound like the first time shed called either the outbuilding was about six or seven feet square banks stood in the doorway and looked at the depression in the mud where the boy had landed then at the two heavy slabs of stone on either side ds cabbot was right adam kelly had been very lucky indeed there were more slabs strewn around on the floor too many of them broken some just fragments sticking up out of the mud he could easily have landed on one and snapped his spine still when youre that young you think youre immortal banks and his friends certainly had even after phil simpkins wrapped his rope all the way around a tree trunk jumped off the top branch and spiraled all the way down onto the pointed metal railings banks shook off the memory and concentrated on the scene before him the sun shone on the top part of the far wall the stone glistened moist and slimy there was a brackish smell about the place banks noticed though there was no salt water for miles and a smell of dead fish which were probably a lot closer see what i mean sir said ds cabbot because the roof kept the sun out its a lot more muddy in here than outside she swept some stray tresses from her cheek with a quick flick of her hand probably saved the kids life bankss gaze lighted on the skeletal hand curled around the edge of a broken stone slab it looked like a creature from a horror film trying to claw its way out of the grave the bones were dark and clotted with mud but it looked like a human hand to banks wed better get some experts in to dig this place out he said then well need a forensic anthropologist in the meantime i havent had my tea yet is there somewhere nearby we might be able to get a bite the black swan in harksides your best bet will you be wanting adam kellys address have you eaten no but you can come with me then fill me in over a meal i can have a chat with young adam in the morning when hes had time to collect himself pc cameron can hold the fort here ds cabbot glanced down at the skeletal hand come on banks said theres nothing more we can do here this poor buggers probably been dead longer than weve been alive vivian elmsley felt boneweary when she finally got home from the signing she put her briefcase down in the hall and walked through to the living room most people would have been surprised at the modern chromeandglass decor in the home of a person as old as vivian but she far preferred it to all the dreadfully twee antiques knickknacks and restored woodwork that cluttered up most old peoples houses at least the ones she had seen the only painting that adorned her plain white walls hung over the narrow glass mantelpiece a framed print of a georgia okeeffe flower overwhelming in its yellowness and intimidating in its symmetry first vivian opened the windows to let in some air then she poured a stiff gin and tonic and made her way to her favorite armchair supported by chrome tubes upholstered in black leather it leaned back at just the right angle to make reading drinking or watching television sinfully comfortable vivian glanced at the clock all its polished brassandsilver inner workings exposed by the glass dome almost nine she would watch the news first after that she would have her bath and read flaubert she reached for the remote control after the best part of a lifetimes writing in longhand with only an old walnutcabinet wireless to provide entertainment she had given in to technology five years ago in one glorious shopping spree the day after she received a large advance from her new american publisher she went out and bought herself a television a vcr a stereo system and the computer she now used to write her books she put her feet up and clicked on the remote control the news was the usual rubbish politics for the most part a little murder famine in africa a botched assassination attempt in the middle east she didnt know why she bothered watching it then toward the end came one of those little humaninterest bites they use to fill up the time this one made vivian sit up and take notice the camera panned a cluster of familiar ruins as the voiceover explained that the drought had brought this lost dales village of hobbs end to light for the first time since it had been officially flooded in she already knew that this was the same film footage they had used when the story first made it to television about a month ago but suddenly the angle changed and she could see a group of people standing by the bridge one of them a uniformed policeman today the voiceover went on a young boy exploring the scene discovered something he hadnt bargained for the narrators tone was light fluffy the way so many of the cozy mysteries vivian detested made light of the real world of murder it was a mystery worthy of miss marple he went on a skeleton discovered not in a cupboard folks but under the muddy floor of an old outbuilding how could it have got there was foul play suspected vivian clutched the cool chrome tubes at the sides of her armchair as she watched gin and tonic forgotten on the glass table beside her the camera focused on the outbuilding and vivian saw the man and woman standing on the threshold the narrator went on about the police arriving at the scene and refusing to comment at this early stage then he brought the piece to a close by saying theyd be keeping an eye on the situation the program was well into the weather by the time vivian had recovered from the shock even then she found that her hands were still gripping the chrome so tightly even her liver spots had turned white she let go let her body sag in the chair and took a deep breath then she reached for her gin and tonic hands shaking now and managed to take a gulp without spilling it that helped when she felt a little calmer she went into the study and dug through her filing cabinet for the manuscript she had written in the early s three years after her last visit to thornfield reservoir she found the sheaf of papers and carried it back through to the living room it had never been intended for publication in many ways it had been a practice piece one she had written when she became interested in writing after her husbands death she had written it when she thought the old adage write about what you know meant write about your own life your own experiences it had taken her a few years to work out that that was not the case she still wrote about what she knew guilt grief pain madness only now she put it into the lives of her characters as she started to read she realized she wasnt sure exactly what it was a memoir a novella certainly there was some truth in it at least she had tried to stick to the facts had even consulted her old diaries for accuracy but because she had written it at a time in her life when she had been unclear about the blurred line between autobiography and fiction she couldnt be sure which was which would she see it any more clearly now there was only one way to find out banks had never been to harkside before ds cabbot led the way in her metallic purple astra and he followed her along the winding oneway streets lined with limestone and gritstone dales cottages with small colorful gardens behind low walls many of the houses that opened directly onto the street had window boxes or baskets of red and gold flowers hanging outside they parked beside the village green where a few scattered trees provided shade for the benches old people sat in the latesummer dusk as the shadows grew long wrinkled hands resting on knobbly walking sticks talking to other old people or just watching the world go by at the center of the green stood a small obeliskstyle war memorial listing the names of harksides dead over the two world wars the essentials were arrayed around the green a kwiksave minimart which from its oddly ornate facade looked as if it had once been a cinema a barclays bank newsagents butchers grocers betting shop oddbins wines a fifteenthcentury church and three pubs one of them the black swan though harkside had a population of only between two and three thousand it was the largest place for some miles and people from the more remote farms and hamlets still viewed it as the closest thing to the big city full of sin and temptation it was simply a large village but most local people referred to it as town wheres the section station banks asked ds cabbot pointed down a side street the place that looks like a brick garage the one with the flat roof thats the one ugliest building in town do you live here for my sins yes sir it was just a saying banks knew but he couldnt help wondering what those sins were just imagining them gave him a little thrill of delight they walked over to the black swan a whitewashandtimber facade with gables and a sagging slate roof it was dim inside but still too warm despite the open door and windows though a few tourists and ramblers lingered over afterdinner drinks at the rickety wooden tables it was long past their bedtime banks walked to the bar with ds cabbot who asked the bartender if they could still get food depends what you want love she said and pointed to a list on the blackboard banks sighed the guessing game he had played it often enough before you walk in about ten minutes after opening time and ask for something on the menu only to be told that its off after about four or five alternatives also declared off you finally find something that they just might have if youre lucky this time banks went through tandoori chicken and chips venison medallions in a red wine sauce and chips and fettucine alfredo and chips before striking gold beef and stilton pie and chips he hadnt been eating much beef for the past few years but he had stopped worrying about madcow disease lately if his brain was going to turn to sludge there wasnt much he could do to stop it at this stage sometimes it felt like sludge already ds cabbot ordered a salad sandwich no chips diet banks asked remembering the way susan gay used to nibble on rabbit food most of the time no sir i dont eat meat and the chips are cooked in animal fat theres not a lot of choice i see drink like a fish she laughed actually ill have a pint of swans down bitter id recommend it very highly its brewed on the premises banks took her advice and was glad that he did he had never met a vegetarian beer aficionado before ill bring your food over when its ready dearies the woman said banks and ds cabbot took their pints over to a table by the open window it looked out on the twilit green the scene had changed a group of teenagers had supplanted the old men they leaned against tree trunks smoking drinking from cans pushing and shoving telling jokes laughing trying to look tough again banks thought of brian it wasnt such a bad thing was it neglecting his architectural studies to pursue a career in music it didnt mean hed end up a deadbeat and if it was a matter of drugs brian had probably had enough opportunities to try them already banks certainly had by his age what really bothered him was his realization that he didnt really know his son very well anymore brian had grown up over the past few years away from home and banks hadnt seen much of him truth be told he had spent far more time and energy on tracy he had also had his own preoccupations and problems both at work and at home maybe they were on the wane but they certainly hadnt gone away yet if ds cabbot felt uncomfortable with bankss brooding silence she didnt show it he fished out his cigarettes still not bad he had smoked only five so far that day despite his row with brian and jimmy riddles phone call cutting out the ones he usually had in the car was a good idea do you mind he asked she shook her head sure if youre asking whether itll make me suffer it will but i usually manage to control my cravings reformed a year sorry you neednt be im not banks lit up im thinking of stopping soon myself ive cut down best of luck ds cabbot raised her glass took a sip of beer and smacked her lips ah thats good do you mind if i ask you something no she leaned forward and touched the hair at his right temple whats that what the scar no the blue bit i didnt think dcis went in for dye jobs banks felt himself blush he touched the spot she had indicated it must be paint i was painting my living room when jimmy riddle phoned i thought id washed it all off she smiled never mind looks quite nice actually maybe i should get an earring to go with it better not go too far banks gestured out of the window get much trouble he asked the kids nah not a lot bit of gluesniffing some vandalism mostly theyre bored its just adolescent high spirits banks nodded at least brian wasnt bored and shiftless he had a direction he passionately wanted to head in whether it was the right one or not was another matter banks tried to concentrate on the job at hand i called my sergeant on the way here he said hell organize a soco team to dig out the bones tomorrow morning a bloke called john webb will be in charge hes studied archaeology goes on digs for his holidays so he ought to know what hes doing ive also phoned our odontologist geoff turner and asked him to have a look at the teeth as soon as it can be arranged you can phone around the universities in the morning see if you can come up with a friendly forensic anthropologist these people are pretty keen as a rule so i dont think thatll be a problem in the meantime he said as his smoke curled and twisted out of the window tell me all about thornfield reservoir ds cabbot leaned back in her chair and crossed her legs at the ankles resting the beer glass against her flat stomach she had swapped her red wellies for a pair of white sandals and her jeans rode up to reveal tapered ankles bare except for a thin gold chain around the left one banks had never seen anyone manage to look quite so comfortable in a hard pub chair he wondered again what she could possibly have done to end up in such a godforsaken outpost as harkside was she another of jimmy riddles pariahs its the most recent of the three reservoirs built along the river rowan she began linwood and harksmere were both created in the latenineteenth century to supply leeds with extra water its piped from the reservoirs to the big waterworks just outside the city then its purified and pumped into peoples homes but harksmere and thornfield are in north yorkshire not west yorkshire west riding i suppose it was back then even so why should they be supplying water to leeds i dont know how it came about but some sort of deal was struck between north yorkshire and the leeds city council for the land use thats why were not part of the park what do you mean rowandale nidderdale too were not part of the yorkshire dales national park though we should be if you go by geography and natural beauty its because of the water nobody wanted to have to deal with national parks commissions rules and regulations so it was easier just to exclude us like eastvale banks thought because it was just beyond the parks border the severe building restrictions that operated inside the yorkshire dales national park didnt apply consequently you ended up with monstrosities like the east side estate with its ugly tower blocks and maisonettes and the new council estate just completed down by gallows view gibbet acres as everyone was calling it at the station their meals arrived banks stubbed out his cigarette what about thornfield he asked after he had swallowed his first bite the pie was good tender beef and just enough stilton to complement it how long has it been there what happened to the village thornfield reservoir was created in the early fifties around the time the national parks system was established but the village had already been empty a few years by then since the end of the war i think used to have a population of around three or four hundred it wasnt called thornfield it was called hobbs end why beats me theres no hobb in its history as far as anyone knows and it wasnt the end of anything except maybe civilization as we know it how long was the village there no idea since medieval times probably most of them have been why was it empty what drove people away nothing drove them away it just died places do like people did you notice that big building at the far west end yes that was the flax mill it was the villages raison dêtre in the nineteenth century the mill owner lord clifford also owned the land and the cottages very feudal you seem to be an expert but you dont sound as if you come from these parts i dont i read up on the area when i came here its got quite an interesting history anyway the flax mill started to lose business too much competition from bigger operations and from abroad then old lord clifford died and his son wanted nothing to do with the place this was just after the second world war tourism wasnt such big business in the dales back then and you didnt get absentees buying up all the cottages for holiday rentals when someone moved out if nobody else wanted to move in the cottage was usually left empty and soon fell to rack and ruin people moved away to the cities or to the other dales finally the new lord clifford sold the land to leeds corporation waterworks they rehoused the remaining tenants and that was that over the next few years the engineers moved in and prepared the site then they created the reservoir why that site in particular there must be plenty of places to build reservoirs not really its partly because the other two were nearby and it was easier for the engineers to add one to the string that way they could control the levels better but mostly i imagine its to do with water tables and bedrock and such theres a lot of limestone in the dales and apparently you cant build reservoirs on that sort of limestone its permeable the rowan valley bottoms made of something else something hard its all to do with faults and extrusions im afraid ive forgotten most of my school geology me too when did you say all this happened between the end of the second world war and the early fifties i can check the exact dates back at the station please banks paused and tasted some beer so our body if indeed there is one and if its human has to have been down there since before the early fifties unless someone put it there this summer im no expert but from what ive seen so far it looks older than that it could have been moved from somewhere else maybe when the reservoir dried up someone found a better hiding place for a body they already had i suppose its possible whatever happened i doubt that whoever buried it there would have put on a frogmans outfit and swum down whoever buried it oh yes sir id say it was buried wouldnt you banks finished his pie and pushed the rest of the chips aside go on the stone slabs maybe the body could have got covered by two or three feet of earth without much help maybe i mean we dont know how much things shifted and silted down there over the last forty years or more we also dont know yet whether the victim was wearing concrete wellies but it beats me how a body could have got under those stone slabs on the outbuilding floor without a little human intervention dont you think sir it was a blustery afternoon in april when she appeared in our shop for the first time even in her land girl uniform the green vneck pullover biscuitcolored blouse green tie and brown corduroy knee breeches she looked like a film star she wasnt very tall perhaps about five foot two or three and the drab uniform couldnt hide the kind of figure ive heard men whistle at in the street she had a pale heartshaped face perfectly proportioned nose and mouth and the biggest deepest bluest eyes i had ever seen her blond hair cascaded from her brown felt hat which she wore at a jaunty angle and held on with one hand as she walked in from the street i was immediately put in mind of hardys novel a pair of blue eyes which i had read only a few weeks previously like elfride swancourts this land girls eyes were a sublimation of her they were a misty and shady blue that had no beginning or surface looked into rather than at those eyes also had a way of making you feel you were the only person in the world when she talked to you nasty out isnt it i dont suppose youve got five woodbines for sale have you she asked i shook my head sorry i said we dont have any cigarettes at all it was one of the toughest times wed had in the war thus far the luftwaffe was bombing our cities to ruins the uboats were sinking atlantic convoys at an alarming rate and the meat ration had just been dropped to only one and tenpence a week but here she was bold as brass a stranger walking into the shop and without a byyourleave asking for cigarettes i was lying of course we did have cigarettes but what small supply we had we kept under the counter for our registered customers we certainly didnt go selling them to strange and beautiful land girls with eyes out of thomas hardy novels i was just on the point of telling her to try fluttering her eyelashes at one of the airmen knocking about the village holding my tongue never having been my strongest point when she totally disarmed me with a sequence of reactions first she thumped the counter with her little fist and cursed then a moment later she bit the corner of her lower lip and broke into a bright smile i didnt think you would have she said but it was worth asking i ran out the day before yesterday and im absolutely gasping for a fag oh well cant be helped are you the new land girl at top hill farm i asked curious now and beginning to feel more than a little guilty about my deceit she smiled again word gets around quickly doesnt it its a small village so i see anyway thats me gloria stringer then she held her hand out i thought it rather an odd gesture for a woman especially around these parts but i took it her hand was soft and slightly moist like a summer leaf after rain mine felt coarse and heavy wrapped around such a delicate thing i always was an ungainly and awkward child but never did i feel this so much as during that first meeting with gloria gwen shackleton i muttered more than a trifle embarrassed pleased to meet you gloria rested her hand palmdown on the counter cocked one hip forward and looked around not a lot to do around here is there she said i smiled not a lot i knew what she meant of course but it still struck me as an odd even insensitive thing to say i got up at six oclock every morning to run the shop and on top of that i spent one night a week firewatching a bit of a joke around these parts until the spinners inn was burned down by a stray incendiary bomb in february and two people were killed i also helped with the local womens voluntary service most days after the nineoclock news i was exhausted and ready to fall asleep the minute my head hit the pillow i had heard how hard a land girls job was of course but to judge by her appearance especially those soft hands you would swear that gloria stringer had never done a days hard physical labor in her life my first thought was an uncharitable one knowing farmer kilnseys wandering eye i thought that perhaps when his wife wasnt around he was teaching gloria a new way of plowing the furrow though i wasnt quite sure what that meant being only sixteen at the time i had heard more than one or two farmers use the phrase when they thought i was out of earshot but in this as in most of my first impressions about gloria i was quite wrong this freshness in her appearance was simply one of her many remarkable qualities she could spend the day haymaking threshing peapulling milking snagging turnips yet always appear fresh and alive with energy to spare as if unlike the rest of us mere mortals she had some sort of invisible shield around her through which the hard diurnal toil couldnt penetrate on first impressions i have to confess that i did not like gloria stringer she struck me as being vain common shallow and selfish not to mention beautiful of course that hurt especially then wouldnt you know it but right in the middle of our conversation michael stanhope had to walk in michael stanhope was something of a character around the village to put it mildly a reasonably successful artist somewhere id guess in his early fifties he affected a rakish appearance and seemed deliberately to go out of his way to offend people that day he was wearing a rumpled white linen suit over a grubby lavender shirt and a crooked yellow bow tie he also wore his ubiquitous broadbrimmed hat and carried a cane with a snakehead handle as usual he looked quite dissipated his eyes were bloodshot he had at least three days stubble on his face and he emanated a sort of general fug of stale smoke and alcohol a lot of people didnt like michael stanhope because he wasnt afraid to say what he thought and he spoke out against the war i quite liked him in a way though i didnt agree with his views half the time he only said what he did to annoy people like complaining that he couldnt get canvas for his paintings because the army was using it all that wasnt true at all but he would have to walk in right then good morning my cherub he said as he always did though i felt far from cherubic i trust you have my usual er sorry mr stanhope i stammered were all out all out come come now girl that cant be he grinned and looked over at gloria mischievously then he winked at her im sorry mr stanhope ill bet if you looked in the usual place he said leaning forward and rapping on the counter with his cane you would find them i knew when i was beaten mortified blushing to the roots of my being i reached under the counter and brought out the two packets of piccadilly i had put aside for him the way i always did whenever we were lucky enough to get some in thatll be one and eight please i said outrageous mr stanhope complained as he dug out the coins the way this government is taxing us to death to make war dont you think so my cherub i muttered something noncommittal all the while gloria had been watching our little display with growing fascination when i glanced at her guiltily as i handed over the cigarettes to mr stanhope she smiled at me and shrugged mr stanhope must have caught the gesture he was always quick to sense any new nuance or current in the atmosphere he fed on that sort of thing ah i see he said turning his gaze fully toward gloria and admiring her figure quite openly do i take it that you were inquiring after cigarettes yourself my dear gloria nodded as a matter of fact i was well said mr stanhope putting the brass snakehead of his cane to his chin as he reflected ill tell you what as i very much approve of women smoking perhaps we can come to some sort of arrangement i have but one stipulation oh said gloria crossing her arms and narrowing her eyes and what might that be that you smoke in the street every now and then gloria stared at him for a moment then she started to laugh that wont be a problem she said i can assure you and he handed her one of the packets i was flabbergasted there were ten cigarettes in each packet and they werent cheap or easy to get instead of protesting that she couldnt possibly accept them but thanking him for his generosity anyway as i would have done gloria simply took the packet and said why thank you very much mr he beamed at her stanhope michael stanhope at your service and its my pleasure believe me my dear its a rare treat indeed to meet a woman as comely as thyself around these parts then he moved a step closer and scrutinized her quite rudely i thought rather like a farmer looking over a horse he was about to buy gloria stood her ground when mr stanhope had finished he turned to go but before the door shut behind him he cast a quick glance over his shoulder at gloria you know you really must visit my studio my dear see my etchings as it were and with that he was gone chuckling as he went in the silence that followed gloria and i stared at one another for a moment then we both burst out giggling when we had managed to control ourselves i told her i was sorry for deceiving her over the cigarettes but she waved the apology aside you have your regulars to attend to she said and these are difficult times i must apologize for mr stanhope too i said im afraid he can be quite rude nonsense she said with that little pixieish grin of hers i rather liked him and he did give me these she opened the packet and offered me a cigarette i shook my head i didnt smoke then she put one in the corner of her mouth and lit it with a small silver lighter she took from her uniform pocket just as well she said i can see these will have to last me a while i can put some aside for you in future i said i mean i can try depending on how many we can get of course would you oh yes please that would be wonderful now if i might just have a look at that copy of picture goer over there the one with vivien leigh on the cover i do so admire vivien leigh dont you shes so beautiful have you seen gone with the wind i saw it in the west end before i went on my months training absolutely but before i could get the magazine for her or tell her that gone with the wind hadnt reached this far north yet matthew dashed in gloria turned at the sound of the bell eyebrows raised in curiosity when he saw her my brother stopped in his tracks and fell into her eyes so deeply you could hear the splash the first thing banks did when he got back to the cottage that night was check the answering machine nothing damn it he wanted to put things right after his miserable cockup on the phone earlier that day but he still had no access to brians number in wimbledon he didnt even know andrews last name he could find out after all he was supposed to be a detective but it would take time and he could only do it during office hours sandra might know of course but the last thing he wanted to do was talk to her banks poured himself a whiskey turned off the bright overhead light and switched on the reading lamp by his armchair he picked up the book he had been reading over the past week an anthology of twentiethcentury poetry but he couldnt concentrate the blue walls distracted him and the smell of paint in the deep silence of the countryside made him feel lonely and restless he turned on the radio someone was playing the first movement of tchaikovskys violin concerto banks glanced around the room the walls did look good they harmonized well with the ceiling which he had painted the color of ripe brie maybe they were just a little too cold he thought though he needed all the airconditioning he could get in this weather he could always repaint them orange or red in winter when the ice and snow came and that would give the illusion of warmth he lit the last cigarette of the day and took his drink outside the cottage stood on a narrow unpaved laneway about fifty yards west of gratly opposite banks front door was a sort of bulge in the low wall that ran between the lane and gratly beck in the daytime it was an ideal spot for ramblers to stop for a moment and admire the falls but at night there was never anyone there the lane wasnt a through road and there was plenty of room for banks to park his car there just beyond the cottage it dwindled to a public footpath which ran between the woods and the side of gratly beck banks had come to see this area as his personal veranda and he liked to stand out there or sit on the low wall dangling his legs over the edge late in the evening when it was quiet it helped him think get things sorted tonight the stone was still warm the smoke on his tongue tasted sweet as freshmown hay a sheep bleated high on the daleside where the silhouetted falls were only a shade or two blacker than the night itself sharp starlight pricked the satin sky along with the lights of a distant farmhouse a gibbous moon hung over helmthorpe in the valley bottom and the square church tower with its ancient weather vane stood solid against the night this must have been what the blackout was like banks thought remembering his mothers stories of getting around london during the blitz as banks sat by the driedup waterfalls he thought again about the odd way he had come to live in this isolated limestone cottage it was a dream cottage in more than one way though he had never told anyone this he had actually bought it because of a dream over his last few months alone in the eastvale semi banks had drifted so far from himself that he hadnt even cleaned or tidied the place since christmas why bother he spent most of his evenings out in pubs or driving the countryside alone anyway and his nights falling asleep halfdrunk on the sofa listening to mozart or bob dylan fishandchips wrappers and takeaway cartons piling up in an everwidening circle around him in april he seemed to reach his lowest ebb tracy who had been to visit her mother in london that easter weekend let it slip over the telephone that there was a new man in sandras life a photojournalist called sean and that they seemed serious he looked young tracy said which was a hell of a compliment coming from a nineteenyearold banks immediately began to wonder just how long this affair had been going on before he and sandra separated last november he asked tracy but she said she didnt know she also seemed upset that banks would even suggest it so he backed off as a result banks was more full of anger and selfpity than usual that night whenever he thought of sean which was far more often than he would have liked he wanted to kill him he even considered phoning an old mate on the met and asking if they couldnt put the bastard away for something there were plenty of coppers on the met who would jump at the chance to put someone called sean away but while he had certainly bent the rules occasionally banks had never yet abused his position for his own ends and even at his lowest ebb he wasnt going to start his hatred was unreasonable he knew but when was hatred ever reasonable he had never even met sean besides if sandra wanted to pick up some toy boy and take him home to her bed it was hardly the toy boys fault was it more likely hers but reason didnt stop banks from wanting to kill the bastard that night after several whiskeys too many he had fallen asleep on the sofa as usual with dylans blood on the tracks playing on the cd long after the music had finished he woke from a dream peculiar only for its emotional intensity he was sitting alone at a pine table in a kitchen and sunlight flooded through the open curtains bathing everything in its warm and honeyed glow the walls were offwhite with a strip of red tiles over the sink and counter area matching red canisters for coffee tea and sugar stood on the white formica countertops and copperbottomed pots and pans hung from a wooden rack beside the set of kitchen knives the clarity of detail was extraordinary every grain and knothole in the wood every nuance of light on steel or copper shone with a preternatural brightness he could even smell the warm pine from the table and the fitted cupboards the oil on the hinges that was it nothing happened just a dream of light but the intense feeling of wellbeing it gave him as warm and bright as the sunlight itself still suffused him when he awoke disappointed to find himself alone and hung over on the sofa in the eastvale semi when sandra decided a few weeks later that their separation was to be permanent or at least that reconciliation wasnt imminent they sold the semi sandra got the television and vcr banks got the stereo and the lions share of the cd collection that was fair he had collected them in the first place they split the kitchenware and for some obscure reason sandra also took the tin opener books and clothes were easily divided and they sold most of the furniture all in all there hadnt been a hell of a lot to show for over twenty years of marriage even after the sale banks didnt care much where or how he lived until a few weeks in a bedandbreakfast place straight out of bill bryson changed his mind he began to seek isolation when he first saw the cottage from the outside he didnt think much of it the view of the dale was terrific as was the seclusion afforded by the woods the beck and the ash grove between the cottage and gratly itself but it was a squat ugly little place that needed a lot of work a typical dales mix of limestone grit and flag it had originally been a farm laborers cottage carved into the gritstone doorhead was the date and the initials jh probably the time it was built and the initials of the first owner banks wondered who jh was and what had become of him mrs perkins the present owner had lost both her two sons and her husband and she was finally leaving to move in with her sister in tadcaster inside the place didnt make much more of an impression at first either it smelled of camphor and mold and all the furniture and decor seemed dark and dingy downstairs was a living room with a stone fireplace at one end upstairs only two small bedrooms the bathroom and toilet had been tacked on to the kitchen at the back as they often were in such old houses plumbing was pretty primitive back in banks was not a believer in visions and prescience but he would have been a fool to deny that when he walked into the kitchen that day he experienced the same feeling of wellbeing and of peace that he had experienced in the dream it looked different of course but he knew it was the same place the one in his dream what it all meant he had no idea except that he had to have the cottage he didnt think he would be able to afford it properties in the dales were fetching astronomical prices but fortune and human eccentricity proved to be on his side for once mrs perkins had no love whatsoever for the holidaycottage trade and no particular greed for mere money she wanted to sell to someone who would actually live in the cottage as soon as she found out that banks was looking for just such a place and that his name was the same as her maiden name the deal was as good as done the only black mark against banks was that he wasnt born a yorkshireman but she took to him anyway convinced they were related and she even flirted with him in that way some old ladies have when she let him have the place for probably about half of what she could have got telling him it would be enough to see her to her grave dimmoch the estate agent groaned and shook his head in disbelief afterward banks always had the impression that dimmoch suspected him of exerting undue pressure on mrs perkins the cottage became bankss longterm project his therapy his refuge and he hoped his salvation in an odd way he felt working on the cottage was like working on himself both needed renovating and both had a long way to go it was all new to him he had never had the faintest interest in diy or gardening before nor had he been much inclined to selfanalysis or introspection but somehow he had lost his way over the past year and he wanted to find a new one he had also lost something of himself and he wanted to know what it was so far he had fitted some pine cupboards in the kitchen like the ones in his dream installed a shower unit to replace the clawfooted victorian bathtub and painted the living room it hadnt kept the depression away completely but made it more manageable at least he always managed to drag himself out of bed in the morning now even if he didnt always view the day ahead with any real relish a night bird called out far in the distance a broken eerie cry as if perhaps some predator was threatening its nest banks stubbed out his cigarette and went back inside as he got ready for bed he thought of the skeletal hand possibly human he thought of ds cabbot definitely human he thought of hobbs end that lost ruined village suddenly risen from the depths with its secrets and somewhere in his mind in the darkness way beyond the realms of logic and reason he heard an echo a click felt something intangible connect across the years three banks watched from the edge of the woods the next morning as the socos slowly lifted the skeleton from its muddy grave under the expert direction of john webb first they had to take down the wall next to which the bones were buried then they made a trench around the area and dug down until the bones were exposed about three feet below the surface next they slipped a thin sheet of metal into the earth under the bones and finally they got it in place ready to lift out the bones came up on the metal sheet still packed in earth and four soco pallbearers carried it up the slope where they laid it out on the grass at bankss feet like a burnt offering it was just eleven and ds cabbot still hadnt shown up banks had already talked to adam kelly who hadnt been able to add anything to his previous statement adam was still shaken but banks sensed a resilience in him that he had also possessed as an early adolescent banks too had loved playing in derelict houses of which there had been plenty in postwar peterborough the worst he had ever come away with was a scraped knee but a pupil from the girls school had been killed by a falling rafter so he knew how dangerous they could be the council was always boarding them up anyway adams little adventure had done no lasting harm and it would give him stories to tell well into the school term he would enjoy celebrity status of a kind among his pals for a while banks stared at the filthy twisted shape at his feet it hardly looked human the bones had taken on the muddy brown color of the earth they had lain in for so long they were also crusted with dark grungy muck it stuck to the ribs the way a hearty stew was supposed to do and it clung to various joints clogging the cavities and crevices the skull looked full of it mud in the mouth the nose the eye sockets and some of the long bones looked like old rusted metal pipes that had been underground for years the sight of it made banks feel vaguely sick he had seen much worse without throwing up of course at least there were no gaping red holes no spilled intestines no legs cut off at the thighs skin riding up over the raw edges like a tight skirt but he hadnt seen much uglier the socos had already photographed the skeleton during every stage of its excavation and once they had finished carrying it up the hill they went back down and started their detailed search of the area digging deeper and farther afield leaving john webb to give it a poke here and a scrape there webb also searched through the dirt for any objects that had been buried at the same time buttons jewelry that sort of thing banks leaned back against a tree trunk as if on sentry duty kept his nausea under control and watched webb work he was tired he had not slept well after his latenight musings most of the night he had tossed and turned waking up often from fragments of nightmares that scuttled off into dark corners when he woke like cockroaches when you turn on the light the morning heat made him drowsy giving in to the feeling for a moment he closed his eyes and rested his head on the tree he could feel the rough bark against his crown and the sunlight made kaleidoscopic patterns behind his eyelids he was at the edge of sleep when he heard a rustling behind him then a voice morning sir rough night something like that said banks moving away from the tree trunk ds cabbot stared down at the bones so this is what we all come to in the end is it she didnt sound particularly concerned about it no more troubled than she seemed about turning up so late any luck banks asked thats what took me so long the university year hasnt started yet and a lot of profs are still away on holiday or busy running research projects overseas anyway ive tracked down a dr ioan williams university of leeds hes a physical anthropologist with a fair bit of experience in forensic work he sounded pretty excited by what weve found must be having a dull summer how quickly can he get to it he said if we could get the remains to the university lab as soon as possible hed have his assistants clean them up then hed manage a quick look by early evening only a preliminary look mind you good said banks the sooner we know what were dealing with here the better if the skeleton had been lying there for a hundred years or more the investigation wouldnt really be worth pursuing with any great vigor as they would be hardly likely to catch a living criminal on the other hand if it turned out to be a murder victim and if it had been buried there during or since the war there was a chance that somebody still living might remember something and there was also a chance that the killer was still alive want me to supervise the move webb asked banks nodded if you would john need an ambulance webb held his hand over his eyes to shield the sun as he looked up a few of the silver hairs in his beard caught the light my old range rover will do just fine ill get one of the lads to drive while i stay in the back and make sure our friend here doesnt fall to pieces he looked at his watch with any luck we can have it in the lab by one oclock ds cabbot leaned back against a tree arms folded one leg crossed over the other today she was wearing a red tshirt and white nikes with her jeans her sunglasses pushed up over her hairline pretty loose dress codes at harkside it seemed to banks but then he was one to talk he had always hated suits and ties right from his early days as a business student at london polytechnic he had spent three years there on a sandwich course six months college and six months work and the student life fast made encroachments on his dedication to the business world everyone at the poly was joining up with the sixties thing back then even though it was the early seventies it was all caftans bellbottoms and afghans bright embroidered indian cheesecloth shirts bandannas beads the whole caboodle banks had never committed himself fully to the spirit of the times neither in philosophy nor in dress but he had let his hair grow over his collar and he was once sent home from work for wearing sandals and a flowered tie i need to know a lot more about the village he said to ds cabbot some names would be a great help try the voters register and the land registry he pointed toward the ruins of the cottage near the bridge the outbuilding clearly belonged to that cottage so id like to know who lived there and who the neighbors were it seems to me that weve got three possibilities either were dealing with someone who used the empty village as a dumping spot to bury a body during the time it was in disuse between may and august i checked this morning right either then or the body was buried while the village was still occupied before may and the victim wasnt buried too far from home or it was put there this summer as you suggested earlier its too early for speculation but we do need to know who lived in that cottage before the village emptied out and if anyone from the village was reported missing yes sir what happened to the church im assuming there was one a church and a chapel saint bartholomews was deconsecrated then demolished where are the parish records now i dont know never had cause to seek them out i imagine they were moved to saint judes in harkside along with all the coffins from the graveyard they might be worth a look if you draw a blank elsewhere you never know what you can find out from old church records and parish magazines theres the local newspaper too whats it called the harkside chronicle right might be worth looking there too if our expert can narrow the range a bit this evening and ds cabbot sir look i cant keep calling you ds cabbot whats your first name she smiled annie sir annie cabbot right annie cabbot do you happen to know how many doctors or dentists there were in hobbs end i shouldnt imagine there were many most people probably went to harkside maybe there were a few more around when everyone was working in the flax mill very altruistic very concerned about their workers welfare some of these old mill owners very concerned they were fit to work a sixteenhour shift without dropping dead more like said banks annie laughed bolshevik ive been called worse try to find out anyway its a long shot but if we can find any dental records matching the remains well be in luck ill look into it sir anything else utilities tax records they might all have to be checked and what should i do next year banks smiled im sure you can conscript one of your pcs to help if we dont get a break soon ill see what i can do about manpower though somehow i doubt this is a highpriority case thank you sir for now lets concentrate on the identity of the victim thats crucial okay just a thought but do you happen to know if theres anyone who lived in hobbs end still alive maybe living in harkside now it doesnt seem an unreasonable assumption ill ask inspector harmond he grew up around these parts good ill leave you to it and see these bones off to leeds with john do you want me to go down there this evening if you like meet me at the lab at six oclock where is it annie told him in the meantime he said heres my mobile number give me a ring if you come up with anything right you are sir annie just seemed to touch her sunglasses and they slid down perfectly into place on her nose with that she turned and strode off into the woods banks was an odd fish annie thought as she drove back to harkside of course before shed met him shed heard a few rumors she knew for example that chief constable riddle hated him that banks was under a cloud almost lost in the clouds though she didnt know why someone had even hinted at fisticuffs between the two whatever the reason his career was on hold and he was not a good horse to hitch ones wagon to annie had no particular liking for jimmy riddle either on the one or two occasions she had met him she had found him arrogant and condescending annie was one of millies projects acc millicent cummings new director of human resources dedicated to bringing more women into the ranks and seeing that they were welltreated and the antagonism between millie and riddle who had opposed her appointment from the start was wellknown not that riddle was especially for the illtreatment of women but he preferred to avoid the problem altogether by keeping their presence among the ranks to an absolute minimum annie had also heard that bankss wife had left him for someone else not too long ago not only that but there were stories going around that he had a woman in leeds had had for some time even before his wife left she had heard him described as a loner a skiver and a bolshie bastard he was a brilliant detective gone to seed they said over the hill since his wife left past it burned out a shadow of his former self on first impressions annie didnt really know what to make of him she thought she liked him she certainly found him attractive and he didnt look much older than his midthirties despite the scattering of gray at the temples of his closely cropped black hair as far as being burned out was concerned he seemed tired and he seemed to carry a burden of sadness in him but she could sense that the fire still smoldered somewhere behind his sharp blue eyes a little diminished in power perhaps but still there on the other hand perhaps he really had lost it and he was simply going through the motions content to shuffle papers until retirement perhaps the fire she sensed in him was simply embers not fully extinguished yet just about to cave in on themselves well if annie had learned one thing over the past couple of years it was not to jump to conclusions about anyone the brave man often appears weak the wise man often seems foolish after all enough people thought she was weird too and it wouldnt be hard to argue that she had been merely going through the motions lately either she wondered if there were any rumors about her going around the region if there were she had a good guess what they would be dyke bitch annie parked on the strip of tarmac beside the ugly brick section station and walked inside only four of them worked directly out of the station inspector harmond annie and pcs cameron and gould apart from samantha their civilian clerk annie was the only woman that was okay with her they seemed a pretty decent bunch of men as men go she certainly felt no threat from any of them pc cameron was married with two kids to whom he was clearly devoted gould seemed to be one of those rare types who have no sexual dimension whatsoever content to live at home with his mum play with his model trains and add stamps to his album she knew that in books such types often turn out to be the most dangerous of all the serial killers and sexual deviants but gould was harmless even if he liked to wear womens underwear in private annie didnt care inspector harmond was well avuncular he liked to think of himself as a bit like sergeant blaketon out of heartbeat but he didnt even come close in annies opinion harkside police station might be ugly on the outside but at least inside it was a sparsely populated openplan office area apart from inspector harmonds office partitioned off at the far end and there was plenty of room to spread oneself around annie liked that her lshaped desk was the messiest of all but she knew where everything was and could put her hands on anything anyone asked her for so quickly that even inspector harmond had given up teasing her about it annies desk also took up a corner part of which included a side window it wasnt much of a view only the cobbled alley a gate and the back wall of the three feathers but at least she was close to a source of light and air and it was good to be able to see something of the outside world even if there was hardly any breeze these days she loved each gentle waft of warm air through the window it lifted her spirits these little things mattered so much annie had discovered she had had her shot at the big time the fast track with all its excitement but it had ended badly for her now she was slowly rediscovering what mattered in life harkside was generally a lawabiding sort of community so there wasnt a lot for a detective sergeant to do there was plenty of paperwork to keep her occupied make her feel shed earned her pay but it was hardly a high overtime posting and there were slack periods that also suited her fine sometimes it was good to do nothing and why should she complain if enough people werent getting robbed killed or beaten up at the moment she had two domesticviolence cases and a spate of afterdark vandalism on her plate and now the skeleton well the others could wait inspector harmond had increased patrols in the area most often hit by the vandals who would probably be caught redhanded before long and just now the wifebeaters were contrite and arranging to seek help annie headed first to the coffee machine and filled her mug the one with she who must be obeyed written on it then she walked over and knocked on inspector harmonds door he asked her to come in sir harmond looked up from his desk annie what is it lass got a minute aye sit down annie sat harmonds was a plain office with only his merit awards on the wall for decoration and framed photos of his wife and children on the desk in his early fifties he seemed perfectly content to be a rural inspector for the rest of his working life his head was too large for his gangly frame and annie always worried it might fall off if he tilted it too far to one side it never had not yet he had a pleasant round open face the features were a bit coarse and a few black hairs grew out of the end of his misshapen potato nose but it was the kind of face you could trust if eyes really were the windows of the soul then inspector harmond had a decent soul its this skeleton thing she said crossing her legs and cradling her coffee mug on her lap what about it well thats just it sir we dont know anything about it just yet dci banks wanted to know how many doctors and dentists lived in hobbs end and if anyone who used to live there lives here now harmond scratched his temple i can answer your last question easily enough he said you remember mrs kettering the one whose budgie escaped that time she was having a new threepiece suite delivered how could i forget it had been one of annies first cases in harkside inspector harmond smiled she lived in hobbs end i dont know exactly when or for how long but i know she lived there she must be pushing ninety if shes a day anyone else not that i can think of not offhand at any rate leave it with me ill ask around remember where she lives up on the edge isnt it the corner house with the big garden the edge was what the locals called the fiftyfoot embankment that ran along the south side of harksmere reservoir the road that used to lead over the packhorse bridge to hobbs end its real name was harksmere view and it didnt lead anywhere now only one row of cottages overlooked the water separated from the rest of harkside village by about half a mile of open countryside what about doctors and dentists annie asked thats a bit trickier harmond said there must have been a few over the years but lord knows whats happened to them seeing as the village cleared out after the war theyre probably all dead now remember lass im not that old i was still a lad myself when the place emptied out as far as i remember there wasnt any village bobby either too small hobbs end was part of the harkside beat how many schools were there inspector harmond scratched his head just infants and junior i think grammar school and secondary modern were here in harkside any idea where the old records would be local education authority most likely unless they were destroyed somehow a lot of records got destroyed back then after the war and all is there anything else annie sipped some coffee and stood up not right now sir youll keep me informed i will and annie yes sir harmond scratched the side of his nose this dci banks ive never met him myself but ive heard a bit about him whats he like annie paused at the door and frowned as she thought do you know sir she said finally i havent got a clue bit of an enigma then eh yes annie said a bit of an enigma i suppose you could say that better watch yourself then lass she heard him say as she turned to leave before i tell you what happened next let me tell you a little about myself and my village my name as you already know is gwen shackleton which is short for gwynneth not for gwendolyn i know this sounds welsh but my family has lived in hobbs end yorkshire for at least two generations my father god bless his soul died of cancer three years before the war began and by my mother was an invalid suffering from rheumatoid arthritis sometimes she was able to help out in the shop but not often so the brunt of the work fell to me matthew helped me as much as he could but university kept him busy most of the week and the home guard took up his weekends he was twentyone but despite the callup the ministry was encouraging him to finish the third year of his engineering degree at the university of leeds they believed i suppose that his training would come in useful in the forces our little shop was a newsagentscumgeneral store about halfway along the high street near the butchers and the greengrocers and we lived above it we didnt sell perishable goods just things like newspapers sweets cigarettes stationery jam and other odds and ends tea and tinned goods depending of course on what was available at the time i was especially proud of the little lending library i had built up because paper was getting scarce and books were in short supply i rented them out for tuppence a week i kept a good selection of worlds classic editions anthony trollope jane austen and charles dickens in particular i also stocked a number of the more sensational novels agatha christie and the mills and boon romances for those who liked such things unfortunately the majority of my customers though most of the ablebodied men in the village had joined up and put on one uniform or another the place had never seemed busier the old flax mill was operating at full strength again and most of the married women worked there before the war it had practically come to a standstill but now the military wanted flax to make webbing for parachute harnesses and other things where a tough fiber was needed like gun tarpaulins and fire hoses there was also a big raf base about a mile or so away through rowan woods and the high street was often busy with jeeps and lorries honking their horns and trying to pass one another in the narrow space the airmen sometimes came to the village pubs the shoulder of mutton just down the high street and the duke of wellington over the river except when they went to harkside where there was much more to do we didnt even have one cinema in hobbs end for example but there were three in harkside these things aside though it remains difficult to say exactly how much the war affected us in hobbs end i think that at first it impinged upon us very little for those of us left behind daily life went on much as normal the first wave of evacuees came in september but when nothing happened for ages they all started drifting home again and we didnt get any more until the bombing started the following august even with rationing our diets didnt change as much as those of the city folks for we had always been used to eating plenty of vegetables and in the country there were always eggs butter and milk our neighbor mr halliwell the butcher was probably the most popular man in town so we were occasionally able to swap any tea and sugar we might put aside for an extra piece of mutton or pork apart from the feeling of waiting the sense that normal life was suspended until all this was over perhaps the hardest thing to get used to was the blackout but even in that we were more fortunate than many as hobbs end had no streetlights to begin with and the countryside is dark enough at the best of times still that pinprick of light on the distant hillside was often the only thing to guide you home in the blackout we had to tape up our windows to prevent damage from broken glass and we also had to hang up the heavy blackout curtains every night mother used to send me outside to check that not a sliver of light showed because our local arp man was a real stickler i remember the whole village laughing the day we heard mrs darnley got a visit from him for blacking out only the front of her house but not the back windows dont be so daft she told him if the germans come to bomb hobbs end young lad theyll come from the east wont they not by grassington way stands to reason on moonlit nights especially if there was a full moon the effect could be spectacular the hills were dusted with silver powder the stars glittered like cut diamonds on black velvet and the whole landscape looked like one of those blackandwhite engravings or woodcuts you see in old books but on cloudy or moonless nights which seemed far more frequent people bumped into trees and even cycled into the river with alarming regularity you could use a torch if you wrapped the light with several layers of tissue paper but batteries were scarce all car and bicycle lights had to be hooded and masked with a variety of gadgets that let the light through only in muddied useless slits needless to say there were a lot of car accidents too until petrol became too scarce and nobody drove anymore except on business several events made the war more personal for us such as the spinners inn fire or the jowett boy getting killed at dunkirk but the day before gloria stringer arrived something hit even closer to home matthew got his callup papers he was due to report for his medical in leeds in two weeks jimmy riddle had once accused banks of skiving off to leeds to go shagging his mistress and shopping at the classical record shop he had been wrong that time but if he had seen banks nipping out of the merrion centre late that afternoon a new recording of herbert howellss hymnus paradisi clutched in his sweaty palm riddle would have felt vindicated at least on one count not that banks gave a toss he didnt even bother to look furtive as he walked out past morrisons onto woodhouse lane it was gone half past five shops were closing and office workers were heading home banks had driven to leeds behind john webbs range rover and stayed with him until they got the skeleton set up and secured in dr williamss lab which turned out to be the first floor of a large red brick house off the main campus while there he had called the forensic odontologist geoff turner again and persuaded him at the cost of at least one pint to drop by the following morning to examine the skeletons teeth after that banks had watched the lab assistants start cleaning the bones then he had gone out for a quick sandwich at a café on woodhouse lane making a slight detour to the classical record shop he had been gone for about an hour and a half ds cabbot was just parking her astra when banks arrived back at the lab she didnt spot him he watched her get out and look up at the building checking with the sheet of paper in her hand and frowning he stepped up behind her its the right place she turned ah sir i was expecting something a bit more well i dont know really but not like this more labby she smiled yes i suppose so whatever that means more hitech this place looks like my old student digs banks nodded toward the building the university bought up a lot of these old houses when the families and their servants couldnt afford to live there anymore youd be surprised how many odd and eccentric departments are hidden away in them lets go inside banks followed her up the steps this evening she was wearing black tights and shoes a midlength black skirt and matching jacket over a white blouse she was also carrying a black leather briefcase much more businesslike banks caught a brief whiff of jasmine as he walked behind her it reminded him of the jasmine tea that jem his friend and neighbor in the notting hill bedsit used to pour so fastidiously as if he were performing the japanese tea ceremony banks pressed the intercom and got them buzzed in the lab was on the first floor up one flight of creaky uncarpeted stairs their footsteps echoed from the high ceiling dr ioan williams waited for them on the landing he was a tall rangy fellow with long greasy blond hair wirerimmed glasses magnified his gray eyes and his adams apple looked like a gobstopper stuck halfway down his throat much younger than banks had expected dr williams wasnt wearing a white lab coat but was dressed casually in torn jeans and a black tshirt advertising guinness his handshake was firm and judging by the way he lingered over ds cabbot his mind was not one hundred percent focused on science or maybe it was biology come in he said leading the way down the corridor and opening the lab door im afraid it isnt much to write home about despite his name williams had no trace of a welsh accent he sounded pure home counties to banks or oxbridge posh at any rate as bankss mother would say the lab consisted of two rooms knocked into one apart from the long table at the center where the skeleton lay there was nothing much to distinguish it bookcases lined one wall a long lab bench another on it lay various measuring instruments and pieces of bone with tags on them like shopwindow goods still banks thought what more did williams need all he looked at were bones no mess no blood and guts to clean up no need for dissecting knives scalpels or brain knives all he really needed were saws chisels and a skull key and thank god they didnt have to worry about the smell though the air was certainly redolent of loam and stagnant mud there were a couple of posters on the walls one of pamela anderson lee in her baywatch swimsuit and another of a human skeleton perhaps banks speculated the juxtaposition meant something to dr williams a reflection on mortality or maybe he just liked tits and bones the bones on the table certainly looked different now that williamss assistants had been to work on them much of the crusting remained especially in the hardtogetat crevices but the skull ribs and long bones were easier to examine they were still far from the sparkling white of the typical laboratory skeleton more of a dirty yellowbrown in color like a bad nicotine stain but at least the whole resembled something more like a human being there was even a little matted red hair on the back of the skull banks had come across this sort of thing before so he knew it didnt mean the victim had been a redhead hair turns red when the original pigment fades and even many of the bog men iron age corpses preserved in peat bogs had red hair there are a number of odds and ends my lads found while they were cleaning up williams said theyre over there on the bench banks looked at the collection of filthy objects it was hard to make out what they were pieces of corroded metal perhaps a ring shreds of old clothing can you get them cleaned up and sent over to me he asked no problem now lets get down to work annie took out her notebook and crossed her legs first of all williams began let me confirm just for the record that we are dealing with human remains most likely caucasian ill check a few things under the microscope tomorrow do some more work on the skull dimensions for the sake of scientific accuracy but you can take my word on it at the moment what about dna analysis banks asked williams grunted people seem to think dna analysis is some sort of miracle answer its not right now i can tell you a hell of a lot more about what you want to know than any dna could believe me ive had plenty of experience in this field may i continue please do but get a dna analysis done anyway it might be useful for determining identity or identifying any living descendants williams nodded very well and what about radiocarbon dating really chief inspector shouldnt you leave the science to the scientists theres too big a margin for error in radiocarbon dating its mostly useful for archaeological finds and i think youll find our friend here is a little more recent than that now if theres nothing else he turned back to the skeleton the height of the subject was easy enough to determine in this case by simple measurement once we got the bones arranged in their original positions a meter and a half between a hundred and fiftyfour and a hundred and fiftyfive centimeters whats that in feet and inches banks asked five foot two dr williams looked over and smiled at ds cabbot but i cant be sure about the eyes of blue annie gave him a chilly smile banks noticed her roll her eyes and tug her skirt lower over her knees when williams had turned away also williams went on you are dealing with the remains of a young woman he paused for dramatic effect annie shot him a quick glance then looked down at her notebook again go on banks said were listening in general williams explained a male skeleton is larger the bone surfaces rougher but the main differences are in the skull and the pelvic area the male skull is thicker well what do you know annie muttered without looking up williams laughed anyway in this case the pelvis is intact and thats the easiest way for the trained eye to tell williams reached over and put his hand between the skeletons legs the female pelvis is wider and lower than the males to facilitate childbearing banks watched as williams ran his hand over the bone this pubic curve is definitely female and here the sciatic notch he touched it with his forefinger also unmistakably female much wider than a males he hooked his finger in the sciatic notch then looked at ds cabbot again as he caressed the skeletons pelvic area annie kept her head down williams turned back to banks the symphyseal area here as you can see is rectangular in males its triangular i could go on but i think you get the point definitely female banks said yes and theres one more thing he picked up a small magnifying glass from the lab bench and handed it to banks look at this williams pointed to where the two pelvic bones joined at the front of the body banks leaned over holding the glass on the bone surface he could just about make out a small groove or pit maybe about half an inch long thats the dorsal margin of the pubis articular surface williams said and what youre looking at is a parturition scar its caused by the stresses that attached ligaments put on the bone so shed given birth to at least one child williams smiled ah youre familiar with the technical terms some of them go on annie raised her eyebrows at banks then got back to her notes before williams could nail her with his leering gaze well williams went on theres only a single pit on either side of the pubis which would strongly suggest that she only gave birth once in her life usually the more times a woman has given birth the more apparent the parturition scars are how old was she when she died id have to do more comprehensive tests to be certain of that with x rays of the ossification centers the centers that basically produce the calcium and other minerals that make up bone we can make a reasonably accurate determination we can also do a spectrographic analysis of bone particles but all that takes time not to mention money i imagine youd like a rough estimate as quickly as possible yes said banks what do you have to go on at the moment well theres epiphyseal union for a start let me explain he looked over toward annie like a professor beginning his lecture she ignored him he seemed unperturbed maybe this sort of ogling was just a habit with him banks guessed and he didnt even notice he was doing it here dr williams went on at the very ends of the long bones in both the arms and the legs the epiphyses have all firmly united with the shafts which doesnt usually happen until the age of twenty or twentyone but look here he pointed toward the collarbone the epiphysis at the sternal end of the clavicle which doesnt unite until the late twenties has not united yet so what age are we looking at roughly williams scratched his chin id say about twentytwo to twentyeight if you take in the skull sutures too you can see here that the sagittal suture shows some signs of endocranial closure but the occipital and the lambdoid sutures are still wide open that would also suggest somewhere in the twenties how accurate is this it wouldnt be very far off i mean this is definitely not the skeleton of a fortyyearold or a fourteenyearold you can also take into account that she was in pretty good general physical shape there is no indication of any old healed fractures nor of any skeletal anomalies or deformities banks looked at the bones trying to imagine the young woman who had once inhabited them the living flesh surrounding them he failed any idea how long shes been down there oh dear i was wondering when youd get around to asking that williams folded his arms and placed his forefinger over his lips its very difficult very difficult indeed to be at all accurate about something like that to the untrained eye a skeleton that has been buried for ten years might look indistinguishable from one that has been buried say a thousand years but you dont think this one has been buried a thousand years oh no i said to the untrained eye no there are certain indications that were dealing with recent remains here as opposed to archaeological these being what do you notice most about the bones the color said banks right and what does that tell you banks wasnt too sure about the usefulness of the socratic method at a time like this but he had found from experience that it is usually a good idea to humor scientists that theyre stained or decayed good good actually the discoloration is an indication that they have taken on some of the color of the surrounding earth then theres this have you noticed he pointed to several places on the bone surfaces where the exterior seemed to be flaking off like old paint i thought that was just the crusting banks said no actually the bone surface is crumbling or flaking now if you take all this into account along with the complete absence of any soft or ligamentous tissue then id estimate its been down there for a few decades certainly more than ten years and as we already know its unlikely she was buried after id go back about ten years from there hold on this is a very rough guess the rate of skeletal decay is wildly unpredictable obviously your odontologist will be able to tell you a bit more narrow things down perhaps is there anything else you can do to get a little closer to the year of death ill do my best of course but it could take some time there are a number of tests i can carry out on the bones tests we use in cases of relatively recent remains as opposed to archaeological finds theres carbonate testing i can do an ultraviolet fluorescence test histologic determination and uhlenhut reaction but even theyre not totally accurate not within the kind of time frame youre asking for they might tell you at a pinch that the bones are either under or over fifty years old but you seem to want year month date and time the best you can realistically hope for is between thirty and fifty or fifty and a hundred i dont want to appear to be telling you your job but probably your best chance of finding out who she was and when she was killed is by checking old missingpersons files i appreciate that said banks anyway ill need more information about soil mineral content bacterial content temperature fluctuations and various other factors buried under an outbuilding floor then flooded under a reservoir you say thats right ill visit the site first thing in the morning and take some samples then ill get working on the tests he looked at annie perhaps ds cabbot here would be willing to escort me there sorry said annie far too busy his eyes lingered on her pity visiting the sites no problem banks said ill arrange for a car and make sure the socos are expecting you look were already a bit suspicious from the way and the place the body was buried i know you dont have a lot to go on but can you tell us anything at all about cause of death i think i can help you a little with that though its not really my area of expertise and you should definitely get your home office pathologist to confirm this of course well ask dr glendenning to have a look as soon as he can i doubt that itll be top of his list though what have you found to be going on with see those markings on the bones there dr williams pointed to several of the ribs and the pelvic area as banks looked more closely he noticed a number of triangular notches they werent easy to spot because of the flaking and crusting but once he saw them he knew hed seen them before on bones stab wounds he muttered exactly cause of death banks leaned over and peered id say so see those little curls of bone there like wood shavings yes theyre still attached to the bone and that only happens with living bone also theres no sign of healing is there if shed remained alive after these injuries the bones would have healed to some extent starting about ten days after the injury so technically she could have been stabbed anywhere from one to ten days before she died of something else but as i said its unlikely especially since the position of some of these wounds indicates the blade would most certainly have pierced vital organs in fact id conclude that she was stabbed quite viciously more than once almost certainly causing death but please dont quote me on that banks looked at annie cabbot murder then she said well id hardly imagine the poor woman did it herself williams agreed yes unless im very much mistaken it looks like youve definitely got yourselves a murder victim here four annie drove up long hill the following morning to interview mrs ruby kettering it was another scorcher she noted rolling her window down devilmaycare this morning she had decided not to bother wearing tights they were damned uncomfortable in the heat youd certainly never catch men wearing anything quite so ridiculous long hill began at the village green and linked harkside to the edge of harksmere reservoir close to the center of the village it was the busiest shopping street with a jumbled mix of shops and pubs and most of the public buildings including the borough council offices the library the womens institute and the mechanics institute it was early for tourists but the shops were open and the locals were doing the rounds shopping bags hooked over their arms standing gossiping in little knots along the pavement the road was narrow and double yellow lines ran along each side toward the end the buildings dwindled and finally gave way to half a mile of open countryside before the tjunction with the edge annie parked on the grass verge opposite the junction from there she could see the ruins of hobbs end in the distance several tiny figures stood clustered around the outbuilding where the skeleton had been discovered and annie realized it must be the soco team still searching the area she wondered if dr williams the skeletongroper was there too annie crossed the road and opened the gate mrs kettering was squatting in the garden spraying her dahlias she looked up annie introduced herself i know who you are the old lady said placing her hands on her thighs and pushing herself to her feet i remember you youre that nice policewoman who found my joey annie accepted the compliment with a brief nod she hadnt actually found joey herself the budgie had been innocently standing on the village green accepting the crumbs an old man was scattering blissfully unaware that it was being watched by a gang of sparrows up in one of the trees and by a ginger tom lurking behind a bush not more than ten yards away one of the local kids had noticed though and remembering the poster offering a fivepound reward for a missing budgie he had carefully scooped up joey and carried him to the police station annie had simply delivered joey back safely into mrs ketterings hands one of the many exciting jobs she had done since arriving in harkside it was however through this incident that annie had received her first onthejob injury joey pecked the base of her thumb and drew blood but inspector harmond wouldnt accept her injury compensation claim mrs kettering was wearing a red baseball cap a loose yellow smock and baggy white shorts down to her knees below them her legs were pale as lard mottled red and marbled with varicose veins on her feet she wore a pair of black plimsolls without laces though a little stooped she looked sturdy enough for her age oh dear she said wiping the streaks of sweat and soil from her brow with her forearm i hope you havent come to arrest me has someone reported me reported you what for annie asked mrs kettering glanced guiltily at the hose coiled near the front door i know theres supposed to be a water shortage but i cant just let my garden die a garden needs a lot of watering when the weathers like this i dont own a car so i dont waste any on washing one and i thought well if i used just a little annie smiled she hadnt washed her car in weeks either but that was nothing to do with the water shortage dont worry mrs kettering she said with a wink i wont report you to yorkshire water mrs kettering sighed and put a gnarled veiny hand to her heart oh thank you dear she said do you know i dont think i could stand going to jail at my age ive heard that the food in there is absolutely terrible and with my stomach anyway please call me ruby what can i do for you its about hobbs end hobbs end yes i understand you used to live there mrs kettering nodded seven years reg and me lived there from to it was our first home together just after we got married you didnt stay there till the end of the war oh no my reg went off to fight he was in the navy and i went to work at a munitions factory near sheffield i lived with my sister in mexborough during the war when reg came back in we stayed on there for a while then he got a job on a farm just outside harkside so we moved here we always did like the country listen dear would you like a cold drink lemonade perhaps thank you im afraid theres not much shelter from the sun mrs kettering said but we can sit over there she pointed to the side of the garden that abutted long hill a short path led to a flagstone patio where two redandgreenstriped deck chairs sat half in the sun and half out of it various creeping plants coiled around the trellises fixed to the wall which provided a little shade thatll be just fine annie said walking over and taking off her sunglasses mrs kettering disappeared inside the house annie settled herself into one of the deck chairs stretched out her legs and luxuriated she could feel the heat on her bare shins warm and sensuous as a lovers caress the sensation took her back to the beach at st ives where she had grown up and spent many a summers day with her father whose job it had been to rent out deck chairs to the holidaymakers the memory of those summers took her back to rob too his days off when they used to go for walks along the cliff tops sail around the headland in his small boat and make love in secluded coves as the sunset colors emblazoned the horizon and waves crashed on the beach how romantic it had all been and how long ago it seemed annie inhaled the sweet scent of the flowers bees droned around her gathering pollen she opened her eyes again and saw gulls circling over harksmere here we are dear said mrs kettering coming back out with a tray first she offered a tall glass to annie then she took the other for herself set the tray aside and sat down the deck chairs faced each other at an angle so it was easy to talk without straining ones neck hobbs end mrs kettering said that takes me back i cant say ive really given the place much thought in years though i can see it from the bottom of the garden now of course what do you want to know as much as you can tell me annie said then she told mrs kettering about the skeleton yes i saw something about that on the news id been wondering who all the people were coming and going mrs kettering thought for a moment annie watched her and sipped lemonade a robin lit down on the lawn for a few seconds cocked an eye at them shit on the grass and took off again a young woman about five foot two with a baby mrs kettering repeated brow knotted in concentration well there was the mcsorley lass but that was when we arrived i mean shed have been well over thirty by the time we left and she had three children by then no dear i cant honestly say anyone comes to mind the far cottage you say the one by the fairy bridge fairy bridge thats what we used to call it because it was so small only fairies could cross over it i see thats right under the outbuilding mrs kettering pulled a face reg and me lived at the far end just down from the mill still i must have passed the place a hundred times or more sorry love its a blank i certainly dont remember any young woman living there never mind said annie what can you tell me about the village itself well however close to harkside it was it had its own distinct identity i can tell you that for a start harksiders looked down on the hobbs end people because it was a mill village thought they were a cut above us she shrugged still i suppose everyones got to have someone to look down on dont they do you remember any doctors and dentists who used to practice there oh yes dr granville was the village dentist terrible man he drank and if i remember correctly there were two doctors ours was dr nuttall very gentle touch do you know what happened to his practice im assuming hes dead now oh long since i should imagine and granville was probably pushing sixty when the war started too youll be after medical and dental records i suppose yes i doubt youll have much luck there love not after all this time probably not what other sorts of people lived in the village all sorts really let me see we had shopkeepers milkmen publicans we had three village pubs farm laborers drystone wallers van drivers traveling salesmen of one sort or another a number of retired people colonels and the like teachers of course we even had our very own famous artist well not exactly constable or turner you understand and hes not very fashionable these days come with me a minute she struggled out of her deck chair and annie followed her into the house it was hot inside and annie felt the sweat trickle down the tendons at the backs of her ears it itched she was glad she wasnt wearing tights because of the sudden contrast between bright sunlight and dim interior she couldnt make out the furnishings at first except that they seemed oldfashioned a rocking chair a grandfather clock a glassfronted china cabinet full of crystalware the room into which mrs kettering led her smelled of lemonscented furniture polish they came to a halt in front of the dark wood mantelpiece and mrs kettering pointed to the large watercolor that hung over it thats one of his she said he gave me it as a goingaway present dont ask me why but he took a bit of a shine to me maybe because i wasnt a badlooking lass in my time bit of a rogue michael stanhope if truth be told most artists are but a fine painter you can see for yourself annies eyes had adjusted to the light and she was able to take in stanhopes painting she had a passion for art inherited from her father she smiled to herself at mrs ketterings remark bit of a rogue yes she supposed that fit her father too annie also painted as a hobby so she was intrigued to look upon the work of hobbs ends neglected genius is that hobbs end before the war yes said mrs kettering just after war broke out actually it was painted from the fairy bridge looking toward the mill annie stood back and examined the work carefully the first thing she noticed was stanhopes peculiar use of color the season was autumn and he seemed to take the hues and tones hidden deep in stone fields hillsides and water and force them out into the open creating such a pattern of purples blues browns and greens as you never saw in a real yorkshire village but it made perfect sense to the eye nothing seemed to be its true color yet everything seemed right somehow it was uncanny almost surreal in its effect next she noticed the subtly distorted perspective probably a result of cubist influences the mill was there perched on the rise in the top left corner and though it looked as if it should dominate the scene somehow by some trick of perspective over size it didnt it was just there the church just to the right of the river managed much more prominence through its dark and subtly menacing square tower and the rooks or ravens that seemed to be circling it the rest of the composition appeared simple and realistic enough a village high street scene whose people reminded her of brueghels there was a lot of detail an art teacher might even describe the work as too busy the villagers were doing the normal things shopping gossiping pushing prams someone was painting a front door a man straddled a roof repairing a chimney shirtsleeves rolled up a tall girl stood arranging newspapers in a rack outside the newsagents shop a butchers boy was cycling down the high street beside the river with his basket full of brownpaper packages bloodstreaked apron flapping in the wind the rows of houses on each side differed in size and design some were semis or terraces front doors opening directly onto the pavement while some of the larger detached houses stood back behind low stone walls enclosing wellkept gardens here and there on the high street side a row of shops broke up the line of houses there was also a pub the shoulder of mutton and its sign looked crooked as if it were swinging in the wind normal life but there was something sinister about it partly it was the facial expressions annie could detect the smug supercilious smiles of moral rectitude or the malicious grins of sadism on the faces of so many people and stanhope had included so much detail that the effect had to be deliberate how he must have hated them if you looked long enough you could almost believe that the man on the roof was about to drop a flagstone on some passerby and that the butchers boy was wielding a cleaver ready to chop off someones head the only characters who looked in any way attractive were the children the river rowan was neither very wide nor very deep where it ran through the village children were playing in the shallows splashing one another paddling the girls with their skirts gathered around their thighs boys in short trousers some of them looked angelic all of them looked innocent the more annie looked the more she recognized that there was something religious ecstatic in the childrens aspects and the link with the water also brought to mind baptism it was a sort of religious symbolism reminiscent of stanley spencer though not quite so blatant over it all the church brooded with its sense of menace and evil the mill was nothing but a husk annie looked away when she turned back the scene appeared more normal and she noticed the strange colors the most again it was a powerful work why had she not heard of stanhope before in the bottom right just above the artists signature stood the outbuilding where the skeleton had been found next to a small semidetached cottage beside the door a wooden sign announced the name bridge cottage what do you think mrs kettering asked have you noticed the way everyone looks as if as if they were all either hypocrites or sadists yes i have thats stanhopes vision i must say i didnt see hobbs end like that at all we had our share of unpleasant characters of course but id hardly say they dominated the place michael stanhope was in some ways a very disturbed individual would you like to go back out to the garden annie looked at the painting once more seeing nothing that she had missed then she followed mrs kettering outside the sunlight came as a shock annie shielded her eyes until she got to the chair and sat down again there was still an inch or so of lemonade in the bottom of her glass she drank it down in one warm and sweet for some reason the painting had unsettled her in the same way some of her fathers more disturbed works did she wanted to know more about it more about michael stanhopes vision of hobbs end how old was stanhope at that time hed be in his late forties when i knew him what became of him i think he stayed in the village until the bitter end and then i heard he moved to a small studio in london but he didnt do much after that didnt achieve much i should say i saw his name in the papers once or twice but i think he was like a fish out of water when he left hobbs end i dont think he managed to find a foothold in the big city art world i heard he was in and out of mental institutions during the fifties and the last i saw was his obituary in he died of lung cancer the poor man always seemed to have a cigarette hanging out of the corner of his mouth it made him squeeze his eyes almost shut against the drifting smoke when he painted i was convinced that must have affected his perspective probably said annie what happened to his paintings i wouldnt know dear all over the place i suppose private collectors small galleries annie sat quietly for a moment taking it all in bridge cottage she said where we found the skeleton it looked neglected in the painting i noticed that too said mrs kettering and it made me remember something now i cant be certain of this not after so much time but i think an old lady lived there bit of a recluse an old lady you said yes i think so though i cant tell you anything about her i just remembered looking at the painting that some of the children thought she was a witch she had a long hooked nose she used to scare them away i think it was her anyway im sorry i cant be of much help annie leaned forward and touched mrs ketterings arm you have been helpful believe me is there anything else you want to know annie stood up not that i can think of not right now please call again if you do think of anything its so nice to have a visitor annie smiled i will thank you back in her car annie sat drumming on the steering wheel and watching the gulls reflections on the waters surface she had learned that the place was called bridge cottage and an old woman may have been living there in the autumn of of course she still had no idea how long the body had lain under the outbuilding floor so she didnt know whether this new information helped or not perhaps more important though she had got her first real feel for hobbs end from the stanhope painting and that might come in useful farther down the road annie had always thought it important to develop a feel for a case though she had never expounded her philosophy to any of her male colleagues why was it that feminine intuition sounded as insulting to her as hysterical and time of the month she turned around and headed back down toward the station a long day on the telephone looming ahead of her when matthew met gloria that first time i could feel their immediate attraction like that eerie electric sensation you get before a storm when you feel jumpy and ill at ease for no apparent reason it scared me i dont know why something about gloria changed when a man entered the room it was as if she were suddenly on the way i feel when the curtain goes up on one of our amateur dramatic productions and the real audience is there to watch us at last i dont mean to indicate that there was anything deliberate about this just that a change came over her and she moved and spoke in a subtly different way when there was a man around i even noticed it with michael stanhope he must have sensed something too or he wouldnt have given her those cigarettes but with matthew it was the real thing from that first april meeting events progressed quickly between them that very afternoon matthew showed her around the village what little there was to see a few days later they went to the pictures in harkside and then to the mayday dance at the mechanics institute there i was helping out behind the refreshments counter and i could see the way they danced so close together the way they looked at one another i wasnt at all surprised when matthew announced that he had invited gloria to tea one sunday it was the eleventh of may and mother was in one of her states so the preparation all fell to me im sure i could have got away with a plate of sandwiches but i was a good cook and more important i was good at making the best of what little was available and i suppose i wanted to show off my skills all day we had been hearing disturbing rumors of a terrible air raid on london some people claimed that the house of commons and westminster abbey had been completely destroyed and that thousands had been killed i had already learned to take these things with a pinch of salt after all one of the first casualties of war is truth to paraphrase hiram johnson i was listening to the brains trust after putting the rabbit stew on to simmer joad and huxley were arguing about why you can tickle other people but not yourself when gloria popped her head around the door matthew right behind her they were a bit early and mother was still titivating herself in her bedroom glorias golden hair parted on the left tumbled in long wreaths of sausage curls over her shoulders she wore very little makeup just a dab of face powder and a trace of lipstick she was wearing a blue blouse with padded shoulders and puffed sleeves tucked into a simple black skirt with silver buttons down the side i must admit that i was surprised at her restraint i would have expected something far more garish from her even so i felt dowdy in my plain old pinafore dress look what glorias brought for us matthew said holding out a pint of milk and half a dozen eggs i took them and thanked her as soon as mother saw the eggs i knew her eyes would light up she would put them in water glass the way she always did suspended in the clear jelly they would last for months seeing them like that always made me uneasy they looked sinister floating there in the transparent space like wombs forever on the verge of giving birth but never quite managing it trapped there instead frozen forever in stillborn becoming sinister or not though the water glass meant we always had fresh eggs as well as the powdered stuff which was only good for scrambling hello gwen gloria said i should have known youd be a brains trust fan tell me whos your favorite joad or campbell surely not huxley joad why hes the most intelligent the bestread the most eloquent hmm probably said gloria sitting down on the sofa carefully arranging her skirt as she crossed her legs matthew sat next to her looking like the proud new owner of well of something i like campbell myself she said i think hes far more entertaining i wouldnt have thought you even listened to something like that i said regretting my rudeness almost as soon as the words were out of my mouth after all this was the woman my beloved brother clearly adored gloria just shrugged ive heard it once or twice then her eyes lit up in that way they had but youre right if i had a wireless id listen to nothing but music all day long you dont have a wireless i couldnt believe it we might have been short of food but surely everyone had a wireless mr kilnsey wont have one in the house hes rather a strict sort of methodist you know thinks theyre the devils loudspeaker i put my hand to my mouth and giggled then blushed oh dear i am sorry it is rather funny isnt it anyway i dont mind that much all i do is work and sleep there its sad for mrs kilnsey though i dont think shed mind a bit of music now and then to cheer her up but of course if the wireless is the devils loudspeaker then music is his voice at its most seductive oh good heavens said matthew shaking his head gloria nudged him its true he really talks like that i must go see to the food i said first i put the kettle on to make us all some tea then i peeled a few potatoes and prepared the carrots and parsnips if i say so myself it was a good meal i put together that sunday matthew had caught the rabbit in rowan woods on one of his weekend home guard exercises and there was plenty of meat on it to feed the four of us we also had some onions from the garden and some rhubarb for a pie talk about dig for victory the kettle boiled i made tea and carried it through along with a plate of biscuits with rationing you had to be sparing and the tea was a lot weaker than we were used to with sugar rationed at only a pound a fortnight and most of that in the rhubarb pie the three of us had all stopped taking it i didnt know about gloria so i offered her some i gave it up she said actually ive got a far better use for my sugar ration oh i said yes she shook her curls if you mix it with warm water you can use it as a setting lotion that was something i had never thought about my rather fine and mousy hair being short in the pageboy style at the time it must make your head feel terribly sticky i said she laughed well sometimes its hard to get my hat off i can tell you but that can be quite a blessing in the wind we get up at the farm some days at that moment mother made her grand entrance she walked slowly because of her arthritis and her stick tapped against the bare floorboards so you could hear her coming long before you saw her she was wearing one of her old flowerpatterned frocks and had taken the trouble to curl her hair though i doubt she had used sugar and warm water mother never wore makeup she was a small rather fraillooking figure a little stooped with a round ruddy pleasant face it was a kind face and she was a kind woman like me though she had a sharp way with words sometimes whatever the arthritis had done to the rest of her body it hadnt progressed as far as her tongue i expected fireworks when she met gloria for the first time but then i had been wrong about a lot of things lately what a lovely blouse my dear mother said after the introductions did you make it yourself i almost choked yes said gloria i managed to scrounge a bit of parachute silk then i dyed it im glad you like it i can make one for you if you like ive got a bit more put away up at the farm mother put her hand to her chest good heavens my dear you dont want to waste your time making fancy clothes for an old crippled woman like me no what ive got will do to see me out typical mother that the worldweary tone as if we might well see her out in the next few minutes the brains trust ended and a special about jerome kern came on gloria liked that better all the songs she had heard in her beloved hollywood musicals she hummed along with a fine romance you couldnt be cuter and the way you look tonight you could have knocked me over with a feather when mother and gloria got talking about how they both loved fred astaire and ginger rogers in swing time it was time to serve tea and i was feeling really sick by then jerome kern finished and we turned the wireless off while we ate so my dear said mother when the stew was served tell us all about yourself theres not much to tell really gloria said oh come come where are you from london oh you poor girl what about your parents they were both killed in the bombing oh dear im so sorry a lot of people have died when was this last year september im all alone now nonsense my dear said mother youve got us i almost choked on my rabbit its not as if were adopting her or anything mother i managed dont be so rude gwen its wartime in case you hadnt noticed people have to pull together anyway matthew said glorias away from all that now arent you darling she looked at him with those big beautiful eyes of hers adoration just dripping out of them like treacle yes she said i am and no matter what happens im never going back is there no one left no one i was out visiting a friend a few streets away when the air raid came we had no warning my friends had an anderson shelter in their back garden so we went down there i wasnt even worried i thought my family would go to the underground or the church on the corner like we always did in air raids but they didnt make it in time our house went up and the ones on either side along with it my grandparents lived next door so they were killed too we were all silent for a few moments digesting the matteroffact horror of what gloria had just told us somehow it made us and our little rationing problems seem insignificant what made you decide on a godforsaken place like hobbs end mother asked it wasnt my choice thats where they sent me the land army i did my training at askham bryan which isnt far away mr kilnsey needs a lot of help since his boy joined up and hes not getting any younger i was just glad to get away to the countryside i just couldnt stand the idea of working in a dirty smelly munitions factory still said mother farmings not an easy life gloria laughed you can say that again its dirty and smelly too but i can cope ive never minded hard work actually i quite enjoy it she shot me a sidelong glance this stew is delicious gwen i really mean it its the tastiest meal ive had in a long time thank you very much i felt absurdly pleased and struggled to stop myself from blushing but you cant do it like you cant tickle yourself i blushed my pleasure i said after the rhubarb pie which gloria once again was kind enough to remark upon matthew made more tea and we put the wireless on again for the happidrome i just caught the end of a news bulletin which confirmed that westminster abbey the british museum and the houses of parliament had been bombed but only damaged not destroyed still you never knew whether to believe newsreaders or not even though they had to say their names before each bulletin now so wed know the germans hadnt taken over the bbc after all the germans could listen to the broadcasts too and we didnt want them to think we were badly hurt or demoralized in any way we had enough with lord hawhaw doing that for us just the previous week he had actually said something about the germans bombing the flax mill in hobbs end which nearly gave our arp man apoplexy over a cup of tea matthew and gloria lit cigarettes i knew mother didnt approve of women smoking but she said nothing then matthew cleared his throat and said mother i invited gloria here tonight for a specific reason because well we have something to tell you mother raised her eyebrows my heart started to thump against my rib cage we want to get married i gaped at matthew tall dashing handsome that charming lock of dark brown hair always slipping over his eye the dimples at each side of his mouth when he smiled the clear eyes and strong chin and then i looked at gloria saw her radiance somehow it was all so inevitable at that moment i hated her ah said mother after a calming sip of tea you do do you yes and you young lady very much said gloria leaning over and taking matthews hand i know its not been long that weve known one another but its wartime and mother waved her down yes yes my dear i know all about that have you thought though that matthew might be going far away soon weve thought about that mother he said even though i passed the medical ill still have my military training to do after the degree and theres a good chance ill be able to come home every weekend until after christmas probably at least and the rest of the week ill be working at the farm as usual gloria said and matt will be at university in leeds until july then hell go wherever they send him for training i know its not perfect wed love nothing more than to be together all the time they held hands and she gazed at him but we know thats not realistic not yet anyway i couldnt believe it she called him matt how could she he had always been matthew to mother and me what about your studies mother asked him ill be working just as hard as usual hmph a lot of couples are waiting to marry she said until times are less uncertain but a lot of people are getting married too matthew argued making the best of the time they have yes we know life is very uncertain now but if anything happens to me in the forces ill die a far happier man for having been married to gloria even if it was only for a day dont talk like that matthew mother said putting her hand to her chest again then she glanced at me what do you think about all this gwen i swallowed me well i suppose if its what they really want to do then theres nothing we can say to stop them good old gwen said matthew i knew i could depend on you where will you live mother demanded have you thought about that its not that we wouldnt have you but theres not enough room here you know even if you wanted to live with gwen and me we dont even have enough room to take in evacuees and you certainly cant both live at the farm yes said matthew weve thought about that too thats why we want to get married as soon as possible mother frowned oh were going to live in bridge cottage what that rundown hovel by the fairy bridge yes itll be big enough for us and itll be ours well well only be renting it but you know what i mean as you know its been used for housing evacuees since old miss croft died anyway ive talked to lord cliffords agent in leeds and he says that the people there now are moving out next week its a woman and her two children evacuees from birmingham apparently theyre homesick and theyre going home i know itll need a lot of fixing up but im good with my hands and its only five shillings a week what about children have you thought about that too im not having a baby mrs shackleton if thats what you mean said gloria of course not my dear thats not what i meant at all i wouldnt suggest such a thing but if you do have a baby after youre married the childs father will most likely be away and youll have a lot on your hands that sad look came over glorias face the way it did sometimes a dark cloud blocking the sun we havent planned to have children she said not yet anyway i wouldnt want to bring a child into the world the way things are now not after what ive been through then the cloud passed and she smiled again after the war though well see things will be different then mother was silent for a moment then she grimaced as if in pain which she probably was and said youve thought of everything havent you matthew beamed everything mother we want to start having the banns called next sunday please say youll give us your blessing please mother held her cup out and i poured more tea her hand was shaking and the cup rattled on the saucer she looked at gloria again and youre an orphan my dear you have no living relatives none but you did say ive got you didnt you mother smiled only a little one thats all she allowed herself those days little ones i did didnt i oh please mrs shackleton please give us your permission it doesnt look as if ive got much choice does it go on then you have my blessing then she sighed and looked at me i suppose well have to start saving our coupons up wont we gwen love some mornings especially when the weather was good vivian elmsley liked to walk up rosslyn hill to the high street take a table outside one of the cafés and linger over her morning coffee she walked slowly finding her breath came with more difficulty these days one or two people on the street recognized her from her television and magazinecover appearances as usual but the people of hampstead took celebrity in their stride especially the literary kind so no one pestered her for autographs or simply had to tell her how good or how bad her latest book was she found an empty table easily enough bought her coffee and unfolded the times her routine varied some days she found herself thinking about the book she was working on as she walked hardly noticing the people in the street unaware even of what season it was on those days she would sit down with her notebook and scribble a few ideas as she sipped today though the book was much farther from her mind than she would have liked instead she opened her newspaper the brief item she was looking for appeared in a column on one of the inside pages usually reserved for news items from the provinces foul play suspected in reservoir skeleton case in a surprise statement given yesterday evening to local reporters north yorkshire police indicated that the skeletal remains found under thornfield reservoir were those of a female murder victim detective chief inspector alan banks in charge of the case said that while police have not yet discovered the victims identity they do know that the body is that of a woman in her early twenties all indications are that she was stabbed to death how long the body has lain there dci banks added is much more difficult to determine but preliminary information indicates that they are dealing with a twentiethcentury crime thornfield reservoir was constructed on the site of a village called hobbs end whose remains have now come into view for the first time since the skeleton was found buried under an outbuilding by a thirteenyearold boy adam kelly while he was playing in the area anyone with information is asked to get in touch immediately with the north yorkshire police so they knew that much already her hand trembling slightly vivian put the newspaper down and sucked some of the frothy milk from the top of her coffee she wouldnt be able to concentrate on the rest of the news now or attempt the crossword that little item had quite spoiled her day it was funny she thought how time played tricks over the years she had managed to distance herself from the past the years with ronald in africa hong kong south america and malaysia her early struggles as a writer after his death the rejections and humiliations the flush of first publication the slow rise to success the television series before ronald she had thought her life completely blighted by fate what she discovered instead over the years was that while it had been in some ways diminished it had also been far more fulfilling than she could ever have dreamed time might not heal everything but some things just die dry up and flake off of course after ronalds death she had never been involved with another man one might say she hadnt even been involved with ronald in that way but there is always a price to pay and that was a relatively small one far less than the nightmares and the deep gnawing guilt that while it fueled her imaginative flights of fancy crippled her in just about every other way and brought on black moods and sleepless nights she sometimes feared would never end now this she watched the innocent pedestrians passing to and fro on the pavement a young woman in a smart gray business suit talking into her mobile telephone a young fairhaired couple carrying rucksacks scandinavian tourists by the look of them holding hands a man with a gray beard wearing a paintsmeared smock two girls with green and orange hair and rings through their noses vivian sighed the streets of hampstead all human life is here as the old news of the world used to proclaim about itself well perhaps not all not in hampstead at least but certainly the more privileged classes were they all so innocent perhaps not no doubt there walked among the crowds of hampstead a murderer or two vivian gave a little shudder she remembered how she had felt there was someone following her on and off over the past couple of weeks she had put it down to an overactive imagination after all she made her living from writing about crime and the same morbid imagination that made her so good at that also sparked off occasional panic attacks and fits of depression they were two sides of the same coin she profited from her fears but she had to live with them too so perhaps she had been imagining it all who would want to follow her anyway the police surely not if they wanted to talk to her they would approach her directly vivian glanced back at her newspaper folded open at the hobbs end item and sighed well it shouldnt take them long now should it and then what would become of her hardearned peace banks started with brians university administration office and ten minutes later after a few white lies about the importance of the information he was requesting he had managed to convince the assistant to break her strict code of privacy on the pad in front of him was the london telephone number of one andrew jones he paused before dialing unsure of what he was going to say to brian if he did get through the only thing he knew was that they had to get beyond the argument get to some position where they could talk like reasonable human beings still both he and brian had always been quick to forgive whenever they had disagreements in the past one or the other would make a conciliatory move within minutes and it was all over sandra was the one who kept things on a slow simmer sometimes it took her a week of cool distance and moody silences before she let you know exactly why she was upset with you in the first place whether banks could manage reconciliation this time without slipping into the iratefather role he wasnt sure besides he had damn good reason to be irate brian had cocked up three years of higher education which hadnt been easy on banks and sandra financially and then he had bottled out of telling anyone for weeks practically disappearing off the face of the earth as it turned out banks neednt have worried when he dialed the number no one picked the phone up and there was no answering machine next he phoned annie who seemed excited about a painting of hobbs end done by an artist called michael stanhope banks couldnt share her enthusiasm though he was glad to find out she had discovered the name of the cottage by the outbuilding waiting for john webb to call with an inventory of the material recovered at the crime scene he examined the contents of his in tray designs for new uniforms had been approved at a conference of the association of chief police officers fascinating stuff had they nothing better to do what the hell did the top brass think the police force was a bloody fashion statement soon theyd have pcs and wpcs flouncing down the catwalks in seethrough uniforms with feather boas under that was a copy of the latest report from ms millicent cummings assistant chief constable or director of the department of human resources as her real title went north yorkshire had been under fire lately for its excessive number of sexualharassment claims accusations of bullying sexual assault discrimination and bizarre initiation ceremonies and millie had been brought in as the new broom on a broomstick too so the lads had it banks liked millie though she was a bright fair woman with a tough job to do as far as he was concerned the more thugs and yobs kicked off the force the better all around banks turned to a report on tightening up alcohol sales it included an incident report about a tenyearold kid who got pissed on alcopop and rode his bicycle through a shoeshop window minor cuts and bruises lucky bugger which was more than could be said than for the poor sales clerk who just happened to be bending over a prospective customers feet with a shoehorn at the time instant hemorrhoid surgery banks signed off on the reports and memos including one that informed him cid was having its name changed to crime management then he worked for a while on an article he was writing on policing in the nineties one of the advantages of his new computer and his deskbound existence was that he had written two of these over the past couple of months and he found he enjoyed the process he had also given a few talks and lectures and discovered he was good at that too there had been times when he had thought it might not be a bad idea to try for some sort of policerelated teaching career but the cards were stacked against him in the form of his education or lack of it banks didnt have a university degree as brian had so cruelly reminded him the other day he had come out of the poly with a higher national diploma in business studies it was supposed to be the equivalent of a pass degree but only the equivalent and that had been almost a quarter of a century ago as far as he knew such diplomas probably didnt even exist anymore a prospective employer would take one look at it and burst out laughing the thought made banks flush with shame and anger at least brian had got a thirdclass honors which beat a mere pass or equivalent christ it sounded like a poker game was he in competition with his son all of a sudden luckily the phone rang before he could frame an answer it was john webb ive just picked up the stuff we dug up with the hobbs end skeleton he said dr williams lads have given it a good clean what did you find not much after all this time i imagine actually youd be amazed at some of things that do survive its all very unpredictable i found a few buttons and some metal clips that look as if they might have come from a brassiere or a suspender belt i also found some small leather shoes which look as though they might have belonged to the corpse so youre saying she was buried in her clothes looks like it anything else yes some other material black and heavy definitely not clothing any ideas some sort of curtains perhaps did you find a wedding ring or anything that looked as if it might have been one he asked i think so i wasnt sure at first because of the corrosion but thats what it looks like all right i dont suppose theres a name and date engraved on the inside is there webb laughed even if there was i wouldnt be able to read it after this long thought not any sign of the murder weapon most likely some sort of knife nothing like that handbag or a purse anything with identification sorry no just what ive told you and a locket no inscription and nothing inside nothing that survived the years underground anyway if there was a photo or something like that it probably disintegrated okay thanks a lot john no problem ill have it sent over to you later today banks walked over to the window the heat was still getting to him he felt sleepy and woollyheaded as if hed had a couple of drinks which he hadnt the cobbled market square was chockablock with tourists coaches from leeds wigan and scunthorpe cars parked in every available nook and cranny a riot of primary colors all summer the tourist hordes had been coming to the dales pubs hotels shops and b and bs had all done record business of course it hadnt rained in two months and even before that there had been nothing much more than minor showers since april though the health fascists had finally succeeded in banning smoking from every police station in the country banks lit a cigarette he had been quietly ignoring the nosmoking order for a while now in the larger openplan stations you couldnt get around it of course you simply had to go outside but here in the old tudorfronted warren he had his own office with the door closed and the window open who would know what did he care anyway what were they going to do put him in detention watching a couple of pretty young tourists dressed in tshirts and shorts sitting eating ice lollies on the raised parapet of the market cross banks started to drift into pleasurable fantasies involving annie cabbot and her red wellies he had been fantasizing a lot lately and he didnt know whether it was a healthy sign or not officially of course fellow police officers did not sleep together especially dcis and sergeants that was a real nono from one perspective it could be called sexual harassment and from the other sleeping your way to the top in reality it happened all the time all over the country coppers were shagging one another like rabbits fucking away like minks regardless of rank murder scenes in particular got them going sex and death the old aphrodisiac combination dream on he told himself snapping out of the fantasy the truth was that annie cabbot wouldnt have him and he wouldnt try it anyway any facility at chatting up women he may have had as a teenager had deserted him now how do you start that sort of thing all over again he was too old to go out on dates and worry about whether a goodnight kiss would be welcome or a nightcap or an invitation to stay the night or who should take care of the condoms the whole idea made him feel nervous and awkward he wouldnt know where to begin he had had only one sexual encounter since sandra left and that had been a complete disaster in his cups at susan gays farewell party in the queens arms banks had picked up a woman called karen somethingorother or perhaps karen had picked him up either way the beer was boosting his confidence and karen was tipsy and definitely frisky instant lust without much preamble they went back to his place where after only the briefest of hesitations they got into a clinch and fell onto the sofa clothes flying everywhere despite the booze everything worked just fine somehow later they must have crawled up into the bed because banks awoke around four in the morning with a pounding headache a naked woman wrapped around him and a burning desire to be alone he had used karen as perhaps she had used him and now all he wanted to do was discard her instead he lay awake beside her thinking gloomy thoughts until she stirred in the early dawn and said she had to go home he didnt object didnt show any tenderness on parting and he never saw her again the telephone dragged him out of his depressing memory and back to his desk it was geoff turner the forensic odontologist this reminded banks that he had a dentists appointment looming and he had hated the dentists since his school days maybe he would have an excuse to cancel if this case went anywhere alan geoff youre fast any news nothing dramatic too soon for that but i was keen to make a start ive always been fascinated by skeletal remains banks thought of dr williams caressing the skeletons pelvic region pervert turner laughed scientifically i mean go on im calling from the lab what i wanted to do first of all was confirm dr williamss estimate of her age at the time of death hes right the third molars are up thats wisdom teeth to you laymen but the apexes havent quite closed yet nor have the medial sides of the incisal sutures the third molars dont usually come up until your early twenties so theres our first clue then the apexes are usually closed by the age of twentyfive and medials by thirty which makes her midtwenties give or take a year or two thanks geoff any idea how long shes been down there hold your horses i told you ive only managed a quick look so far what few fillings there are seem to indicate fairly recent dental work if thats of any interest to you and by recent i mean twentiethcentury any closer a rough guess by the look of the material and techniques probably not later than the fifties if thats any help are you sure its not more recent like nineties no way you might not believe it when youre sitting in the chair but dentistrys come a hell of a long way in the past thirty years or so and this mouth shows no signs of that no modern techniques or materials and there are several missing teeth could that have happened after death you mean could the killer have pulled her teeth out could he possible but unlikely they look like pretty clean extractions to me she cant have been buried between and this summer if thats any help then id say definitely before are you sure it couldnt just be someone who neglected her teeth its not a matter of neglect alan though ill get back to that in a moment its materials and procedures go on theres not much more to tell really just a couple of vague ideas where would we be in our business without vague ideas turner laughed you shouldnt say that to a scientist its heresy anyway i cant be certain until the x rays but were not talking topquality dental work here and were also not talking regular visits if i had to guess id say this lass only went to the dentists when she had a problem what do you mean asked banks who was beginning to feel even more empathy with the victim he felt exactly the same way about dentists the fillings might have lasted a few years longer had she lived but in one case the decay wasnt quite eradicated that sort of thing a bit sloppy also as i said there are signs of neglect which may indicate were dealing with someone from a poor background someone who couldnt afford the best treatment quite often you know girls had all their teeth pulled out in their twenties and wore dentures for the rest of their lives right thanks geoff banks had always thought that the idea of paying for so much pain was the quintessence of masochism another possibility is wartime really why do you say that think about it most of the good young dentists and doctors were in the forces and there were only old dodderers left poor equipment repairs were hard to get done military got priority over everything right i didnt think of that and theres another thing there is we didnt get the national health service until before that you had to pay for dental work naturally the working class had the hardest time of it didnt they always said banks remembering his father coming home silent and exhausted after long shifts at the steel factory and his mother falling asleep in the evenings after spending her day cleaning other peoples houses so possibly wartime possibly poor right thanks again i owe you geoff itll be my pleasure to collect of course if you could track down her actual dentist if there are still records were trying said banks but it happened a long time ago how long is a dentist likely to hang on to old records even if he is still alive true enough best of luck alan talk to you later banks put down the receiver and leaned back in his chair to think about what he had just heard both ioan williams and geoff turner agreed that the skeleton had not been put there after thornfield reservoir dried up earlier in the summer and dr williams had estimated the late thirties at the earliest so the skeleton wasnt a hundred years old or more it was more like fifty or sixty which meant that if the victim had been between twentytwo and twentyeight when she was killed she would probably have been between seventy or eighty had she lived not only might she still be alive then but so might her killer and so might a witness or at least someone who remembered her this was quickly turning into a real case what had been dug up from thornfield reservoir was no longer just a collection of filthy old bones in bankss mind the woman was slowly assuming flesh he had no idea what she had really looked like but in his minds eye he could already see a sort of amalgam of the wartime film stars in the fashions of the period greer garson deanna durbin merle oberon what he needed to know next was her name that would make her even more real to him he looked at his watch just turned four if he set off now he could be in harkside in an hour or so plenty of time to compare notes with annie five as weddings go matthew and glorias was a relatively small affair a few family members came from as far away as eastvale and richmond some of them distant uncles aunts and cousins i hadnt seen for years gloria had no family of course so the rest of the guests were made up of people from the village mr and mrs kilnsey from the farm were there though mr kilnsey looked terrified for his mortal soul to find himself in the church of england that hotbed of idolatry gloria had also insisted on inviting michael stanhope as they had become quite close friends and he looked almost as uncomfortable as mr kilnsey to find himself in such hallowed surroundings he was sober though and at least he had made the effort to shave comb his hair and wear a decent if rather frayed and shiny suit he also remembered to remove his hat during the service i must say gloria looked radiantly beautiful with her angelic face and earthly figure she had a natural advantage to start with wizard that she was at making things she had decided it was more expedient to buy her wedding dress she had found one on sale at fosters in harkside for two pounds ten shillings it was a simple white affair neither voluminous nor trailing half a mile of material both elegant and tasteful she did however make her own veil out of lace which wasnt rationed whether she had set them with sugar and water or not i dont know but her glistening blond sausage curls tumbled to her shoulders in an even more dazzling array than usual gloria had bought her wedding dress almost as soon as mother gave her blessing so she was all right but wouldnt you know it clothes rationing came into force the sunday before the wedding luckily we had all got used to mending and making do by then matthew dug out his only suit and we had it cleaned and pressed it would have cost him almost an entire half years clothes ration to get newly kitted out mother put on her best flowered frock adding a belt here and a little lace there just to make it look new and she bought a new hat for the occasion hats being one of the few items of clothing along with lace and ribbon not rationed cynthia garmen and i were bridesmaids and we wore matching taffeta dresses made out of some old curtains just for an extraspecial touch i cut up some lace to trim our knickers i dont know about cynthia she certainly never said anything but the things made my thighs itch through the entire service it was the seventh of june and a lovely day with clouds like trails of spilled milk spelling out arabic characters in the sky the ceremony went smoothly the reverend graham conducted the service with his usual oratorical skill and gravity barry naylor matthews best man didnt forget the ring and they all got their lines right nobody fainted though it was exceedingly hot in the church mother shed a few tears there was no confetti of course there being a paper shortage and there was something else different that nagged away at the back of my mind but i didnt remember what it was until much later that night we stood outside for photographs film was expensive and hard to obtain but we werent going to let matthews wedding day go by without some sort of visual record and one of his friends from the home guard jack cheswick fancied himself as a bit of an amateur photographer mr truewell the chemist was obliging and the film cost us only twenty passing cloud cigarettes luckily for us the pictures turned out all right though the album got lost in one of the many moves that came later we held the reception in the church hall of course i had done most of the catering myself though i was able to leave the lastminute assembly to my helpers sue and olive we had to apply in leeds for an allocation of rations and sue who had got married herself just a couple of months earlier had warned me it was advisable to double your estimate of the number of guests consequently i said we were expecting a hundred people even so we only got two ounces of tea which we had to eke out with some of our own ration to make it even drinkable luckily our first american food on lendlease had just arrived in the shop so we had spam for sandwiches and tinned sausage meat which was wonderful for making sausage rolls because you could also use the fat left in the tin to make the pastry there wasnt much to drink but we did manage to get a keg of watery beer from the shoulder of mutton and there was some sweet sherry we had been keeping in our cupboard mr stanhope supplied a bottle of gin and some wine the wedding cake was the biggest disappointment icing had been banned nearly a year earlier so we had to make do with a cardboardandcrepe fake still it looked nice in the photographs the highlight of the reception was the band matthews friend richard bright played trumpet with the victor pearson dance band so we got at least half the band to come and play for their supper gloria and matthew led off the dancing of course and a lump came to my throat as i watched them after that it was a freeforall the music was all right if you liked that sort of thing but i found it all either too noisy and frenetic or too mushy and sentimental i talked to michael stanhope for a while and he remarked on how beautiful he thought gloria looked and what a lucky man matthew was for once he didnt say anything nasty about the war betty warden who had managed to wangle an invitation somehow sat with her nose in the air most of the night disapproving of everything and everyone but i must say that when she danced with william goodall she seemed like a different person so did he for that matter almost human both of them alice hill was cheerful and talkative as ever and i rather think she developed a fancy for eric poole that very night they certainly danced closely together often enough gloria came up to me at one point she had changed now into a long flared skirt and pink blouse with a little sweat beaded on her brow and upper lip from dancing too energetically her eyes were shining i think shed had a drink or two she rested her soft delicate hand on my arm this is the happiest day of my life gwen she said do you know just six months ago i thought i would never laugh or dance again but thanks to you your mother and of course dear matt thank you gwen thank you so much then she leaned forward quickly and clasped me to her bosom giving me a little peck on the cheek it was awkward and with her being so small i had to bend i could smell the gin on her breath im sure i blushed but she didnt remark on it i havent seen you dancing she said i shook my head i dont i mean i cant ill teach you she said not right now of course but ill teach you will you let me i nodded stupidly yes if you want its the least i can do then she excused herself and went to talk to mother and cynthia smiling on everyone she passed with those hardyheroine eyes of hers i did my bit moving from table to table being polite to my distant relations removing uncle geralds hand from my knee without drawing attention to the fact that it was there the local people started to drift home around sunset to make sure they had all got their blackout curtains in place our relations were staying with friends in harkside so they began to leave too before it got too dark to see their way across the fields matthew and gloria went to bridge cottage for their first night together as man and wife whether this was their first time together i have no idea it may be hard to believe now when everyone seems to be very sophisticated about sex but i knew very little of such things back then i had no idea for example what men and women actually did when they made babies the next day they were going to scarborough for a threeday honeymoon matthew had already booked a room at a guest house in st marys near the castle after that it was back to university for matthew with his finals coming up soon and back to top hill farm for gloria though she would live at bridge cottage and walk or cycle to and from work mother was talking to sue and olive at the door when i finally excused myself through tiredness and set off home alone it had been a long hard day though it was late a deep purpleandvermilion glow still lit the sky in the west behind the dark mill the streets were quiet though i could still hear music coming from the church hall behind me back home i made sure the blackout curtains were drawn tightly then weary to the bone i went to bed it was only when i was on the very edge of sleep and heard the thrumming and droning of the bombers taking off from rowan woods raf base that i remembered what had bothered me so much outside the church after the wedding not only had there been no confetti there had been no wedding bells either all the church bells had been silent since and were only supposed to ring if there was an invasion the thing was i hadnt even noticed at first because i had got so used to the silence i thought that was very sad and i cried myself to sleep that night annie paused with the dusty file folder in her hands when she heard footsteps on the stairs she hoped it would be pc gould bringing her a cup of tea so she was surprised when she saw instead dci banks inspector harmond told me you were down here banks said annie turned her nose up and gestured around at the mustysmelling illlit basement room welcome to central records she said you can see how often we dip into our history around here dont worry one day itll all be on the computer when im long since dead and buried banks smiled as he ducked under an overhead pipe and walked over to join her anything yet quite a lot as a matter of fact ive been on the phone most of the day and i was just checking some missingperson files and its a bit of a confusing period for that sort of thing just after the war there were so many changes so many people coming and going anyway most of the ones who went missing seemed to turn up eventually either dead or alive or in the colonies there are a couple of young women who fit the general description still unaccounted for ill follow up on them fancy a pint the black swan annie smiled you took the words right out of my mouth what a relief if she had been hoping for a cup of tea the prospect of a pint of swans down was even more appealing she had been in the stifling basement for the best part of the afternoon and her mouth was full of dust her contact lenses beginning to dry out and it was gone five on a friday afternoon comfortably ensconced on a padded bench just a few minutes later legs stretched out and crossed at the ankles pint already half finished annie smacked her lips if she were a cat she would have been purring i checked the voters register first she said but the clerk in the council office told me it was frozen at the start of the war the last person theyve got listed for bridge cottage is a miss violet croft i had a bit more luck with the land registry violet croft rented the cottage from the clifford estate and the manager kept impeccable records she lived there between the fourteenth of september and the third of july so she must be the old lady ruby kettering remembered the one the village kids thought was a witch the cottage remained empty until june when a mr and mrs shackleton took up residence there it might have been requisitioned for the billeting of evacuees or military personnel in the interim period but there was no record of that and theres no way of finding out i doubt that many places stayed empty for long during the war said banks maybe some soldiers got billeted there killed a local tart in a drunken orgy and then decided to cover their tracks its possible annie gave a slight shiver were talking about wartime banks went on army camps and air force bases sprang up overnight like mushrooms evacuees came and went it was easy to disappear change identity slip through the cracks but people had identity cards and ration books the council clerk told me he said there was a national registry at the beginning of the war and everyone got identity cards i imagine those sort of things were open to a fiddle easily enough who knows maybe were dealing with a nazi spy done in by the secret service annie laughed mata hari maybe anyway what happened to miss violet croft annie flipped over a page in her notebook i dropped by saint judes next and found the young curate very helpful theyve got all the old parish registry records and magazines from saint barts stored in the vestry there boxes of them violet croft spinster of the parish died in july of pneumonia she was seventyseven that lets her out what about the shackletons much more interesting they were married at saint barts on the seventh of june the husbands name was matthew stephen shackleton the wifes maiden name gloria kathleen stringer the witnesses were gwynneth shackleton and cynthia garmen were they hobbs end residents matthew shackleton was his parents lived at high street they ran the newsagents shop the brides listed as being from london parents deceased big place banks muttered how old was she nineteen born the seventeenth of september interesting that would put her within dr williamss age range by the end of the war exactly any mention of children no i looked through the registry of baptisms but theres nothing there was he certain about that do you think he seemed to be you saw the pitting for yourself i wouldnt know a parturition scar from a hole in the ground it could have been a postmortem injury couldnt it i mean these things are often far from accurate it could have been well check with dr glendenning after hes done the postmortem do you know what im beginning to get a vision of st catherines house looming large in your future annie groaned checking birth marriage and death certificates was one of the most boring jobs a detective could get the only positive aspect was that you got to go to london but even that was offset by the departments lack of willingness to grant expenses for an overnight stay no time to check out the shops any luck with the education authorities banks asked no they said they lost the hobbs end records or misplaced them same with the doctors and the dentist the ones who practiced in hobbs end are all dead and their practices went with them records too i imagine i think we can say goodbye to that line of inquiry pity what does your instinct tell you annie annie pointed her thumb toward her chest moi yes you i want your feelings on the case so far annie was surprised no senior officer had ever asked for her feelings before for her feminine intuition banks was certainly different well sir she said for a start i dont think its a stranger killing why not you asked for my feelings not logic okay it looks domestic like that bloke who killed his wife and sailed off to canada dr crippen thats the one i saw donald pleasence play him on telly creepy crippen buried his wife under the cellar cellar outbuilding same difference all right i take your point conclusion victim gloria shackleton killer husband or someone else who knew her motive god knows jealousy sex money pick one does it matter did you ask mrs kettering if she kept in touch with anyone else who lived in hobbs end sorry sir it slipped my mind ask her maybe we can track down some people who actually knew the shackletons who knows where the old residents live now we might even get a weekend in paris or new york out of this annie noticed banks avert his eyes was he flirting that would be nice she said sounding as neutral as possible anyway for what its worth i think its more the kind of thing someone who lived there or near there would do it was a good hiding place i dont think anyone could have foreseen the reservoir or the drought not that it would matter really i mean if adam kelly hadnt been playing truant and larking about on that roof wed never have found out you cant anticipate an accident of fate like that blackout curtains banks slapped his palm on the table come again sir blackout curtains its something john webb told me he said they found some heavy black material with the body i didnt make the connection at the time but it makes sense now the body was wrapped in blackout curtains annie and geoff turner mentioned wartime dental work when did the blackout end at dawn i suppose banks smiled idiot i mean when was it no longer required i dont know we can find out easily enough i suppose either the blackout material was left over which id guess was unlikely because from what i remember my mother telling me nothing was left over during the war or it was no longer needed for its original purpose which might help narrow down the time of the murder even more but i certainly think were dealing with a wartime crime and gloria shackleton fits the bill as victim brilliant holmes elementary anyway before we go any further lets find out all we can about her what was her maiden name again stringer sir gloria stringer right we already know shes about the right age and we know she lived in bridge cottage during the war she hasnt shown up as missing not in any records ive seen and hers was the first name i looked for okay if you can find no trace of her existence in the local records after say then we could narrow things down a bit banks looked at his watch how about something to eat im getting hungry i dont want to eat here again are there any decent restaurants in harkside annie paused for a moment thinking of every restaurant where she had found nothing she could eat but a salad or meat and two veg without the meat then she gave in to the little surge of devilmaycare excitement that tingled through her and said well sir theres always my place after the honeymoon gloria continued to report for work at the farm every day at eight oclock and she wasnt home until five or later on weekends she was at bridge cottage looking fresh and beautiful ready for matthews arrival matthew passed his engineering degree graduating with firstclass honors as i knew he would and started his military training at catterick which wasnt too far away gloria had managed i discovered one evening to barter her needlework skills for an extra half day off work at the farm which gave her the full weekend her local area supervisor would be none the wiser so long as the kilnseys didnt tell and while gloria kept them in mended clothes they were hardly likely to do that most days i was busy with the shop in my spare time i was involved in the harkside amateur players production of a new j b priestley play when we are married so i spent a lot of time in rehearsal despite all this we managed to get to the pictures in harkside together a few times gloria just loved films and sometimes she didnt even have time to change out of her uniform before pedaling at breakneck speed to meet me outside the lyceum or the lyric she always managed some little eccentricity in her appearance like wearing a bright pink ribbon or a yellow blouse instead of the regulation green that summer for the first time we had double summer time which meant it stayed light much later in autumn and winter though it was always dark when we had to go home though it was only a mile or so from harkside to hobbs end across the fields there was no marked path or road and on a cloudy moonless night you could wander for hours in the pitchdarkness and miss the place entirely unless there was a bright moon we had to walk the long way home all the way up long hill and then along the edge careful not to fall into harksmere reservoir because it was much bigger harkside was eerier than hobbs end in the blackout for a start they had street lamps which we didnt and though they werent lit of course each one of them now had a white stripe painted up its length to help you see your way in the dark the same way there were stripes of white paint along the curbsides people had also put the little dabs of luminous paint on their doorbells which glowed like fireflies all along the streets sometimes we accepted a lift with some of the raf boys from rowan woods and we even became quite friendly with a couple of canadian airmen attached to the raf mark from toronto and stephen from winnipeg mark was the handsomest one and i could have listened to his soft smooth accent all night long i could tell he liked gloria by the way he looked at her he even contrived to touch her in small ways like taking her hand to help her step into the jeep and touching the spot between her shoulders if he opened a door for her and ushered her through gloria seemed amused by it all stephen had a high squeaky voice ears that stuck out and hair that seemed glued on like handfuls of straw but he was nice enough sometimes we let them take us to the pictures and they were both very well behaved for glorias twentieth birthday in september i took her to bruntons café on long hill where we gorged ourselves on grilled sausage with mashed potatoes braised butter beans followed by jam roll and custard matthew couldnt be with us because it was a weekday but gloria showed me the locket he had already given her as a birthday present it was beautiful dark gold with their names entwined on the heart and a photograph cut out from one of the wedding pictures of the two of them inside after tea holding our tummies we went to the lyceum to see ziegfeld girl starring jimmy stewart and lana turner it was so memorable that the next day i couldnt remember a single melody it was glorias choice of course unfortunately our tastes couldnt have been more different gloria liked emptyheaded hollywood musicals and romantic comedies with beautiful stars and handsome leading men whereas i preferred something with a bit of meat on its bones an adaptation of the classics say more often than not i preferred to stay home and listen to dramas on the home service where i very much enjoyed mrs gaskells cranford and thackerays vanity fair among others anyway it was glorias birthday she also liked the lyceum best because of the red plush seats and the way the organ came rising up slowly and majestically through its trapdoor with the famous teddy marston usually playing the white cliffs of dover shine on victory moon or some such patriotic tune gloria would have tears in her eyes when she listened to that sort of thing then the lights dimmed and the heavy red velvet curtains parted slowly sometimes alice cynthia and betty came to the pictures with us even michael stanhope on occasion while he often delighted us with his wicked critical commentary on the way home he disappointed me in leaning more toward glorias sort of film than toward something with a bit more substance after all he was supposed to be a serious artist i often wondered what he and gloria found to talk about when they went drinking together in the shoulder of mutton i was too young to go with them of course not that they ever invited me anyway i suppose they must have had long intricate conversations about the deeper meaning of hollywood musicals matthew and gloria tried to furnish bridge cottage as best they could this was before the government banned most furniture production but even then the good stuff was either expensive or unavailable you had to scrounge for the simplest of things like curtain rods and coat hooks they went to auctions some weekends bought an old sideboard or a wardrobe here a dresser there and bit by bit they managed to furnish the house in a tasteful if not terribly elegant way they made a home out of bridge cottage glorias pride and joy was the radiogram they bought from the coopers after their son john was killed when the prince of wales was sunk just before christmas it had been johns pride and joy and his mum and dad couldnt bear to keep it around the house after he was gone gloria honored her promise to give me dancing lessons and i spent an hour or so over at bridge cottage each weekend while matthew read the newspaper after dinner it felt strange having her put her arms around me her body felt soft and i could smell her perfume evening in paris she was a good teacher but with her being so much shorter it was awkward at first having her lead me i soon got used to it i was a good pupil too over the next couple of weeks i learned the waltz the quickstep and the foxtrot i actually tried out my skills at a bonfire night dance in the harkside mechanics institute we might not have been able to have bonfires during the war but we still managed to celebrate guy fawkes night anyway i did very well at dancing and that worked wonders for my confidence by christmas matthew had almost finished his training and there was talk of a posting i asked him if he was going to be a commissioned officer and he said he didnt think so he had been for an interview and was upset at the way the board asked him about what his parents did for a living and how often he rode with the local hunt he said there wasnt much hope of a shopkeepers son getting a commission it was also that christmas at a party gloria and matthew held when i got my first real inkling of glorias problems with men annies place turned out to be a squat narrow terrace cottage at the center of a labyrinth banks left his car parked by the green and walked through so many twisting narrow streets and ginnels by backyards where washing hung out on lines in the evening sun where children played and dogs barked behind sturdy gates that he was lost within seconds why do i keep thinking i should have left a piece of thread attached to the black swan he said as he followed her down a snicket narrow enough to pass through only in single file annie cast a glance over her shoulder and smiled like theseus you mean i hope you dont think im the minotaur just because i live at the center of all this bankss mythology was a bit rusty but he remembered being impressed by an ancient vase he had seen on a school trip to the british museum it depicted ariadne outside the labyrinth holding one end of the thread and theseus at its center killing the minotaur he had even seen what was left of the labyrinth at the palace of knossos on crete where a pedantic guide inflicted with a serious case of synonymitis had explained it all to sandra and him as they tried to hold back their giggles and this is king minoss throne his regal seat his chair of office and they carried her body to the hill the rise the tor the mountain he remembered the olive trees with their silvergreen oily leaves and the orange trees lining the road from heraklion but now wasnt the time to be thinking about sandra he was about to say that he thought of annie more as ariadne seeing as she was probably the only one who could get him out of there but he bit his tongue considering what transpired between theseus and ariadne on naxos it didnt seem like a very good idea he followed annie deeper into the labyrinth her keys were jingling in her hand now almost there she said glancing back at him then she opened a high wooden gate in a stone wall led him through a small flagged yard and in the back door where do you park banks asked annie dropped her keys on the kitchen table and laughed a long way away look its tiny theres not much of a view and very little light but guess what its cheap and its mine well it will be when ive paid off the mortgage you must have been a ds once a dc too banks remembered the early days scraping and saving to make ends meet especially when tracy and brian were little and sandra had to take extended periods off work there were no maternity benefits back then not for dental receptionists anyway even now as a dci it was difficult making payments on the cottage he also had to furnish the place by driving around to local auctions and carboot sales there would be no greek holiday this year at least you get overtime he said you probably make more than me in harkside you must be joking annie led him through to the living room it was small but cozy and she had decorated much of it in whites lemons and creams because of the lack of outside light as a result the room seemed airy and cheerful there was just enough space for a small white threepiece suite the settee of which would probably seat two very thin people a tv ministereo and a small bookcase under the window several miniature watercolors hung on the walls local scenes mostly banks recognized semerwater aysgarth falls and richmond castle there was also one oil portrait of a young woman with flowing preraphaelite hair and laughing eyes who painted these he asked i did most of them theyre very good annie seemed embarrassed i dont think so not really i mean theyre competent but she put her hand to her head and swept back her hair anyway look i feel really grubby after being down in that basement im going up for a quick shower first then ill start dinner it wont take long make yourself at home open the window if youre too warm theres plenty of beer in the fridge help yourself then she turned and left the room banks heard stairs creak as she walked up this woman was an enigma he thought she had a dci her boss as a guest in her house yet nothing in her behavior toward him indicated a deferential relationship she was the same always with everyone not adapting herself to the various roles people play in life he imagined she would even be the same with jimmy riddle not that shed invite that bastard into her home banks hoped he heard the shower start though it was small the cottage wasnt particularly old not like his own and it had an upstairs bathroom and toilet even so he guessed annie must have had the shower installed herself because it certainly wouldnt have come with the original building first he did what he always did when left alone in a new room he nosed around he couldnt help it curiosity was part of his nature he didnt open drawers or read private mail not unless he thought he was dealing with a criminal but he liked to look at books choice of music and the general lie of the land annies living room was fairly spartan it wasnt that she didnt own books or cds but that she didnt have many of either he got the impression that she may have had to pare down her existence at one time and everything that remained was important to her there seemed to be no chaff unlike his own collection where the mistakes piled up alongside the hidden gems discs he never listened to shared shelf space with some that were almost worn out first he crouched down and checked the cd titles in the cabinet under the stereo it was an odd collection gregorian chants don cherrys eternal now and several ambient pieces by brian eno there was also an extensive blues collection from mississippi john hurt to john mayall next to these stood a few pop and folk titles emmylou harriss the wrecking ball kate and anna mcgarrigle some kd lang the books mainly centered around eastern philosophy it was a real sixties treasure trove considering that annie was a nineties woman banks remembered some of the titles he had come across them first in jems room in the notting hill days and he had even borrowed and read some of them baba ram dasss be here now gurdjieffs meetings with remarkable men ouspensky carlos castaneda thomas merton alan watts and old bluecovered pelican paperbacks about yoga zen and meditation seeing them again took him right back to the dim candlelit room with the meltingbutter walls and the jasmine joss sticks to the first time he smoked hash with arlo guthries alices restaurant on the stereo earnest allnight arguments about marx and marcuse changing the system love and revolution with banks more often than not playing the straight man the devils advocate gentle sweetnatured jem his gaunt face always in shadows dark hair spilling over his narrow shoulders his soft husky voice and his unwillingness to kill even the mice that sometimes walked across the room right in front of them as they talked his record collection rainbow bridge bitches brew live dead joy of a toy strange days old days back then banks had spent half his time studying industrial psychology and cost accounting and the other half listening to miles davis jimi hendrix roland kirk and the soft machine one way led to security and what his parents wanted the other led to uncertainty and god only knew what else poverty and drug addiction as like as not hard to believe now that there had been a time when it was all balanced on a razors edge when he could have gone either way then jem died and banks joined the police a third option he hadnt considered before even in his wildest dreams the shower stopped and a few seconds later banks heard the roar of a hair dryer shaking off the memories that seemed to cling to his mind like cobwebs he wandered into the kitchen like the living room it was decorated in light colors white tiles for the most part with chocolate brown around the work area just for contrast in addition to the small oven fridge sink and countertops there was a dining table it could probably seat about four comfortably he guessed banks opened the fridge and took out a bottle of black sheep he found an opener in one of the drawers and a pint glass in one of the cupboards carefully he poured out the beer so it had just enough head on it then he took a sip and went back into the living room the hair dryer stopped and he could hear annie walking around upstairs he took eternal now from its jewel case and put it in the cd player he had heard of don cherry a jazz trumpeter who used to play with ornette coleman but didnt actually know his work the music started with strummed chords on oddly tuned stringed instruments then a deep echoey flutelike instrument entered banks turned down the volume picked up the cd liner notes and sat down to read while he waited for annie abandoning himself to the weird combinations of wooden saxophones indian harmoniums and polynesian gamelans before the first track had finished annie breezed into the room exuding freshly scrubbed warmth i never took you for a don cherry fan she said a wicked grin on her face life is full of surprises i like it i thought you were an opera buff been asking around just station gossip ill start dinner now if you want banks smiled fine with me she disappeared into the kitchen you can keep me company she called out over her shoulder banks put the cd case back on the shelf and carried his beer through he sat down at the kitchen table annie was bending over pulling vegetables out of the fridge the jeans looked good on her pasta okay she asked half turning her head great its a long time since ive had any home cooking mostly these days its been either pub grub or something quick and easy from marks and sparks ah the lonely eaters friends banks laughed it was funny and rather sad he had often noticed how you saw so many young single men and women wandering around the marks food section just after five on a weeknight reaching for the prawn vindaloo then changing their minds going instead for the single portion of chicken kiev and the carton of mixed vegetables he supposed it might be a good place to pick up a girl annie filled a large pan with water added a little salt and oil then set it on the gas ring she didnt waste a gesture as she washed and chopped mushrooms shallots garlic and courgettes there was a certain economic grace to her movements that banks found quite hypnotic she seemed to possess a natural centered quality that put him at ease she went to the kitchen cupboard took down a bottle of red wine and uncorked it want some banks held up his beer ill finish this first annie poured herself a generous glass soon the oil was hot in the frying pan and she was dropping the vegetables in a handful at a time when they were done she added a cup or two of tinned tomatoes and a handful of herbs banks decided to make cooking his next project after he had fixed up the cottage something else to keep depression at bay he liked food so it made sense to learn how to cook it properly now that he was alone about the time banks finished his beer annie announced that dinner was ready and delivered two steaming plates to the table don cherry finished and she put on emmylou harris whose voice seemed to catch on sharp notches inside her throat before it came out singing about loneliness loss pain all things banks could relate to he ground pepper and grated parmesan onto the pasta and tucked in after a couple of bites he complimented annie see she said its not all salads and tofu you learn to be more inventive in the kitchen when youre a vegetarian i can tell wine please annie brought over the bottle of sainsburys bulgarian merlot refilled her glass and poured one for banks plenty more where that came from she said you know id really like to find out more about this hobbs end artist michael stanhope why because you think hes connected to the case well he might be mightnt he he was living in hobbs end during the war maybe he knew the shackleton woman there may be other paintings they might tell us something they might banks agreed though im not sure how far art could be trusted as evidence even if he painted the murder itself annie smiled not technically perhaps but artists often distort reality to reveal the truth about it do you believe that annies eyes the color of milk chocolate shone in the failing light yes she said i do not about my own work as i said im technically competent but i lack whatever it is that makes a great artist vision passion intensity insanity i dont know probably what most people call genius but the true artists reality is every bit as valid as any other perhaps more so in some ways because an artist struggles to see more deeply to illuminate a lot of art is far from illuminating yes but thats often because the subject the truth hes trying to get at is so elusive that only symbols or vague images will do to approach it dont get me wrong im not saying that artists are always trying to get some sort of deep message across theyre not preachers what im saying is that stanhope obviously perceived something odd about hobbs end something that went below the surface beyond the superficial ideas of village life he saw something evil there and maybe something redemptive in the children isnt that a bit farfetched maybe it was just because there was a war coming im not trying to make out he was a visionary just that he saw something a lot of other people would either not see or would gloss over he really looked and maybe he saw something that might be useful to us damn what oh i just spilled some pasta sauce on my tshirt thats all she grinned and rubbed at the red mark over her breast that only made it worse i always was a messy eater i wont tell anyone thanks where was i the artists vision right its got nothing to do with personality in life stanhope might well have been a mean lecherous drunken slob believe me ive known a lot of artists and many of them have been exactly that talk about groups living up to their stereotypes banks sipped some wine emmylou harris was singing about wearing something pretty and white banks thought he could detect neil youngs highpitched warble in the background you seem to know a lot about the subject he said any particular reason annie fell silent for a moment looking down at her empty plate moving the fork around in her hand finally she said in a quiet voice my fathers an artist is he wellknown not really in some circles perhaps she looked up and smiled crookedly hell never go down in history as one of the greats if thats what you mean hes still living i assume ray oh yes hes just turned fiftytwo he was only twenty when i was born does he have what it takes to be a great artist to some extent but you have to remember theres a big big gap between someone like my dad and van gogh or picasso its all relative what about your mother again annie was silent a few moments she died she said at last when i was six i dont really remember her very well i wish i could but i cant thats sad im sorry more wine please annie poured that oil portrait in the living room is it your mother annie nodded your father painted it yes its very good she was a beautiful woman you look a lot like her it was almost dark outside now annie hadnt put on any lights so banks couldnt see her expression where did you grow up he asked saint ives nice place you know it ive been there on holiday a couple of times years ago when i worked on the met its a bit far from here i dont get down as often as i should maybe you remember it was a magnet for hippies in the sixties it became something of an artists colony i remember my father lived there even before that over the years hes done all kinds of odd jobs to support his art he might have even rented you a deck chair on the beach now he paints local landscapes and sells them to tourists does some glass engraving too hes quite successful at it so he makes a decent living yes he doesnt have to rent out the deck chairs anymore he brought you up alone annie pushed her hair back well not really i mean yes in the sense that my mother was dead but we lived in a sort of artists colony on an old farm just outside town so there were always lots of other people around my extended family you might call them rays been living with jasmine for nearly twenty years now it sounds like a strange setup only to someone who hasnt experienced it it seemed perfectly normal to me it was the other kids who seemed strange the ones with mothers and fathers did you get teased a lot at school tormented some of the locals were very intolerant thought we were having orgies every night doing drugs worshiping the devil the usual stuff actually though there always seemed to be some pot around they couldnt have been further from the truth there were a few wild ones that kind of free experimental way of life always attracts a few unstable types but on the whole it was a pretty good environment to grow up in plus i got a great education in the arts and not from school what made you join the police the village bobby took my virginity seriously annie laughed and poured more wine its true he did his name was rob he came up to see us once looking for someone whod passed through one of the occasional undesirables he was goodlooking i was seventeen he noticed me it seemed a suitable act of rebellion against your par your father against all of them oh dont get me wrong i didnt hate them or anything it was just that id had enough of that lifestyle by then there were too many people around all the time nowhere to escape to too much talk and not enough done you could never get any privacy thats why i value it so much now and how many times can a grown person listen to white rabbit banks laughed i feel the same way about nessun dorma anyway rob seemed solid dependable more sure of himself and what he believed in was he yes we went out until i went to university in exeter then he turned up there a year or so later as a dc he introduced me to some of his friends and we sort of started going out again i suppose they found me a bit weird after all i didnt throw out the baby with the bathwater i still had a lot of my fathers values and i was into yoga and meditation even back then when nobody else was i didnt really fit in anywhere i dont know why but being a detective sounded exciting different when you get right down to it most jobs are so bloody boring id thought of becoming a teacher but i changed my mind and joined the force it was a bit impulsive ill admit banks wanted to ask her why she was in a deadend place like harkside but he sensed that this wasnt the moment at least he could ask a leading question and see if she was willing to be led how has it worked out its tough for a woman but things are what you make them im a feminist but im the sort who just likes to get on with it rather than whine about whats wrong with the system maybe that comes from my dad he goes his own way anyway you know all about what its like about how unexciting it is most of the time and how bloody boring it can be true enough what happened to rob he got killed during an armed drugs bust three years later poor sod his gun jammed im sorry annie put her hand to her forehead then fanned it in front of her face ooh im hot listen to me go on i havent talked to anyone like this in ages i wouldnt mind a cigarette would you like to stand outside with me cool down a bit if its possible okay they went out into the backyard it was a warm night though there were signs of a breeze beginning to stir annie stood beside him he could smell her scent he lit up inhaled and blew out a plume of dark smoke it was like drawing teeth he said getting you to talk about your personal life im not used to it im like you in a lot of ways what do you mean well how much have you told me about your past what do you want to know thats not what i mean you just wouldnt think of telling people about yourself of letting someone in would you its not in your nature youre a loner like me i dont just mean now because youre because my wife left me right not just because youre physically alone or because youre living alone i mean in your nature deep inside even when you were married i think youve got a lonely isolated nature it colors the way you see the world the detachment you feel im not explaining it very well am i i think im the same i can be alone in a crowded room ill bet you can be too banks thought about what annie had said as he smoked it was what sandra had said when they had their final argument what he had refused to admit was the truth there was something in him that always stood apart that she couldnt reach and he wouldnt offer it wasnt just the job and its demands but something deeper a central core of loneliness he had been like that even as a child an observer always on the outside even when he played with others as annie said it was a part of his nature and he didnt think he could change it if he tried maybe youre right he said funny thing though i always thought i was a simple family man and now and now im not so sure i ever was a cat meowed in a nearby yard down the street a door opened and closed and someone turned a television on emmylou drifted through the open kitchen window singing about losing this sweet old world banks dropped his cigarette and trod on the red ember suddenly a chill gust of wind rustled the distant trees and passed through the yard annie shivered banks put his arm around her and moved her gently toward him she let her head rest on his shoulder oh dear she said i dont know if this is a good idea why annie paused banks could feel her warm shoulder under the thin tshirt the ridge of her bra strap well weve both probably had too much to drink if its the rank thing thats bothering you no no its not that i dont give a damn about that to be honest as i said the jobs not my beallandendall i still have a bit of the bohemian left in me no its just that ive had some bad experiences with men ive been i mean i havent been oh shit why is this so difficult she rubbed her forehead banks kept silent annie sighed deeply ive been celibate she said by choice for nearly two years now i dont want to pressure you banks said dont worry i wouldnt let you i make my own choices ill never find my way out of this labyrinth alone id lead you annie said facing him and smiling if i really wanted you to go but somehow i doubt whether youre in a fit state to drive its probably my duty to arrest you crime intervention she paused and frowned then rested her hand lightly on his chest his heart beat more loudly surely she could hear it feel it there are a lot of reasons for not taking this any further you know she went on ive heard youre a bad lot not true a womanizer not true they looked at one another for a few moments annie bit her lip shivered again and said oh hell banks wished he hadnt just smoked a cigarette he leaned forward and kissed her her lips yielded and her body molded itself to his then he forgot all about cigarettes six matthew and gloria decided to have their party on christmas eve but first we all went iceskating on harksmere reservoir already there were lots of people around and fires burned in braziers set up along the edges of the ice it was dark and there was something hypnotic about the mix of ice and fire in the twilight to me there was at any rate so i was skating in a sort of trance if i shut my eyes i could see the flames dancing behind my eyelids and feel flashes of warmth as i sped by the bank people started drifting back to bridge cottage at about seven oclock then the other guests started to arrive including more airmen from the base some with their girlfriends alices eric was away in north africa by then but bettys william hadnt passed his medical which didnt surprise me at all so they would only let him in the home guard michael stanhope came dressed in his usual artistic costume including hat and cane but he did bring two bottles of gin and some wine which made him most welcome indeed he must have had a cellarful of drink alcohol wasnt always easy to come by then most of the distilleries having shut down and it was very expensive if you could get it i could picture michael stanhope knowing a war was coming hoarding his private stock away bottle by bottle i hoped he wouldnt run out matthew and gloria had decorated the tiny front room as best they could with balloons concertina streamers and fairy lights over the mantelpiece the whole place had a warm cozy feel with the blackout curtains up especially when you thought of the icicles and the frozen puddles outside there was also plenty of mistletoe and a fake christmas tree dressed in lights and tinsel the only cigarettes we had in stock were pasha and gloria said they tasted like sweepings from the factory floor which they probably were the canadians had some players though so the room soon seemed to fill with smoke mark and stephen had also contributed a bottle of canadian club whiskey unfortunately for gloria john coopers musical taste hadnt extended much farther than opera so the record collection shed picked up along with the radiogram was of little use to her so far she didnt have many records of her own so we listened to the radio luckily there was a victor sylvester concert on that night and soon people were dancing close together in the cramped space matthew had hardly let gloria out of his sight for a moment all day but as the tiny cottage grew more crowded and noisy it was harder for them to stay together couples danced or chatted cynthia and johnny marsden hogged the sofa and kissed one another once i even saw him trying to put his hand up her dress but she stopped him gloria drank too much canadian club and then switched to gin she wasnt loud or falling down or anything but there was a sort of glaze to her eyes and a slight wobble in her step it all got more pronounced as the evening wore on as did the way she held her cigarette slightly askew as she swayed in time to the music i got distracted by an raf radio operator who first dragged me under the mistletoe and gave me a kiss that tasted of tinned sardines then proceeded to explain the intricacies of radiolocation to me i should have told him i was a german spy hadnt he seen those walls have ears posters everywhere it must have been close to ten oclock by then and the party was still going strong i suppose quite a few people were already drunk i had only been drinking ginger ale well i did have just a drop of canadian club but i was feeling lightheaded because of all the gaiety when you had a party in wartime especially at some important time like christmas the fun was just a little louder a little gaudier and a little more desperate than at peacetime parties michael stanhope was holding forth to a young corporal about how artists had a duty to shun propaganda in their search for truth if governments listened to the artists he said there would be no wars the corporal would probably have moved on ages ago had mr stanhope not been topping up his gin every few minutes matthew i noticed was leaning against the wall deep in conversation with two men in army uniforms no doubt trying to find out what military life was really like once the training was over i realized i hadnt seen gloria for a while and wondered if she was sick or something she had been drinking quite a lot i needed to go to the toilet anyway so as gently and politely as i could i disengaged myself from the radiolocation lecture it was cold and dark outside so i put my coat over my shoulders picked up the torch with its tissuefiltered light and headed out into the backyard bridge cottage had two outbuildings one was the toilet and the other was used for storage i could hear the radiogram playing in the dark from inside the house as i made my way down the flags to the toilet suddenly i heard sounds nearby i paused then i heard them again a grunt and a muffled little voice calling out i couldnt tell where it was coming from at first then i realized it was behind the outbuilding puzzled i tiptoed over and pointed my torch at the wall what i saw made my skin tingle even in the poor tissueweakened light i could see it was gloria pinned to the wall by mark the canadian airman her back was against the large v sign someone had chalked there during the summer victory campaign her dress was bunched around her waist and the pale white flesh of her bare thighs above the stockingtops stood out in the darkness i remember thinking she must be freezing cold mark was crushed forward into her one hand over her mouth the other fumbling at his waist gloria was calling out in a muffled voice no please no over and over again trying to struggle against him and he was calling her filthy names when he saw my light he swore at me and took off around the front of the house gloria leaned back against the wall gasping and sobbing not looking at me her hair and clothes in disarray then she straightened her dress leaned forward with her hands on her knees and was sick right onto the garden it was warm and made the ice crack i could see the chalk dust from the v on the back of her dress i didnt know what to do i knew nothing about these things back then and i wasnt even sure what sort of scene i had witnessed except that there was something very wrong about it all i knew was that gloria looked hurt upset and in pain so i did what came naturally i opened my arms and she fell into them then i held her close and stroked her hair and told her not to worry that everything would be all right the birds struck up the dawn chorus first then the milkmans float rattled by and soon banks was listening to the myriad strange sounds of an unfamiliar street through the halfopen window of annies bedroom a baby cried for feeding someone slammed a door a dog started barking a letter box snapped shut a motorcycle revved up everything sounded all the more foreign since banks had got used to the silence of his new cottage annie lay beside him breathing softly she would be silent for a while then let out a soft exhalation partway between a sniff and a sigh there was enough light through the thin curtains for banks to see her she lay on her side curled away from him hands clasped in front where he couldnt see them the single white sheet had slipped down far enough for him to see the curve of her waist follow it up to her shoulders and hair she had a small mole about halfway gently banks touched it annie stirred a little but still she didnt wake banks lay on his back and closed his eyes his only fear last night what almost held him back until that intimate moment in the backyard when his arm moved of its own volition was that he would feel the same way he did when he slept with karen he should have known better he should have known this was different he did know but the fear was still there their lovemaking had been a little tentative at first but that was only to be expected it never happened in real life the way it did in movies with both lovers exploding together in a climax of wagnerian proportions as fireworks burst orchestras crescendoed and trains rushed into tunnels that was pure monty python in real lovemaking especially with people new to one anothers bodies there are disappointments mistakes hesitancies if you can laugh at these as banks and annie had then you are halfway there if you find yourself looking forward to the hours of practice it will take to learn to please one another more as banks did then you are more than halfway afterward skin warm and damp and tangy with sweat she had rested in the crook of his arm and he knew then that he wouldnt wake with a burning desire to be alone just for the briefest of moments he gave in to a wave of paranoia and wondered if this was a trap riddle had set for him a new approach give him enough rope to hang himself were there hidden cameras in the bedroom walls was annie riddles secret mistress were the two of them plotting bankss final downfall the thoughts scudded across his mind like cloud shadows over the daleside then as quick as it came the paranoia was gone jimmy riddle obviously didnt know who ds cabbot was or what she looked like he clearly didnt even know her first name otherwise he wouldnt have sent banks within twenty miles of her banks opened his eyes and looked at the tibetan mandala on the wall a circle of fire full of brightly colored intricately entwined symbols and mythological figures some fearful armed some clearly benevolent jem had had a similar poster on his wall too banks remembered he had said that it was a map of stages you go through to reach a state of wholeness according to jung jem also said people who were beginning to get themselves together would see mandalas in their dreams without knowing anything at all about tantric buddhism that kind of thinking had been one of bankss big problems with the whole sixties thing he thought it was the mark of a brain softened by too much marijuana or lsd in their long arguments about changing the system jem had always taken the view that you cant change the system from within if youre in it you become part of it you become absorbed and corrupted by it you end up with a stake in it maybe that was what had happened to banks but even back then he had never felt fully able to join in especially with phony letsallloveoneanother togetherness annie was right he was a loner he had always kept his distance even from jem maybe if he hadnt jem might not have died annie stirred and banks ran his hand slowly all the way from her hip to her shoulder mmm she murmured good morning good morning i see youre awake have been for hours you poor man you should have got up made some tea im not complaining banks hooked his arm over her side and rested his palm on her stomach easing her closer he kissed the soft flesh between her shoulder and neck then slid his hand up to cup her small breast last night he had discovered that she had a tiny red rose tattoo just above her left breast and he found it incredibly sexy he had never slept with a tattooed lady before annie sighed and pushed herself farther back toward him curved bodies molding to one another skin touching everywhere it could touch banks forgot about jem now he touched annies shoulder gently to turn her toward him no she whispered like this is just fine and it was the other night said gloria the next time i saw her alone at the christmas party i want to thank you if you hadnt come along i dont know what would have happened i just dont want you to think it was something it wasnt i dont know what i think it was i said i felt embarrassed her talking to me like this cold too we were in the high street and the icy wind whistled through my old coat as if it were full of holes which it probably was i pulled the collar up over my throat and felt my bare hands freezing around the handles of the shopping bag foolishly i had forgotten my mittens i was just going to the toilet she said and he followed me out there mark did i know id had a bit too much to drink i didnt mean to but i suppose i might have given him some encouragement he called me a tease said id been leading him on all night things just got a bit out of hand thats all what do you mean i started shifting from foot to foot hoping the movement would keep me warm gloria didnt seem to feel the cold at all still the land girls were provided with warm khaki overcoats earlier in the evening she went on he got me under the mistletoe everyone was doing it i didnt think anything of it but gwen she chewed on her lower lip what oh i dont know men sometimes its just i dont know what it is you try to be nice to them but they get the wrong idea wrong idea yes i was only being friendly like i am with everyone i didnt do anything to make him believe i was that kind of girl men sometimes get the wrong impression about me i dont know why it seems like they just cant stop themselves theyre so strong and believe it or not sometimes its easier just to give in is that what you were doing giving in no i was struggling i was trying to call for matt for anyone to help me but mark had his hand over my mouth maybe before i would have given in i dont know but now ive got matt i love him gwen i didnt want to cause a fuss get matt upset start trouble i hate violence i dont know what would have happened if you hadnt come along i didnt have much fight left in me do you know what i mean i think so i said i had given up on ever getting warm now luckily i was so numb i couldnt feel the cold anymore can we just forget about it gloria pleaded i nodded thats probably for the best she gave me a hug good and were still friends gwen of course after banks had gone annie did her usual twenty minutes of meditation followed by a few yoga exercises and a shower as she dried herself her skin tingled and she realized how good she felt last night had been worth the risk and this morning that celibacy business wasnt all it was cracked up to be anyway they definitely needed more practice banks was a little reticent a bit conservative that was only to be expected annie thought after twenty or more years of marriage to the same woman she thought back to her lovemaking with rob and how natural they had become even when they had been apart for a year or two they had picked up the rhythm again without any trouble when they got together in exeter how could so many people have read banks wrong she wondered gossip distorts the truth certainly but to such an extent perhaps he was the empty canvas people used to project their fantasies onto whatever he was she hoped he wasnt the kind who felt a moral obligation to fall in love just because he slept with a woman when it came right down to it she hadnt a clue what she wanted from the relationship if indeed there was to be a relationship she wanted to see more of him yes she wanted to sleep with him again yes but beyond that she didnt know still maybe it would be nice if he did fall a little bit in love with her just a little bit most of all she hoped to hell that he wouldnt regret what they had done for her sake wouldnt feel that he had taken advantage of her vulnerability or her tipsiness or any of that male rubbish as for the career business surely he couldnt imagine she had only slept with him because he was her boss or because she was after advancement annie laughed as she pulled on her jeans sleeping with dci banks was hardly likely to advance anyones career these days probably quite the opposite for the moment another beautiful summers day beckoned and it was a great luxury not to have to make any more serious choices than whether to go do her washing or drive to harrogate and go shopping she liked harrogate town center it was compact and manageable the cottage needed a tidyup true but that could wait annie didnt mind a little mess as usual there were far more interesting things to do than housework she could put the washing in before she went there wasnt much before going anywhere though she picked up the phone and dialed a number she knew by heart it rang six times before a mans voice answered ray annie is that you yes how are you doing my love whats happening having fun you certainly sound as if you are were having a bit of a party for julie annie could hear laughter and music in the background some retro sixties rock like the grateful dead or the jefferson airplane but its only ten oclock in the morning she said is it oh well you know how it goes love carpe diem and all that dad when are you going to grow up for crying out loud youre fiftytwo years old havent you realized yet that were in the nineties not the sixties uhoh i can tell youre angry at me you only call me dad when youre angry at me what have i done now annie laughed nothing she said really youre incorrigible i give up but one day the police will come and bust the lot of you mark my words itll be bloody embarrassing for me how am i supposed to explain that to my boss my father the dopesmoking old hippie police theyre not interested in a couple of teenyweeny joints are they at least they shouldnt be ought to have better things to do and a bit less of the old thank you very much anyway how is my little wpc plod getting any lately dad lets lay off that subject shall we please i thought wed agreed that my sex life is my own business oh you have been you are i can tell by your tone well thats wonderful news love whats his name is he a copper dad annie felt herself blushing all right sorry just showing a bit of fatherly concern thats all much appreciated im sure annie sighed really it was like talking to a child anyway im fine she said whats julie got to celebrate something i should know about didnt i tell you shes finally got a publisher for that novel of hers after all these years no you didnt thats great news tell her im really happy for her how about ian and jo theyre away in america nice and jasmine jasmines fine annie heard a voice in the background she sends her love her father said anyway wonderful as it is to talk to you its not like you to phone before discount time especially since you moved to yorkshire anything i can help you with like me to beat up a couple of suspects for you fake a confession or two annie fitted the receiver snugly between her ear and shoulder and curled her legs under her on the settee no but as a matter of fact she said there is something you might be able to help me with ask away michael stanhope stanhope stanhope sounds familiar wait a minute yes i remember the artist michael stanhope what about him what do you know about him not much really let me see he didnt live up to his early promise died in the sixties sometime i think last few years pretty unproductive why do you want to know i saw a painting of his in connection with a case im working on and you think it might be a clue i dont know it just made me want to know more about him what was it the painting annie described it to him yes thatd be stanhope he had a reputation for brueghelesque village scenes touch of lowry thrown in for good measure that was his problem you know too derivative and never developed a uniform style of his own all over the map a bit stanley spencerish too haute symbolism very much out of vogue today anyway what could michael stanhope possibly have to do with a case youre working on maybe nothing like i said he just grabbed my curiosity do you know where i can find out more about him is there a book i dont think so he wasnt that important most of his stuff will be in private collections maybe spread around the galleries too why dont you try leeds theyve got a half decent collection there if you can stand the atkinson bloody grimshaws id say theyre bound to have a few stanhopes what with him being local and all good idea annie said kicking herself for not thinking of it first ill do that and ray yes take care of yourself i will promise love come see us soon bye bye annie looked at her watch not long after ten she could be in leeds in an hour do her shopping there instead of in harrogate have lunch and spend a bit of time in the art gallery she picked up her car keys and her shoulder bag from the sideboard and set off through the labyrinth to her car which was still parked outside the section station she wondered if inspector harmond would make anything of that not unless he also knew that bankss car had remained parked by the village green all night besides she didnt care and friends we remained we saw the new year in together linked arms and sang auld lang syne hong kong had fallen to the japanese on christmas day and the fighting in north africa and in russia went on as bitterly as ever as the winter weather continued through january british troops withdrew down the malayan peninsula to singapore though i often thought about what i had witnessed i didnt begin to understand what had gone on against the outbuilding wall that christmas night until much later and even then i had no way of knowing how culpable gloria had been what had mark been trying to do to her to me at the time gloria had seemed to be resisting struggling but when i discovered the act of sex for myself not so very much later i found it could often be misleading that way one often seemed to be struggling and resisting especially during the wildest moments looking back now id call it attempted rape but memory over time has a way of altering its content so i did the best i could to put the whole episode out of my mind i certainly agreed that gloria was right not to involve matthew that would only have started a fight and upset everyone his going away soon would have made it worse too he would be worried enough to leave her behind as it was sometimes though at night in bed as i listened to the bombers drone over rowan woods i would remember the scene with glorias bare white thighs above the stockingtops and those strange muffled sounds she was making that seemed lost somewhere between pain and acquiescence and i would feel a strange fluttering excitement inside me as if i were on the verge of some great discovery that never quite came on the fifteenth of january sergeant matthew shackleton shipped out he didnt know where he was headed but we all assumed he would be going to north africa to fight with the eighth army imagine our surprise when gloria got a letter from matthew in cape town south africa three weeks later of course they could hardly sail through the mediterranean but even so cape town seemed a long way around to go to north africa then we got another letter from colombo in ceylon then calcutta india what a fool i was i could have kicked myself for not guessing earlier they didnt need bridges and roads in the desert of course but they needed them in the jungles of the far east the drive to leeds took less time than annie had expected she parked north of the city center and walked down new briggate to the headrow the place was busy pavements jammed with shoppers all wearing thin loose clothing to alleviate the blistering heat which seemed even more oppressive in the city than it did out harkside way a juggler performed for children in dortmund square the sun dazzled annie reflecting on shop windows making it hard to see what was inside annie put on her sunglasses and set off through the crowds toward cookridge street a little research after her chat with ray had revealed that leeds city art gallery had in its collection several works by michael stanhope and annie wanted to see them once inside she picked up a guidebook at the reception area the stanhopes were on the second floor four of them she started up the broad stone staircase annie had never liked art galleries with their rarefied atmosphere uniformed custodians and stifling aura of hush no doubt this dislike was largely due to her fathers influence though he loved the great artists he despised the barren way their works were put on display he thought great art ought to be exhibited on a constant rotation in pubs offices trattorias cafés churches and bingo parlors he approved of the henry moores standing out in open weather on the yorkshire moors he also approved of david hockneys faxes photo collages and operaset designs annie had grown up in an atmosphere of irreverence toward the established art world with its stuffy galleries plummy accents and inflated prices because of this she always felt selfconscious in galleries as if she were an interloper maybe she was being paranoid but she always thought the guards were watching her from one room to the next just waiting for her to reach out and touch something and set off all the alarms when she found the stanhopes she was at first disappointed two of them were rather dull landscapes not of hobbs end but other dales scenes the third a little more interesting showed a distant view of hobbs end in its hollow smoke drifting from chimneys the bright vermilions and purples of sunset splashed across the sky a fine effect but it told annie nothing she didnt know the fourth painting though was a revelation titled reclining nude according to the catalog the painting reminded annie of goyas naked maja which she had seen with ray when it came briefly to the national gallery in no matter what his opinions about galleries were ray certainly never missed the opportunity to view a great work the woman reclined on a bed in much the same pose as goyas original propped on a pillow hands behind her head looking directly at the painter with some sort of highly charged erotic challenge in her expression bedsheets ruffled beneath her also like the majas her round breasts were widely spaced and her legs bent a little awkwardly placed as her lower half twisted slightly toward the viewer her waist was thin her hips in perfect proportion and a little triangle of hair showed between her clasped legs connected to the navel by a barely perceptible line of fair down there were differences though stanhopes model had goldenblonde hair rather than black her nose was shorter her large eyes a striking blue her lips fuller and redder even so the resemblance was too close to be accident especially the frank eroticism of her expression and the hint of pleasures recently enjoyed conveyed by the rumpled sheets stanhope had obviously been strongly affected by goyas original and when he had encountered the same sort of sensual power in a model he had remembered this and painted it but there was more to stanhopes vision as annie remembered the background of the naked maja was dark and impenetrable it seemed as if the bed were floating in space the only important thing in the universe stanhope hadnt given his model a realistic background either but if you looked very closely you could see images of tanks airplanes armies on the march explosions and swastikas in other words he had painted the war into the background it was subtle the images didnt jump right out at you and dominate the work but they were there and when you looked closely you couldnt ignore them eroticism and weapons of mass destruction make of it what you would annie glanced at the note on the wall beside the painting then she stepped back with a gasp that made one of the custodians look up from his newspaper everything all right miss he called out annie put her hand over her heart what yes oh yes sorry he eyed her suspiciously and went back to his paper annie looked again it wasnt mentioned in the catalog but there it was plain as day below reclining nude a subtitle gloria autumn seven on monday morning banks looked again at the postcard reproduction of reclining nude gloria autumn that lay on his desk it was an uncanny and disconcerting experience to see an artists impression of the flesh that had probably once clothed the filthcovered bones they found last week and to feel aroused by looking at it banks felt an exciting flush of adolescent guilt the same as he had on looking at his first pictures of naked women in swank or mayfair annie had picked up several copies of the postcard at the art gallery and thrilled by her discovery phoned him late on saturday afternoon they met for dinner at cocketts hotel in hawes with every intention of going their separate ways later both having agreed that they shouldnt rush things that they needed their time alone after the second bottle of wine though instead of leaving they took a room and woke to sundaymorning church bells after a leisurely breakfast they left agreeing to restrict their trysts to weekends at home banks had tried to reach brian all weekend without any luck he knew he should call sandra and find out what she had to say about it all but he didnt want to maybe it was something to do with sleeping with annie or maybe not but he didnt think he could handle talking to sandra he spent the rest of sunday reading the papers and doing odd jobs around the cottage he walked over to stand by the open window the gold hands against the blue face of the church clock stood at a quarter to eleven horns blared out in the street and the smell of fresh bread from the bakery mingled with the exhaust fumes an irate van driver swore at a tourist the tourist swore back and scurried off into the crowd another coach pulled up in the cobbled market square and disgorged its load of old ladies from worthing banks noticed by the sign painted on the side worthing why couldnt the old biddies stay down there maybe roll up their skirts and go for a paddle stop and smell the seaweed why did everyone have to come to the bloody dales when it came right down to it he blamed james herriot if they hadnt done that damn series on television the place would be empty banks lit a proscribed cigarette and wondered not for the first time this past year why he bothered with the job there had been plenty of occasions when he felt like packing it all in at first he hadnt done so because he simply couldnt be bothered as long as people left him alone it didnt really matter he knew he wasnt working up to par even on desk duties but he didnt give a damn it was easy enough to show up and push paper around without enthusiasm or to play computer games the truth was that he hurt so much after sandra left that everything else seemed meaningless then when he bought the cottage and started pulling himself together or at least managing to distance himself a bit from the pain he seriously considered a career change but he couldnt think of anything else he was qualified for or even wanted to do he was too young to retire and he had no desire whatsoever to go into security work or a private detective agency lack of formal education had closed most other paths to him so he stuck with it now though partly because of this dirty pointless deadend case or so jimmy riddle must have seen it banks was finally getting back to some sense of why he had joined in the first place when something becomes routine mechanical when youre just going through the motions you have to dig down and find out what it was that you loved about it in the first place what drew you to it or what obsessed you about it then you have to act on that and to hell with all the rest banks had cast his memory back and thought about those questions a lot over the past few months it wasnt simply a matter of why he walked in the recruiting center that day asked for information and then followed up on it a week later he had done that partly because of his disenchantment with the bohemian scene after jems death partly because he hated business studies and partly to piss off his parents he and sandra knew they were serious about one another by then too they wanted to get married start a family and he would need a steady job with banks it wasnt some abstract notion of justice or being on the side of good and putting the bad guys away he wasnt naive enough to see the police as good for a start or even all criminals as bad some people were driven to crime through desperation of one kind or another some were so damaged inside that they were unable to make a choice when it came right down to it banks believed that most violent criminals were bullies and ever since he was a kid he had detested bullies at school he had always stuck up for the weaker kids against the bullies even though he wasnt especially big or tough he got frequent black eyes and bloody noses for his trouble in some way it all came together with mick slack fifthform bully two years older and six inches taller than banks one day in the schoolyard for no reason slack started pushing and shoving a kid called graham marshall marshall was in bankss class and was always a bright quiet shy kid the sort the others taunted by calling him a puff and a pansy but mostly left alone when banks stepped in slack pushed him instead and a skirmish followed more by speed and stealth banks managed to wind slack and knock him to the tarmac before the teacher came out and stopped it slack swore vengeance but he never got the chance he was killed two days later on his way to play for the school rugby team when his motorbike ran smack into a brick wall the strangest thing was though that about six months later graham marshall disappeared and was never seen again police detectives came and questioned everyone in his class asking if they had seen any strangers hanging around the school or if graham had told them about anyone suspicious anyone who was bothering him nobody had banks felt especially impotent at being so useless to the police and he remembered that feeling years later when he was on the other side of the interview table watching witnesses flounder as they tried to remember details the theory was that graham had been abducted by a child molester and his body buried in some forest miles away that made three deaths banks had been exposed to as an adolescent including phil simpkins who had swung onto the sharp iron railings but it was the ultimate mystery of graham marshalls disappearance that haunted him most of all until jems death some years later and in a way it was his curiosity and unaccountable feelings of guilt over it that were behind his decision to join the police years later all the petty duties and details of a policemans job aside bankss obsession was with bringing down as many bullies as possible when the victims were dead of course he couldnt defend them but he could damn well find out what had happened to them and bring the bullies to justice it wasnt foolproof it didnt always work but it was all he had that was what he had to get back to or he might as well pack it all in and join group or some other private security outfit he went back to his desk and sat down as he looked at glorias pose again beautiful erotic sensual playful but also challenging mocking as if she knew some sort of secret about the artist or shared one with him he felt that in this case he was needed as much as ever he was convinced that gloria shackleton was the victim they had found buried at hobbs end and he wanted to know what she was like what had happened to her and why no one had reported her missing did people just think she had vanished into space been abducted by aliens or something the bully who had killed her might well be dead but that didnt matter a damn to banks he needed to know dr glendennings call cut into his thoughts ah banks he said glad i caught you in youre very lucky i happened to be in leeds you know otherwise you could have whistled for your postmortem there are plenty of fresh cadavers craving my expert attention im sure there are my apologies i promise to do better in the future i should hope so what have you got nothing much to add to what dr williams told you im afraid she was stabbed then oh yes and viciously too how many times fourteen or fifteen as far as i can tell i wouldnt swear to that of course given the condition of the skeleton and the time that has elapsed since death is that what killed her what do you think i am laddie a miracle worker its not possible to say what killed her though the knife wounds would have done the trick judging from the angles and positions of the nicks the blade would almost certainly have pierced several vital organs did you find evidence of any other injury patience laddie thats what im getting to if youll slow down and give me the chance its all that caffeine you know too much coffee try a nice herbal tea for a change ill do that tomorrow but tell me now i found possible and i stress possible signs of manual strangulation strangulation thats what i said and stop echoing me if i needed a bloody parrot id buy one im going by the hyoid bones in the throat now these are very fragile bones almost always broken during manual strangulation but i say its only possible because the damage could have occurred over time due to other causes the weight of all that earth and water for example i must say though the skeleton was in remarkable condition considering where its been for so long would that make it more probable than possible whats the difference when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth sir arthur conan doyle glendenning sighed theatrically and to think that fellow was a doctor all right shall we say its certainly not impossible and even quite likely that the poor woman was strangled is that clear enough for you before she was stabbed how would i know that honestly banks you either have an overinflated opinion of the medical profession or youre being just plain bloodyminded knowing you id bet on the latter but let us just for once be reasonable about this shall we and apply a little logic by all means my my youre grumpy this morning arent you doc aye its what happens when my own doctor tells me to lay off the coffee and ive told you before not to call me doc its disrespectful now listen the way this poor woman was stabbed stopped just short of chopping her into little pieces it would seem very unlikely to me not impossible but very improbable if you like that her killer felt any need to strangle her after he had done this the degree of rage involved would probably have left him quite exhausted for a start not to mention the anger vented the almost postcoital relaxation some killers feel after perpetrating extremely violent acts so id say the strangulation came first and then for whatever reason the stabbing that kind of thing is statistically more common too so why the stabbing to make sure she was dead i doubt it though its true she may have still been alive after the strangulation may just have lost consciousness as i said were dealing with anger with rage here thats the only explanation in the vernacular whoever did it got carried away with killing literally saw red either that or he knew exactly what he was doing and he enjoyed himself he again statistically more likely though i wouldnt rule out a strong woman but you know as well as i do banks that these sorts of things are usually lustrelated either that or they stem from very strong passions such as jealousy revenge obsession greed and the like i suppose it could have been a wronged wife or a woman spurned a lesbian relationship gone wrong but statistically speaking its men who do these things i hesitate to do your job for you but i dont think youre dealing with a runofthemill sort of crime it doesnt look like a murder committed during a robbery or to cover up a secret of course murderers can be damnably clever sometimes and disguise one sort of crime to look like another fault of all these detective novels if you ask me right said banks scrawling away on the pad hed pulled in front of him that was the trouble with computers it was bloody awkward to write on them when you were speaking on the telephone what about the parturition marks thats exactly what they are in my opinion so theres no chance that they were also caused by the knife or by time well theres always a chance that something else could have caused them some animal friction from a small stone or pebble or suchlike though given where she was found i say we can pretty much exclude the chance of scavenger activity after so long though its impossible to be a hundred percent sure about anything but judging by the distinctive position and appearance id say theyre parturition marks the woman had a baby banks theres no saying when of course okay said banks thanks very much doc glendenning snorted and hung up all through february and march day after day i followed the news reports they were censored and incomplete of course but i read about the estimated sixty thousand british taken prisoner at singapore and about the fighting near the sittang river from where matthew wrote gloria another letter telling her how things were pretty dull and safe really and not to worry clearly its not only governments that lie during wartime then on the eighth of march we heard about the fall of rangoon our morale at home was pretty low too in april the germans gave up all pretense of bombing military and industrial targets and started bombing cities of great architectural beauty such as bath norwich and york which was getting very close to home i remembered when leeds only about thirty miles away had its worst raid of the war about a month before gloria arrived matthew and i took the train in the next day to see what it looked like the city museum right at the corner of park row and bond street had taken a direct hit and all the stuffed lions and tigers we had thrilled over on childhood visits hung in the overhead tram wires like creatures thrown from an outofcontrol carousel i wanted to go and see the damage in york but mrs shipley our stationmaster told me york station had been bombed so no trains were allowed in at least she was able to assure me that they hadnt destroyed the minster it was a miserable spring though we had the sunniest april in forty years there were the usual random shortages items simply disappeared from the shelves for weeks on end one week you couldnt get fish for love or money the next it was poultry in february soap was rationed to sixteen ounces every four weeks the civilian petrol ration was cut out completely in march which meant no more motoring for pleasure we still managed to retain a small petrol ration though because we needed the van to make pickups from wholesalers i followed the news far more closely than i had before scouring all the newspapers from the times and the news chronicle to the daily mirror the minute they came in on the first train cutting out articles and pasting them into a scrapbook spending hours tracing meandering rivers and crooked coastlines in the atlas even so i never managed to get a true picture of what life was like for matthew out there i could imagine it from my reading of rudyard kipling and somerset maugham but that was the best i could do i wrote to him every day which was probably more often than gloria did she was never much of a letter writer matthew didnt write back that often but when he did he would always assure us he was well mostly he complained about the monsoons and the humid jungle heat the insects and the dreadful terrain he never said anything directly about fighting and killing so for a long time we didnt even know if he had been in battle once though he wrote that boredom seemed the greatest enemy long stretches of boredom relieved only by the occasional brief skirmish was the way he put it somehow i had the idea that these brief skirmishes were a good deal more dangerous and terrifying than the boredom as time passed we got used to matthews absence and enjoyed what we could of him through his letters gloria would read bits from his to her no doubt missing out all the embarrassing loveydovey stuff and i would read from his to me sometimes i sensed she was jealous because he wrote to me more about ideas and books and philosophy and to her mostly about daytoday things like food and mosquitoes and blisters that september pride and prejudice with laurence olivier and greer garson finally came to the lyceum gloria had just had a tooth extracted by old granville after suffering toothache for several days i told her i thought it was a crime the prices he charged for such poor work but she countered that brenchley in harkside a notorious butcher was even more expensive as usual granville did more damage than good and poor gloria had been bleeding from the torn gum for over a day she was just beginning to feel a little better and i managed to persuade her to come to the pictures with me as it turned out she actually admitted to enjoying the film that shouldnt have surprised me it wasnt exactly the sharpwitted ironic jane austen i knew from the books it was far more romantic still it made a nice change from all the silly comedies and musicals she had been dragging me to see lately double summer time made it easy for us to see our way across the fields that night it was a beautiful autumn evening tinged with smoky green and golden light the kind of evening when i used to go out and enjoy the stubbleburning just after dark before the war when you could smell the acrid sweet smoke drifting in the air over the fields and see the little fires stretched out for miles along the horizon sadly there was no stubbleburning in the war we didnt want the germans to know where our empty fields were this evening was almost as beautiful even without the smoke and the little fires i could see the purple heather darkening on the distant moortops to the west hear the night birds call smell clean hayscented air and feel the dry grass swish against my bare legs as i walked despite the ravages of war and matthews being far away i felt as deeply content as i had ever been at that moment yet as we came down toward the fairy bridge in the gathering darkness i felt that chilling shudder of apprehension as if a goose had stepped over my grave as mother would have said gloria arm linked in mine was chatting on and on about how handsome laurence olivier was and she obviously didnt notice so i let it go by as the weeks passed i tried to dismiss the feeling but it had a way of creeping back there was plenty to rejoice about i told myself matthew continued to write regularly and assured us he was doing well the red army seemed to be making gains at stalingrad and the tide had turned in north africa but after the victory at el alamein that november when i lay on my bed and listened to the church bells ring for the first time in years all i could do was cry because matthew had had no bells at his wedding first off annie told banks over the phone later that day i can find no official record of gloria shackleton at all after the wedding notice in theres no missingpersons report in our files and no death notice anywhere the harkside chronicle by the way suspended publication between and because of paper shortages so thats no use as a source theres always the yorkshire post of course if they took any interest in the harkside area anyway it looks as if she disappeared from the face of the earth did you check with immigration banks asked yes nothing okay go on well i was able to dig up a bit more about her life at hobbs end most of it pieced together from the parish magazine shes first mentioned in the may issue welcomed to the parish as a member of the womens land army assigned to work at a place called top hill farm just outside the village top hill farm did you find out who owned the place i did it was a mr frederick kilnsey and his wife edith they had one son called joseph who was called up thats why they got gloria apparently it wasnt a very big farm just a few cows poultry sheep and a couple of acres of land anyway joseph didnt come back killed at el alamein by then gloria was living at bridge cottage still working for the kilnseys yes i suppose it was a mutually convenient arrangement they needed her especially with joseph dead and she could live at bridge cottage and stay close to what family she had in hobbs end all this from the parish magazine well im embroidering just a little but its remarkably informative dont you think i mean its easy enough to joke about how petty the news items they publish are at the time you know like farmer jones loses sheep in winter storm but when youre looking back into something like this its a real treasure trove unfortunately they also stopped publication early in paper shortage again pity go on thats about it really gloria married the shackletons eldest child matthew he was twentyone and she was nineteen he had a younger sister called gwynneth i assume she was the same one who witnessed the marriage what became of her she was still around in the last issue march as far as i know wrote a little piece on growing your own onions in fact how fascinating what about matthew the last time he was mentioned he was shipping overseas where didnt say secret i suppose any idea where any of these people moved when they cleared out of hobbs end no but i did ring ruby kettering she knows two people still living who lived in hobbs end during the war theres betty goodall who lives in edinburgh and alice poole in scarborough she thinks theyd be thrilled to talk to us okay look ive decided to send ds hatchley to saint catherines house tomorrow which do you fancy edinburgh or scarborough doesnt matter to me anythings better than checking birth death and marriage records ill toss for it heads or tails how can i trust you over the telephone trust me heads or tails this is crazy heads annie paused a moment and heard a sound like a coin clinking on a metal desk she smiled to herself insane banks came back on it was heads your choice i told you it doesnt really matter ill take scarborough though if you insist i like the seaside there and its not as far to drive okay if i get an earlyenough start i can be up to edinburgh and back by early evening plenty of time for us to compare notes id like to get something on tonights news first like what i want to put glorias name out there see if anything comes back i know we might be jumping the gun but you never know weve got no idea what happened to the shackletons and gloria may have had family in london who are still alive they might know what happened to her or if were wrong about it all she might drop by the station herself and let us know shes still alive annie laughed right anyway ill try local television that way i can get them to show the postcard what nudity on the local news they can crop it let me know what time youll be on why so i can set my vcr bye so jimmy riddle thinks hes dropped you in the shit with this one then said ds hatchley after swallowing his first bite of toasted tea cake to put it succinctly yes said banks i think he was also pretty sure this case wouldnt involve race relations or any of his rich and influential friends from the lodge oh i dont know about that hatchley said id imagine quite a few of them have got skeletons in their cupboards ouch they were sitting in the golden grill just across the street from eastvale divisional hq outside market street was packed with tourists jackets or cardigans slung over their shoulders cameras around their necks like sheep up on the unfenced moorland roads they strayed all over the narrow street the local delivery vans had to inch through horns blaring most of the tables were already taken but they had managed to find one near the back once the two of them had sat down and given their orders to the bustling waitress banks told hatchley about the skeleton by the time he had finished their order arrived banks knew his sergeant had a reputation as an idle sod and a thug his appearance didnt help hatchley was big slowmoving and bulky like a rugby prop forward gone to seed with straw hair pink complexion freckles and a piggy nose his suits were shiny ties eggstained and he usually looked as if he had just been dragged through a hedge backward but it had always been bankss experience that once hatchley got his teeth into something he was a stubborn and dogged copper and damned difficult to shake off the problem lay in getting him motivated in the first place anyway we think we know who the victim was but we want to cover all possibilities what id like you to do is take pc bridges and go down to london tomorrow heres a list of information id like banks passed over a sheet of paper hatchley glanced at it then looked up cant i take wpc sexton instead banks grinned ellie sexton and you a married man im ashamed of you jim hatchley winked spoilsport banks looked at his watch before you go could you put out a nationwide request for information on similar crimes in the same time period this is a bit tricky because its an old crime and theyll drag their feet but theres a chance someone might have something unsolved with a similar mo on the books ill put someone on checking our local records too you think this was part of a series i dont know jim but what dr glendenning told me about the manner of death made me think i shouldnt overlook that possibility ive also asked the socos to broaden their search to include the general hobbs end area given what ive just heard from dr glendenning about the way she died i wouldnt like to think were sitting on another cromwell street without knowing it im sure the press would have a field day with that said hatchley they could call it the hobbs end house of horrors nice ring to it lets hope it doesnt come to that aye hatchley paused and finished his tea cake this ds cabbot youre working with down harkside said hatchley i dont think ive come across him yet whats he like shes pretty new around here banks said but she seems to be working out okay she hatchley raised his eyebrows bit of all right then depends on your type anyway you seem to be showing a dangerous interest in these things for a man with a wife and child of his own how are carol and april by the way theyre fine over the teething a long time ago that were but thanks for asking sir banks finished his tea cake look jim he said if ive been a bit distant this past while you know havent shown much interest in you and your family its just that well ive had a lot of problems theres been a few changes a lot to get used to aye bloody hell banks thought aye the word with a thousand meanings he struggled on anyway if you thought i ignored you or cut you out in any way i apologize hatchley paused for a moment eyes everywhere but on banks finally he clasped his hamlike hands on the redandwhitechecked tablecloth still avoiding eye contact lets just forget about it shall we sir water under the bridge weve all had our crosses to bear these past few months maybe you more than most of us talking of crosses i suppose youve heard theyre changing our name to crime management banks nodded yes hatchley mimicked picking up a telephone good morning crime management here madam how can we help you not enough crime in your neighborhood dear dear well yes im certain theres some to spare on the east side estate yes ill look into it right away and see if i can get some sent over by this afternoon byebye madam banks laughed i mean really hatchley went on if this goes on theyll be calling you a senior crime consultant next the door opened and wpc sexton walked over to them hatchley nudged banks and pointed here she is the belle of eastvale divisional fuck off sarge she said then turned to banks sir we just got an urgent message from a ds cabbot in harkside she wants you to get down there as soon as you can she said a lad named adam kelly has something he wants to tell you the telegram in its unmistakable orange cover came to the shop for some reason i remember the date it was palm sunday the eighteenth of april and mother and i had just got back from church gloria was working that day so heart thumping and heavy i had to leave mother to her tears and run up to top hill farm though it was a chilly afternoon the sweat was pouring off me by the time i got there i found gloria collecting eggs in the chicken shack she had one in her palm and she held it out to show me its so warm she said freshly laid but what are you doing here gwen you look out of breath your eyes have you been crying panting i handed over the telegram to her she read it her face turned ashen and she sagged back against the flimsy wooden wall a nail squealed in the wood and the chickens squawked the sheet of paper fluttered from her tiny hand to the dirt floor she didnt cry right there and then but a soft moan came from her mouth oh no she said no almost as if she had been expecting it then her whole body started to tremble i wanted to go to her but somehow i knew that i mustnt not just yet not until she had let the first pangs of grief shake her and rip through her alone she closed her hand by her side and the egg broke bright yellow yolk stained her dainty fingers and long strings of viscous glair trailed down toward the strawcovered earth the kellys house stood in the middle of a terrace block on the broad east of harkside there was an infants school across the road and next to that a pay n display car park to encourage tourists not to clog the village center beyond the car park a meadow full of buttercups and clover descended eastward to the west yorkshire border and the banks of linwood reservoir mrs kelly answered the door and asked them in banks could sense the tension immediately the aftermath of a scolding it was a familiar childhood sensation of his and the scoldings were usually dished out by his mother though it was never openly admitted banks knew his father believed that household discipline was a womans job only if banks cheeked her off or tried to resist did his father step in and sort things out with his belt he wont say owt mrs kelly said she was a plain harriedlooking woman in her early thirties old before her time with limp tired hair and a drawn face i challenged him on it when he came home for his lunch and he ran off up to his room he wouldnt go back to school and he wont come down challenged him on what mrs kelly banks asked what he stole stole yes i found it when i were cleaning his room from that that there skeleton i left it where i found it i didnt want to touch it anyone would think i havent brought him up right its not easy when youre on your own calm down mrs kelly annie said stepping forward and resting her hand on her arm nobodys blaming you for anything or adam we just want to get to the bottom of it thats all the room was hot and a woman on television was explaining how to make the perfect soufflé because it was late afternoon and they were facing east there was very little light banks was already beginning to feel claustrophobic may i go up and talk to him he asked youll get nowt out of him clammed up he has may i try suit yourself left at the top of the stairs banks glanced at annie who tried to settle mrs kelly in an armchair then he made his way up the narrow carpeted stairway he knocked first on adams door and getting no response opened it a short way and stuck his head around adam he said its mr banks remember me adam lay on his side on the single bed he turned slowly wiped his forearm across his eyes and said youve not come to arrest me have you i dont want to go to jail nobodys going to take you to jail adam i didnt mean nothing honest i didnt why dont you just calm down and tell me what happened well get it sorted can i come in adam sat up on the bed he was a fairhaired kid with thick glasses freckles and stickingout ears the kind who is often teased at school and develops an active fantasy life to escape the kind banks used to defend from bullies perhaps his eyes were red with crying suppose so he said banks went inside the small bedroom there were no chairs so he sat on the edge of the bed at the bottom posters of muscular swordandsorcery heroes wielding enormous broadswords hung on the walls a small computer sat on a desk and a pile of old comic books stood by the bedside that was about all there was room for banks left the door open why dont you tell me about it he asked i thought it were magic adam said the talisman thats why i went there went where hobbs end its a magic place it were destroyed in a battle between good and evil but theres still magic buried there i thought it would make me invisible he reads too many of them comic books a voice said accusingly banks turned to see mrs kelly standing in the doorway annie came up beside her head in the clouds he has adams mother went on dungeons and dragons conan the barbarian myst riven stephen king and clive barker well hes gone too far this time banks turned mrs kelly he said will you let me talk to adam alone for a few minutes she stood in the doorway arms folded then made a sound of disgust and walked off sorry annie mouthed to banks following her banks turned right adam he said so youre a magician are you adam looked at him suspiciously i know a bit about it would you tell me what happened at hobbs end that day when you fell ive already told you the whole story adam chewed his lower lip you found something didnt you adam nodded will you show it to me the boy paused then reached under his pillow and pulled out a small round object he hesitated then passed it to banks it was a metal button by the look of it corroded still encrusted with dirt but clearly a button of some sort where did you find this adam it fell into my hand honest banks turned away to hide his smile if he had a penny for every time hed heard that from an accused thief hed be a rich man by now all right he said what were you doing when it fell into your hand pulling the hand out it was in the skeletons hand mustve been mustnt it as if the victim had been holding it in her palm you what never mind why didnt you tell us about it sooner i thought it were what id gone there for the talisman its not easy to get you have to pass through the veil to the seventh level theres sacrifice and fear to overcome banks hadnt a clue what the boy was talking about in adams imagination it seemed the old button had taken on some magical quality because of how it had been delivered to him not that it mattered that much the point was that adam had taken the button from gloria shackletons hand you did well banks said but you should have passed this on to me the first time i came to see you its not what you were looking for adam seemed disappointed its not no its not a talisman its just an old button is it important i dont know yet it might be who was it do you know the skeleton a young woman adam paused to take it in was she pretty i think she was has she been there a long time since the war did the germans kill her we dont think so we dont know who killed her he held out the button on his palm this might help us find out you might help us but whoever did it will be dead by now wont he probably said banks my granddad died in the war im sorry to hear it adam banks stood up you can come down now if you want nobodys going to do you any harm but my mum she was just upset thats all banks paused in the doorway when i was a lad your age i once stole a ring from woolworths it was only a plastic ring not worth much but i got caught banks could remember it as if it were yesterday the smell of smoke on the departmentstore detectives breath their overbearing size as they stood over him in the cramped triangular office tucked away under the escalator the rough way they handled him and his fear that they were going to beat him up or molest him in some way and that everyone would think he deserved it because he was a thief all for a plastic ring not even that really just to show off what happened adam asked they made me tell them my name and address and my mother had to go down and see them about it she stopped my pocket money and wouldnt let me go out to play for a month they had searched him roughly pulling everything from his pockets string penknife cricket cards pencil stub a gobstopper bus fare home and his cigarettes that was why his mother had stopped his pocket money because the woolworths store detectives told her about the cigarettes which they no doubt smoked themselves he always thought that was unfair that the cigarettes had nothing to do with it punish him for stealing the ring yes but leave him his cigarettes of course over the subsequent years he had come across many more examples of lifes basic unfairness not a few of them perpetrated by himself he had to admit that there were occasions when he had arrested someone for a driving offense found a few grams of coke or hash in his pocket and added that to the charge sheet anyway he went on it took me a long time to work out why she was so upset over something so unimportant as a plastic ring why because she was ashamed it humiliated her to have to go down there and listen to these men tell her that her son was a thief to have them talk down to her as if it were her fault and have to thank them for not calling the police it didnt matter that i hadnt done anything serious she was ashamed that a son of hers would do such a thing and worried it might be a sign of what id turn into but youre a copper not a thief banks smiled yes im a copper so come on downstairs and well see if we can make your mother a bit more forgiving than mine was adam hesitated but at last he jumped up from the bed banks moved aside and let him go down the narrow staircase first adams mother was in the kitchen making tea and annie was leaning against the counter talking to her oh so youve decided to join us have you you little devil said mrs kelly sorry mum she ruffled his hair get on with you just dont do owt like that again can i have a coke in the fridge adam turned to the fridge and banks winked at him adam blushed and grinned eight vivian elmsley sat down with her gin and tonic to watch the news that evening the drinks were becoming more frequent she had noticed since her memories had started disturbing her though it was the only chink in her iron discipline and she only allowed herself to indulge at the end of the day it was a worrying sign nonetheless watching the news had become a sort of grim duty now a morbid fascination tonight what she saw shook her to the core toward the end of the broadcast after the major world news and government scandals had been dealt with the scene shifted to a familiar sight a young blond woman held the microphone she stood in hobbs end where crimescene searchers in their white boilersuits and wellies were still digging up the ruins today the reporter began in a further bizarre twist to a story we have been covering in the north of england police investigating some skeletal remains found by a local schoolboy are almost certain they have established the identity of the victim just over an hour ago detective chief inspector alan banks who is heading the investigation talked with our northern office the scene shifted to a studio background and the camera settled on a lean darkhaired man with intense blue eyes can you tell us how this discovery was made the reporter asked yes banks looked straight into the camera as he spoke she noticed not letting his eyes flick left or right the way so many amateurs did when they appeared on television he had clearly done it before when we discovered the identity of the people living in the cottage during the second world war he began we found that one of them a woman called gloria shackleton hasnt shown up on any postwar records so far and that made you suspicious the detective smiled naturally of course there could be a number of reasons for this and were still looking into other possibilities but one thing we are forced to consider is that she doesnt show up because she was dead how long have the womans remains been buried its hard to be accurate but were estimating between the early to midforties thats a long time ago isnt it it is dont trails go cold clues go stale indeed they do but im very pleased with the progress weve made so far and im confident we can take this investigation forward the remains were discovered only last wednesday and within less than a week we are reasonably certain we have established the identity of the victim id say thats pretty good going for this sort of case and the next step the identity of the murderer even though he or she may be dead until we know that one way or the other were still dealing with an open case of murder as they say in america theres no statute of limitations on murder is there any way the public can help yes there is banks shifted in his chair the next moment the screen was filled with the head and shoulders of a woman surely it couldnt be but even though it wasnt a photographic likeness there was no mistaking who it was gloria vivian gasped and clutched her chest gloria after all these years it looked like part of a painting judging from the odd angle of the head vivian guessed that gloria had been lying down as she posed michael stanhope it looked like his style in the background bankss voice went on if anyone recognizes this woman who we think lived in london between and and in hobbs end after that if there is any living relative who knows something about her would they please get in touch with the north yorkshire police he gave out a phone number theres still a great deal we need to know he went on and as the events occurred so long ago that makes it all the more difficult for us vivian tuned out all she could see was glorias face stanhopes vision of glorias face with that cunning blend of naivety and wantonness that comehither smile and its promise of secret delights it both was and wasnt gloria then she thought with a tremor of fear if they had already discovered gloria how long would it take them to discover her it only said hes missing gloria insisted over two months later at the height of the summer of we were standing by one of mr kilnseys drystone walls drinking tizer and looking out over the goldgreen hills to the northwest she thrust the most recent ministry letter toward me and pointed at the words see missing during severe fighting east of the irrawaddy river in burma wherever that is when mr kilnseys son was killed at el alamein it said he was definitely dead not just missing what had kept us going the most since we heard the news of matthews disappearance was our attempt to get as much information as we possibly could about what had happened to him first we had written letters then we had even telephoned the ministry but they wouldnt commit themselves missing was all they would tell us and nobody seemed to know anything about the exact circumstances of his disappearance or where he might be if he was still alive if they did they werent saying the most we could get out of the man on the telephone was that the area in which matthew had disappeared was now in the hands of the japanese so there was no question of going in to search for bodies yes he admitted an unspecified number of casualties had been confirmed but matthew was not among them while it was still likely he might have been killed the man concluded there was also a chance he had been taken prisoner it was impossible to get anything further out of him since the telephone call gloria had been brooding over what to do next i think we should go there she said crumpling the letter into a ball where burma no silly london we should go down there and buttonhole someone get some answers but they wont talk to us i protested besides i dont think theyre in london anymore all the government people have moved out to the country somewhere there has to be somebody there gloria argued it stands to reason even if its just a skeleton staff a government cant just pack up and leave everything behind especially the war office besides this is london im talking about its still the capital of england you know if there are answers to be found you can bet well find them there there was no arguing with glorias passionate rhetoric i dont know i said i wouldnt have the faintest idea where to start whitehall she said nodding thats where we start whitehall she sounded so certain that i didnt know what to reply for the rest of that month i tried to talk gloria out of the london trip but she was adamant once she got like that i knew there could be no stopping her getting her own way even cynthia and alice and michael stanhope said it would be a waste of time mr stanhope had no time at all for government bureaucrats and assured us they would tell us nothing gloria insisted that if i didnt want to come with her that was fine she would go by herself i didnt have the courage to tell her that i had never been to london not even in peacetime and the whole prospect scared me stiff london seemed about as remote to me as the moon it was finally arranged for september gloria decided it would be best if we went and returned by night train that way she would only have to rearrange her one and a half days off for midweek rather than ask mr kilnsey for more time when things were busy to her surprise mr kilnsey said she could take longer if she wished since he had lost joseph at el alamein he had become a more compassionate and sympathetic man and he understood her grief we still decided to stick to the original plan because i didnt want to leave mother alone for any longer cynthia garmen said she would look after mother and the shop while we were gone she said norma prentice owed her a days work at the naafi in exchange for babysitting the previous week so it should be no problem mother offered to buy the train tickets and gave gloria some of her clothes coupons to use down there if we had time to visit the big shops though she accepted them gratefully for once clothes were the last thing on glorias mind it was about ten oclock when the road crested the hill and banks could see edinburgh spread out in the distance in all its hazy glory the stepped rows of tenements the dark gothic spire of the sir walter scott monument like some alien space rocket the hump of arthurs seat the castle on its crag the glimmer of sea beyond apart from one or two brief policerelated visits it was years since banks had spent any time there he realized as he coasted down the hill van morrisons tupelo honey on the stereo when he was a student he used to drive up to see friends quite often for weekends and holidays at one time he had a girlfriend a ravenhaired young beauty called alison who lived down on st stephen street but as is the nature of such longdistance relationships out of sight out of mind beats absence makes the heart grow fonder any day of the week and during one visit she simply turned up at the pub with someone else easy come easy go by then he had his eye on another woman called jo anyway banks tried to recollect if he had ever taken jem up to edinburgh with him but for the life of him he couldnt remember even seeing jem outside his room though he must have gone out to buy food records and dope as well as to sign on the dole banks had never even seen him out in the hallway he saw people come and go from time to time strangers sometimes at weird hours of the night but jem never mentioned any other friends bankss edinburgh days were all pretrainspotting and the place didnt look quite so romantic when he came down off the hill into the builtup streets of dark stone the roundabouts and traffic lights shopping centers and zebra crossings he got through dalkeith easily enough but shortly afterward he made one simple mistake and found himself heading toward glasgow on a dual carriageway for about three miles before he found an exit elizabeth goodall lived just off dalkeith road not far from the city center she had given him precise directions on the telephone the previous evening and after only a couple more wrong turns he found the narrow street of tall tenements mrs goodall lived on the ground floor she answered bankss ring promptly and led him into a highceilinged living room which smelled of lavender and peppermint all the windows were shut fast and not the slightest breeze stirred the warm perfumed air only a little daylight managed to steal through the wallpaper was patterned with sprigs of rosemary and thyme parsley and sage too for all banks could tell mrs goodall bade him sit in a sturdy damask armchair like all the other chairs in the room its arms and back were covered by white lace antimacassars so you found your way all right she asked yes banks lied nothing to it i dont drive a motorcar myself she said with a trace of her old yorkshire accent i have to rely on buses and trains if i want to go anywhere which is rare these days she rubbed her small wrinkled hands together well then youre here tea please she disappeared into the kitchen banks surveyed the room it was a nondescript sort of place clean and tidy but not much character a few framed photographs stood on the sideboard but none of them showed hobbs end one glassfronted cabinet held a few knickknacks including trophies silverware and crystal that would be tempting to burglars banks thought old woman in a groundfloor flat with a nice haul of silverware just there for the taking he hadnt noticed any signs of a security system mrs goodall walked back into the room slowly carrying a china tea set on a silver tray she set it down on a doily on the low table in front of the sofa then sat down knees together and smoothed her skirt she was a short stout woman dressed in a gray tweed skirt white blouse and a navyblue cardigan despite the heat her recently permed hair was almost white and its waves looked frozen razorsharp to the touch margaret thatcher style her forehead was high and her glaucous watery eyes pinkrimmed she had a prissy slit of a mouth that seemed painted on with red lipstick well just let it mash a few minutes shall we she said then well pour fine said banks banishing the image of the two of them holding the thin teapot handle and pouring now she said hands clasped on her lap let us begin you mentioned hobbs end on the telephone but that was all you saw fit to tell me what do you wish to know banks leaned forward and rested his forearms on his thighs a number of general questions came to mind but he needed something more specific something to take her memory right back if possible do you remember gloria shackleton he asked she lived in bridge cottage during the war mrs goodall looked as if she had just swallowed a mouthful of vinegar of course i remember her she said dreadful girl oh in what way not to put too fine a point on it chief inspector the girl was a brazen hussy it was perfectly obvious the flirtatious manner the tilt of her head the lascivious smile i knew it the first moment i set eyes on her where was that where why in church of course my father was the verger at saint bartholomews though how such a a painted strumpet would dare to show herself like that in the sight of the lord is beyond me so you first met her in church i didnt say i met her just that i saw her there first she was still called gloria stringer then was she religious no true christian woman would go about flaunting herself the way she did why did she go to church then because the shackletons went of course she had her feet firmly under their kitchen table she was from london originally wasnt she so she said did she ever say anything about her background about her family not to me though i vaguely remember someone told me her parents were killed in the blitz shed come to hobbs end with the womens land army hadnt she yes a land girl tea please mrs goodall sat up back erect and poured the teacups with matching saucers were tiny fragile bonechina things with pink roses painted inside and out a gold rim and a handle he couldnt possibly get a finger through not a drop stained the white lace doily milk sugar just as it comes thanks very much she frowned as if she didnt approve of that anything other than milk and two sugars was probably unpatriotic in her book of course she went on one hoped that over time she would make attempts to fit in to alter her manner and appearance according to the standards of village society but she made no attempt she did not none at all did you know her well chief inspector does she sound like the kind of person whose company i would cultivate it was a small village you must have been about the same age i was one year older even so alice thats alice poole used to spend quite a bit of time with her against my advice i might add but then alice always was a bit too free and easy did you have any dealings with gloria at all mrs goodall paused as if to bring to mind an unpleasant memory then she nodded indeed i did it fell to me to advise her that her behavior was unacceptable as was the way she looked looked yes the sort of clothes she wore the way she sashayed about the way she wore her hair like some sort of cheap american film star it was not ladylike not in the least as if that werent bad enough she smoked in the street you say it fell to you on what authority was there strong general feeling against her in my capacity as a member of the church of england i see was everyone else in hobbs end ladylike she pursed her lips again and let him know with a quick dagger glance that she hadnt missed the insolence in his tone im not saying that there werent lower elements in the village chief inspector dont get me wrong of course there were as there are in every village society but even the lowly of birth can aspire to at least a certain level of good manners and decent behavior wouldnt you agree how did gloria react when you rebuked her mrs goodall flushed at the memory she laughed i pointed out that it might do her much good morally and socially were she to become active in the womens institute and the missionary society what was her response to this she called me an interfering busybody and indicated that there was only one missionary position she was interested in and it was not the churchs can you believe it and she used such language as i would not expect from the mouth of the lowest mill girl despite her puton speech i think she showed her true colors then how did she speak oh she had her airs and graces she spoke like someone on the wireless not the way they do these days of course but as they did back then when people spoke properly on the wireless but you could tell it was put on she had clearly been practicing the arts of imitation and deception she married matthew shackleton didnt she mrs goodall sucked in her breath with an audible hiss yes i was at their wedding and i must say that al though matthew was only a shopkeepers son he married well beneath himself when he married the stringer girl matthew was an exceptional boy i expected far better of him than that do you know anything about their relationship it wasnt long after they were married he was sent abroad he went missing in action poor matthew missing presumed dead banks frowned when was this when he went missing yes sometime in he was in the far east captured by the japanese she gave a little shudder what happened to him i have no idea i presume he was dead you lost touch she fiddled with her wedding ring yes my husband william was engaged in topsecret work for the home front and he was assigned to scotland early in i accompanied him my parents came to live with us and we didnt have anything more to do with hobbs end i still keep in touch with ruby kettering and alice poole but they are my only connections it was all so long ago we women dont dwell on the war the way the men do with their legions and their regimental reunions do you know if gloria had affairs with anyone other than matthew mrs goodall sniffed almost certainly who with she paused a moment as if to let him know that she shouldnt be telling him this then she uttered just one word soldiers what soldiers this was wartime chief inspector contrary to what you might imagine not every man in the armed forces was over fighting the hun or the nip unfortunately there were soldiers everywhere not all of them british either what soldiers were these for the first time in their conversation mrs goodall let a small smile slip it endeared her to banks tremendously oversexed she said overpaid and over here americans yes the raf handed rowan woods over to the american air force did you see much of these americans oh yes they often used to come and drink in the village pubs or attend our occasional dances at the church hall some even came to the sunday services they had their own on the base of course but saint bartholomews was a beautiful old church such a pity it had to be knocked down did gloria have american boyfriends then several and i neednt tell you about the opportunities for immorality and indiscretion that a wide area of wooded land like rowan woods has to offer need i banks wondered if she would take a positive answer as an indication of personal experience he decided not to risk it was there anyone in particular he asked i have no firsthand knowledge i kept my distance from them according to cynthia garmen she had more than one not that cynthia was one to talk no better than she ought to be that one why she married one of them didnt she went off to live in pennsylvania or some such place so there was no one serious for gloria oh ive no doubt her liaisons were every bit as serious as a woman such as gloria shackleton was capable of a married woman but you said she thought her husband was dead missing presumed dead its not quite the same besides thats no excuse mrs goodall remained silent for a few moments then said may i ask you a question chief inspector go ahead why are you asking me about the shackleton girl after all these years dont you watch the news i prefer to read historical biography newspapers on occasion but only the obituaries what are you hinting at chief inspector am i missing something banks told her about the reservoir drying up and the discovery of the body they believed to be glorias mrs goodall paled and clutched at the silver crucifix around her neck i dont like to speak ill of the dead she muttered you should have told me sooner would that have changed what you said she paused a moment then sighed and said probably not i have always considered telling the truth to be an important virtue all i can tell you though is that gloria shackleton was alive and well when william and i left hobbs end in may thank you said banks that helps us narrow things down a bit do you know if she had any enemies not what youd call enemies nobody who would do what you have just described many people like myself disapproved of her but thats quite a different thing one would hardly murder a person for not joining the womens institute might i make a suggestion please given glorias wayward nature dont you think you should be looking at this as a crime passionel perhaps banks shifted in his chair and crossed his legs the other way mrs goodall poured more tea it was lukewarm what about michael stanhope he asked she raised her eyebrows theres another one another what debauched perverted i could go on birds of a feather him and gloria shackleton have you seen any of his socalled paintings banks nodded one of them seems to be a nude of gloria i wonder if you knew anything about that i can hardly say it surprises me but no believe me if such a painting exists it was not public knowledge in hobbs end at least not while i was there do you think gloria might have had an affair with michael stanhope i cant say given that the two of them shared similar natures and views i wouldnt rule it out they did spend a lot of time together drinking as i recollect though even glorias tastes werent quite so exotic as to extend as far as a tortured drunken depraved artist did gloria and matthew have any children not that i ever knew of and you would have known i think so its hard to hide such things in a small village why do you ask there were certain indications in the postmortem thats all banks scratched the tiny scar beside his right eye but nobody seems to know anything about it she could have had a child after we left in its possible or perhaps she gave birth before she arrived in hobbs end and married matthew shackleton after all she was nineteen when she came to the village perhaps she abandoned the baby and its father in london but but that means means what mrs goodall well i never assumed that matthew was her first conquest not a woman like her but a child surely that would indicate she was already married and that her marriage to matthew was bigamous just one more sin to add to her list said banks but it wasnt necessarily so i imagine even back then in the good old days the odd child was born on the wrong side of the blanket mrs goodalls lips tightened to a single red line for a moment then she said i dont appreciate your sarcasm chief inspector or your coarseness things were better back then simpler clearer ordered and the wartime spirit brought people together people of all classes say what you will im sorry mrs goodall i dont mean to be sarcastic really but im trying to get to the bottom of a particularly nasty murder here one that i probably have hardly any chance of solving because it was committed so long ago i believe the victim deserves my best efforts no matter what you may think of her of course she does i stand corrected gloria shackleton could not possibly have deserved what you say happened to her but im sorry i dont think i can help you any further did you know matthews sister gwynneth gwen oh yes gwen was always rather the quiet one head buried in a book i imagined her becoming a teacher or something like that perhaps even a university professor but she worked in the shop throughout the war besides taking care of her mother and doing firewatching at night she was no shirker wasnt gwen do you know what became of her is she still alive im afraid we lost touch when william and i went to scotland we werent especially close though she was a regular churchgoer and wrote for the parish magazine were she and gloria close well they had to be to some extent being family but they were different as chalk and cheese there was some talk about gloria leading gwen astray they were always off to dances together in harkside or to the pictures gwen had generally avoided social intercourse until gloria arrived on the scene preferring her own company or that of books gwen was always a rather impressionable girl though she took gloria under her wing at first so to speak it was soon quite clear who exactly was under whose wing what was their age difference gwen was two or three years younger perhaps believe me though it makes a vast difference at that age what did she look like gwen she was rather a plain girl apart from her eyes remarkable eyes almost oriental the way they slanted and she was tall tall and awkward a gangly sort of girl what about matthew a dashing handsome fellow very mature gifted with wisdom beyond his years again she allowed a little smile to flit across her hardset features if i hadnt met my william and the stringer girl hadnt arrived on the scene well who knows anyway she got her hands on him and that was that banks let the silence stretch he could hear a clock ticking in the background if youll excuse me chief inspector she said after a few moments im extremely tired all those memories banks stood up yes of course im sorry for taking up so much of your time not at all it seems youve come a long way for nothing or very little banks shrugged part of the job besides youve been a great help if theres anything else i can help you with please dont hesitate to telephone thank you banks looked at his watch going on for one time for a spot of lunch before the long drive home we took the night train from leeds where the platform was crowded with young soldiers the train clanked and steamed into the station only an hour late and we felt ourselves jostled and pushed along by the crowd like corks in a fastflowing river i was terrified that we were going to fall between the carriages and be run over by the huge iron wheels but we clung on to each other for dear life amid all the shoving and heaving and hissing steam and we finally managed to get ourselves more or less pushed onto seats in a cramped compartment that soon grew even more cramped another hour passed before the engine groaned and shuddered out of the station i had loved train journeys ever since i was a little girl loved the gentle rocking motion the hypnotic clicketyclick of the wheels on the lines and the way the landscape drifts by like images from a dream not that time a lot of trains had been damaged and most of the railway workshops were being used for munitions production as a result many of the engines in use would have been good for nothing but scrap iron if it hadnt been for the war the motion was jerky and we never really got going fast enough for a rhythmic clicketyclick everyone was crushed far too closely together to make sleep possible at least for me i couldnt even read the blinds were drawn tight and the whole compartment was lit by one ghostly blue pinpoint of light so dim you could hardly make out the features of the person sitting opposite you there wasnt even a restaurant car we talked for a while with two young soldiers who offered us woodbine after woodbine i think that was when i started to smoke out of sheer boredom even when the first few puffs made me feel sick and dizzy i persevered it was something to do the soldiers sympathized and wished us luck when gloria told them about matthew then people started to fall silent each drifting into his own world for me it was a matter of gritting my teeth and enduring the long journey the constant unexplained delays the jerking stops and starts gloria managed to doze off after a while and her head slid slowly sideways until she was resting her cheek on my shoulder and i could feel her warm breath against my throat i still couldnt sleep i was left with nothing but my own gloomy thoughts and rasping snores from the soldiers we stopped in the middle of nowhere for nearly two hours at one point no explanation because of the double summer time it didnt get light as early as it used to but even so we werent more than six or seven hours into the journey before we were able to open the blinds on muted earlymorning sunlight slanting across the fields people had put odd objects like old mangles and broken cars on some of the empty meadows to make obstacles for any enemy planes that might try to land there one field was scattered with country signposts stuck in the ground at strange angles the signposts had been taken down at the start of the war along with all the station nameplates to confuse the enemy in case of invasion but i was still surprised to see where some of them had ended up all in all the journey took ten hours and the last hour or two seemed to take us through the endless london suburbs it was here that i caught my first sight of street after street of bombedout terraces shattered lampposts powdered plaster twisted girders and jagged walls rosebay willow herb and oxford ragwort grew from the rubble pushing between the cracks in the bombed masonry and brickwork packs of children roved through the streets playing among the derelict houses one ingenious group had rigged up a rope from a lamppost that seemed to be leaning at a precarious angle like the tower of pisa and they were proceeding to take it in turns to swing back and forth playing at tarzan the ape man some houses were only halfdestroyed split open like a cross section you could see wallpaper framed paintings and photographs on the walls a bed half hanging over the jagged remains of the floor here and there people had moved damaged items of furniture into the street a doorless wardrobe a cracked sideboard and a pram with buckled wheels i felt like a voyeur at a disaster site which is what i was i suppose but i couldnt stop looking im not sure that i had any real grasp of the full extent of the wars devastation until then despite seeing leeds after that air raid it seemed that on every area of spare ground not taken up by allotments a barrage balloon station had been set up to deter lowflying enemy planes the fat silver balloons glinted in the sun and looked like whales trying to fly in some of the green areas rows of antiaircraft guns pointed at the sky like steel arrows of course there were also plenty of buildings left standing and some of these were surrounded by sandbags often to a height of about ten feet or more i also noticed a lot of posters on just about every available hoarding they told us to grow our own food save coal buy war bonds walk when we can and lord knows what else i was so lost in the sights that i hardly noticed the time pass until kings cross it was after ten oclock in the morning when we arrived at the station and i was starving gloria wanted to head straight for whitehall but i persuaded her to stop and we found a lyons where we managed to get a rasher of bacon and an egg after breakfast we walked back into the street and i was at last able to take in where i was my first sensation was of being a very small tiny insignificant little creature lost in an immense and sprawling city people pressed in on me from all directions tall buildings towered over me the whole place had a shabby worn and slightly defeated air about it everybody looked pinched and pale the kind of look you get after years of rationing bombing and uncertainty even so for a yorkshire country girl it might as well have been another planet i had never been anywhere bigger than leeds before and im sure london would have overwhelmed me even in peacetime it had started to drizzle though the air was still warm and the damp sandbags gave off a musky smell there were so many people rushing about most of them in uniform that i began to feel quite panicky and dizzy i clutched at glorias arm as she led me purposefully toward a bus stop often people smiled or said hello as we passed i saw my first wounded soldiers sadlooking men with bandaged heads missing limbs eye patches some on crutches or with their arms in slings all of them lucky ones they were still alive gloria was in her element after only a few moments of disorientation at first something seemed to click as if the city actually made sense to her which it certainly didnt to me she seemed to have only the slightest doubt over which bus to catch and a quick word with the clippie who was trying to look like joan crawford soon set her right on that we went upstairs where you could smoke and then we were off it was a whirlwind journey and more than once i feared the bus would tip over turning a corner in the east i fancied i could see the immense dome of st pauls in the gray light through the dirty rainstreaked window i was overwhelmed by the size of the buildings all around me white and gray stone darkened by rain curving georgian or edwardian facades five or six stories high with pediments gargoyles and pointed gables huge ionic columns surely i thought this must be a city built by giants at one point my heart jumped into my throat i saw broken glass and rubble on the pavement and strewn among it all human body parts a head a leg a torso but when i looked more closely i could see no blood and the limbs all had a hard unnatural look about them i realized that a bomb must have hit a dress shop and blown all the mannequins into the street we passed trafalgar square where nelsons column stood much taller in reality than it had been even in my imagination you could hardly see poor lord nelson up at the top the base of the column was covered with hoardings asking us to buy national war savings bonds across the square near the insurance office and the canadian pacific building was a huge billboard advertising famel cough mixture there were a lot of soldiers milling about i didnt recognize all the caps and uniforms in just about every color you could imagine from black to bright blue and cherryred i also saw my firstever negro from that bus in trafalgar square i knew they existed of course i had read about them but i had never actually seen a black man before i remember being rather disappointed that apart from being black he didnt look all that much different from anyone else gloria nudged me gently and we got off on a broad street flanked with even more tall buildings and that was when our search began in earnest i felt like a small child dragged along by its mother as gloria took me from building to building we asked policemen knocked on doors asked soldiers strangers in the street knocked on even more doors finally wet and weary and ready to give up i rejoiced when gloria found some sort of minor clerk who took pity on us i dont honestly think he knew anything about matthew or what had happened to him but he did seem to know a little more about the war in the far east than anyone else would admit to and he seemed to take a shine to gloria he was a tidy little man in a pinstripe suit with gray hair parted at the center and a neat trim mustache he glanced at his watch pursed his lips and frowned before suggesting he might spare us ten minutes if we cared to accompany him to the tea house on the corner he had a rather highpitched squeaky voice and spoke with a posh educated accent at that point i would have cheerfully murdered for a cup of tea we dragged ourselves inside bought tea at the counter and gloria started to pump the poor fellow for information before we had even had our first sip what are the chances that matthew might still be alive she asked this clearly wasnt the sort of question the man who told us his name was arthur winchester was trained to answer he hemmed and hawed a bit then measured his words as carefully as the sugar cubes in the bowl were rationed im afraid i cant really answer that question he said as i told you i have no knowledge of the individual case to which you refer merely a little general knowledge of the situation in the east all right gloria went on undaunted tell me about what happened at irridaddy or whatever it is thats if its not classified arthur winchester sniffed and granted us a little smile irrawaddy it happened six months ago so its hardly classified he said then he paused sipped some more tea and rubbed the bristly bottom of his mustache with the back of his hand i glanced toward the window and saw the rain slanting down distorting the shapes of the people passing by on victoria street burma he went on as you probably know stands between india and china and it would be of inestimable value if our forces could reopen the burma road and clear the way to china which could then be used as a direct base for operations against japan this as i say is general knowledge not to me it isnt gloria lit a craven a go on she prompted blowing out a long plume of smoke arthur winchester cleared his throat to put things simply since burma fell we have been trying to get it back one of the offensives with this end in mind was the chindit operation launched in february they began east of the irrawaddy a river in central burma while they were there the japanese launched a major offensive on the arakan front and the british had to withdraw are you following me we both nodded good arthur winchester finished his tea well the chindits were trapped behind the enemy lines cut off and they began to filter back in some disarray he looked at gloria this no doubt is why no one has been able to give you any specific information about your husband hes an engineer you said yes hmm what happened next next oh well the chindits had suffered severe hardships most severe not long after they were ordered to leave burma but were still trying to get burma back oh yes its of great strategic importance so theres still a chance a chance of what that someone might find matthew when the british win back burma arthur winchester glanced out of the window i wouldnt get your hopes up my dear a long time might pass before that happens were the losses heavy i asked arthur winchester gazed at me for a moment but he wasnt seeing me what oh yes rather worse than we had hoped for how do you know all this gloria asked arthur winchester inclined his head modestly i dont know very much im afraid but before the war before this government work i was a history teacher the far east has always interested me so you dont really have anything to tell us gloria said well any excuse to take tea with a pretty lady will do for me if you dont mind my saying so gloria got to her feet in a fury and was about to storm out of the place leaving even me behind when arthur winchester blushed and grabbed hold of her sleeve meekly i say my dear im sorry poor taste i really didnt mean to offend you a compliment thats all i meant no hint of any sort of prurient suggestion if gloria didnt know what prurient meant she never let on she merely sat down again slowly a hard suspicious look in her eyes and said can you tell us anything at all mr winchester all i can tell you my dear he went on gravely is that during the retreat many of the wounded had to be left behind enemy lines they simply couldnt be transported they were left with a little money and a weapon of course but what became of them i cant say gloria had turned pale i found myself twisting the fabric of my dress in my fist over my lap until my knuckles turned white are you saying this is what happened to matthew she asked her voice no louder than a whisper im saying it may be what happened if he is simply being described as missing presumed dead and what if that was the case arthur winchester paused and brushed an imaginary piece of lint from his lapel well he said the japanese dont like taking wounded prisoners it would depend how badly wounded he was of course whether he could work that sort of thing so youre saying they might have simply murdered him as he lay there wounded and defenseless im saying its possible or or what he looked away as i said the wounded were left behind with a weapon it took a second or two for what he was getting at to sink in i think it was me who responded first you mean matthew might have committed suicide if capture was inevitable and if he was badly hurt then id say yes its a possibility his tone brightened a little but this is all pure conjecture you understand i know nothing at all of the circumstances maybe he was simply captured by the enemy and hes going to while away the rest of the war in the relative safety of a prison camp i mean youve seen how well we take care of our germans and italians here havent you it was true the italians in yorkshire even worked on the farms at planting and harvest times gloria and i had talked to them on occasion and they seemed cheerful enough for prisoners of war they liked to sing opera while they worked and some of them had beautiful voices but you said the japanese dont like taking prisoners its true they despise the weak and the defeated but if they capture fit men they can put them to work on railways and bridges and suchlike theyre not fools you did say your husband was an engineer so he could be useful to them if he cooperated yes the main problem is that we dont know a lot about the japanese and our lines of communication are very poor almost to the point of not existing at all even the red cross has great difficulties getting its parcels delivered and getting information out of them the japanese are notoriously difficult to deal with so he may be a prisoner of war and nobody has bothered to let anyone know is that what youre telling us that is a distinct possibility yes there are probably hundreds if not thousands of others in that same position too but you said youre a teacher you know about the japanese dont you arthur winchester laughed nervously i know a little about their geography and history but the japanese have always been very insular comes from living on an island perhaps we live on an island too i reminded him yes well i mean insular more in that theyve screened themselves off from the rest of the world actively resisted contact with the west we knew practically nothing at all about them until the turn of the century their customs beliefs and even now we dont know a lot what do you know what can you tell us gloria asked he paused again well he said i dont want to upset you but you asked me to be honest with you id say its best to hope hes dead its best that way he paused look its wartime things are very different you have to let go of the past your husband is probably dead or if he isnt he might as well be nothing will be the same when its done all over the city people are living as if theres no tomorrow how long are you staying in london gloria looked at him suspiciously until tonight why i know a place very nice very discreet perhaps i could gloria got to her feet so fast she bumped the table with her thighs and the remains of her tea spilled onto arthur winchesters lap but he didnt stop around to mop it up instead he bolted for the door saying good lord is that the time i must dash and with that he was out of the door before gloria could even pick up something to throw at him she glared after him for a moment then touched up her curls and sat down again the serving girl frowned at us then turned away i thought we were lucky not to get thrown out we dawdled over our tea gloria calming down smoking another cigarette and gazing out through the steamedup window at the phantoms drifting by outside in the café soldiers came and went with their girls i could smell the rain on their uniforms what did he mean its best that way gloria asked i dont know i said i suppose he meant to say that the japanese dont treat their prisoners as well as we do what do they do torture them beat them starve them i dont know gloria i said putting my hand over hers i just dont know all i can say is that it sounded to me as if he was saying matthew would be better off dead nine annie parked in one of the hilly streets around st marys at the back of the castle and went looking for alice pooles cottage the sky was bright blue with only a few wisps of white cloud borne on the sea breeze pity she had to work she could have brought her bucket and spade as a child she had spent hours amusing herself on the beach some of her only memories of her mother took place on the beach in st ives building sand castles together burying one another in the sand so that only a head showed or maybe a head and feet running into the big waves and getting knocked over in annies memory her mother was a bright mercurial figure mischievous devilmaycare always laughing though her father on the surface was easygoing bright funny and caring there was a darkness in his art that annie felt excluded her she didnt know where it came from or how he reconciled it with the rest of his life did he suffer terribly in private and simply put on a public face even for his own daughter she hardly knew him at all she found the cottage easily enough according to directions she had received over the telephone it was in a high quiet part of town away from the pubs and shopping centers crowded with holidaymakers from leeds and bradford from the garden she could see a wedge of the north sea far below beyond marine drive steely grayblue today dotted with small boats flocks of gulls gathered squealing above a shoal of fish the woman who answered the door was tall with thin wispy hair like candy floss she was wearing a long loose purple dress with gold embroidery around the neck hem and sleeves and gold earrings of linked hoops that dangled almost as far as her shoulders it reminded annie of the sort of thing hippies used to wear a pair of black hornrimmed glasses hung on a chain around her neck come in love she led the way into a bright cluttered room dust motes spun in the rays of sunlight that lanced through the panes of the mullioned window can i offer you anything she asked having settled annie in an armchair so soft and deep she wondered how shed ever get out of it only i usually have elevenses around this time coffee and a kit kat instant coffee mind you annie smiled thatll be fine thanks mrs poole alice call me alice and why dont you have a look through this while i see to things in the kitchen your call got me thinking about the old days and i realized i hadnt had it out in years she handed annie a thick leatherbound photograph album and headed for the kitchen most of the deckleedged blackandwhite photographs were family groups what annie took to be alice and her parents aunts brothers and sisters but several were village scenes women stopping to chat in the street baskets over their arms scarves knotted on their heads children fishing from the riverbanks there were also a couple of pictures of the church which was smaller and prettier than she had imagined from stanhopes painting with a squat square tower and of the dark brooding flax mill like a skull perched on its promontory alice poole came back holding a mug of coffee in each hand and a kit kat still in its wrapper between her teeth when she had freed her hands she took the chocolate bar from her mouth and put it on a small coffee table beside her chair a little indulgence of mine she said would you like one i should have asked no said annie no thats fine she accepted her coffee it was milky and sweet just the way she liked it what do you think of the photos very interesting youve come about poor gloria then youve heard oh yes your boss was on telly last night i dont see very well but theres nothing wrong with my ears i dont watch a lot of television but not much local news slips by me especially something like that how horrible have you got any suspects yet not really said annie were still trying to find out as much as we can about gloria its very difficult what with it all being so long ago you dont say i was seventyfive last birthday can you believe it quite honestly mrs sorry alice i cant she really did seem remarkably spry for a woman of that age apart from a few liver spots on her hands and wrinkles on her face the only real indication of the ravages of age was her sparse and lifeless hair which annie was now coming to believe had probably fallen victim to chemotherapy and not yet grown back properly look alice pointed out this is gloria she turned to a photograph of four girls standing in front of a jeep and pointed to the petite blonde with the long curls the narrow waist and the provocative smile without a doubt it was the same girl from stanhopes painting underneath in tiny white letters was written july this ones gwen her sisterinlaw gwen was the tallest of them all she wasnt smiling and had half turned away from the camera as if shy about her looks and this one here is cynthia garmen the four musketeers we were oh that ones me alice had been a svelte blonde by the look of her also in the photograph standing in the jeep behind the girls were four young men in uniform who are they annie asked americans that ones charlie and thats brad we saw quite a lot of them i dont remember names of the other two they just happened to be there id like to make a copy of that photo if you dont mind well send it back to you not at all alice detached the photograph from its corners please take care of it though i promise annie slipped it in her briefcase you knew gloria well she went on quite well she married matthew shackleton as you probably know and while he was away at war gloria and gwen matthews sister became inseparable but quite often the gang of us would do something together anyway i wouldnt say we were the best of friends but i did know her and i liked her what was she like gloria alice unwrapped her kit kat and took a bite when she had swallowed it she said well id say she was a good sort cheerful fun to be with kind generous shed give you the shirt off her back or make one for you pardon magic fingers gloria was such an expert sewer you could give her rags and shed turn out a ball gown well i might be exaggerating a little but im sure you get my point it was a skill in much demand back then i can tell you there wasnt a heck of a lot in the shops and your clothing coupons didnt go very far she worked at top hill farm didnt she yes for kilnsey the lecherous old sod do you think there was anything funny going on up there between him and gloria alice laughed kilnsey and gloria in his wildest fantasies maybe nellie his wife would have had his guts for garters if hed so much as looked twice at another woman and gloria well she might have been generous in some ways but she wasnt that generous old kilnsey no youre barking up the wrong tree there love he was one of them serious religious types that always look like perverts to me probably need more religion than the rest of us just to keep their unnatural urges down annie made a note of the name in her experience that repressed type was more likely to lose control and kill than most what kind of things did you do together the usual gloria was impulsive shed suggest a spurofthemoment picnic on harksmere bank or a film at the lyceum in harkside its been converted to the kwiksave last time i saw it but back then it was a popular place for lads and lasses to meet or walking in the fields at night during the blackout and swimming she lowered her voice and leaned forward believe it or not dearie we once went swimming without costumes in harksmere after dark what a time we had of it that was glorias idea too spontaneous she didnt like everything all planned out for her but she always liked to have something to do or to look forward to doing did she tell you anything about her past she never spoke much about that at all from what little i could gather it must have been very painful for her so i just thought if she doesnt want to talk about it then thats all right with me all she said was that she lost her family in the blitz she did sometimes seem very distracted she had deep quiet sad moods that would just come on her out of nowhere in the middle of a picnic at a dance whatever but not often how did she fit into village life well said alice i suppose that depends on your point of view at first she wasnt around very much land girls worked very long hours after shed married matthew and moved to bridge cottage we saw a bit more of her did she have any enemies anyone who had reason to dislike her quite a few people disapproved of her jealous if you ask me gloria didnt care what people thought of her she went in the pubs by herself and she smoked in the street i know thats nothing now love the streets the only place you can smoke in some places but back then it was well to some people it meant you were nigh on being a prostitute people had some funny ideas back then she shook her head slowly they call them the good old days but im not so sure there was a lot of hypocrisy and intolerance snobbery too and gloria was far too cheeky and flighty for some people anyone in particular betty goodall could never take to her betty always was a bit of a snob and a bit too high church too if you ask me but shes a good soul underneath it all dont get me wrong she has a good heart she was always just a bit too quick with her moral judgments i think she fancied matthew shackleton for herself and i think it rather put her nose out of joint matthew marrying gloria like i said gloria was free and easy in her nature besides being a real stunna as they say in the papers these days i think a lot of women were just plain jealous of her annie smiled from this description of alices she could imagine what a time banks would be having up in edinburgh betty goodall wasnt in the photograph she remarked no betty and william had gone by then he was some sort of dogsbody with the home guard and they kept sending him from council to council not fit for real war work apparently and no one could quite figure out what to do with him do you know if gloria actually did anything to merit such disapproval or was it simply because of her nature her personality oh dear you want me to tell tales out of school annie laughed not if you dont want to but it is a long time ago and it might help us find her killer oh i know love i know alice waved her hand just let me get my cigarettes i usually have one after my elevenses one after lunch and one after tea and perhaps one with a nightcap before bed but never more than five a day she got up and brought her purse over fiddled for a packet of dunhill and lit one with a slim gold lighter now then dearie where was i i wanted to know if gloria had affairs slept around certainly no more than a lot of others did then ones youd generally consider nice girls but people made a lot of assumptions about gloria just because she was a freethinking woman and spoke her mind she definitely was a bit of a flirt theres no denying that but that doesnt mean anything does it its just a bit of fun depends on who you flirt with i suppose so anyway i may have been naive but i think there was more smoke than fire most of the time what did you think of matthew not very much to tell you the truth there was always something just a bit too smarmy and cocky about him for my taste oh he was nice enough on the outside handsome and charming and one had to feel sorry for what happened to him later what happened killed by the japanese over in burma anyway matthew was a big talker i also heard he got more than one lass in the family way before gloria came on the scene while he was a student in leeds so he was no saint wasnt matthew shackleton though to hear some speak youd think butter wouldnt melt in his mouth some folk said she only married him because he was a bright handsome lad with a great future ahead of him which seems to me like a very good reason to marry someone im sure he made her all kinds of promises about how wonderful their future would be he filled her head full of dreams of all the things he would build and all the faroff exotic lands theyd visit and all that rubbish underneath it all gloria was a romantic i think she fell in love with this new world matthew painted for her all the bridges and cathedrals he was going to build and her by his side she was impatient for it all how did gloria take his death she was heartbroken devastated i was worried about her and i mentioned it to gwen once or twice gwen said shed be okay in a while but then gwen didnt look too good herself either very close they were her and matthew anyway when gloria started to go out again she was more devilmaycare you know the way some people get when they feel theyve nothing left to lose a lot of people were like that then she paused and took another drag on her cigarette then fiddled with the chain around her neck so gloria started going out again to dances and things yes a few months later when did she form her relationship with michael stanhope the artist oh hed always been around he was at their wedding gloria spent a lot of time with him used to drink with him in the shoulder of mutton thats another reason those religious types disapproved of her did you know stanhope just to say hello to michael stanhope i havent thought of him in years he was an eccentric always wearing that floppy hat of his and the cane very affected theres was no mistaking that he was an artist if you know what i mean i cant say i had much time for him myself but i think he was harmless enough anyway he wouldnt have had anything to do with gloria it was all just a show what do you mean he was a homosexual dearie queer as a threepound note as we used to say anyway as you probably know it was illegal back then i see would it surprise you to know that a painting of gloria by michael stanhope did show up annie asked it did yes a nude its in leeds art gallery alice put her hand to her mouth and laughed well bless my soul it is really a nude of gloria still i cant say it really surprises me gloria was never really shy about her body i told you about the swimming party didnt i im not much of a one for art galleries but i must go see it next time im in leeds what was their relationship i think they genuinely liked one another they were friends both of them were outsiders freethinkers on some strange level they understood one another and i think she genuinely liked him and respected him as a painter not that she was an intellectual or anything but she responded to his work it touched her in some way annie could understand that over the years her father had had many female friends who genuinely admired his art no doubt he had also slept with some of them but then ray certainly wasnt homosexual and it didnt mean the women hadnt respected him as a painter too was she involved with anyone in particular after her husbands death she asked she had a bit of a fling with a yank from rowan woods called billy joe something or other i never did like him wouldnt trust him and those bedroom eyes of his as far as i could throw him she got a bit of a reputation for hanging around with american airmen disappearing into the woods late at night that sort of thing alice winked not that she was the only one do you think there was anything in it id be surprised if there wasnt i think she was lonely and she was also lovely we met a lot of them betty cynthia gloria gwen and me wed go to dances mostly at the base or in harkside there were a few in hobbs end at the church but they were rather tame affairs betty goodall tended to take charge and im sure you can imagine there wasnt much fun to be had betty was a keen dancer oh did she love to dance but it was all waltzes and foxtrots oldfashioned stuff no jitterbugging she was good though her and billy went in for ballroom dancing in a serious way after the war won trophies and all where was i dances americans oh yes well lets face it most of the local lads were at war except those unfit for service or in reserved occupations and they just hung out in the shoulder of mutton and complained all the time the americans were different they talked differently spoke about places wed only dreamed of or seen at the pictures they were exotic exciting they also had all sorts of things we hadnt been able to get because of rationing you know nylons cigarettes and that stuff we were friendly with px which was the nickname of the chap who ran their stores sort of quartermaster i suppose and he used to get us all sorts of stuff gloria in particular she was definitely his favorite but she was everyones favorite gloria was like a beautiful exotic butterfly she attracted every man who met her there was something special about her she sparkled and glowed she radiated it this px what was his real name sorry love i cant remember come to think of it i dont know if i ever knew we always just called him px was there anyone else in particular after billy joe she developed a real soft spot for brad but after what happened to matthew she didnt want anything serious what about this brad what did he want he was a nice lad no doubt about it he was head over heels do you remember his second name sorry love thats all right said annie how long did they go out together there youve got me the best part of i think at least they were still seeing each other when i left at christmas christmas yes she beamed best christmas of my life my eric got wounded in the battle of the bulge silly bugger nothing serious but it got him an early discharge and he was home for christmas the doctor recommended a bit of sea air so we came here fell in love with the place and ended up staying we left hobbs end on boxing day wheres eric now oh hes out and about likes to go for his constitutional along the prom every morning then he stops by the pub and plays dominoes with his mates did gloria ever mention anything about having a baby alice looked puzzled no not to me and i never saw any evidence of children im not even sure she liked them wait a minute though what it was something i noticed when i was crossing the fairy bridge once something odd a bloke turned up a bloke in a soldiers uniform with a little lad in tow couldnt have been more than about six or seven holding his hand id never seen them before they went in to see gloria talked for a while then they left i heard voices raised when was this sorry love i cant remember it was after matthew had gone though i do know that and thats all that happened yes did you hear what was said no who was he do you know sorry dearie ive no idea did you ever ask gloria about him yes she went all quiet on me she did that sometimes all she would say was that it was relations from down south i thought maybe it was her brother and nephew or something you dont think i dont know said annie did they ever come back the man and the child not that i ever heard of and what happened to gwen and gloria after youd left i dont know i sent gloria a postcard must have been march or april of telling her that eric was better now and we were going to stay in scarborough and that she should come and visit us what happened nothing she never replied didnt you think that odd yes i did but there wasnt much i could do about it life goes on i wrote again a few months later and still got no reply after that i gave up you lose touch with a lot of people over the course of your life ive found it was the same with gwen i wouldnt say we were really close she was a bit too quiet and bookish for that but we did have some good times together after we moved here though i never saw or heard of her again did you ever go back to hobbs end no reason to after the war it was like a new life except for the same old rationing you just got on with it and tried not to dwell on the past im sorry i never saw gloria again she was a breath of fresh air but as i said when you get to my age you realize people lose touch all the time annie had found that true enough even in her own short life schoolfriends university colleagues lovers work partners there were so many people she had completely lost touch with they could be dead for all she knew like rob she let the silence stretch for a few moments then shifted in her armchair well alice she said i think thats all for now ill make sure i get the photograph back to you within a couple of days if i think of anything else ill get in touch with you she managed to get herself out of the deep comfortable chair by pushing her hands down hard on the arms please do alice got to her feet its been a great pleasure to me though i cant see as its done you much good me rabbiting on like this about the past youve been very helpful well its nice of you to say so dearie i must admit ive enjoyed having a good chinwag its been years since i thought about all that stuff hobbs end gloria gwen matthew the war i hope you find out who did this to her even if hes dead id like to know he died as slow and painful a death as he deserved we left the café saddened and dazed with hours to kill before our train home to tell the truth i dont think either of us at that time had much hope that matthew was still alive i asked gloria if she would take me to where she used to live but she refused that would have been simply too much for her to bear she said and i felt cruel for asking it stopped raining and the sun was trying to pierce its way through the ragged clouds we walked through st jamess park past the barrageballoon station and the antiaircraft guns toward oxford street though our hearts werent in it we did some shopping at least it took our minds off matthew for a short while on charing cross road i bought graham greenes new entertainment the ministry of fear as well as the last two issues of penguin new writing the latest horizon and some secondhand worlds classics copies of trollope and dickens for the lending library gloria bought a blackredandwhitechecked dorville dress at john lewiss it cost her three pounds fifteen shillings and eleven coupons she persuaded me into buying a utility design by norman hartnell in a shop nearby for only three pounds and nine coupons after fish and chips at a british restaurant we went to the carlton on haymarket to see gary cooper and ingrid bergman in for whom the bell tolls it was one of the first films i ever saw in technicolor color films not having made a real impact in harkside by then i hadnt read the hemingway novel so i couldnt judge how faithful the film version was it was getting dark when we walked out onto haymarket and gloria suggested we catch the underground back to kings cross it is hard to describe the london blackout especially on a broad busy street like haymarket as it is never fully silent anywhere so it is never fully dark either you can see the sharp edges and cornices of the buildings etched against the night sky in varying shades of darkness if the halfmoon slips out from behind the clouds everything shimmers in its pale light for a few moments and then disappears again what i noticed most of all was the noise the way blind people develop a more acute sense of hearing distant shouts and whistles engines laughter and singing from a public house perhaps a dog howling in the distance or a cat meowing down a ginnel all these sounds seem to carry farther and echo longer in the darkness of the blackout they all sound more sinister too unnatural is the word that comes to mind but what could be more natural than darkness perhaps it is a matter of context in the city especially such a sprawling busy city as london darkness is unnatural in piccadilly circus i could just make out the statue of eros buttressed by sandbags there was music coming from somewhere too a tune i later learned was glenn millers take the a train there were soldiers all over the place many of them drunk and on more than one occasion men approached us and grabbed us or offered us money for sexual favors at one point i heard some sounds down an alley and could just make out the silhouettes of a man grunting as he thrust himself toward a woman her back against a wall it made me think of that icy christmas of when i had seen gloria and the canadian airman mark in exactly the same position the underground platforms where people came to shelter during the air raids were crowded and i fancied i could smell sweat unwashed clothes and urine mixed in with the sooty smell the trains made everything was grimy and rundown the train soon came and we had to stand all the way no one stood up to offer us seats i was glad our train for home left on time and though i knew i would dream about the trip for weeks to come i cant say i was sorry when after a boring and uneventful journey of some seven hours we caught the morning train from leeds to harrogate thence to hook up with our little branch line back to hobbs end it was after seven oclock by the time banks and annie met up that evening on his way back from edinburgh banks got stuck in the midafternoon traffic around newcastle then he had to call in at the station to see if there had been any developments during his absence he had found about twenty telephone messages waiting for him in response to monday evenings television news appearance he spent an hour or so returning calls but all he found out was that someone thought the shackletons had moved to leeds after ve day and someone else remembered drinking with matthew shackleton in hobbs end near the end of the war most people though simply wanted to relive wartime memories and had no useful information whatsoever there was also a message from john webb who said he had cleaned up the button adam kelly had taken from the skeleton it was made of brass probably about half an inch in diameter and had a raised pattern on the front possibly reminiscent of wings the expert who had examined it suggested it might be some sort of bird clearly he added given the time period under consideration the armed forces came to mind perhaps the raf when banks had finished at the station he phoned annie and asked if she would mind coming up to gratly as he had been on the road most of the day she said she didnt mind at all then he went home took a long shower and tidied the place up it didnt take long next he tried phoning brian in wimbledon again still no luck what the hell was he supposed to do it was nearly a week since their argument he could go down there he supposed but not until the case was over anyway he decided to try again the next day he thought of cooking something for annie then decided against it learning to cook might be his next project after fixing up the cottage but he still had a long way to go besides there was nothing in the fridge except a couple of cans of lager half a tomato and a piece of moldy cheddar he would take her out to the dog and gun in helmthorpe for dinner and hope to god there was something vegetarian on the menu when annie arrived she first showed him the photograph of gloria and her friends with the american airmen then after a lightning tour of the house which she described as very bijou she agreed it was a perfect evening for a stroll they left their cars parked in bankss gravel laneway and headed for helmthorpe in the hazy evening light sharing the information each had learned that day as they walked sheep grazed on the lynchets that descended toward the driedup beck some of them had even managed to get through the gate at the back of the churchyard where they grazed among the lichendappled tombstones have time for a walk on the prom in scarborough banks asked of course had to eat didnt i i can tell you though theres not much choice for a vegetarian in scarborough i ended up buying some chips cooked in vegetable oil or so the woman said and sat on a bench by the harbor to eat them watching a man painting his fishing boat he tried to chat me up oh he didnt get very far im used to being chatted up by fishermen it takes more than heroic tales of landing haddock or halibut to get into my knickers i can tell you banks laughed saint ives right heard it all before got the tshirt anyway after that i went for a quick look at anne brontës grave then i came back to the station to write up the interview do you like anne brontës books i havent read any its just the sort of thing you do isnt it when youre nearby go and see where famous people are buried i saw the tenant of wildfell hall on tv its all right if you like that sort of thing what sort of thing governesses bodices tight corsets all that repressed victorian sexuality and you dont annie cocked her head i didnt say that it was early september now and the nights were drawing in fast when they got to the high street the sun was already low in the west a red ball glowing like an ember through the gathering haze and the shadows were lengthening sounds of laughter and music came from the open pub doors tourists tired after the day out and a big meal were getting in their cars and driving back to their cities annie and banks walked through the crowded bar and managed to find a table in the beer garden out back between the trees the dying sunlight streaked the river shallows bloodorange and crimson annie sat down while banks went to buy a couple of pints and order their food luckily annie said she wasnt very hungry and a cheeseandpickle sandwich would do her fine he was just in time they were about to stop serving its nice out here annie said when he came back with the drinks thanks cheers banks took a sip though there were a few other people sitting outside conversations seemed hushed so who have we got now then he asked now weve discovered that matthew was killed before gloria was annie leaned back stretched out her long legs and set them on the third white plastic chair at the table what about the boyfriend she suggested the american brad as her killer why why not or one of his pals she could have stirred them up set them against one another i get the impression that gloria was the kind of woman who exerted an enormous power over men brad could have been hoping for more than he got alice said she thought he was more keen on gloria than she was on him maybe she tried to shake him loose and he wouldnt go rowan woods wasnt far away it would have been easy for him to sneak in and out the back way i should think we definitely need to find out more about the americans in hobbs end said banks how do we go about that you can start with the american embassy they might be able to point you in the right direction i notice the subtle pronoun usage there you i dont suppose youre planning on spending a day on the phone banks laughed rank has its privileges besides youre so good at it annie pulled a face and flicked some beer at him if it makes you feel any better he added ill be trying to get more information on matthew shackleton from our own military authorities their food arrived and they both ate in silence for a while the river looked like an oil slick now there were no clouds but the air had turned more humid during the day and the setting sun turned the western sky scarlet and purple clusters of small buzzing insects gnats or midges hovered over the still shallow water what about michael stanhope banks suggested what possible motive could he have they were friends inordinate desire drink they can push a person beyond the normal limits and its likely stanhope was a bit beyond them anyway to start with if he was powerfully attracted to gloria if she wouldnt have anything to do with him sexually then painting her in the nude might have inflamed him beyond all reason lets admit it a man like stanhope cant have been entirely dispassionate all the time he had a naked gloria shackleton in his studio annie raised her eyebrows cant he perhaps you mean you couldnt be youd be surprised how dispassionate an artist can be anyway alice poole said she was sure they werent lovers and i believe her the impression i get is that a lot of villagers like the one you talked to projected negative feelings onto gloria i think she was basically a decent woman and a devoted wife but her good looks and her free and easy attitude gave her no end of problems especially with men eventually someone went over the top you sound as if you know what youre talking about annie turned away and stared at the dark river it had only been a teasing offhand remark but banks felt as if he had trespassed on some private reserve set her hackles up they still had to be careful with one another he realized a couple of nights of passionate abandon and a sense of having something in common as mutual outsiders werent enough to map the route through the emotional minefields that lay between them tread carefully he warned himself after a pause annie went on i think gloria was one of the few people in hobbs end who understood michael stanhope who took him seriously besides alice also said he was gay she couldnt know that for certain or he could have been bisexual i think youre pushing it a bit thats all youre probably right anyway theres one obvious flaw with the stanhope theory there is banks shoved his empty plate aside where do you think gloria was killed he asked in or very close to bridge cottage i thought wed already agreed on that because of where she was buried by the way annie consulted her notebook i forgot to tell you before but the blackout ended officially on the seventeenth of september not that it matters now we know gloria was still alive that christmas every little bit helps anyway whats your point most of the time gloria visited stanhope at his studio that would certainly have been the case if he was painting her that autumn if anything happened between them it would be more likely to have happened there thats all thats where she was naked in front of him if he killed her i dont think he would have risked carrying the body all the way back to bridge cottage he would have found some other way of disposing of her somewhere closer unless they were having an affair as you suggest in which case he might well have visited her at her own home would she risk that with gwen so close by possibly gloria certainly sounds unconventional and unpredictable from everything ive heard just going to his studio must have been scandalous enough given his reputation in the village good point elizabeth goodall certainly seemed to think their relationship was a scandal another drink better not annie said placing her hand over her glass ones my limit when im driving banks paused a moment his voice lost somewhere deep in his chest you dont have to drive home he said finally sure he was croaking annie smiled and put her hand on his arm her touch set his pulse going faster no but i think i should with it being a weeknight and all ive got a busy day tomorrow besides we agreed didnt we cant blame a bloke for trying mind if i have one she laughed course not banks went inside he hadnt expected annie to rise to his offer but he was disappointed that she hadnt he knew they had agreed to stick to weekends but surely there was room for a little spontaneity now and then he wondered if he would ever be able to figure out this relationship business it was easy when you were married at least you didnt usually have to make appointments to see one another on the other hand he and sandra hadnt seen all that much of each other and they had been married over twenty years perhaps if they had made more time for one another they would still be together the dinner crowd had thinned out leaving the lounge half empty mostly locals playing dominoes and darts in the public bar a group of kids sat in one corner and one of them put concrete and clay on the jukebox christ almighty thought banks unit it had been recorded before they were born he bought himself another pint and went back outside annie wasnt much more than a silhouette now and a beautiful one to his eyes with her graceful neck and strong profile staring at the river in that peculiarly relaxed and centered way she had he sat down and broke the spell annie stirred languidly she still had half her drink left which she swirled in her glass a few times before sipping what about her family banks asked family whose family gloria shackletons her family was killed in the blitz all of them thats what she told alice what about this mysterious stranger and the child who turned up looking for her you said she told alice that it was relations i know annie shook her head slowly thats what i dont understand it does seem odd doesnt it if she ran off and left a husband or boyfriend stuck with her kid that might be someone else with reason to be angry with her he could have tracked her down and killed her yes but maybe whoever it was didnt feel stuck with the kid maybe he loved the boy besides men do that sort of thing all the time and women dont kill them for it banks wasnt going to jump at that one the point is he said did this particular man feel strongly enough to track down the wife or girlfriend who bore his child and deserted him they did argue according to what alice poole told you gloria was still alive after he left he could have stewed for a while gone back weeks months later possibly annie admitted id also like to know what happened to the sisterinlaw gwynneth even with your appeals on the telly no ones come forward with any useful leads maybe shes dead maybe she is do you see her as a suspect annie frowned she looked like a tall strong woman in the photograph something could have happened between them maybe ds hatchley came up with something in london well find out tomorrow its been a long day a night bird called across the river in the silence then someone put an oasis song on the jukebox the kind of crime it was ought to be telling us something annie said after a slight pause what does it tell you that we havent considered already well it was obviously violent passionate somebody felt strongly enough about gloria shackleton to stab her so many times after strangling her first youve said it yourself gloria was the kind of woman men felt passionately about the sort to spark off strong feelings but there are probably a lot of things we dont know about what happened sorry i dont follow its an old crime scene annie all weve got is bones and a few odds and ends of corroded jewelry we dont know whether she was raped or sexually interfered with in any way first or after for all we know this might be a sex crime pure and simple the socos havent found any other victims buried in the area not yet besides sex crimes dont always mean multiple victims usually they do you cant tell me that someone raped and murdered gloria shackleton the way he did and never did it again before or after thats the point said banks think about it the body was buried in the outbuilding of gloria and matthews cottage the fact that we havent found any other bodies in the vicinity doesnt mean there arent any anywhere else it doesnt mean that whoever did it didnt kill elsewhere in exactly the same way a serial killer then a stranger to the area its possible ds hatchleys already put out a request for information on crimes with similar mos itll take time though and thats if anyone even bothers following it up people can be pretty lazy especially when what they want isnt on the computer lets face it were not exactly high on anyones priority list with this one still some curious or industrious pc might poke about and discover something ill have jim send out a reminder annie paused you realize we might never know who killed her dont you banks finished his drink and nodded if thats what it comes down to we make out a final report based on all the evidence weve collected and point at the most likely solution how do you think youll feel about that what do you mean its become important to you hasnt it oh im not saying i dont care i do but for you its something else it goes deeper you have a sort of compulsion banks lit a cigarette as he did so he realized how often he hid behind the smoke of his cigarettes somebody has to give a damn that sounds melodramatic besides is it really as simple as that nothing ever is really is it meaning banks paused and tried to frame his nebulous thoughts gloria shackleton i know what she looked like ive got some idea of her character and her ambitions who her friends were the things she liked to do to amuse and entertain herself he tapped the side of his head shes real enough for me in there where it counts somebody took all that away from her somebody strangled her then stabbed her fifteen or sixteen times wrapped her body in blackout curtains and buried it in an outbuilding but it happened years ago the wars been over for ages now murders happen all the time whats so different about this one banks shook his head i dont know nothing really partly its the war itself im older than you i grew up in its shadow and it cast a long one for a long time after it was over i was born with a ration book and a national identity card he laughed its funny you know the way people resist being named and counted these days but i was proud of that card when i was a kid it actually gave me an identity told me who i was maybe i was already in training for my warrant card anyway there were ruins all over the place in my hometown i used to play in them just like adam kelly and my dad had a collection of mementos i used to sneak up to the attic and play with when he was out an ss dagger a nazi armband there were pictures i used to look at photographs of the collaborators hanging from the balustrades in brussels it was another age before my time but in a way it wasnt it was much closer than that we used to play at being commandos we even used to dig tunnels and pretend to escape from prison camps i bought every book about fighter and bomber planes i could get my hands on my childhood and early adolescence were saturated with the war somehow the idea of a vicious murder like this one being committed while all that carnage was going on in the world makes it seem even more of a travesty if you see what i mean i think so what else bothers you thats the simple part as far as we can tell nobody reported gloria missing there was no hue and cry it looks as if nobody cared i had a friend once one day ill tell you about him anyway nobody cared then somebody has to i seem to be good at it overburdened with compassion a natural banks smiled am i still making sense annie brushed his sleeve with her fingers i care too she said maybe not for the same reasons or in the same way but i do banks looked into her eyes he could tell she meant what she was saying he nodded i know you do home annie stood up they walked out into the street much quieter now that night had fallen the fishandchips shop was still serving and two of the kids who had been in the pub were leaning against the wall eating from newspaper a whiff of vinegar drifted by at the top of the ginnel that ran past the churchyard was a swing gate and after that the narrow flagged footpath curved around the steep banks of gratly beck about half a mile up the daleside to the village itself luckily there was a moon for there was no other illumination on the path sheep scampered out of the way and bleated again banks thought of the blackout his mother had told him a story of a friend of hers who made her way home from work at the munitions factory by touching railings along the canalside before her left turn then five lampposts down the street it must have been in the early days banks thought before the lord beaverbrook ordered the collection of all railings for the war effort his mother had also told him about the enormous mountain of pots and pans on the cricket pitch that were supposed to be turned into aircraft once through the narrow stile at the other end banks and annie turned left past the new houses the pavement was broader there and annie slipped her arm through his the small act of intimacy felt good they crossed the stone bridge walked along the lane and stood at bankss front door coffee banks asked annie smiled no but ill have a cold drink if youve got one nonalcoholic he left her in the front room rummaging through his compactdisc collection while he went to the fridge it was eerie how the kitchen always gave him that feeling of peace and belonging even at night when the sun wasnt shining he wondered if he would ever be able to tell annie about it without feeling like an idiot he took out a carton of orange juice and poured them each a glass an old etta james cd started playing in the living room funky and fiery he hadnt played it in years annie walked in clearly pleased with her find youve got a hell of a cd collection she said its a wonder you can ever decide what to play it is a problem sometimes depends on the mood he handed her the glass and they went through to the living room soon etta was belting out jump into my fire and shakey ground sure you wont have a nightcap banks asked when annie had finished her orange juice no i told you ive got to drive back i dont want to get stopped by an overzealous country copper its a pity said banks i was hoping you might change your mind his mouth felt dry come to mama was playing now and the musics rhythmic slowmoving sensuality was getting to him he had to keep telling himself that annie was a detective sergeant someone he was working with on a case and he shouldnt even be thinking like this but the problem was that annie cabbot didnt seem like any detective sergeant he had ever come across before and she was the first woman apart from his daughter tracy to visit his new home well said annie smiling i didnt say i had to go just yet did i you dont have to get me drunk to get me in bed you know then she stood up crossed her arms in front of her and pulled her tshirt slowly up over her head she stood holding it in her hand head tilted to one side then smiled held her hand out and said come to mama there are giant redwood trees in california they say that can grow another layer around the dead and blackened wood if they ever burn in a forest fire matthews disappearance burned out my core like that and while over time i did grow another skin over it a harder skin there was part of me inside that was always black and dead there still is though over the years the new skin has grown so thick that most people take it for the real thing i suppose in a way it is real but it is not the original of course life went on it always does in time we laughed and smiled again stood on the fairy bridge and discussed the italian campaign lamented the shortages and complained about lord woolton pie and the national wholemeal loaf gloria threw herself into her work at the farm making it clear that she was indispensable because the government was putting even more pressure on women to work in the aircraft and munitions factories the idea of which terrified her rumor had it that there were spies from the labour exchange all over the place just looking for idle women if there were they left me alone too as i had enough work on my hands looking after an invalid mother and running the shop as well as firewatching and helping with the wvs taking out pies and snacks to the field workers in the area in october gloria had her hair done like veronica lake with a side parting curling inward over her shoulders i had the new short liberty cut because it was easy to manage and my hair just wouldnt do the things glorias did even if i put sugar water on it that month also gone with the wind finally came to harkside and gloria and mr stanhope practically dragged me to see it as it turned out i enjoyed the film and found it was made even more poignant by the death of leslie howard whose airplane had been shot down by nazi fighters in june mr stanhope battered hat on his head tapping with his snakehead handled cane as we walked back was enthusiastic about the use of color and gloria needless to say was potty about clark gable autumn mists came to our shallow valley often making it impossible for the airplanes to land or take off for days in september we heard that the rowan woods aerodrome had been closed and the raf had gone somewhere else it was hard to get a clear answer to any questions in those days but one of the ground crew told me that the twoengined bombers they had been flying were old and were being phased out of operation the runways at rowan woods had to be converted to be able to handle fourengined bombers he didnt know whether his squadron would be back or not things were so uncertain people coming and going at a moments notice whatever the reason the raf moved out and a crew of laborers mostly irish came in over the next couple of months they brought in tons of cement gravel and tarmac to bring the runways up to standard they also put up more nissen huts of course the character of village life changed a little during this period we had a few fights between the irish and the soldiers at the shoulder of mutton and we got used to the whiff of tar that would drift through the woods when the wind was blowing the right way early in december the laborers finished their work and shortly before christmas rowan woods became the new home to the united states eighth air forces th bomber group just like that the yanks had arrived alone after annie had left banks couldnt sleep despite the lovemaking and the long days drive he lay in the dark for a while his mind racing images of the old days in edinburgh of alison and jo keeping him awake and jem and annie and sandra and brian the first night banks had spent in the cottage a bat flew in the open window and it took him half an hour to coax it out again that was how his mind felt now like a misshapen black rag flapping about wildly inside him he felt an overwhelming sense of anxiety not about anything specific to such an extent that he began to sweat and his heart beat fast he put on his jeans and went downstairs to pour himself a small whiskey ever since he had become worried about his drinking in the dark months after sandras departure he had got into the habit of totting up his daily intake as he did with cigarettes a pint at lunchtime in edinburgh two pints with annie at the dog and gun and now one finger of laphroaig close to midnight not bad he had only smoked seven cigarettes too and he was especially proud of that he took the drink out to the wall and sat with his legs dangling over the driedup falls it was a warm night but a slight breeze rustled through the leaves and cooled the sweat on his forehead a little a small animal rustled through the undergrowth probably a squirrel or a rabbit banks looked into the dark woods and remembered robert frosts words which he had read recently in his anthology and miles to go before i sleep it was the repetition of that line that made it so memorable he thought that sent that tingle up your spine he didnt profess to understand it at least he couldnt have stood up in class and described what it was about but he got something from it he remembered what he had said to annie earlier about caring and how he couldnt tell her it was partly because of jem banks had found jems body himself on the bare dusty floor of the bedsit the needle still in his arm which was oddly discolored here and there where the mice had nibbled he was sick the same way he had been when phil simpkins spiraled slowly and inevitably down onto the spiked railings but people had cared about phils accident they even had a minutes silence in assembly and a morning off school for the funeral nobody had cared about jem though the way no one seemed to have cared about glorias disappearance over the years banks became inured to seeing corpses like any other detective who investigates a fair number of murders he developed a protective shell he could crack jokes at the scene with someones entrails spilling over his feet or brain matter sticking to the soles of his shoes but no matter how hard his carapace banks had always felt something no matter how low on the food chain the victim was he always felt some connection with what had once been a living person after jems death banks had felt driven to find out more about him who he was where he came from why no one seemed to care he realized how little he knew even though jem had been his first and closest friend in a new and overpowering city he was so innocent he hadnt even suspected that jem was a heroin addict they had smoked hash and grass together on occasion but that was all the police themselves hadnt been impressive hardly an advertisement for recruitment they interviewed banks who described the man he had seen entering jems flat the previous evening but they didnt seem interested one of them dc carter banks remembered played the concernedparent role feigning sadness at jems death lecturing banks on the drug subculture while the other ds fallon pockmarked face a cynical smile on his thin cruel lips rifled through bankss drawers and cupboards looking for drugs later banks found out that three junkies had died in nothing hill that week because a shipment of unusually pure heroin hadnt been adequately cut no arrests were made disenchanted with both business and sixties navelgazing banks joined the police force to change the system from within despite jems advice and when he found he couldnt do that he settled for the adrenaline buzz of the investigation the chase the revelation the strange bond with the murder victim who couldnt speak for herself and this bond was true no less in the case of gloria shackletons cracked and filthy bones than it was with a corpse so fresh you could still see the flush on its cheek finally tired with remembering banks put out his cigarette finished the whisky and went back inside his bed still smelled of annie and he was grateful for that much at least as he tossed and turned and tried to get to sleep ever since she had seen glorias image and heard her name on television vivian elmsley had been expecting the police to come knocking at her door it wasnt as if she had taken any great steps to cover her tracks she had never consciously sought to hide her past and her identity although she had certainly glossed over it perhaps also the life she had lived hinted at a certain amount of conscious escape at every stage she had had to reinvent herself the selfless carer the diplomats wife the eversoslightly withit young widow with the red sports car the struggling writer the public figure with the splinter of ice in her heart would that be the last which was the real one she didnt know she didnt even know if there was a real one though the worry and fear gnawed away at her since the tv broadcast vivian tried to live a normal life wandering up to hampstead in the morning reading the newspaper sitting down in her study for the day whether she wrote anything worth keeping or not talking to her agent and publisher answering correspondence all the while waiting for that knock on the door wondering what she would say how she could convince them she knew nothing or thinking that perhaps she should just tell them what she knew and let the chips fall where they would would it really make a difference after all this time yes she decided it would when it came though the shock came in a form she hadnt in the least expected that tuesday night the phone rang just as she was dropping off when she picked up the receiver all she heard was silence or as much silence as you ever get on a telephone line who is it she asked gripping the receiver more tightly please speak up more silence she was just about to hang up when she heard what she thought was a sharp intake of breath then a voice she didnt recognize whispered gwen gwen shackleton my names vivian elmsley there must be some mistake theres no mistake i know who you are do you know who i am i dont know what youre talking about you will soon then the caller hung up ten christmas it was a gloomy chill and moonless night when the th held their first dance at rowan woods gloria cynthia alice and i walked there together along the narrow lane through the woods our breaths misting in the air we wore court shoes and carried our dance shoes because they were far too precious and flimsy to walk in luckily the ground wasnt too muddy because none of us would have been caught dead wearing wellies to a dance even if we had to walk through rowan woods in a storm how many of them do you think there are cynthia asked i dont know said gloria its a big aerodrome though probably hundreds thousands even alice did a little dance ooh just think of it all those yanks with money to throw away they get paid much more than our boys you know ellen bairstow told me she went out with a gi when she was working at that factory near liverpool and shed never seen so much money dont you try to tell yourself they wont want something in return alice poole said gloria and dont you forget your poor eric away fighting for his country we were all a bit quiet after that i dont know about the others but i couldnt help thinking of matthew a fox or a badger suddenly flashed across the path and scared us but the adrenaline at least broke the silence we were still excited and we giggled like silly schoolgirls the rest of the way most villagers had already seen the newcomers around and i had even served some of them in the shop where they had looked puzzled at our meager offerings and confused by the unfamiliar brand names some people disapproved of their arrival especially betty goodall thinking it would lower moral standards but most of us quickly accepted them as part of the general scenery i even helped the local wvs set up a welcome club for them in harkside thus far in my limited experience americans had always been friendly and polite though i cant say i really warmed to the way they called me maam it made me feel so old they were certainly far more casual and confident in their manner than our lads and they had much smarter uniforms they even wore shoes rather than the great clodhopping boots the ministry saw fit to issue to our poor armed forces of course our view of americans was still almost entirely formed by the glamour of hollywood films magazines and popular songs to some they were all cowboys and gangsters to others the men were handsome heroes and the women beautiful and rather vulgar molls that evening as we trudged through the forest we had little real idea of what to expect we had all fussed about what to wear for days and we had taken special care with our appearance even me who was generally not overly concerned about such superficial matters under the overcoats we wore to keep out the chill we all had on our best dresses gloria of course looked gorgeous in her black velvet vneck dress with the puff sleeves and wide padded shoulders she had added a red felt rose at the neckline on the left side i was a little more serviceable in the utility dress i had bought in london one big problem was that we had all run out of fashion stockings and either we didnt have enough coupons to get new ones or we couldnt find any in the shops when gloria dropped by to meet me after i closed up shop the first thing she told me to do was stand on a chair why i asked go on youll see i could have said no but i was curious so i stood the next thing i knew gloria was lifting up my skirt and applying some sort of cold greasy stuff to my legs i squirmed what is that shut up and keep still its miners liquid makeup foundation cost me two and sevenpence halfpenny it did i kept still when the stuff she had slathered on my legs finally dried gloria had me stand on the chair again and she carefully drew a seam all the way down the backs of my legs with a special sort of pencil it tickled and again she had to tell me to keep still there she bit down on the corner of her lip and stepped back to admire her handiwork i stood on the stool feeling like an idiot holding my skirt up around my thighs thatll do she pronounced at last me next as i did her rubbing the foundation on her soft pale skin she started to laugh marvelous stuff this she said i was at my wits end the summer before last before matthew well anyway i was so desperate i tried a mixture of gravy powder and water what happened bloody flies chased me all the way from here to harkside and the damn things even buzzed around my legs inside the hall i felt like a piece of meat in a butchers window she paused ooh gwen do you remember what that looked like all those lovely cuts of meat in the butchers window dont i said youll only make us miserable we met the others by the fairy bridge cynthia garmen was going for the dorothy lamour look she had a black pageboy hairdo and wore a lot of makeup she even had mascara on her eyes which looked really strange as women tended not to use a lot of eye makeup back then it wasnt goodquality mascara when she got hot from dancing later in the evening it started to melt and she looked as if she had been crying she said she had bought it on the black market in leeds so she could hardly go back and complain alice was in her marlene dietrich period plucked eyebrows penciled in a high arch wavy blond hair parted in the center hanging down to her shoulders she was wearing a princessstyle burgundy dress with long tight sleeves and buttons all down the front it came in at the waist to show how thin she was almost as thin as marlene dietrich the dance was held in the mess we could hear the music before we even got there it was the song i remembered hearing in piccadilly circus a few months ago take the a train we stood outside the door touching up our hair checking our appearance one last time in our compact mirrors then we took off our coats not wanting to walk in wearing bulky winter overcoats stuffed our court shoes in the pockets and put on our dance shoes ready at last we made our grand entrance the music didnt stop though i swear it faltered for a moment the way records do sometimes when they become warped it was a sextet playing on a makeshift stage at the far end from the bar and they all wore american air force uniforms i suppose the odds are that when you gather so many disparate people together youre bound to end up with enough musicians for a band already the place was crowded with airmen and local girls mostly from harkside the dance floor was busy and a knot of people stood laughing and drinking by the bar others sat at the rickety tables smoking and chatting i had expected the large nissen hut to be cold but there was a peculiarlooking squat thing giving out heat in one corner which i later discovered was called a potbellied stove a very apt description i thought apparently the air force had brought it all the way from america having heard english winters were cold and wet and so were the summers they hardly needed it tonight though as the press of bodies and the motion of dancing exuded all the heat we needed the men had already covered the walls with photographs taken from magazines landscapes of vast snowcapped mountain ranges long flat plains and prairie wheatfields deserts dotted with huge twisted cacti and city streets that looked like scenes from hollywood films little bits of america brought over to make them feel less far away from home a christmas tree stood in one corner covered with tinsel and fairy lights and paper trimmings hung around the ceiling take your coats ladies why thank you said gloria it was gloria who had turned the heads of course even with dorothy lamour and marlene dietrich for competition she still stood way ahead of the field we handed our coats to the young airman who was tall slim and dark in complexion he spoke with a lazy drawl and moved with agile unhurried grace he had brown eyes short black hair and the whitest teeth i had even seen over here he led us to the far wall beside the bar where everyones coats hung theyll be safe here now dont you ladies worry when he turned his back gloria looked at me and raised an eyebrow in approval we followed him and held on to our handbags it was always awkward not knowing what to do with your handbag when you danced usually you left it under the table but cynthia once had hers stolen at a dance in harkside and now maam he said turning straightaway to gloria if i may have the pleasure of the first dance gloria inclined her head slightly passed her handbag to me took his hand and went off it didnt take long before someone snapped up cynthia too and i was holding three handbags but if i say so myself a rather handsome young navigator from hackensack new jersey called bernard which he pronounced with the emphasis on the second syllable asked me to dance even before his friend asked alice i passed the three handbags to her and left her standing there gawping in a way that marlene dietrich never gawped first you have to answer a question for me i said before i let him lead just to show i could be quite brave when i wanted to though i was secretly scared to death of all these brash and handsome young men all around me bernard scratched his head whats that maam whats an a train huh the music that was playing when we came in take the a train whats an a train ive always wondered is it better than a b train for example he grinned well no maam i mean its just a subway train subway you mean the underground yes maam in new york city the a trains the subway thats the fastest way to harlem ah i said the light finally dawning well i never okay then lets dance after kalamazoo stardust and april in paris we gathered at the bar and the tall airman who had taken our coats bought us all bourbon which we took to the table his name was billy joe farrell he hailed from tennessee and worked on the ground crew he introduced us to his friend edgar konig whom everyone called px because on american bases px meant the quartermasters stores which was exactly what he ran px was a gangly young iowan with a baby face and his fair hair shaved almost to his skull he was tall with nordic cheekbones pouting lips and the longest eyelashes over his cornflowerblue eyes he was also very shy far too shy to dance with any of us he never quite made full eye contact with anyone he was the sort of person who is always around but never really gets noticed and i think the reason he was so generous to us all was simply that it made him feel needed when i look back on that evening now over twentyfive years ago especially considering all that has happened since it seemed to go around in a whirl of dancing and talking and drinking and it finished before it really began i still remember the strange accents and the unfamiliar place names and phrases we heard the young faces the surprisingly soft feel of a uniform under my palm the biting yet sweet taste of bourbon the kisses whispered plans to meet again as the four of us walked tipsily back through the woods arms linked with our gallant escorts little did we know how before long wed be using words like lousy bum and creep in our daily conversation not to mention chewing gum and smoking luckies as we walked we sang shenandoah and after goodnight kisses agreed to meet them again in harkside the following week it was the first time banks had been to the queens arms for lunch in some months he had been trying to avoid boozing too much during the day partly because it was sometimes hard to stop and partly because it seemed too much a part of his old life it wasnt so much that he used to go there with sandra frequently though they often dropped in for a quick jar if theyd been in town together to see a film or a play just that the queens arms brought back memories of the days when his life and work were in harmony the days before jimmy riddle the days when he had enjoyed long brainstorming sessions with gristhorpe hatchley phil richmond and susan gay over a steakandkidney pud and a pint of theakstons bitter the days when sandra had been happy with their marriage and with her work at the gallery or so he had believed like many things he had believed it had all been an illusion only true because he had been gullible enough to believe in it in reality it had all been as flimsy and fleeting as an optical illusion it depended entirely on your point of view in calendar time perhaps those days werent so long ago but in his memory they sometimes seemed as if they had been dreamed by another person in another century even before he bought the cottage in those days when he had been out on the booze in eastvale nearly every night he had avoided the queens arms instead he had sought out modern anonymous pubs tucked away on the estates places where the regulars enjoyed their quiz trivia nights and their karaoke and paid no attention to the sad figure in the corner who bumped against the table a little harder each time he went for a piss he got into a fight only once with a paunchy loudmouth who thought banks was eyeballing his girlfriend a pastyfaced scrubber with bad hair it didnt matter that banks didnt think she was worth fighting over her boyfriend was ready to rock and roll luckily banks was never so pissed that he forgot the rules of barroom brawling get in first and get in nasty while the boyfriend was still building up steam verbally banks punched him in the stomach and brought up his knee to connect with his nose blood snot and vomit spattered his trousers everyone went quiet and no one tried to stop him leaving banks had always had a violent streak he knew that even when he used to talk about love and peace with jem that was one reason he could never fully give himself to the sixties scene in the first place only hang around the fringes the music was fine the pot was okay the girls were willing but the turntheothercheek philosophy sucked today he felt like indulging himself at the queens arms cyril the landlord welcomed him back like a longlost friend not remarking on his absence and glenys cyrils wife gave him her usual shy smile he bought a pint and ordered a yorkie filled with roast beef and onion gravy the pub was busy with its usual lunchtime mix of tourists local office workers and shopkeepers on their lunch breaks but banks managed to snag a small coppertopped table in the far corner between the fireplace and the diamondshaped amber and green windowpanes he had brought with him the folder ds hatchley had just dropped on his desk information gleaned from the central registry of births marriages and deaths with any luck it would answer a number of his questions already that morning he had phoned army records and asked about matthew shackletons service history they said they would verify his identity and call him back he knew from experience that the military didnt like people snooping into their affairs even the police but he didnt expect much trouble with this one after all matthew shackleton was long dead hatchleys notes confirmed that gloria was born on september as she had correctly noted on the st bartholomews register instead of simply giving london as her place of birth the official record listed london hospital mile end christ banks thought that was in the thick of the east end all right and a real villains thoroughfare these days it would certainly have made her a cockney an accent she had worked hard to lose if elizabeth goodall was to be believed her father was jack stringer whose illegible signature appeared in the signature residence and description of informant column along with the mile end address her mothers name was patricia mcphee the fathers rank or profession was listed as dock worker there was no column on the form to record the mothers next hatchley had checked to see if glorias parents had indeed been killed in the blitz and had pulled death certificates for the two of them dated september listing the same mile end address and injuries sustained during bombing as the cause of death a series of blackandwhite images passed through bankss mind vast stretches of rubble and craters acrid smoke drifting through the night air childrens screams flames licking sootblackened walls the screeching of the bombs before the shattering explosions houses only halfdestroyed so you could see inside the rooms the pathetic sticks of furniture framed photographs askew on the walls peeling wallpaper families huddled together under blankets in underground stations a few valued possessions with them the images came mostly from films and documentaries he had seen on the blitz his parents had actually lived through it moving to peterborough from hammersmith only after the war they never spoke about it much as most people who had been through it didnt but his mother had told him a comical story or two about the war days some of the images of the wars devastation came from bankss own experience when he was a child even that long after the war as he had told annie wastelands of rubble and halfdestroyed buildings remained in some areas for years he remembered visiting london as a child and being surprised when his father told him that the acres of flattened streets in the east end were there because of the war hatchley had been unable to find a death certificate for gloria kathleen shackleton but he did find one for matthew and the information on it caused banks almost to choke on his beer according to the death certificate matthew shackleton died at leeds general infirmary on march by his own hand cause of death was given as a selfinflicted gunshot wound at the time he was thirtyone years of age of no occupation living at an address in bramley leeds the informant of his death was listed as gwynneth vivian shackleton of the same address banks checked again but hatchley had made no mistake he lit a cigarette and thought for a moment matthew shackleton was supposed to have died in burma but obviously he hadnt of the three survivors of the old hobbs end days that banks and annie had talked to over the past few days one had left the village in before glorias arrival there the second had gone in may and the third at christmas neither elizabeth goodall nor alice poole had mentioned matthew shackletons returning so he must have come back after they had left which made him a definite suspect in his wifes murder again what had he come home to and why had he killed himself five years later banks flipped the sheet and carried on reading a marriage certificate existed for gwynneth vivian shackleton and ronald maurice bingham they were married at christ church hampstead on august the grooms profession was listed as civil servant ronald died of liver cancer at home on july there was no death certificate for gwynneth hatchley had dug even deeper and he had also discovered that there was a record of a child being born to gloria kathleen stringer at her parents home address in mile end london on november shortly after her sixteenth birthday november guy fawkes night banks imagined gloria struggling to give birth as catherinewheels spun and jumping crackers and bangers exploded outside in the street as volcanoes erupted dark red fire changing to green then white and rockets burst into showers of bright colors in the darkness beyond the bedroom windows did she look out on the scene from her pain did the noise and colors take her mind off what she was going through the boy was christened francis paul henderson taking his fathers surname george henderson like jack shackleton was listed as dock worker there was no trace of a wedding certificate so gloria had given birth over three years before she turned up in hobbs end what had become of the child and its father had she turned over the boys care completely to george henderson it looked that way she had certainly indicated to none of her new friends that she had a son was george henderson the man with the boy who had turned up at bridge cottage during the war the one gloria had argued with glenys brought over bankss yorkie he tucked into the huge stuffed yorkshire pudding and washed each mouthful down with a sip of theakstons according to hatchleys final search george henderson had died of a heart attack just five months ago there was no death or marriage certificate for his son francis that made three of them unaccounted for by death certificates gloria in all likelihood had been buried under the outbuilding but that still left gwynneth shackleton and francis henderson why hadnt they come forward one possibility was that they might both be dead though gwynneth would be in her early seventies and francis only pushing sixty hardly old in this day and age another possibility was that neither of them knew what was going on which was too much of a coincidence for banks to swallow there again maybe they had something to hide but what francis wouldnt be able to tell banks much everything that happened in hobbs end happened before he turned eight so he was hardly a suspect in the murder of gloria shackleton he would have been about sixteen when the village was flooded to make thornfield reservoir and banks doubted that the event would have meant anything to him nonetheless it would be interesting to know what had become of him if nothing else francis hendersons dna could help determine beyond a shadow of a doubt whether the skeleton really was gloria shackletons there was another issue too someone had to lay glorias body to rest bury her properly in a churchyard this time two people who had been intimately involved with her were possibly still alive her sisterinlaw gwynneth bingham and her son francis henderson they should be the ones to do it to bury their dead banks sighed put the files back in his briefcase and walked through the crowds across market street he found a message waiting at the front desk from army personnel informing him that matthew shackleton had been listed as missing presumed dead in and that was all they had on him curioser and curioser back in his office banks picked up the phone and called detective inspector ken blackstone at millgarth station in leeds alan said blackstone long time no see there was a coolness and distance in his voice they hadnt been in touch often over the past year or so and banks realized he had probably alienated ken along with just about everyone else who had tried to be his friend during the dark days ken had left a number of messages on his answering machine suggesting they get together and talk but banks had responded to none of them he didnt feel like explaining how he just hadnt been able to handle people offering help and encouragement feeling sorry for him how he was managing to feel quite sorry enough for himself thank you very much and how he had preferred to seek anonymity among the crowds instead you know how it is he said sure so what can i do for you dont tell me this is just a social call not exactly i thought not there was a slight pause then blackstones tone softened a little any new developments between you and sandra nothing except ive heard shes seeing someone im sorry alan these things happen tell me about it ive been there then you should understand i do want to get ratarsed and talk about it sometime banks laughed itll be a pleasure good so what can i do for you well if this little idea works out we might have that pissup quicker than you think im looking for the details of a suicide leeds bramley gunshot wound names matthew shackleton died the fifteenth of march the local cop shop should have some sort of record especially as there was a firearm involved is there an explanation in here somewhere long story ken by the way have you ever heard anything on the grapevine about a ds called cabbot annie cabbot cant say as i have but then ive not exactly been around the grapevine much for the past while why do you want to know all right i know dont bother another long story right look about this suicide it could take a while you mean youre talking minutes instead of seconds blackstone laughed hours instead of minutes more like ill get dc collins to make some phone calls if i can drag him away from his paper ill call you back later banks heard a grunt and the rustle of a newspaper in the background thanks ken he said appreciate it youd better you owe me a curry youre on and alan yes i know some of what youve been going through but dont be a stranger i know i know i told you youre on curry and pissup and talk about girls just like a couple of teenagers soon as you get the info blackstone chuckled okay talk to you later billy joe and gloria soon became a couple billy joe was seen going alone to bridge cottage and that got the village tongues wagging especially when px was seen coming and going there the next day he too seemed to have taken a shy sort of shine to gloria happy to be her slave and get for her whatever her heart desired i suggested gloria tell them to use the back door where they couldnt be seen from high street but she just laughed and shrugged it off there was no real mystery to the visits gloria told me she wanted sex and she had chosen billy joe to supply it she said he was good at it i still didnt understand what it was all about when i asked her if i had to be in love before i let men take liberties with me she lapsed into one of her mysterious silences then said theres love gwen and then theres sex they dont have to be the same especially not these days not while theres a war on just try not to get them mixed up then she smiled but its always nice to be a little bit in love after this i was more confused than ever but i let the subject drop gloria also needed her luckies nylons lipstick rouge and scented soap she drank too much so she needed a source for whiskey too and she also took to chewing gum which she insisted on chewing in church just to annoy betty goodall and px of course would get her all these things at the flutter of an eyelash whether she ever granted him any favors in exchange i cant say for certain but i doubt it whatever she was gloria was never a whore and i couldnt imagine px actually being with a woman in that way he looked even younger and seemed even shyer and more awkward than me there was some health reason that prevented him from serving in a more active branch of the forces after all he looked young and strong enough for combat but he never told anyone exactly what it was px did little favors for us all for me cynthia alice even mother especially when it came to nylons and makeup one thing i soon started to wonder about was why the american forces undoubtedly male as they were for the most part had storage rooms full of womens underwear and cosmetics it was either intended to endear them to the local women or they had certain private proclivities that they managed to hide from the rest of the world anyway lucky for us px seemed willing and able to get hold of just about anything we needed if we bemoaned the lack of decent meat for example he would mysteriously produce bacon and on occasion even a piece of beef once he even miracle of miracles came up with some oranges i hadnt seen an orange in years i dont think his empire was limited to the contents of the rowan woods px either sometimes when he got a weekend pass he would disappear for the entire time he never said where he went or why but i suspected he had a few dealings with the leeds black market i think i rather liked him even though he seemed so young and i might have gone out with him if he had asked me but he never did and i was too shy to ask him we were only together in a group besides i know he preferred gloria billy joe had other uses too he was essentially an airplane mechanic but he could also fix anything on wheels that came in useful when our little morris van gave up the ghost billy joe came down in the evening with px and a couple of others tagging along fixed it in a jiffy then the whole gang of us picked up gloria and went to the shoulder of mutton for a drink a curious incident occurred that night that colored my view of billy joe for some time to come they were the only americans in the pub and we were the only women in addition to getting us plenty of suspicious and disapproving glances even from people i had known for years and served in the shop this also drew a few loud and pointed comments most of the men there were either too old to go to war or were excused because of health reasons some were in reserved occupations just think about it bert said one local as we bought our first drinks our lads are over there fighting the nazis and them damn yanks are over here sniffing around our women like tomcats in heat we ignored them took a table in a quiet corner and kept to ourselves the next time we were ready for drinks billy joe went to the bar he was drinking pints of watery beer and i had told him to hold on to his glass because there was a shortage a lot of locals took their own and some even used jam jars but if you got one early in the evening you had to hold on to it for the night as he was on his way back one of the local strapping farm lads who hadnt been called up something to do with an allergy to tinned food i think called out after him hey yank thas taen me glass billy joe tried to ignore him but the man seth his name was had drunk enough to make him feel brave he lumbered over from the bar and stood right behind billy joe back at the table the place went quiet i said thats my glass thas got tha beer in yank billy joe put the tray down on the table glanced at the pint glass and shrugged same one ive had all evening sir he said in that lazy southern drawl same one ive had all evening sir seth tried to mock him but it didnt come out right well its mine sithee billy joe picked up his glass of beer turned to face seth slowly and shook his head i dont think so sir seth thrust his chin forward well i bloody do gimme it back you sure sir aye yank billy joe nodded in that slow way of his then he poured the beer all over seths feet and held out the glass to him you can take the glass he said but the beer was mine i paid for it and by the way sir ah am not a yankee even seths friends had started to laugh by now it was that sort of fulcrum moment when so much hangs in the balance just the lightest touch the wrong way sends it all tumbling down i could feel my heart beating hard and fast seth made the wrong move he stepped back and raised his fist but he was slow billy joe might have had that exaggerated sort of lazy grace but his speed amazed me before anyone knew what had happened there was the sound of breaking glass and seth was on his knees screaming hands over his face blood gushing out between his fingers ah am not a yankee sir billy joe repeated then turned his back and sat down the mood had soured nobody wanted anything more to drink and we all left shortly afterward vivian elmsley got up at about one oclock turned on the bedside light and took a sleeping pill she didnt like them didnt like the way they made her feel woollyminded the next morning but this was getting ridiculous they said old people didnt need as much sleep but lying tossing and turning all night imagining someone scratching at the window or tapping at the door was exhausting it was probably the wind she told herself as she turned off the light and settled back on the pillows but there was no wind slowly the chemical morpheus insinuated its way into her system she felt sluggish her blood heavy as lead pushing her down into the mattress soon she hovered on the threshold between sleep and waking where thoughts take on the aspect of dreams and an image you conjure up consciously is suddenly snatched away for unconscious improvisations like variations on a musical theme at first she pictured glorias tilted head as she had appeared on the tv screen the detail from stanhopes painting looking like a cartoongloria then the cartoongloria started talking about a night in rio de janeiro when vivian had had too much to drink and the only time succumbed to sexual advances at a cocktail party in a big hotel remembered a whispered room number waited until ronald was fast asleep and slipped out into the corridor the cartoonglorias monologue was cut with images of the night which flicked past jerkily like the series of cards in an old what the butler saw machine vivian had always wondered what it would be like they only did it once her lover was a gentle and sensitive woman from the french embassy conscious it was vivians first time but ultimately frustrated at her lack of ability to respond it wasnt for want of trying vivian thought she couldnt lose herself in sex with a man so she had hoped she could abandon herself to the caresses of another woman enjoy the bliss that writers wrote about and people risked everything for but she couldnt it wouldnt happen finally she put on her robe and hurried out humiliated back to her own room ronald was still snoring away she lay on her own bed and stared at the dark ceiling tears welling in her eyes a dull ache in her loins as the cartoongloria retold the story of vivians failed attempt at sex and infidelity it was as if the tv camera started to move away from her and the rest of gloria came into view showing more of her figure and before long vivian realized that gloria wasnt wearing a red dress she was covered in blood which oozed from cuts deep into the gristle of her flesh yet she was still talking talking about something that happened years after her death vivian tried to stop it but she felt as if she were being held down by the weight of her own blood an anchor hooked deep into the darkness and the horror too heavy she struggled to wake and as she did the telephone rang her bonds were suddenly cut and she shot up gasping for air as if she had been drowning without thinking she picked up the receiver a lifeline after a short pause the monotone voice whispered gwen gwen shackleton go away she mumbled her tongue thick and furred the voice laughed soon gwen the man said soon eleven banks and annie drove out to the estate from millgarth police headquarters when annie asked banks why he always wanted to do the driving himself he didnt really know the answer being driven was one of the perks of his rank that he had never really capitalized on partly he would always rather use his own car than sign one out because he didnt want to have to put up with other coppers cigarette butts in the ashtrays chocolate wrappers used tissues and god knows what else all over the floor not to mention the lingering germs and odors mostly though he needed to be in control with his feet on the pedals his hands on the steering wheel he also liked to control the music it had always angered sandra the way he put on whatever cd he wanted to listen to or turned on the television to a program he wanted to watch she claimed he was selfish he said he always knew what he wanted to listen to or watch and she didnt besides why should he listen to music or watch films he didnt like another standoff banks parked in front of a strip of shops set back from the main road near bramley town end and he and annie strolled down the hill toward the street where gwen and matthew shackleton had lived both were dressed casually neither looked like a police officer sometimes feelings against all forms of authority ran high on these estates people spotted strangers quickly enough as it was and they were naturally suspicious of anyone in a suit which was hardly surprising on an estate like this if you saw someone you knew wearing a suit you assumed he had a court appearance coming up and if you saw a stranger wearing one it was either the cops or the social banks had grown up on a similar estate in peterborough more modern than this one but basically the same mix of grim and grimy terrace houses alongside the newer red brick maisonettes and tower blocks all covered in graffiti when he was a kid the street was cobbled and they would have bonfires there every guy fawkes night the whole estate would come out and share their fireworks and food potatoes baked in foil at the edges of the fire and people passed around trays of homemade parkin and treacletoffee neighbors would seize the opportunity to chuck their old furniture on the fire a practice bankss mother said she thought was showing off if mrs green at number threw her battered armchair on the bonfire it was tantamount to telling everyone she could afford a new one eventually the council tarmacked the street and put an end to the celebrations afterward they had to have their bonfire on a large field half a mile away strangers from other estates started muscling in looking for trouble and the older people began to stay home and lock their doors how are we going to approach this annie asked well play it by ear i just want to get a look at the lie of the land it was another hot day people sat out on their doorsteps or had dragged striped deck chairs onto postagestamp lawns where the grass was parched pale brown for lack of rain banks couldnt help but be aware of the suspicious eyes following their progress from one garden a couple of seminaked teenage boys whistled at annie and flexed the tattoos on their arms banks looked at her and saw her stick her hand behind her back and give them two fingers they laughed they passed two girls neither of whom looked older than fifteen each was pushing a pram with one hand and holding a cigarette with the other one of them had short pinkandwhitedyed hair green nail varnish black lipstick and a nosestud the other had jetblack hair a large butterfly tattoo on her shoulder and a red dot in the center of her forehead both wore highheeled sandals tight shorts and midriffrevealing tops the one with the red dot also had a ring in her navel get her one of them sneered as banks and annie walked by little miss hoitytoity im beginning to think this wasnt such a good idea after all annie said when the girls had passed why not whats wrong easy for you to ask nobodys insulted you yet theyre only jealous what of my good looks no your designer jeans ah here it is the address turned out to be on one of the narrower side streets most of the doors had scratched and weathered paintwork and the whole street looked rundown all the windows of the old shackleton house were open and loud music blasted from inside next door two men with huge beer bellies sat smoking and drinking carlsberg special brew an enormous woman sat on a tiny chair at an angle to them hips and thighs flowing over the edge she looked as if she might be their mother both men were stripped to the waist skin white as lard despite the sun the woman wore a bikini top and garish pink shorts all three of them followed banks and annie with their narrowed piggy eyes but nobody said anything banks knocked on the door a dog growled inside the house the people next door laughed finally the door jerked open and a young skinhead in a red tshirt and torn jeans stuck his head out holding the barking dog by its studded collar it looked like a rottweiler to banks banks swallowed and stepped back a couple of paces he wasnt normally scared of dogs but this one had wickedlooking teeth maybe annie was right what could they find out anyway nearly fifty years after the fact who the fuck are you what do you want the skinhead asked the cords stood out on his neck he couldnt have been older than eighteen or nineteen banks thought he could hear a baby crying somewhere beyond the music in the depths of the house your mum and dad in banks asked he laughed i should think so he said they never go anywhere trouble is youll have a bloody long journey they live in nottingham so you live here course i fucking do look i havent got all day the dog was still straining at its collar drool dripping from its jowls but it had turned quieter now and seemed to be settling down just growling rather than barking and snapping id like some information said banks about what look can we come in you must be fucking joking mate one step over this threshold and gazza herell have you singing soprano in the church choir before you know it banks looked at gazza he could believe it he considered his options call animal control the rspca fine he said then maybe you can tell us what we want to know out here depends its the house im interested in the kid looked annie up and down then looked back at banks househunting are you then idve thought you two would be after something a bit more upmarket than this fucking slum not exactly househunting no who is it kev came a womans voice from inside kev turned around and yelled back mind yer own fucking business yer stupid cunt or youll be sucking yer meals through a straw for a week banks sensed annie stiffen beside him he touched her gently on the forearm the trio next door howled with laughter the kid stuck his head farther round the door so they could see him and grinned at them pleased with himself he gave them the thumbsup sign how long have you lived here banks asked two years whats it to you im interested in something that happened here fifty years ago a suicide suicide fifty years ago what fucking haunted is it he stuck his head around the door again to talk to the people next door hear that lads this is a fucking haunted house this is maybe we could start charging an entry fee like those fucking stately homes they all laughed including banks the kid seemed so thrilled with his audience response that he repeated the comment he then let go of the dog which glanced uninterestedly at banks and annie and slunk off deeper into the house no doubt toward a bowl of food maybe it wasnt a rottweiler after all banks was about as good on dogs as he was on wildflowers constellations and trees most of nature come to think of it but he would get better now he had the cottage by the edge of the woods he had already learned to identify some of the birds nuthatches dunnocks and blue tits and he had often heard a woodpecker knocking away at an ash trunk do you know who lived here before you he asked havent a clue mate but you can ask the wrinklies over the road theyve been here since the fucking ice age he pointed to the middle terrace house directly opposite mirror image banks could already see a figure peeking from behind motheaten curtains thanks he said annie followed him across the street i smell pork said one of the doorstep trio as they went the others laughed someone made a hawking sound and spat loudly after banks and annie had held their warrant cards up to the letter box for inspection the dead bolt and the chain came off and a hunched man probably somewhere in his early seventies opened the door he had a hollow chest deepset eyes a thin lined face and sparse blackandgray hair larded back with lashings of brylcreem that glint of selfpitying malice peculiar to those who have been knocked on their arses too many times by life had not been entirely extinguished from his rheumy eyes a few watts of indignant outrage at least remained making sure hed locked up behind him he led them into the house the windows were all shut tight and most of the curtains were closed the living room had the atmosphere of a hot and stuffy funeral parlor it smelled of cigarette smoke and dirty socks whats it all about then the old man flopped down on a sagging brown corduroy settee the past said banks a woman walked through from the kitchen about the same age as the man she seemed a little better preserved she certainly had a bit more flesh on her bones the old man reached for his cigarettes and lighter balanced on the threadbare arm of the settee and he coughed when he lit up what the future holds in store for us smokers if we dont stop banks thought glumly deciding against joining him just at the moment police elsie the man said come to do something about those hooligans she asked no said the man a puzzled frown creasing his brow they say its about the past aye well theres plenty of that about for everyone she said like a cuppa please said banks annie nodded sit yerselves down then im mrs patterson by the way you can call me elsie and this is my stanley stanley leaned forward and offered his hand call me stan he said with a wink elsie went to make the tea i see you met that lot over the street stan said with a jerk of his head we did said banks he threatened to beat his wife annie said have you ever seen any evidence of that mr patterson any cuts or bruises nay lass said stan hes all wind and piss is you kev colleend kill him like as not if he ever laid a finger on her and shes not his wife neither not that it seems to matter these days its not even his kid he took a drag on his cigarette which banks noticed was untipped and launched into a coughing fit when he recovered his face was red and his chest was heaving sorry he said thumping his chest all them years grafting in that filthy factory ought to bloody sue i did how long have you lived here banks asked forever or so it seems stan said it were always a rough estate even back then but it werent really such a bad place when we first moved in lucky to get it we were he smoked and coughed again elsie came back with the tea a cold drink would probably have made more sense banks thought but you take what youre offered stan was just saying youve lived here a long time banks said to her she poured the tea into heavy white mugs since we got married she said well we lived with stans mum and dad in pontefract for a few months didnt we love but this was our first home together she sat beside her husband and our last way things turned out stan said well whose fault were that werent mine woman you knew i wanted to move to that new raynville estate when they built it didnt you aye said stan when were that in and where is it now theyve had to knock the bloody place down now things got so bad there were other places we could have moved poplars wythers wythers wythers is worse than this what year was it banks butted in when you first came to live here the pattersons glared at one another for a moment then elsie stirred her tea she sat up straight knees pressed together hands around the mug on her lap in the distance banks could hear the music from the skinheads house tortured guitars heavy bass a testosteronepumped voice snarling lust and hatred christ he hoped brians band was better than that in elsie said october i remember because i were three months gone with derek at the time he was our first remember stan she said youd just got that job at blakeys castings aye said stan turning to banks i were just twenty years old and elsie here were eighteen banks hadnt even been born then the war had been over four years and the country was going through a lot of changes setting up the welfare state in the wake of the beveridge report setting up the whole system that had given banks far more opportunities and chances of selfimprovement than previous generations had and to his parents dismay he had become a copper instead of a business executive or managing director the sort of position his father had always looked up to now though having felt very much like a business executive this past year he was pleased to discover that he still thought he had made the right choice banks tried to imagine the pattersons as a young couple with hope in their hearts and a promising future before them crossing the threshold of their first home together the image came in black and white with a factory chimney in the background do you remember anything about your neighbors across the street annie asked directly opposite where kev and his family live now elsie spoke first werent that those you know those whatstheirnames lived stanley a bit stuck up there were some trouble a suicide banks prompted her aye thats right dont you remember stanley shot himself that tall skinny young fellow used to walk with a stick never said a word to anyone what were his name matthew shackleton thats right we had police all over the place they even came over and talked to us by gum that takes me back a bit matthew shackleton dont you remember stanley aye said stan hesitantly i think so he lit another cigarette and coughed then he glanced at his watch opening time did you know the shackletons banks asked not really elsie said acted like theyd gone down in the world fallen on hard times like from the country somewhere though i found out she were nowt better than a shopkeepers daughter not that theres owt wrong with that mind you im no snob i tried to be friendly you know like you do seeing as we were the newcomers and all that but nobody bothered with them the time or two i did talk to her she didnt say owt about where they came from except to mention that things had been different back in the village like well ladida i thought well banks thought from hobbs end to this leeds council estate would have been quite a frightening journey into purgatory for gwen and matthew unless they were in a purgatory of their own making already how many of them lived there just the two elsie said i remember her saying her mother used to live with them and all but she died a year or so before we moved here aye stan chirped in i remember them now just the two of them werent there him and his wife tall gangly lass herself nay said elsie she were never his wife he werent right in his head who were she then i dont know but she werent his wife how do you know banks asked elsie they didnt act like man and wife i could tell dont be so bloody daft woman stan said then he looked at banks and rolled his eyes she were his wife take it from me what was her name banks asked its on the tip of my tongue elsie said blodwyn said stan summat welsh anyroad no it werent gwynneth that were it gwynneth shackleton what did she look like ordinary really apart from them beautiful eyes of hers said elsie like stanley said she were a bit taller than your average lass and a bit clumsy you know the way some big people are she were nearly as tall as matthew how old would you say she cant have been that old but she had a harddoneby look about her i dont know how to say it really old before her time tired like mustve been from looking after her husband he were an invalid battle fatigue war wound he werent her husband stan turned to face her did you ever see her stepping out with a young man come to think on it no i dont recall as i did there you are then goes to show show what youdve thought if she werent married shed have had a boyfriend or two girl like that wouldnt you ill grant you she were no oil painting but she were well enough shaped where it counts and she were bonny enough did they ever have many visitors banks asked not as i noticed elsie answered but im not one of your noseatthewindow types you know how about an attractive young woman with blond hair annie said turning to stanley might have looked like this she handed him the copy of alice pooles photograph and pointed to gloria no said stan never seen anyone looked like her and i think id remember he winked at annie im not that old tha knows but the other ones gwynneth all right he pointed to the woman alice had identified as gwen shackleton i cant recall as they ever had any visitors come to think on it aye youre right there stanley she said they kept to themselves what happened after the suicide banks asked she went away do you know where no she never even said goodbye one day she were there the next she were gone ill tell you what though what asked banks a wicked smile twisted her features i know who she is what do you mean her that gwynneth shackleton thats not her name now of course but its her right enough done right well for herself she has who is she ive seen her on telly seen her picture in womans own yer barmy woman stan piped up im telling you stanley its her those eyes the height the voice i dont forget things like that im surprised you cant see it for yourself banks was trying hard to remain patient and beginning to think he was fighting a losing battle mrs patterson elsie he said finally do you think you could tell me who you think gwen shackleton is its that woman writes those books isnt it always being interviewed on telly and she did that documentary about that little church in london you know like alan bennett did on westminster abbey used to live just down the road did alan bennett his dad were a butcher anyroad you could see it were her how tall she were and those eyes what books banks asked them detective books always on telly with that goodlooking whatsisname playing the inspector good they are too ive had her books out of the library i must go through ten books a week its her im telling you shes thinking of that vivian elmsley woman sighed stan swore the first time she saw her interviewed by that bloke who talks through his nose melvyn bragg aye him swore blind it were gwen shackleton you dont agree annie asked nay i dont know lass im not good at faces not the way our elsie is shes always telling me someones baby looks like his mum or dad but im buggered if i can see it they all look like winston churchill to me or edward g robinson there is a resemblance but he shook his head its so long ago people change and things like that dont happen to people like us do they people from places like this someone across the street gets famous and writes books that get done on telly and all i mean lifes not like that is it not here not for the likes of us what about alan bennett elsie argued and she were wellread you could tell that about her in the brief silence that followed banks heard more music and laughter from across the street you hear what its like stan said never a moments peace day and night night and day bloody racket we keep our windows shut and curtains closed you never know whats going to happen next we had a murder last week bloke down the street playing cards with some bloody gyppos vinnie and derek our lads they worry about us theyd like us to go live in sheltered housing we might just do it and all right now id settle for three squares a day and a bit of peace and quiet back to this woman said banks turning to elsie gwen shackleton aye how long did she stay on the estate after the suicide oh not long id say as long as it took to get him buried and get everything sorted out with the authorities were the police suspicious about what happened police are always suspicious arent they said stan its their job he laughed and coughed nay lad you ought to know that banks smiled was gwen in the house at the time of the suicide he asked elsie paused and lowered her head thats what they asked us back then she said ive thought and thought about it to this day and i still dont know i thought i saw her get back from the shops that was where shed been shopping up town street before i heard the bang she frowned but you see i were so close to having our derek and i werent always seeing things right i could have been wrong did you tell the police this yes but nowt came of it or theyd have put her in jail wouldnt they now banks definitely wanted to have a look at the matthew shackleton file we might as well be off he said to annie then turned to stan and elsie thanks very much youve been a great help tell me summat said stan i know getting information out of you lots like prizing a penny from a scotsmans arse but im curious this gwen were she his wife banks smiled his sister we think elsie nudged her husband hard in the ribs he started coughing see stanley i told yer so yer great lummox banks insisted they could find their own way out and soon he and annie walked gratefully in the fresh air the people across the street were still enjoying their party joined now by kev and his dog which was running wild across the tiny lawns scratching on doors and ripping up what weeds had survived summer so far another woman whom banks assumed to be colleen was also there holding her baby she was a skinny girl about seventeen smiling no bruises but with a hard defeated look about her as banks and annie neared the end of the street an empty beer can skittered across the tarmac behind them what do you think about this vivian elmsley business annie asked i dont know im surprised that neither elizabeth nor alice mentioned it maybe they didnt know alice said shes got very poor eyesight and elizabeth goodall didnt even know why you were visiting her she pays so little attention to current affairs true said banks and ruby kettering left hobbs end in when gwen was only about fifteen definitely worth looking into so said annie back in the car what next the local nick i want to see matthew shackletons file i thought so and then back to millgarth have we time for a drink and a bite to eat later sorry ive got a date she thumped him playfully seriously seriously with a detective inspector a male detective inspector called ken blackstone you met him briefly he gave us the address i remember him the snappy dresser cute if annie was disappointed she didnt show it banks explained his tenuous friendship with ken and how he was in a mood for building bridges things seemed to be coming together for him the cottage an active investigation annie and he realized that he had been neglecting his friends for too long i see annie said a boys night out then i suppose so she laughed i wouldnt mind being a fly on the wall at that one billy joe was confined to base for a few weeks they said his punishment would have been far more severe had not all the witnesses even seths friends attested that he didnt start the fight seth was fine too at first i thought billy joe had broken the glass in his face but it had simply fallen off the edge of the table when he had tried to put it back there before preparing to defend himself all billie joe had done was punch seth in the nose and everyone agreed it was well deserved gloria never said as much but i think the incident put her off billy joe she hated violence some girls like being fought over ill never forget the primal blood lust in cynthia garmens eyes when two soldiers fought over her favors at one of the harkside dances she didnt care who was hitting whom as long as someone was getting hit and blood was flowing but gloria wasnt like that violence upset her it was while billy joe was confined to base that we first met brad and charlie we were walking out of the lyceum it was a miserable february night in not snowing but freezing cold with icicles hanging from the cinemas eaves we hadnt been out for a few days and gloria was getting depressed with the cold and the hard working conditions at the farm she needed cheering up we had been to see bette davis and paul henreid in now voyager and we were both humming the theme song as we put our coats back on in the foyer before going out into the bitter cold evening before gloria could dig out her own cigarettes a young man in a fleecelined leather jacket walked over put two cigarettes in his mouth lit them then handed one to her it was the same thing they had done in the film we doubled over laughing brad said the young man brad szikorski and this is my pal charlie markleson gloria did a little mock curtsy charmed to meet you im sure were with the four hundred fortyeighth over at rowan woods though they were statements they sounded like questions i had noticed this before with both americans and canadians i dont mean to be forward said brad but would you ladies care to honor us by joining us for a drink we exchanged glances i could tell gloria wanted to go brad was tall and handsome with a twinkle in his eye and a little clark gable mustache i looked at charlie who was probably destined to be my companion for the evening and i had to admit i quite liked what i saw about the same age as brad he had intelligent eyes if a little puppydog and a rather pale thin face his nose was too big and it had a bump in the middle but then mine was nothing to write home about either he also seemed reserved and serious all in all hed do at least for a drink we walked across to the black swan the village green was deserted and the ice crackled under our feet icicles hung from the branches and twigs of the chestnut trees and frost covered the bark if it hadnt been so cold i could have imagined they were blossoms in may behind us the illuminated sign over the lyceum went off even in the blackout cinemas shops and a few other establishments were allowed a small measure of light unless the airraid siren went off ahead st judes was partially lit and close by stood the black swan with its familiar timberandwhitewash facade and sagging roof we could hear the sounds of talking and laughter from inside but heavy blackout curtains covered the mullioned windows the pub was crowded and we were lucky to get a table brad went to the bar for drinks while we took our coats off a meager fire burned in the hearth but with all the warm bodies in there it was enough also in the black swan brad and charlie werent the only americans it seemed to be a popular place among the rowan woods crowd and there were even some gis from the army base near otley they were loud and they used hand gestures a lot they also seemed to push and shove one another a lot in a friendly way as children do brad came back bearing a tray of six drinks we wondered who was going to join us gloria and i were both drinking gin and when brad and charlie picked up their beer glasses then poured the small measures of whiskey into them our unspoken question was answered nobody just another american peculiarity we toasted one another and drank then brad did the thing with the cigarettes again and charlie did it for me what do you do gloria asked im a pilot said brad and charlie heres my navigator a pilot how exciting where are you from california gloria clapped her hands together hollywood well not exactly a little place called pasadena you probably havent heard of it but you must know hollywood brad smiled revealing straight white teeth they must have wonderful dentists over in america i thought and people must have enough money to be able to afford them as a matter of fact yeah i do he said i did a little stunt flying there in the movies before i came over here you mean youve actually been in pictures well you cant really see its me but i mean yeah i guess so he named a couple of titles we hadnt heard of either of them thats what i want to do when all this is over he went on get back there and get in the movie business my fathers in oil and he wants me to join him i know theres plenty of money there but thats not what i want i want a shot at being a stunt man if gloria was disappointed that brad didnt want to be an oil millionaire or a movie star she didnt show it as they chatted away excitedly about films and hollywood charlie and i started our own hesitant conversation the beer and whiskey must have melted a little of his reserve because he opened by asking me what i did he regarded me seriously as i told him his expression unchanging nodding his head every now and then then he told me his father was a professor at harvard that he had completed his university degree in english just before the war and when he went back he wanted to go to harvard too to study law he liked flying he said but he didnt see it as a career the more we talked the more we found we had in common jane austen and thomas hardy for example and the poetry of t s eliot and robert frost and edward thomas he hadnt heard of many of our younger poets so i offered to lend him some issues of penguin new writing with poems by macneice auden and day lewis and he said he would lend me tate and bishops american harvest anthology if i took special care with it i told him that i would no more damage a book than i would a living human being and that made him smile for the first time have you got a husband i overheard brad ask gloria i mean i dont mean to you know its all right i did have but hes dead killed in burma at least i hope to god he was i turned from charlie it was true that we had tried to convince ourselves of matthews death but there was still a lingering hope at least in my mind and i thought that was a terrible thing to say i told her so she turned on me eyes flashing well you should know better than anyone that im right gwen youre the one who reads the newspapers and listens to the news arent you yes look im really sorry brad cut in but gloria ignored him kept staring at me so you must know what theyre saying about the japanese about the way they treat their prisoners she went on i had to admit that i had read one or two rather grim stories alleging that the japanese beat and starved prisoners to death and according to anthony eden torture and decapitation were favorite pastimes in their pow camps the daily mail called them monkey men claimed that they were subhuman and should be outlawed after they had been beaten back to their savage land i didnt know what to believe if the stories were true then i should probably agree with gloria and hope to god matthew was dead ive got friends fighting in the pacific said charlie i hear its pretty rough out there a lot of these stories are true well hes dead anyway said gloria so nothing can hurt him now look this is too depressing can we have another round of drinkies please brad and charlie drove us home in their jeep charlie seemed a little embarrassed when brad and gloria started kissing passionately by the fairy bridge but he managed to pluck up the courage to put his arm around me we kissed dutifully and arranged to meet again soon to swap books brad told charlie to drive on that hed walk back to the base alone later and he followed gloria into bridge cottage the indian restaurant ken blackstone had chosen was a holeinthewall on burley road with red tablecloths and a bead curtain in front of the kitchen every time the waiter walked through the beads rattled sitar music droned from speakers high on the walls and the aromas of cumin and coriander filled the air did you find what you were looking for in those incident reports blackstone asked as they shared popadams samosas and pakoras i wasnt after anything in particular banks said elsie patterson was unsure as to whether she saw gwen shackleton enter the house with her shopping before or after she heard the shot she even thought the shot might have been a car backfiring and she was the only witness nobody else saw gwen or matthew that day the other neighbors were at work the local kids at school what did gwen shackleton say in her statement banks swallowed a mouthful of samosa so far the food was excellent as ken had promised it was neither too greasy nor too needlessly hot the way many indian restaurants made it mistaking chili peppers and cayenne for creative spicing banks thought he might like to try his hand at indian cooking have annie over for a vegetarian curry she just said she found matthew dead in the armchair when she got home from shopping was there any real doubt was she ever a suspect i didnt get that impression matthew shackleton had a history of mental illness since the war he was also an alcoholic functioning more or less but an alcoholic according to the report he had tried to kill himself once before head in the gas oven that time a neighbor smelled gas and saved him the hospital suggested a period of psychiatric observation which they carried out then they sent him home again why didnt he use the gun that time no idea but it was just a matter of time seems that way you disagree no though i suppose theres always the possibility that he was helped on his way that he had become an intolerable burden to his sister remember gwen had been taking care of both her mother and her brother its not much of a life for a young woman is it anyway if elsie patterson really did see gwen shackleton go into the house before the shot was fired its possible gwen might have stood by and let him get on with it still a crime yes but it happened over forty years ago ken and wed never prove it not unless gwen shackleton confessed why should she do that years of accumulated guilt the need to get it off her chest before her final confrontation with the almighty i dont know who knows why people confess they do though their main courses arrived aloo gobi rogan josh and king prawn with pilao rice lime chutney and chapatis they ordered more lager banks looked at blackstone cute annie had said cute was the last thing that came to bankss mind elegant yes donnish even but cute no matter where blackstone was student hangout backstreet pub fivestar restaurant cop shop he was always immaculately dressed in his burtons best pinstripe or herringbone monogrammed silk handkerchief poised over the edge of his top pocket folds so aesthetic and delicate they might have been set by a japanese flower arranger crisp white shirt neat windsor knot in his subdued tie thinning sandy hair curled around his ears and his wirerimmed glasses balanced on the bridge of his straight nose what about forensics blackstone asked single shot in the mouth splattered his brains over the wall like blancmange no evidence of a struggle empty whiskey bottle by the chair the angle of the wound was also consistent with the suicide theory note yes the genuine article according to forensics so whats bothering you banks ate some curry and washed it down before answering already a pleasant glow was spreading from his mouth and stomach throughout the rest of his body the curry was just hot enough to produce a mild sweat but not to burn his taste buds off nothing really outside of normal curiosity im not really interested in whether gwen shackleton helped her brother commit suicide or not but i would like to know if he murdered gloria shackleton perhaps he couldnt live with the guilt my first thought but now oh its still the most likely explanation the only person who can tell us is gwen shackleton what happened to her is she still alive thats another interesting thing elsie patterson swears shes vivian elmsley blackstone whistled and raised his thin arched eyebrows the writer thats the one what do you think i dont know its possible i suppose the pattersons said they could tell gwen was wellread and everyone who remembers her said she always had her head stuck in a book annies going to ask around but theres only one way to find out for certain isnt there well have to talk to her like glorias son if hes still alive she certainly hasnt been in touch with us and weve had calls out all over the country for information its hard to imagine that many people dont know the story which may mean that if it is her she has a reason for not wanting to be found exactly a guilty secret wasnt that the title of one of her books banks laughed was it i cant say as ive read any i have said blackstone seen them on telly too shes actually a very talented writer hasnt a clue about how we really operate of course but then none of them do itd make for some pretty boring books if they did true enough blackstone ordered a couple more pints of lager he looked at his watch how about heading into town after this one he asked okay how are the kids fine i suppose well at least tracy is brian silly buggers just cocked up his finals and come out with a third blackstone who had a degree in art history frowned any particular reason you dont blame yourself do you the breakup stress banks shook his head no not really i think he just sort of lost interest in the subject and found something he felt more passionate about the music uhhuh hes in a band theyre trying to make a go of it good for him said blackstone i would have thought youd approve thats the bloody problem ken i do only when he first told me i said some things i regret now i cant get in touch with him to explain theyre out on the road somewhere keep trying thats about all you can do i sounded just like my own parents it brought back a lot of stuff things i hadnt really thought much about in years like why i made some of the choices i did any answers banks smiled on a postcard please any great change in your circumstances tends to make you introspective its one of the stages you go through been reading those selfhelp books again ken blackstone smiled fruits of experience mate this ds you were asking me about on the phone the one who was with you at millgarth whats her name again annie annie cabbot goodlooking woman i suppose so you involved with her banks paused if he told ken blackstone the truth that would be one person too many who knew about them but why keep it a secret why lie ken was a mate he nodded briefly is it serious for crying out loud ken ive only known her a week blackstone held his hand up okay okay is she the first one since sandra yes well apart from a mistake one night yes why just be careful thats all come again blackstone leaned back in his chair youre still vulnerable thats what im talking about it takes a long time to get over a relationship as longlasting and as deep as yours and sandras im not sure how deep it went ken im beginning to think i believed what i wanted to believe missed the signposts to the real world whatever all im saying is that when someone goes through what youre going through he either ends up angry at women for a long time or he misses what he had or both if hes angry then he probably just shags them and leaves them but if he misses the relationship then he looks for another one to replace it and his judgment is not necessarily in the best of nick if hes both then he gets into another relationship and fucks it up royally all around and wonders why everyone ends up in tears banks pushed his chair back and stood up well thanks for the amateur psychology ken but if id wanted claire fucking rayner blackstone grabbed on to bankss sleeve alan sit down please im not suggesting you do anything except be aware of the pitfalls he smiled besides youre bloodyminded enough to do what you want in any situation i know that all im saying is think about what you want and why you want it be aware of whats going on thats all the wisdom i have to offer youve always struck me as a bit of a romantic underneath it all banks hesitated still half ready to leave and half ready to punch blackstone what do you mean the kind of detective who cares just a bit too much about every victim the kind of bloke who falls a little bit in love with every woman he sleeps with banks glanced at blackstone through narrowed eyes i havent slept with that many women he said and as for sit down alan please banks paused for a moment when he felt the anger sluice away he sat what does she feel about it all banks reached for a cigarette he felt uncomfortable as if he were in the dentists chair and blackstone were probing a particularly sensitive nerve he had never been good at talking about his feelings even with jenny fuller who was a psychologist it was something he had in common with most of his male friends and it gave him a special solidarity with yorkshiremen he should have remembered that ken blackstone was a bit artsy read freud and that sort of thing i dont know he said i havent asked her we havent really talked about it blackstone paused banks lit his cigarette on a night like this one was shaping up to be he might go over his allowance alan blackstone went on ten months ago you thought you had a stable marriage of more than twenty years standing house kids the full monty then all of a sudden the carpets pulled out from under you and you find youve got nothing of the kind the emotional fallout from that sort of upset doesnt go away overnight mate i can tell you and believe me i speak from experience it takes years to get it out of your system enjoy yourself just dont make it more than it is youre not ready to deal with that yet dont confuse sex and love he slapped the table shit now i am starting to sound like claire rayner i didnt really want to get into this why did you start it then blackstone laughed god knows because ive been there maybe bit of personal therapy like anything its probably more about me than you maybe im just jealous maybe i wouldnt mind sleeping with an attractive young ds myself lord knows its been a bloody long time ignore me banks finished his pint and put the glass down slowly look i take your point ken really i do but to be honest its the first time ive felt comfortable with a woman since sandra left not comfortable so much thats not the right word annies not a woman you necessarily feel comfortable with shes a little weird bit of a free spirit very private hell though its the first time ive really felt free enough to jump into something and say damn the consequences blackstone laughed and shook his head slowly sounds like youve got it bad he looked at his watch what say we hit the fleshpots of leeds and get irredeemably pissed banks smiled most sensible thing youve said all night lets do it and ive got a fine malt tucked away at home for afters even better lead on winter finally gave way to a slow spring with its snowdrops in rowan woods then the bluebells crocuses and daffodils brad and charlie became our regular beaux and we saw far less of billy joe who became very sulky after he found he had lost gloria to a pilot the americans always seemed more casual about rank unlike the english i suppose it is because our class system instilled it in us from birth while americans were all created equal or so they say it must be nice for them it would probably be confusing for us but its one thing for officers and enlisted men to eat drink and billet together and quite another for a second lieutenant to steal a mere sergeants girl i was worried that billy joe would start a fight given his violent streak but he soon found another girl and even started talking to us again when we met at dances and in pubs he pestered gloria on occasion to go back with him or at least just to sleep with him again but she was able to keep him at bay even when shed been drinking px of course remained absolutely essential so we made sure we still cultivated him as none of us had actually gone out with him anyway we had no reason to think our new relationship with brad and charlie would have any effect on the friendship and it didnt seem to i wont say that my affair with charlie was a grand passion but we became less awkward with the physical side of things as time went on and he did become the first man i ever slept with he was gentle patient and sensitive which was exactly what i needed and i came to look forward to those times we spent in bed together at bridge cottage courtesy of gloria our relationship remained more of an intellectual one we passed books back and forth with abandon forster proust dostoevsky charlie wasnt dull and dry though he loved to dance and was a great humphrey bogart fan he took me to see casablanca and the maltese falcon even though he had seen them both before he was also far more passionate about classical music than i was and we sometimes went to concerts once i remember we went all the way to huddersfield to see benjamin britten conduct his own hymn to st cecilia in all the excitement we were probably guilty of neglecting the people who had been good to us in the worst days after matthews disappearance especially michael stanhope we redeemed ourselves with him a little when he had an exhibition in leeds charlie and i made a weekend of it and went to stay at the metropole hotel charlie who knew a lot more about painting than i did praised the exhibition to the skies and i think mr stanhope was rather taken with him even gloria went to see mr stanhope at his studio that summer and autumn far more often than she had before i tried not to dwell on the dangers inherent in charlies job and for his part he never seemed to want to talk about them the war receded into the distance during those hours we spent together reading or making love though it was difficult to ignore the rest of the time the americans were carrying out precision daylight bombing raids over germany often without fighter cover and their casualties were appalling instead of listening to the drone of the planes taking off after dark i now heard them in the mornings the flying fortresses were much louder than the raf planes that had been there before they would warm up the engines at about five oclock which was the time i usually awoke anyway and i would lie there stealing an extra few minutes of warmth and imagine charlie checking his maps and preparing himself for another raid charlie told me that up around twenty thousand feet they were flying at temperatures of between minus and minus degrees fahrenheit i couldnt imagine anything that cold he had to wear long woolen underwear and electrically heated flying suits under his fleecelined leather jacket i had to laugh when he said it would take him half an hour to get undressed and into bed with me and so life went on books bed pictures dances concerts talk double summertime began on the second of april that year giving us the long spring evenings to go for walks to pick wildflowers in rowan woods or idle down by the river in may when it was warmer we would often sit on the banks of harksmere and read coleridge and wordsworth out loud to one another we had picnics of spam and pottedshrimp sandwiches on the terraces just off the edge mother liked charlie i could tell though she didnt say much she never did matthews disappearance had taken most of the wind out of her sails but charlie brought her lifesavers and hershey bars and she thanked him and ate them all after the excitement of the normandy landing we soon got back to reality the summer of the doodlebugs we only experienced one v rocket in hobbs end one which had badly lost its way i was standing on the fairy bridge chatting with cynthia garmen it was a typical july day muggy with dark leaden clouds and the threat of storm we were talking about the japanese defeat at imphal wishing matthew could have been there to experience it when we heard the awful sound in the sky like a motorcycle without a silencer all of a sudden it spluttered to a stop then there was a dreadful silence we could see it by then a dark pointed shape beginning the silent arc of its descent fortunately it fell in one of the fields between hobbs end and harkside without exploding and by the time we had rushed down to see what was going on the local arp people already had the area cordoned off and were waiting for the uxb team to arrive the advance continued and slowly things began to improve the blackout was replaced by the dimout in september but most of us left the curtains up anyway and didnt get around to taking them down until the following year if by autumn then we were feeling flush with the possibility of victory we had little idea of the grim winter to come by ten oclock that night annie was feeling so restless that even a large glass of wine didnt help settle her down she knew what part of the problem was banks when he told her he was going out boozing with a mate instead of going to dinner with her she did feel pissed off with him she felt disappointed that he would rather go drinking with someone else than be with her especially at such an early and delicate stage in their relationship true it was she who had suggested they limit their time together to weekends but it was also she who had broken the rule the other night why couldnt he do the same tonight but at least she hadnt wasted her time that evening the long trail that had started on wednesday over the telephone was beginning to bear fruit at first she had come to the conclusion that it was easier finding a fully dressed woman in the sunday sport than getting information out of the american embassy people were polite insufferably so but she was shunted from one minion to another for the best part of an hour and came out with nothing but an earache and a growing distaste for condescending and suspicious american men who called her maam by the end of the day she had managed to discover that the personnel at rowan woods in late would have been members of the united states eighth air force and it was very unlikely that there would be any local records of who they were one of the more helpful employees suggested that she try contacting the usafe base in ramstein and gave her the number when she got back from the leeds council estate even though it was early evening she phoned ramstein where she discovered that all air force personnel records were kept at the national personnel records center in st louis missouri she checked the time difference and found that st louis was six hours behind harkside which meant it would be afternoon there after a little more shunting around and a few abrupt requests to please hold she was put through to a woman called mattie who just adored her accent they chatted about the differences in weather it was raining hard in st louis and about other things for a short while then annie plucked up the courage to ask for what she wanted expecting some sort of military smoke screen she was pleasantly surprised when mattie told her that there was no problem the records were generally available to the public and she would see what she could do when annie mentioned the initials px mattie laughed and said that was the man who looked after the store she also warned annie that some of their records had been burned in a fire a few years ago but if she still had rowan woods shed set the fax to send it out during the night annie should get it the next morning annie thanked her profusely and went home feeling absurdly pleased with herself but it didnt last sometimes when she felt irritable and restless like this she would go for a drive and that was exactly what she did without making a conscious decision she took the road west out of harkside and when she reached the turnoff for thornfield reservoir she turned right by then she had realized that banks wasnt the problem she was she was pissed off at herself for letting him get to her she was behaving like some sort of silly lovestruck schoolgirl vulnerable hurt lets face it annie she told herself life has been pretty simple pretty much regimented for some time now no real highs no real lows only herself to think of manageable but diminished she had been hiding from life in a remote corner of yorkshire protecting her emotions from the harsh world she had experienced out there sometimes when you open yourself up to that life again it can be confusing and painful like when you open your eyes to bright light your emotions are tender and raw more than usually sensitive to all its nuances its little hurts and humiliations so that was what was happening well at least she knew that much so much for cool annie so much for detachment a misshapen harvest moon hung low in the western sky bloated and flattened into a red sausage shape by the gathering haze otherwise the road was unlit surrounded on both sides by tall dark trees her headlights caught dozens of rabbits she pulled into the car park and turned off the engine silence as she got out and stood in the warm night air she started to feel at peace her problems seemed to slip away one way or another she knew they would sort themselves out annie loved being alone deep in the countryside at night where you might hear only the very distant progress of a car the rustles of small animals see only the dark shapes of the trees and hills perhaps a few pinpricks of light from farmhouses on distant hillsides she loved the sea at night even more the relentless rhythm of the waves the hiss and suck and the way the reflected moonlight sways and bends with the waters swell and catches the crests of the waves but the sea was fifty miles away she would have to make do with the woods for now the appeal was still to the deep primitive part of her she took the narrow footpath toward hobbs end walking carefully because of the gnarled tree roots that crossed it in places and the stones that thrust up out of the dirt hardly any moonlight penetrated the tree cover but here and there she caught a slat or two of reddishsilver light between branches she could smell the loamy earthy smell of trees and shrubs the slightest breeze butterflykissed the upper leaves when annie reached the slope she paused and looked down on the ruins of hobbs end it was easy to make out the dark skeletal shape the spine and ribs but somehow tonight with the slight curve of the high street and the dry riverbed the ruins looked more like the decayed stubs of teeth in a sneering mouth annie skipped down the slope and walked toward the fairy bridge from there she looked along the river and saw the bloodred moonlight reflected in the few little puddles of water that remained on its muddy bed she walked on past the outbuilding where glorias skeleton had been found and the ruins of bridge cottage next to it the ground around had all been dug up and was now taped off for safety the socos from headquarters had brought their own crimescene tape she headed down what was once the high street as she went annie tried to visualize the scene from michael stanhopes painting children laughing and splashing in the river shallows knots of local women gossiping outside a shop the butchers boy in his bloodstained apron riding like the wind the tall young woman arranging newspapers in a rack gwynneth shackleton that was who it was why hadnt she realized it before somehow the revelation that stanhope had also painted gwen shackleton into his scene thrilled her she looked at the ruins to her right and saw where once was a detached cottage with a little garden once a row of terrace houses opening directly onto the pavement this was where the ginnel led off to the tanners yard here was the shackletons newsagents shop here the butchers and a little farther down stood the shoulder of mutton where the sign had swayed and creaked in the wind so real did it all seem as she walked toward the flax mill that she began to fancy she could even hear longsilent voices whispering secrets she passed the street that led to the old church and stood at the western end of the village on that stretch of empty ground where the houses ended and the land rose toward the mill as she stood and breathed in the air deeply she realized how much she wanted to know what had happened here every bit as much as banks did without her wishing for it or asking for it hobbs end and its history had imposed themselves on her thrust themselves into her consciousness and become part of her life it had happened at the same time that banks had become part of her life too she knew that whatever became of them the two events would be united in her mind forever when she had challenged him on his obsession with it the other night she hadnt even attempted to explain hers it wasnt because of the war but because she identified with gloria this was a woman who had struggled and dared to be a little different in a time that didnt tolerate such behavior she had lost her parents then had either abandoned or been cast out by the father of her child had come to a remote place taken on a hard job and fallen in love then she had lost her husband in the war or so she must have believed if gloria had been still alive when matthew came back then she would have had to face a stranger most likely whatever else happened someone strangled her stabbed her nearly twenty times and buried her under an outbuilding and nobody had tried to find out what happened to her suddenly annie noticed a movement and saw a figure scuttle across the fairy bridge toward the car parks her blood froze at that moment she became a little girl frightened of the dark and she could believe that witches demons and hobgoblins haunted hobbs end she was the whole length of the village away so what she saw was nothing more than a fleeting silhouette finding her voice she called out no answer came the figure disappeared up the slope into the woods annie set off in pursuit with every stride the policewoman in her started to overcome the scared superstitious girl just when she had got back up the slope and was heading for the woods she heard a car start ahead of her there were two small car parks separated by a high hedge and whoever this was must have been parked in the other one or annie would have seen the car earlier she put on an extra burst of speed but could only get to the road in time to see the taillights disappearing even in the moonlight all she could tell was that the car was dark in color she stood there leaning forward hands resting on her knees getting her breath back and wondering who the hell could be in such a hurry to escape discovery twelve he asked me to marry him gloria repeated i still dont believe you i said well you can ask him yourself its true it was early in the new year and i had dropped by bridge cottage one evening to see how gloria was coping she had had a terrible cold over christmas had even missed alice pooles farewell party and the doctor said she had almost caught pneumonia though she was weak and pale and had lost some weight she seemed to be on the mend you should have seen my nose when he asked me it was redraw i laughed it was good to laugh at something christmas that year had been a miserable affair not only because it was the coldest one i could remember but because the advance that had seemed to be going so well earlier had bogged down in the ardennes it was all right for alice her eric had been wounded there and shipped home but how long was this bloody war going to drag on couldnt everyone see we had all had enough sometimes i felt that i had never even known life during peacetime what did you say i asked i told him id think about it but hed have to wait until the war was over until we could find out for certain about matt do you love him in a way not oh i mean i dont really think i could ever love anyone like i loved matt but brad and i get on well enough in and out of bed i like his company and hes good to me when the wars over he wants to take me back to hollywood with him itll be a new lease on life i suppose yes and ill have someone i can visit out there you will but what do you mean i still sense a but you only told him youd think about it oh i dont know gwen you know i cant even consider getting married again until the wars over for a start but i will think about it oh look what px brought me when i was ill isnt he sweet it was a box of chocolates a bloody box of chocolates i hadnt even seen a single chocolate in years gloria held out the box please take one take them all in fact theyll only make me fat what about me i asked picking out the caramel you could do with a bit of meat on your bones i threw the screwedup wrapper at her cheeky well you could what about charlie oh hes still depressed about glenn miller disappearing thats not what i mean and you know it has he asked you yet im sure i blushed no i said we havent talked about marriage books thats all you two ever talk about its not she smiled im teasing gwen im glad youre happy honest i am we still havent talked about marriage well theres no hurry i suppose but you could do a lot worse a lawyer hell be rich just you wait and see money isnt everything it certainly helps anyway you can go to america too and be a rich lawyers wife we can see each other all the time have lunch together gloria boston is miles away from los angeles is it well at least well be in the same country and so we chatted on about love and marriage and what the future might offer us gloria soon recovered her health and the round of dances films and pub nights started all over again february brought the prospect of victory closer and i actually began to believe that we were entering the last spring of the war everything changed one gray afternoon in march when a tall gaunt stranger walked down the high street toward me struggling against the wind banks really must have had a night on the tiles annie thought pursing her lips and tapping her pen against the side of her thigh it was after nine and he wasnt in his office yet was he still in leeds had he and his friend picked up some women she fought back the acidburn of jealousy that curdled in her stomach jealousy and suspicion had ruined relationships for her before just before rob got killed she had suspected he was seeing someone else and had consequently treated him badly she thought she had conquered her feelings by now thought she had learned detachment but perhaps she had only put her insecurity on mothballs along with everything else since she had transferred to north yorkshire it was a frightening thought until she had met banks she had imagined she was in control doing just fine annie remembered she was supposed to check on the gwen shackletonvivian elmsley link first she phoned ruby kettering who said as expected that it was so long ago she couldnt even remember what gwen looked or sounded like besides gwen would have only been fifteen then elizabeth goodall told annie that she had no idea who vivian elmsley was and alice poole said that with her poor eyesight she couldnt be relied upon to tell queen elizabeth from prince charles next annie phoned millgarth and asked to speak to di blackstone he told her banks was on his way back to eastvale she could have sworn he was suppressing laughter as he said it they had probably been talking about her images of banks telling all the steamy details to his pal after a few pints made her face burn and her throat constrict all of a sudden her pleasure in wanting to tell him about her success with usafe evaporated men annie thought never anything but bloody big kids when you got right down to it and that was the most charitable view the fax machine hummed into action annie hurried over to see if it was the information from mattie in st louis it was a personnel breakdown of the th bomber group at rowan woods aaf base between december and may when they had left there were a lot of names too many as she glanced over the list annie thought again about the hobbs end incident last night it had rattled her more than she realized at first and she had had a difficult time getting to sleep she didnt know why it should have affected her that way apart from the misshapen red moon the eerie atmosphere and the way the ruins had seduced her into believing in ghosts and goblins and things that go bump in the night but ghosts and goblins dont run away and drive off in cars now in the light of day what bothered her most of all was why someone should hide from her in the first place and then why take off like a bat out of hell when she gave chase there might be a simple explanation of course whoever it was may have been more afraid of her than she was of him a mischievous kid perhaps given everything else they had discovered since adam kelly found the hobbs end skeleton however annie felt inclined to be more suspicious the answer still eluded her there was nothing left at the site the socos had been over it thoroughly perhaps someone might think there was something there though even so how could anything buried there incriminate anyone living now from what annie had seen briefly of the figure last night whoever it was hadnt been old enough to have murdered gloria shackleton over fifty years ago people in their seventies or eighties dont usually move that fast so it remained a mystery she wanted to talk to banks about it but hed been off behaving like a silly kid getting pissed with his mates and telling tales about her sexual appetite and his ability to satisfy it she hoped he had a hangover the size of china debussys chamber music for harp and wind instruments got banks back to gratly safe and sane via the slow back roads he thought of stopping in at harkside on his way to see how annie was doing but decided against it he didnt want her to see him until he had at least managed a change of clothes the ones he was wearing still stank of smoke and stale beer his head ached despite the paracetamol he had downed at kens flat that morning and his mouth tasted like the bottom of a birdcage when he had awoken and looked around kens living room he had groaned at the detritus of a wild and foolish night an empty bottle of glenmorangie on the coffee table alongside an empty bottle of claret and an overflowing ashtray he didnt think the whiskey bottle had been full when they got into it but even a fifteenyearold would have had more sense than to mix beer wine and whiskey that way still he had enjoyed what he remembered of their rambling talk about women marriage divorce sex and loneliness and there was wonderful music ken was an aficionado of female jazz singers a vinylfreak too and the lp sleeves scattered over the floor attested to this ella fitzgerald june christy dinah washington helen forrest anita oday keely smith peggy lee the last thing banks remembered was drifting off to lateperiod billie holiday singing ill wind her smokedhoney voice beautifully mingling with ben websters tenor sax then came oblivion he groaned and rubbed his stubbly face all the hangover clichés ran through his mind one after another youre getting too old for this sort of thing time you grew up and ill never touch another drop as long as i live it was a familiar litany of guilt and selfdisgust last night would have to remain a oneoff a brief lapse a necessary sacrifice to friendship as banks emptied his pockets before dropping his jeans in the laundry basket noticing how full it was getting he found a slip of paper on it was the name maria followed by a leeds telephone number he racked his brains but he couldnt remember which one of the two girls theyd talked to in the adelphi was maria was it the petite blonde or the slender redhead with the freckles and the wide gap between her front teeth he thought the blonde had been more interested in ken and he vaguely remembered them talking about the preraphaelites if maria was the redhead she had a sort of preraphaelite look about her maybe that was how the subject had come up no good he couldnt remember it had been that kind of night he screwed up the slip of paper aimed it at the wastebin then stopped straightened it out and put it in the top drawer of his bedside table you never know after a shave a shower and a change of clothes banks drove to eastvale and arrived at his office just after ten oclock he hardly had time to turn on his computer when his door opened and in strode chief constable jeremiah jimmy riddle himself making one of his rare forays to eastvale banks muttered a silent curse just what he needed in his fragile state banks looked up sir banks you look bloody awful said riddle what have you been doing man drinking yourself silly touch of flu sir flu my arse anyway thats your problem you want to go on poisoning your liver what can i do for you sir its that skeleton case i gave you been all over the news lately attracting a lot of publicity i hope youre on top of things definitely sir good i want you to bring me uptodate ive got to go to london today to tape an interview for panorama theyre putting together a special segment on the investigation of old cases how dna makes a difference that sort of thing he brushed some imaginary fluff from the front of his uniform and glanced at his watch i need an angle and youd better make it quick my train leaves in an hour and a half well be thankful for small mercies banks told himself where do you want me to begin sir he asked at the bloody beginning man where do you think banks told him what he and annie had discovered so far from the socos from talking to elizabeth goodall and alice poole and from the visit to leeds when he had finished riddle ran his hand over his shiny bald scalp and said its not much to go on is it memory of a couple of old biddies were not likely to get much better said banks not at this point too much times gone by i suppose you could make a point about how unreliable peoples memories become over the years riddle nodded and made a note anyway theres a lot were still waiting on weve got a report on dr williamss physical examination of the bones but were still waiting the results of further tests both from him and our forensic odontologist these things take time and cost money itd better be worth it banks dont think im not keeping my eye on the bottom line on this one we also found a button possibly military close to the body she may have been holding it when she was killed theres still a lot we dont know yet riddle rubbed his chin still he said theres a good angle in what youve already told me nude paintings village scandals women playing around with yanks yes thats good stuff thatll play and give me a copy of the forensic anthropologists report to read on my way i want to sound as if i know what im talking about youve been trying to do that for years without much success banks wanted to say but he held his tongue and phoned the input clerk for a photocopy riddle could pick it up on his way out seeing as he was in such a hurry you mentioned dna sir he said you might mention that we think her son is still alive and it would be a great help if he could get in touch with us that way we could verify the identity of the remains once and for all riddle stood up if ive got time banks if ive got time he paused with his hand on the doorknob and halfturned by the way he said ds cabbot hows she working out she so he did know fine said banks shes a good detective wasted in a place like harkside a malicious smile flitted across riddles face ah yes pity really i understand there was some trouble in her previous posting nicelooking girl though by all accounts trouble sir you should know all about that banks insubordination failure to respect senior ranks i respect the rank sir said banks but not always the person who fills it riddle stiffened well i hope youre enjoying yourself for your sake banks because this is about as good as its going to get for you around here with that he walked out and slammed the door banks thought about what he had just heard so jimmy riddle knew who annie cabbot was and had assigned him to work with her anyway why riddle already thought banks was a rampant cocksman making trysts with exotic asians in leeds during police time and basically shagging everything in a skirt riddle had also mentioned some trouble what could all that be about most of all though why would riddle think that working with annie cabbot would be hell on earth for banks because if one thing was certain hell on earth was all riddle had in store for him on his way to the coffee machine banks bumped into ds hatchley and asked him to find out what he could about francis henderson glorias illegitimate child it was probably a pointless exercise but it was a loose end that nagged him banks was still getting the hang of the stations new voicemail system and was more often than not likely to forget about it or delete everything waiting for him but that morning he got annies message loud and clear the ice in her tone was enough to freeze his eardrum there was also a message from a major gargrave in military personnel banks phoned him first building up the courage to call annie later its about that query you made the other day said major gargrave matthew shackleton yes well its all a bit embarrassing really he came back didnt he we found a death certificate dated i was going to ask you about it yes well these things happen sometimes you know when my assistant was returning the file he found some papers wedged down between two folders it was because of the irregularity of it all you see and a filing error yes when did he return banks asked it was his sister who reported his return actually march place called hobbs end does that make any sense yes said banks go on im afraid theres not much more to tell really sergeant shackleton simply discharged himself from a london hospital and went home the hospital said hed been liberated from a japanese pow camp in the philippines and shipped home in pretty bad shape no identification and thats all yes it would seem so very odd okay said banks thanks very much for calling major no problem after he hung up banks opened the window and let the sunshine in he thought of lighting a cigarette but realized he didnt really feel like one too many last night his throat and lungs still felt raw there was something that didnt make sense in what the major had just told him it was on the tip of his consciousness but he couldnt quite force it out too many dead brain cells in the way back at his desk banks steeled himself and picked up the phone he was as ready as he would ever be for annie now she answered on the third ring youre back then was all she said yes have a good time pretty good thanks good im glad id rather forget this morning though you probably deserved it probably ive got the info on the rowan woods personnel wonderful its a long list though itll take a bit of whittling down there was more than one person working in the px for a start banks sensed that her tone was softening a little should he tell her he had missed her last night or ask her what was wrong better hold off awhile he ventured a tentative is there anything else annie told him about what happened at hobbs end what were you doing out there he asked what does it matter maybe i just wanted to see what it looks like in the dark and it looks spooky it was probably just a kid i thought about that it didnt look like a kid and it drove away ive known tenyearolds do that still i take your point theres not much we can do about it now though is there i just thought id let you know for the record it was interesting thats all sounds like it anything else annie told him about drawing a blank on trying to confirm vivian elmsleys identity through ruby betty and alice wed better track her down anyway banks said ive already done that now im really impressed so you should be while youve been recovering from your selfinflicted damage ive been on the phone was there a hint of forgiveness there perhaps depended how he played it he needed to strike the right balance of remorse and praise guilt and compliments and well in her case it was easy shes in the london telephone directory you didnt phone her did you please give me some credit im not that gormless but ive got her address what do you want to do about it we should talk to her as soon as possible if she really is the one were looking for shes holding something back she might also know the names we want there was another thing nagging at me a few minutes ago and ive just realized what it was apart from the hangover yes all right what was it banks explained to her about the call from major gargrave its to do with the gun he said what gun the one matthew shackletons supposed to have shot himself with what about it handguns must have been common enough just after the war youd just had hundreds of thousands of men running around armed to the teeth killing one another remember yes but why would matthew have a gun i dont wait a minute i think i do see what you mean if he was a released pow hed hardly have his service revolver i should imagine the japanese confiscated the weapons off the people they captured wouldnt you unless his liberators gave him one i suppose thats remotely possible especially if they were americans americans feel naked without guns but you dont think so i think its highly unlikely said banks why should they and why would he still have it when he went back to hobbs end from hospital anyway its a minor point probably doesnt mean a thing if he did have a gun though why didnt he use that on gloria instead of strangling her and stabbing her if it was matthew who killed her have you considered gwen as a serious suspect annie asked certainly according to everything weve heard she was very close to her brother if gloria was hurting him running around with other men gwen might just have fought back on his behalf at the very least she should be able to tell us more about matthews relationship with gloria after he came back assuming gloria was still alive at the time fancy a trip to london tomorrow whos driving well take the train its faster and the london traffics murder if my memory serves me well theres a train leaves york around a quarter to nine thatll have us at kings cross by twenty to eleven can you manage that no problem in the meantime ill see if i can get any more information on the airmen after annie hung up banks walked over to the window and looked out over the square with its ancient market cross and squaretowered church graygold in the sunlight he thought about vivian elmsley could she really be gwen shackleton it seemed a preposterous idea but stranger things had happened he decided it wouldnt be a bad idea to have a go at one or two of vivian elmsleys books before he set off to interview her her writing might give him some insight into her character he tried dialing brians wimbledon number again still nothing ken blackstone was right though all he could do for the moment was keep on trying if he was going to london tomorrow he hoped he might be able to see brian have a talk get things sorted he didnt want brian to keep on thinking his father was disappointed in him for what he was doing the way bankss own father always made clear his dismay at bankss choice of career even now every time they met banks went back to his desk for about the third time since the case began he spread out the objects found with gloria shackletons body before him not much for the remnants of a life or the detritus of a death a locket whose original heart shape had been squashed and bent a corroded wedding ring clips from a brassiere or suspenders a pair of tiny deformed leather shoes which reminded him of the ones he had seen at the brontë parsonage once a few scraps of blackout cloth and the button from adam kelly greenishblue with verdigris superintendent gristhorpe might be able to tell him a bit about the button he thought gristhorpe was a bit of an expert on military history especially the second world war banks grabbed his jacket and was just about to leave the office when his phone rang hello alan a womans voice yes its me jenny jenny fuller dont you recognize my voice jenny its been a long time where are you home just got back yesterday look a bit early arent you its a long story im glad you called i need some advice if its personal im the last person to ask believe me professional i might be able to manage that the reason i was phoning is i know i shouldnt bother you at work and all but im in town and i wondered if youve got time for lunch banks had intended to drive out to lyndgarth to see gristhorpe who was taking his annual holidays at home but that could wait until after queens arms halftwelve wonderful ill see you there banks smiled as he put down the receiver he hadnt seen jenny fuller in almost a year not since shed decided to take a leave of absence from the university of york to teach in california that was around the time he and sandra had split up he had received a couple of postcards asking how he was doing but that was all jenny was one of the two women his colleagues expected him to sleep with after sandra left perhaps he would have slept with her if she had been around but timing is everything jenny was spending most of her time in california these days and there was a man at the bottom of that the other friend pamela jeffries feeling restless and hemmed in had taken off to play in an orchestra in australia of all places and he hadnt seen her for months again he got the occasional postcard from such exotic locales as sydney melbourne adelaide and perth it made him want to travel more too now he and jenny were having lunch in about an hours time just enough time in fact to prepare his questions on matthew shackleton and nip over to waterstones for a couple of vivian elmsleys novels for some reason i was standing out in the street to check the window display which was pretty meager when i glanced to my left and saw him coming across the fairy bridge i had just heard the train arrive so i assumed that he had come from the station the wind howled around the chimneys and clouds as black as a nazis heart besmirched the sky like grease stains there was nobody else about that was why i noticed him that and the fact that he was wearing only an overlarge baggy brown suit and carrying no luggage he was tall but stooped as if suffering some affliction of the spine and he walked with a sturdy stick he moved slowly almost like a figure in a dream as if he knew where he was going but felt no hurry to get there his frame was thin to the point of emaciation as he came closer i realized that he wasnt as old as i had first thought though his lank lifeless hair was tinged here and there with gray or white the wind tugged at my hair and clothes and chilled me to the marrow but something about him compelled me to stand and watch as if in a trance when he got within a few feet of the shop i saw his eyes deep hollow haunted eyes turned completely inward as if he was subjecting himself to a most intense and unflinching scrutiny he saw me though and he stopped i dont know when the truth dawned on me it could have been seconds it could have been minutes but i started to shake like a leaf and it had nothing to do with the cold i ran to him and threw my arms around him but his body felt stiff and unyielding as a tree i caressed his cheek with my palm noticing the puckered white scar that curved up from the side of his mouth in an ugly parody of a grin tears were pouring down my cheeks matthew i cried oh my god matthew and i took his arm and led him inside to mother banks walked into the queens arms a couple of minutes before twelvethirty carrying two of vivian elmsleys paperback mysteries in his waterstones bag he bought a pint and sat down at a table near the empty fireplace jenny was always late he remembered opening the bag and looking at the books one was a suspense novel called guilty secrets certainly an interesting title from bankss point of view which bore review quotes from the sunday times scotland on sunday the yorkshire post and the manchester evening news all to the general effect that it was an amazing and disturbing achievement by one of our best mystery writers a true equal of p d james and ruth rendell the other was called the shadow of death and featured her regular series character detective inspector niven in this one he was called on to investigate the murder of an upmarket shepherds bush restaurateur banks didnt even know that such a creature existed as far as he could remember there werent any upmarket restaurants in shepherds bush still it was a long time since hed been there so he gave her the benefit of the doubt anyway the novel was praised for its compassionate realism in the portrayal of ordinary people and its believable depictions of policemens lives and police procedures banks smiled hed see about that on the cover was a picture of the handsome craggyfaced young actor who so the blurb informed banks played di niven on the television series and got paid far more than a real copper did he was on page when jenny dashed in out of breath tousled red hair flaming around her face as she looked this way and that when she saw him she waved patted her chest and hurried over she bent and gave him a quick peck on the cheek sorry im late my god you look awful banks smiled and raised his glass hair of the dog jenny picked up the paperback he had set down on the table and turned up her nose i didnt think this sort of thing was up your alley work aha she raised her eyebrows the california tan looked good on her banks thought the sun hadnt burned her the way it did with most redheads only darkened the natural creams and reds of her complexion and brought out her freckles especially across her nose her figure looked as good as ever in tight black jeans and a loose jade silk top so banks said when jenny had settled herself down and deposited her oversized shoulder bag on the floor beside her can i get you a drink campari and soda please food scampi and chips ive been craving scampi and chips for about a month now scampi and chips it is banks made his way to the bar got them each a drink and ordered the food there were a few more exotic dishes finding their way onto the menu these days like fajitas and pad thai noodles but banks finally settled for plaice and chips it wasnt that he had anything against exotic food but from experience he didnt trust the pub version of it besides he could still taste the curry he had eaten in leeds last night he carried the drinks back and found jenny poring over the shadow of death one hand holding her hair back from her eyes when he approached she flashed him a quick smile and closed the book i think i saw this on tv over there she said touching the cover on pbs they interviewed her afterward vivian elmsley shes very popular in the states you know quite a striking woman banks told her briefly about the case so far including the possibility of vivian elmsleys having a role in the affair by the time he had finished their food arrived is it as good as you remembered he asked after she had taken a couple of bites nothing ever is jenny said he noticed a new sadness and weariness in her eyes its good though what happened over there what do you mean she glanced at him then looked away quickly too quickly he saw fear in her eyes he thought of the very first time he had met her in gristhorpes office shortly after he had first arrived in eastvale how he had been struck by her sharp intelligence and her quick sense of humor as well as her natural beauty the flamingred hair full lips and green eyes with their attractive laugh lines jenny fuller had been thirtyone then she was nearly thirtyeight now the lines had etched themselves a little deeper and they werent so easy to associate with laughter anymore his first impression had been that she was a knockout he felt exactly the same today they had come close to an affair but banks had backed off unwilling to commit himself to infidelity he had been different then more confident more certain of what his life was all about and where it was going life had been simpler for him then or perhaps he had approached it on more absolute terms it had seemed simple at least he loved sandra and believed she loved him therefore he didnt want to do anything to jeopardize that no matter how tempting they had just moved up from london where banks felt he was quickly burning out to a less hectic region partly to save their marriage and it had worked up to a point seven years against all odds banks and jenny had remained friends jenny had become friends with sandra too though banks got the impression they had drifted apart over the past two or three years come on jenny he said this sudden return wasnt on the agenda i thought youd become a california beach bunny for good beach bunny jenny laughed i guess i just didnt quite make the grade did i what do you mean she sighed looked away tried to form some words sighed again then laughed there were tears in her eyes she seemed a lot more twitchy than he remembered always moving her hands its all washed up alan thats what ive been meaning to say whats all washed up all of it the job randy my life she cocked her head i never did have much luck with men did i i should have listened to you years ago there was no arguing with that banks remembered one or two of jennys disasters that he had been around to mop up after jenny pushed her plate aside scampi and chips unfinished and took a long swig of campari and soda her glass was almost empty banks still had the best part of his pint left he didnt want any more another he asked am i becoming an alcoholic too no dont answer that ill get it myself before he could stop her she stood up and headed for the ladies loo banks finished his plaice and chips and looked at the back cover of the shadow of death on the table beside him a masterpiece toprate work a must read the critics obviously loved vivian elmsley or were the brief quotes cunningly edited from less flattering sentences whereas dostoevsky wrote a masterpiece vivian elmsley can be said to have written only a potboiler of the lowest kind or had this book shown even the slightest sign of literary talent or creative imagination i would not have hesitated to declare it a must read and a piece of toprate work but as it possesses neither of these qualities i have to say its a dud when jenny came back she had repaired what little damage the tears had caused to her makeup she had also picked up another campari and soda you know she said ive been imagining sitting here and talking this over with you like this all the way over on the plane picturing how it would be just you and me here in the queens arms like old times i dont know why i found it so difficult i think i might still be jetlagged take it easy said banks just tell me what you want to at your own pace she smiled and patted his arm thanks youre sweet she snatched a cigarette from his packet and lit up you dont smoke banks said i do now jenny blew out a long plume ive just about had it up to here with those niconazis out there you cant smoke anywhere and to think california was a real hotbed of protest and innovation in the sixties its like a fucking kindergarten run by fascists now he hadnt heard jenny swear before something else new smoking drinking swearing he noticed that she wasnt inhaling and she stubbed the cigarette out halfway through as im sure youve gathered already she went on randy my main man my paramour my significant other my reason for staying out there as long as i did is no longer a part of my life the little shit what happened graduate students or to put it more bluntly blond twentysomething bimbos with their brains between their legs im sorry jenny she waved her hand i should have seen it coming anyone else would have anyway soon as i found out about what he was up to there wasnt much to keep me there after i confronted him with the evidence my dear randy made damn sure i wasnt going to be offered another years visiting lectureship what are you going to do well thank god theyre not all like that ill be going back to my old lecturing job at york start next month if that doesnt work out ill hang up my shingle next door to the cop shop and go into private practice im quite the expert on deviants and criminal psychology should you happen to have such a creature as a serial killer lurking in the general vicinity ive even been on training courses with the fbi profilers ive heard thats all a load of bollocks said banks but im impressed sorry we dont have anything at the moment i know dont call us story of my life i dont think youll have any problem staying in work jenny but if theres ever anything i can do thanks youre a pal she patted his hand i do want to ask your advice on something go ahead im finished blubbering and moaning and i didnt even ask about you i havent seen you since sandra left how are you doing im doing fine thanks seeing anyone banks paused a moment sort of serious what kind of a question is that so it is serious how about sandra do you mean is she seeing anyone yes she is oh its okay im fine jenny if you say so what was it you wanted to ask me its about matthew shackleton gwens possibly vivian elmsleys brother apparently he was captured by the japanese and spent a few years in one of their prison camps by all accounts he was pretty disturbed when he came home ended up committing suicide five years after the war thing is all i can come up with in terms of psychiatric diagnoses are such vague terms as shell shock i thought that went out with the first world war apparently not they just changed the name to battle fatigue or combat fatigue i was wondering what sort of diagnosis youd come up with today thats good one alan jenny pointed her thumb at her chest you want me a psychologist to come up with a psychiatric diagnosis of a dead mans mental problems i like that i really do that takes the biscuit banks grinned oh dont be such a nitpicker jenny this had better be between you and me cross my heart jenny toyed with her beer mat ripping off little pieces of damp cardboard well she said im only guessing you understand but if your man had indeed been a prisoner of war under such terrible conditions then he was probably suffering from some kind of posttraumatic stress disorder banks took his notebook from his inside pocket and jotted a few words down dont you dare quote me on this jenny warned him i told you its strictly between you and me dont worry you wont be called upon to testify in court i realize this is pure speculation anyway it all happened a long time ago this condition would have been caused by his experiences in the war and the camp right right basically ptsds are caused by some event or series of events well beyond the normal range of human experience maybe we should redefine exactly what that means these days given the state of the socalled normal world but it generally refers to extreme experiences things that go way beyond marital breakdowns broken love affairs simple bereavement chronic illness or bankruptcy the things most of us suffer from on a daily basis that bad jenny nodded things like rape assault kidnapping military combat floods earthquakes fires car crashes bombing torture death camps the list of divine and human atrocities goes on and on but im sure you get the picture i get the picture what are the symptoms many and varied recurrent nightmares about the event are common as is feeling that the event is recurring things like flashbacks and hallucinations anything that reminds the person of the event is painful too such as an anniversary also things that were part of it if a man was kept in a small cage for a long period for example then he would be likely to experience suffocating claustrophobia whenever those conditions were approximated maybe in a lift for example what about amnesia yes theres psychological memory loss sometimes believe me most of the people who suffer from this would find the memory loss preferable to the persistent nightmares but the problem is that strong feelings of detachment estrangement and separation come with it you cant even enjoy your lack of recollection of the horror people who suffer from ptsds often find it difficult to feel or accept love they become alienated from society from their families and loved ones and they have an extremely diminished sense of the future add to that insomnia difficulty in concentrating hypervigilance depressive or panic disorders sounds like me much worse suicide is also not uncommon hes a suspect i assume yes that was another thing i wanted to ask you might he be likely to become violent thats a difficult one to answer anyone can become violent given the right stimulus he would certainly be prone to irritability and outbursts of anger but im not sure theyd necessarily lead him to murder i was thinking he might have killed his wife because he found out shed been having an affair i suppose its possible he got a bee in his bonnet about it jenny said but you dont think so i didnt say that let me just say i hold reservations dont forget the constraints youve got me working under i wont tell me about your reservations the outbursts of anger in ptsd are usually fairly irrational by linking them to his wifes behavior youre making it all far more logical do you see cause and effect yes and the other thing is that if he did feel detached and was unable to love then where does the hate come in or the jealousy so could he or couldnt he oh no youre not trapping me like that of course he could have committed murder people do all the time often for no reason whatsoever yes he could have heard about his wife having it off with some other bloke and as a result he could have quite reasonably come to hate her and to want rid of her or he could have just done it in an outburst of irrational rage for no apparent reason whoever did it probably strangled the woman at least until she was unconscious then stabbed her about fifteen or sixteen times such rage i dont know alan from what youve told me about this man and from what i know of ptsd id say that most of his pain and anger would have been directed inward not out at the world while i wouldnt rule it out id maybe hedge on the side of saying its unlikely he would have killed that way for that reason but its hard to say anything about someone youve never met never had the chance to talk to also its often too easy to pick on the mentally disturbed person as the most likely murderer most mentally ill people wouldnt harm a fly im not saying all of them there are some really sick puppies out there who manage to keep it well hidden but most of the obvious ones are harmless sad and pathetic perhaps sometimes even a little scary but rarely dangerous thanks youve given me a lot to think about well im just glad i can still be of some use to somebody they both sat in silence nursing what was left of their drinks banks thought about matthew shackletons suffering and about what jenny had said about his possible alienation his estrangement from the world of normal human affairs maybe that could have made a killer out of him and maybe not if you couldnt feel love for someone why would you feel hate when banks first found out about sandra and sean he had hated them both because he still loved sandra if he hadnt cared he wouldnt have felt so passionate now the feelings were receding into the distance he wasnt sure if he loved sandra anymore at least he was trying to make a life without her reinventing and discovering himself if she came and asked him to take her back tomorrow he honestly didnt know what he would do i fell apart you know jenny said suddenly startling him out of his train of thought you did what she played with her hair a number of expressions battled for pride of place on her face a sort of crooked grin won out i had a breakdown after all that with randy i suddenly found myself alone out there completely cut off from everything and everyone id grown up with alone in a foreign country its one of the scariest feelings ive ever had i mean they speak sort of the same language and all but that only makes things worse like a parody of all youve known im not making myself clear i felt like i was on another planet a hostile one and i couldnt get home i fell to pieces she laughed do you know the song ive heard it said banks who tried to avoid country and western music the way he did a dose of clap well ive done it she shook her head slowly i even went to see a shrink do any good some one of the things i realized was that i wanted to go home i mean that wasnt part of being ill the desire was real and perfectly reasonable it wasnt just randy or not having the contract renewed i could have got a teaching job somewhere else if id wanted but i missed this place too much can you believe it i actually missed overcooked scampi and chips and bloody hell wouldnt you know it if i didnt miss winter too it gets you down all that sun day in day out only the occasional flood fire or earthquake for variety pretty soon you begin to feel like youre living in some kind of suspended animation like everythings on hold or maybe youre not really living at all youre in limbo you keep telling yourself one day the snows going to come but it never does anyway as soon as i realized what i really wanted to do i gave myself the best therapy i could think of i chucked my tranquilizers down the toilet and took the next flight home well almost the next flight i had a few things to do first including im almost ashamed to admit a little act of girlish revenge on poor dear randy what did you do jenny paused for a moment then licked her lips and flashed him a wicked grin i planted one of those little voiceactivated tape recorders in his office and taped one of his trysts then i retrieved the machine and sent the tape to the dean in his office yes over the desk dont be such a prude alan it happens all the time over there what are offices for oh you should have heard them give it to me big boy fuck me go on oh yeah stick that big hard cock in me go deep fuck me harder her voice had risen and one or two tourist families looked at her uncomfortably oops sorry she said putting her hand over her mouth wash your mouth out jenny fuller anyway there was no mistaking whose voices they were what happened i dont know i left before the shit hit the fan so if i get murdered you know where to start looking i should imagine he got suspended maybe fired of course it was hardly evidence you could use at a tribunal but they can get quite stroppy about things like that over there fucking your students is almost as bad as being caught smoking in a restaurant she tossed back the rest of her drink and looked at her watch look im sorry ill have to go the universitys been very good to me so far but they wont continue to be unless i get my courses prepared its great seeing you again she picked up her bag paused and rested it on her lap then she looked banks in the eye reached out and touched his hand softly and said why dont you give me a ring we could you know have dinner or something together if thats okay banks swallowed i will that would be great and youve got to come out and see the cottage id love to she patted his hand blew him a kiss and then she was gone in a whirl of red jade and black leaving a faint trace of miss dior behind in the smoky air banks looked down at his hand it still tingled where she had touched him now that he had found the courage and desire to start a relationship with annie jenny was a complication he didnt need but she was a friend he couldnt turn his back and there was no reason at all why annie should object to his having dinner with her even so he felt more confused than he had half an hour earlier as he picked up his books and left the pub thirteen it took some time but after i had run and fetched gloria from the farm i was finally able to piece together what had happened matthew himself wouldnt say a word he looked at us as if he remembered knowing us once as if some sort of deep homing instinct had brought him here but our fussing didnt make much sense to him gloria and mother comforted him while i went down to the telephone and began the long round of calls the ministry was about as much help as usual the red cross a little more forthcoming but it was ultimately a doctor in one of the big london hospitals for it was clear matthew was ill and had probably discharged himself from hospital who told me the most at first he didnt know whom i was talking about because they didnt know the name of the man who had walked out of the hospital yesterday when i described matthew however he was certain we were talking about the same person matthew had been found along with several other british and indian soldiers at a japanese pow camp near luzon in the philippines all his identification was missing and all anyone could tell about him from the scraps of his uniform that remained was that he was british he hadnt spoken to any of the other prisoners and none of them had been captured in the same place or at the same time as he had consequently nobody knew where he had come from or who he was when i asked the doctor why matthew wouldnt speak and why he also refused when offered pen and paper to write anything down he paused then said hes probably suffering from some form of combat fatigue thats why he wont communicate there may be other problems but im afraid i cant be any more specific than that is that why he refuses to talk he paused again longer this time then went on slowly im sorry to say but when we gave him a thorough physical examination one of the things we found was that his tongue had been cut out i could think of nothing to say i stood there head spinning clinging to the telephone as if it were all that was holding me to earth miss shackleton miss shackleton are you there yes im sorry please go on im the one who should be sorry it must have sounded so abrupt and callous to you i didnt know how else to tell you if you only knew some of the lads weve got in here well i apologize thats all right doctor so matthew is physically incapable of talking yes but he could write if he wanted theres no reason why not theres some damage to the fingers of his left hand as if they have been broken and badly reset but his right hand is fine and as far as i can tell he seems to be righthanded am i correct yes matthews righthanded all i can assume then is that he simply chooses not to communicate what should we do what do you mean well he ran away didnt he should we send him back i cant see much point in doing that said the doctor and quite frankly we need all the beds we can get no physically theres nothing more we can do for him theres some deformity of the spine probably due to being forced into a cramped environment like a box or a cage for long periods of time a pronounced limp in the left leg caused by an improperly set fracture he was also shot in the arm and the abdomen the wounds are healed now though by the looks of the scars the surgery was of a poor quality i swallowed trying not to think of all the suffering poor matthew must have gone through and mentally as i said we dont really know whats wrong he refuses to communicate its a good sign that he came home though he knew his way and he negotiated the journey with what little money he took took ah yes please dont worry about it we hadnt supplied him with any clothes or money he took another patients suit before he left will there dont worry the other patient is most understanding he knows something of what your brother has been through please dont worry about it any further but the money there wasnt much enough for his train fare and perhaps a bite to eat he doesnt look as if hes eaten in months is there any treatment will he get better its impossible to say there are treatments what sort of treatments narcosynthesis is the most common and that is a druginduced reenactment of the traumatic episode or episodes its used to assist the ego to accept what happened but if you dont know what the traumatic episode was there are ways of getting at that but i dont want to get your hopes up the problem is of course that matthew cant express himself vocally and that could mean a severe limitation in the value of narcosynthesis what do you suggest i suggest you tell me where you live and ill do my best to put you in touch with a doctor who knows about these things i told him where i lived and where it was it may mean visits to leeds he said that will be no problem i promise ill get working on it in the meantime just take good care of him i dont think i need to tell you that he has suffered appallingly no thank you doctor i put down the receiver and went back upstairs matthew was sitting staring toward the window though not through it and mother and gloria seemed at their wits end ive tried to talk to him gwen gloria said voice quivering i dont think he even knows me i dont think he even knows where he is i told her some of what the doctor had said he came back here didnt he i said to comfort her he made his way here by himself it was the only place he knew to come home dont worry hell be fine now hes back with the people who love him gloria nodded but she didnt seem convinced i couldnt blame her i wasnt convinced either it was a long time since banks had driven up the rutted driveway in front of detective superintendent gristhorpes squat stone house on the daleside above lyndgarth as expected he found gristhorpe out back working on his drystone wall walling was a hobby the superintendent had taken up years ago it was the ideal pointless activity his wall went nowhere and fenced nothing in he said he found it relaxing like some form of meditation you could just empty your mind and get in harmony with the natural world so he said maybe the super and annie would have a lot in common gristhorpe was wearing a baggy pair of brown corduroy trousers held up by frayed red braces and a checked shirt that might once have had a white background he was holding a triangular lump of limestone in his hand and squinting at the wall when banks approached he turned his pockmarked face was redder than usual after the sun and exertion he was also sweating and his unruly mop of thatched hair lay plastered to his skull was it a trick of the light banks wondered or was gristhorpe suddenly looking old alan he said it wasnt a greeting or a question just a statement hard to tell anything much from the flat tone sir gristhorpe pointed toward the wall they say a good waller doesnt put a stone aside once hes picked it up he said then looked at the rock in his hand i wish i could figure out where to put this bugger he paused for a moment then he tossed the stone back on the pile slapped his hands on his trousers to get rid of the dust and walked over youll have a glass of something anything cold coke then ive got some in the fridge well sit out here gristhorpe pointed to two foldup chairs in the shade by the back wall of the old farmhouse banks sat down he thought he could see some tiny figures making their way along the limestone escarpment that ran along the top of fremlington hill gristhorpe came out with two glasses of coke handed one to banks and sat down beside him at first neither of them spoke finally gristhorpe broke the silence i hear jimmy riddles given you a real case to work on sort of im sure he thinks of it as more of a dead end gristhorpe raised his bushy eyebrows is it i dont think so banks told gristhorpe what he and annie cabbot had discovered so far and handed him the button adam kelly had taken from the skeletons hand its impossible to say he went on but it might have been in the victims hand it was certainly buried with her and it didnt walk there she could have ripped it from her attackers uniform when she was being strangled gristhorpe examined the button and took a sip of coke it looks like an american army air force button he said i could be wrong its so old and corroded its hard to tell but that design looks like the american eagle its not what the husband would have been wearing even if he had been in uniform not from what youve told me and its very unlikely that he would have been in uniform if he had been liberated from a japanese pow camp and repatriated so you think its american gristhorpe weighed the metal in his palm i wouldnt swear to it in court he said the american armed forces were very casual dressers compared to our lot most of the time they wore ike jackets with hidden front buttons but this could have come from the collar usually it was worn on the right side officers wore them left or right with the branch of service below gis not assigned to any specific service wore the eagle on both sides if she was being strangled said banks then its quite likely she reached out to try to scratch her attackers face and grab at his collar gloria and her friends went around with a group of american airmen from rowan woods gristhorpe handed back the button it sounds like a reasonable theory to me theres another thing that puzzles me matthew shackleton committed suicide in shot himself im wondering where he got the gun anyone can get a gun if he wants one badly enough even today he was in no state to go out and buy one on the black market even if he knew where to look so youre assuming he already had it yes but he wouldnt have had one in the prison camp would he he could have got it from someone on his way home long journey lots of opportunities i suppose so all we know is that he went missing presumed dead in burma in turned up at hobbs end again in march then committed suicide in leeds in its a long gap what kind of gun was it a colt fortyfive automatic really yes why that was the gun the american military issued their servicemen it raises interesting possibilities doesnt it american button in the wifes hand american gun in the husbands mouth banks nodded though what the possibilities were he hadnt a clue the two events were separated by five years more or less and happened in different places he sipped some more coke hows sandra gristhorpe asked fine as far as i know im sorry about what happened alan me too gristhorpe gazed at a point in space somewhere above fremlington edge this annie cabbot he said whats she like banks felt himself blush shes good he said too good for a godforsaken outpost like harksmere i think so then whats she doing there i dont know banks glanced sideways at gristhorpe maybe she pissed somebody off like i did gristhorpe narrowed his eyes alan he said i dont approve of what you did last year taking off like that without so much as a byyourleave you dropped me right in it i can see why you did it i might even have done it myself in your place but i cant condone it and while it pulled your chestnuts out of the fire in one sense its probably dropped them in it in another way what do you mean jimmy riddle already hated you he also hates being proved wrong especially after hes done his crowing to the press your maverick actions helped solve the case but now he hates you even more i cant do anything for you you must be aware your grasp at eastvale is pretty tenuous to say the least banks stood up im not asking for any favors sit down alan hear me out banks sat and fumbled for a cigarette id probably have looked for a transfer before now he said but ive had a few other things on my mind aye i know and i know youd not ask for any favors either thats not your way i might have a bit of good news for you though if you can promise to keep it to yourself good news that makes a change between you and me and the stone wall jimmy riddle might not be around much longer banks could hardly believe his ears what riddles retiring at his age a little bird tells me that the crooked finger of politics beckons as you know he cant enter into that as a copper so you tell me what the logical solution is politics aye his local conservative member is practically gaga not that anyone would notice something like that much in the house highechelon rumor has it that riddle has already had several interviews with the selections committee and theyre pleased with him like i said alan this is just between you and me of course theres no guarantee hell go or get elected for that matter though the conservative seat around here is so secure they could put saddam hussein up and hed probably win it even if riddle does go hell leave a bad smell around and swear its yours so im not saying theres no damage done for a start a lot depends on whether we get a cc who can tell the smell of shit from perfume banks began to feel a sort of warm glow deep inside an interesting case annie cabbot now this maybe there was a god after all maybe his dry season really was coming to an end do you know he said it might even be worth voting conservative just to make sure the bastard wins his seat charlie was killed on the nineteenth of march during a big raid over berlin their flying fortress got badly shot up by a messerschmidt brad managed to fly the burning airplane back across the channel and land in an airfield in sussex only to find charlie and two other members of his crew dead brad himself escaped with cuts and bruises and after a couple of days observation in hospital he returned to rowan woods coming right after matthews return this news was almost impossible for me to bear poor gentle charlie with his poetry and his puppydog eyes gone when brad got back from sussex he came over to the shop with a bottle of bourbon and told me the news in person though he had only known charlie a couple of years during that time they had become close friends he tried to explain the kind of bond that is forged between pilot and navigator i could tell he was devastated by what happened he blamed himself and felt guilty about his own survival gloria was busy taking care of matthew and she had told brad she couldnt see him again that it would only upset her and would do them no good brad was angry and upset about her rejection but there was nothing he could do except come to me and pour his heart out we sat in the small room above the shop after mother had gone to bed drank bourbon and smoked luckies we had the home service on the wireless and vivien leigh was reading poetry by christina rossetti and elizabeth barrett browning neither of us said very much there was nothing really to say charlie was gone and there was an end to it poetry filled our periods of silence not far down the high street gloria who adored vivien leigh i remembered from our very first meeting was devoting her time to caring for a man who couldnt speak wouldnt communicate and probably didnt even know who she was she was spoonfeeding him bathing him for all i knew with no end in sight that was what our lives had been reduced to by the war the essence of misery and hopelessness the bottle lay empty my head spun the room reeked of cigarette smoke how do i love thee let me count the ways read vivien leigh how charlie hated such maudlin poetry i let my head rest on brads shoulder and cried banks went home early on thursday evening he didnt need to be in his office to prepare a list of questions for vivian elmsley and he was far more comfortable at the pine table in his kitchen a mug of strong tea beside him arvo pärts stabat mater on the stereo and the earlyevening light gold as autumn leaves flooding through the window behind him when he had made a list of the essential things he wanted to know he went through to the living room and tried brians number yet again on the fifth ring someone answered yeah brian andy whos calling his father pause just a sec banks heard muffled voices then a few moments later brian came on the phone dad whereve you been ive been trying to get in touch with you all week playing holiday resorts in south wales we were doing some gigs with the dancing pigs look dad i told you weve got gigs coming out of our ears were busy you werent interested banks paused he didnt want to blow it this time but he was damned if he was going to grovel to his own son thats not the point he said i dont think its out of line for a father to express some concern at his sons sudden change of plans do you you know im into the band youve always known ive loved music dad it was you who bought me that guitar for my sixteenth birthday dont you remember of course i do all im saying is that you have to give it a little time to sink in its a shock thats all we were all expecting you to come out with a good degree and start working at a good firm somewhere musics a great hobby but a risky living so you keep saying were doing all right anyway did you always do what your parents wanted you to low blow banks thought almost never would have been the truth but he wasnt ready to admit to that not always he said look im not saying you arent old enough to make your own decisions just think about it thats all i have thought about it this is what i want to do have you spoken to your mother banks swore he could almost hear the guilt in brians pause shes always out when i call he said at last bollocks banks thought well keep trying i still think it would come better from you brian if its your decision you can take responsibility for it believe me it wont come any better from me yeah yeah fine all right ill try her again you do that anyway the main reason im calling is that ill be down in your neck of the woods tomorrow so i wondered if we could get together and talk about things let me buy you a pint i dont know dad were really busy right now you cant be busy all the time theres rehearsals you know half an hour another pause followed banks heard brian say something to andrew but he couldnt catch what it was then brian came back on again look he said tomorrow and saturday were playing at a pub in bethnal green if you want to come and listen we can have that pint during the break banks got the name of the pub and the time and said hed do his best its all right said brian ill understand if something else comes up and you cant make it wouldnt be the first time one of the joys of being a coppers son ill be there said banks goodbye it was almost dark by now he took his cigarettes and small whiskey and went outside to sit on the wall a few remaining streaks of crimson and purple shot the sky to the west and the waning moon shone like polished bone over the valley the promise of a storm had dissipated and the air was clear and dry again well banks thought at least he had talked to brian and would get to see him soon he looked forward to hearing the band he had heard brian practicing his guitar when he lived at home of course and had been impressed by the way he had picked it up so easily unlike banks way back in the beatles days when every kid tried to learn guitar he had managed about three badly fingered chords before packing it in he envied brian his talent perhaps in the same way he envied him his freedom there had been a time when banks had also contemplated the bohemian life what he would actually have done he didnt know after all he had no facility for music or writing or painting he could have been a hangeron perhaps a roadie or just a real cool guy it didnt seem to matter back then but jems death soured the dream for him and he ended up joining the police he was living with sandra too by then wildly in love and thinking seriously for the first time in his life of a real future together with someone kids mortgage the lot besides deep down he knew he needed a career with some sort of disciplined structure or god knew what would happen to him he didnt really fancy the armed forces and with images of the nevertobefound graham marshall in his mind that left the police mysteries to solve bullies to send down maybe he should have followed his original impulse and dropped out he thought looking back and considering all that had happened lately but no he wasnt going to fall into that trap it would be far too easy he had chosen the life and the job he had wanted had two great kids and a slightly shopsoiled career to show for it and he couldnt imagine himself doing anything else nobody had ever promised him it was going to be a breeze the dark moods depressions that settled upon him like a flock of crows would disappear eventually the sense of futility the feeling that the dark pit of his despair actually had no bottom would also dissipate over time as brian had said when banks had first told him about the separation from sandra he just had to hang in there hang in there and make the best of what he had the cottage annie a challenging case an agitated curlew screeched and shrieked way up the daleside some animal threatening its nest perhaps banks heard his phone ring again quickly he stubbed out the cigarette and went back inside sorry to disturb you at this time of night sir said ds hatchley but i know youre off to london in the morning what is it banks looked at his watch half past nine its not like you to be working so late jim im not i mean i wasnt i was just over at the queens arms with a couple of mates from the rugby club so i thought id pop in the station like and see if id got any answers to my inquiries and francis henderson like i said i know youre off down there tomorrow so thats why im calling ive got an address he lives in london dulwich hatchley read the address whats interesting why it came back so quick is hes got form bankss ears pricked up go on according to criminal intelligence francis henderson started working for one of the east end gangs in the sixties not the krays exactly but that sort of thing mostly he dug up information for them found people they were after watched people they wanted watched he developed a drug habit and started dealing to support it in the seventies they say hes been retired and clean for years now at least as far as they know sure its our francis henderson yes sir okay thanks a lot for calling jim get yourself home now dont worry i will and give another push on that nationwide tomorrow if you can find time will do bon voyage fourteen annie was waiting on the platform at york station looking very businesslike in a navy midlength skirt and silverbuttoned blazer over a white blouse she had tied her hair back so tightly it made a v on her forehead and arched her dark eyebrows for once though banks didnt feel underdressed he wore a lightweight cotton summer suit and with it a redandgray tie top shirt button undone good lord she said smiling i feel like were sneaking away for a dirty weekend banks laughed if you play your cards right the station smelled of diesel oil and ancient soot from the days of steam gouts of compressed air rushed out from under the trains with a deafening hiss and pigeons flapped around the high ceiling announcements about late arrivals and departures echoed from the public address system the london train pulled out of the station only eleven minutes after the advertised departure time banks and annie chatted for a while lulled by the rattling and rocking rhythm and banks ascertained that whatever had been bothering annie on the phone yesterday was no longer a problem he had been forgiven annie started reading the guardian she had bought at the station newsstand and banks went back to guilty secrets in bed the previous evening he had given up on the shadow of death when the erstwhile di niven arrested his first suspect saying you have the right to remain silent if you dont have a lawyer one will be provided for you so much for the realistic depiction of police procedures allowing that it was one of her early di niven books and feeling that she deserved a second chance he started guilty secrets her most recent nonseries book and had trouble putting it down to get to sleep the basic plot device was the kind of thing everyone has seen a dozen times on television a man on holiday in a foreign country becomes involved in an altercation with another man in a crowded bar he tries to calm the situation and eventually leaves but the man pursues him outside and attacks him someone else a stranger comes to his aid and together they get carried away and beat the attacker to death they hide the body then go their separate ways and nothing more is heard of the incident back in england the first man becomes very successful in business and is poised at the edge of what promises to be an equally successful career in politics until the inevitable blackmailer turns up what does he do pay up or kill again despite the thinness of the plot guilty secrets turned out to be a fascinating exploration of conscience and character because of the situation he finds himself in the central character is forced to reexamine his entire life in relation to the crime he got away with while at the same time agonizing over what to do to secure his future to complicate matters killing does not come easy to this man he is human with a firm if understated belief in christianity at one point he considers letting it all come out so that he can pay the consequences he feels he should have paid years ago but he also likes his life the way it is not without a streak of selfinterest he is ambitious enjoys power and feels he can do the country some genuine good if he gets in the right position he also has others to consider family and employees who rely or depend on him for their livelihoods chapter after chapter with merciless compassion vivian elmsley strips the man to his soul lays bare his moral and spiritual dilemmas and tightens the net around him in his time banks had arrested a number of men who had killed to protect their illgotten fame or fortune or both but rarely had he come across a character as complex as the one vivian elmsley had created here perhaps he just hadnt looked deeply enough into them a police interview room was not the best place to get to know someone and banks had been far more concerned with obtaining a confession than with striking up a relationship that was where real life and fiction parted ways he thought one is messy and incomplete the other ordered and finished banks finished the book just before peterborough annie had closed her eyes by then and was either napping or meditating he gazed out of the window at the uninspiring landscape of his childhood a brick factory a red brick school stretches of waste ground littered with weeds and rubbish even the spire of the beautiful norman cathedral behind the shopping center failed to inspire him the train squealed to a halt of course it hadnt been so uninspiring back then his imagination had imbued every miserable inch of the place with magical significance the waste grounds were battlefields where the local lads reenacted the great battles of two world wars using tree branches or sticks of wood for rifles bayoneting opponents with great relish even when banks was playing alone or fishing in the river nene it was easy enough for him to believe he was an arthurian knight on a quest adam kelly had been doing the same thing in hobbs end when the world of his imagination had suddenly become real as the train left peterborough station banks thought of his parents not more than a mile away he looked at his watch about now he guessed his mother would be drinking milky instant coffee and reading her latest womens magazine and his father would be having his morning nap snoring gently feet up on the green velour pouffe newspaper spread over his lap unchanging routine it had been the same since his father was made redundant from his job as a steelworker in and his mother grew too old and tired to clean other peoples houses anymore banks thought of the disappointment and bitterness that had twisted their lives problems that he had certainly contributed to as well as margaret thatcher but their disappointments had been visited on him too in turn no matter how well he did it was never good enough even though banks had bettered himself he had a secure job with a steady source of income and good opportunities for advancement his parents didnt approve of his joining the police his father never tired of pointing out the traditional opposition between the working classes and the police force when the riot police on overtime taunted striking miners by waving rolls of fivepound notes at them in the strike he accused banks of being the enemy and tried to persuade him to resign it didnt matter that banks was working the drugs squad on the met at the time and had nothing to do with the troubles up north as far as his father was concerned the police were merely maggies bullyboys the enforcers of unpopular government policies oppressors of the workingman bankss mother for her part took a more domestic view and relayed tales of police divorces she heard about over the grapevine being a policeman wasnt a good career choice for a family man she never ceased to tell him never mind that it was over twenty years later when he and sandra split up most of that time relatively successful as modern marriages go his mother took great satisfaction that she had finally been vindicated and there lay the main problem banks thought as he watched the city disappear behind him he had never been able to do anything right when bad things happened to other kids parents usually took their side but when bad things happened to banks it was his own fault it had always been that way ever since he started getting cuts and bruises in schoolyard fights always him who must have started it whether he did or not as far as his parents were concerned banks thought if he got killed on the job that would probably be his own fault too when it came to blame they offered no quarter for family still he thought in a way that was what made him good at his job when he had been junior in rank he had never blamed his bosses when things went wrong and now he was dci he took the responsibility for his team whether it consisted of hatchley and susan gay or just annie cabbot if the team failed it was his failure a burden yes but also a strength kings cross was the usual madness banks and annie negotiated their way through the crowds and the maze of tiled echoing tunnels to the northern line and managed to cram into the first edgewarebound train that came along a few minutes later they came out of belsize park tube station walked up rosslyn hill and turned into the side street where vivian elmsley lived banks knew the area vaguely from his years in london though after notting hill he and sandra had mostly lived south of the river in kennington keats used to live near here banks remembered it was in one of these streets that the poor sod fell in love with his nextdoor neighbor fanny brawne a womans voice answered the intercom there was a long pause after banks had stated his rank and his business then a more resigned voice said youd better come up the lock buzzed and banks pushed open the front door they walked up three flights of thickly carpeted stairs to the secondfloor landing that this was a wellmaintained building was clear from the fresh lemon scent the gleaming woodwork and freshly painted walls decorated here and there with a stilllife print or a seascape probably cost an arm and a leg but then vivian elmsley could no doubt afford an arm and a leg the woman who opened the door was tall and slim standing ramrodstraight her gray hair fastened in a bun she had high cheekbones a straight slightly hooked nose and a small thin mouth crowsfeet spread around her remarkable deep blue eyes slanted at an almost oriental angle banks could see what elsie patterson meant if you were at all observant there was no mistaking those eyes she was dressed like a jogger in baggy black exercise trousers and a white sweatshirt still he supposed it didnt matter what you wore if all you had to do was sit around and write all day some people have all the luck she looked tired bags puffed under her eyes and broken blood vessels crisscrossed the whites she also looked strained and edgy as if she were running on reserves the flat was spartan and modern in its furnishings chrome and glass giving the small living room a generous sense of space a framed print of one of georgia okeeffes huge yellow flowers hung on the wall over the mantelpiece please sit down she gestured banks and annie toward two matching chromeandblackleather chairs then sat down herself clasping her hands on her lap they looked older than her face skeletal and liverspotted they were also unusually large for a womans hands i must admit im quite used to talking to the police she said but usually im the one questioning them how can i help you banks remembered the police procedure in the shadow of death and bit his tongue maybe she hadnt known any police officers when she wrote that book first of all he asked are you gwynneth shackleton i was though most people called me gwen vivian is my middle name elmsley is a pseudonym actually its my mothers maiden name its all perfectly legal im sure it is you grew up in hobbs end yes did you kill gloria shackleton her hand went to her chest kill gloria me what a suggestion i most certainly did not could matthew your brother have killed her no matthew loved her she looked after him he needed her im afraid this is all rather overwhelming chief inspector no doubt banks glanced at annie who remained expressionless notebook on her lap may i ask why you havent come forward in response to our requests for information he asked vivian elmsley paused before answering as if composing her thoughts carefully the way she might revise a page of manuscript chief inspector she said i admit that i have been following developments both in the newspapers and on television but i honestly dont believe i can tell you anything of any value i have also found it all very distressing thats why i havent come forward oh come off it said banks not only did you live in hobbs end throughout the war and not only did you know the victim well you were also her sisterinlaw you cant expect me to believe that you know nothing at all about what happened to her believe what you will where the two of you close i wouldnt say we were close no did you like her i cant honestly say i knew her very well you were about the same age you must have had things in common besides your brother she was older than i it does make a difference when youre young i wouldnt say we had much in common i was always a bookish sort of girl whereas gloria was the more flamboyant type as with many extroverts she was also a secretive person very difficult to get to know did you see a lot of her quite a bit we were in and out of one anothers houses bridge cottage wasnt far from the shop yet you claim you didnt know her well i didnt you probably have cousins or inlaws you hardly know at all chief inspector didnt you ever do things together like what i dont know girl things annie shot him a glance that he felt even before he noticed it out of the corner of his eye the hell with it he thought they were girls back then he had been a boy once too he did boy things and he didnt object to anyone saying so vivian pursed her lips then shrugged girl things i suppose we did the same sorts of things other people did during the war we went to the pictures to dances dances with american airmen sometimes yes was there anyone in particular i suppose we were quite friendly with several of them over the last year of the war do you remember their names i think so why what about brad ring a bell brad yes i think he was one of them what was his second name szikorski brad szikorski banks checked the list of rowan woods personnel he had brought with him bradford j szikorski jr that had to be the one and px billy joe edgar konig and billy joe farrell they were on the list too what about charlie vivian elmsley turned pale a muscle by the side of her jaw began to twitch markleson she whispered charlie markleson banks checked the sheet charles christopher markleson that the one charlie he was always called charlie whatever how did you find out their names i havent heard them in so long it doesnt matter how we found out we also discovered that gloria was having an affair with brad szikorski was she still seeing him when matthew came back is that what happened not that i knew of i dont know what youre getting at youve been misinformed chief inspector gloria was married to matthew whether he was there or not yes we went to the pictures with those boys on occasion perhaps to dances but thats all there was to it there was no question of romantic involvement are you sure of course i am how did gloria behave during her husbands absence what do you mean when she thought he was dead obviously things would be different then wouldnt they it wasnt as if she were waiting for him anymore as far as she was concerned she would never see him again after a reasonable period of mourning she could enter back into the spirit of the times couldnt she surely an attractive woman like her must have had boyfriends vivian paused again gloria had a very gregarious side to her nature she liked parties group excursions that sort of thing she liked to keep things superficial at a distance besides we never gave matthew up for dead completely you must understand that chief inspector we never gave up hope there was always hope hope that he would return and it proved wellfounded you havent answered my question did gloria have a romantic affair with brad szikorski or with anyone else she looked away not that i knew about so she lived like a nun even though she believed her husband was dead i didnt say that i didnt spy on her whatever she got up to behind locked doors was none of my business so she did get up to something i told you i didnt spy on her youre twisting my words how did brad take it when matthew came back alive how should i know why would it matter to him it might have if he fell in love with gloria and if she rejected him in favor of her husband he might have been angry are you suggesting that brad killed gloria vivian sniffed youre really clutching at straws now banks leaned forward somebody did ms elmsley and the most immediate suspects that come to mind are matthew one of the americans michael stanhope or you ridiculous it must have been a stranger we got plenty of them in the village you know what about michael stanhope its been years since ive heard his name they were friends thats all would it surprise you to hear that gloria posed nude for a painting by stanhope in yes it would very much i know that gloria wasnt as fastidious about her body as some would have wished her to be but i never saw any evidence of anything like that next time youre in leeds banks said drop by the art gallery and have a look youre sure she never told you i would have remembered was gloria having an affair with michael stanhope i shouldnt think so he was too old for her and homosexual i wouldnt know about that as i said i was very young it certainly wasnt something people went around boasting about back then did she ever tell you about her family in london about her son francis she did mention him to me once yes but she said shed cut off all relations with him and his father even so they could have come to drag her back maybe they fought and he killed her vivian shook her head im sure i would have known was matthew ever violent toward her never matthew had always been a gentle person and even his war experiences didnt change that her voice had taken on a strained wavering quality banks paused and softened his tone there is one thing that really puzzles me he said and thats what you did think had happened to gloria surely you cant have thought she had simply disappeared from the face of the earth it wasnt a mystery at the time not really she left thats what i had always thought until you found the remains you are certain its gloria arent you banks felt a twinge of doubt but he tried not to let it show they still had no definite proof of the skeletons identity for that they would need francis henderson so they could run dna checks were sure he said why would she leave because she couldnt stand it anymore taking care of matthew the way he was after all it wouldnt have been the first time shed done that she had clearly broken off all contact with whatever life she had had in london before coming to hobbs end i dont think gloria was particularly strong when it came to emotional fortitude true enough banks thought if a person has bid one life goodbye then it probably wouldnt be too difficult to do it again but gloria shackleton hadnt bid hobbs end goodbye he reminded himself she had been killed and buried there when did she disappear he asked shortly after ve day a week or so you must see how the discovery casts suspicion on your brother most of all gloria was buried in an outbuilding adjoining bridge cottage matthew was living with her there at the time but he was never violent i had never known him be violent never war can change a man even so did he go out much what do you mean after his return did he go out much was gloria often alone in the house he went to the pub on an evening the shoulder of mutton yes she was alone there sometimes did gloria ever say anything to you about leaving she hinted at it once or twice but i didnt take her seriously why not her manner it was as if she was joking you know some day my prince will come im going to leave all this behind and run off to untold wealth and riches gloria was a dreamer chief inspector i on the other hand have always been a realist i suppose thats debatable banks said given what you do for a living perhaps my dreams are very realistic perhaps even though she hinted you didnt believe gloria would actually go no what were the circumstances surrounding her departure banks asked did you see her go no it happened on one of the days when i accompanied matthew to his doctor in leeds when we got back that evening she was gone you accompanied him why not gloria she was still his wife and he was still my brother anyway she asked me to on occasion it was the only respite she got she looked after him the rest of the time i thought it only fair she get some time to herself once in a while did she take anything with her when she left a few clothes personal items she didnt have much but she took her clothes yes a few thats interesting what did she carry them in an old cardboard suitcase the same one she arrived with did she leave a note not that i saw if matthew found one he never indicated it to me would he have possibly not he wasnt very communicative in his condition its impossible to predict what he would have done murder no not matthew ive already told you he had a gentle nature even his dreadful war experiences and his illness didnt change that about him though they changed everything else but glorias belongings were definitely missing yes and you and matthew were in leeds during the time she made her exit yes so she never even said goodbye sometimes its easier that way so it is banks remembered that sandra once she had made her mind up had given him little time for protracted goodbyes he paused for a moment ms elmsley he asked knowing what you know now why do you think her clothes and suitcase were missing where do you think they got to i have no idea im only telling you what i witnessed at the time what i thought must have happened perhaps someone stole them perhaps she interrupted a burglar and he killed her were they particularly fine clothes minks a few diamond necklaces perhaps a tiara or two dont be absurd its not me whos being absurd you see its not often people get murdered for their clothes especially if theyre ordinary clothes perhaps they were taken for some other reason like what to make it look as if she had gone away ah now that would be clever wouldnt it who do you think would feel the need to risk taking time burying her body under the outbuilding floor i dont know not a casual burglar i dont think as i suggested perhaps someone wanted to make it appear as if she had gone away but who would want to do that and perhaps more important why to avoid suspicion exactly which brings us back very close to home doesnt it why try to avoid suspicion unless you have some reason to believe suspicion will fall on you your rhetoric is too much for me chief inspector but you write detective novels ive read one of them dont play the fool with me you know exactly what im talking about im very flattered that you have read my books chief inspector but im afraid you attribute to me a far more logical mind than i actually possess banks sighed if someone took great pains to make it look as if gloria had run away id say that someone wasnt likely to be a stranger just passing through or a burglar it had to be someone who felt suspicion was likely to fall on him or her matthew brad szikorski or you well it wasnt me and i told you matthew never raised a finger to her which leaves brad szikorski perhaps though i doubt it it doesnt matter anyway why not she allowed him a thin smile because brad szikorski was killed in a flying stunt in the desert outside los angeles in ironic isnt it during the war brad flew on bombing raids over europe and survived only to be killed in a stunt for a war film seven or eight years later what about charles markleson charlie he would have had no reason at all to harm gloria besides he was killed in the war edgar konig billy joe farrell i dont know what happened to them chief inspector its all so long ago i only know about brad because it was in the newspapers at the time i suppose youll have to ask them yourself wont you that is if you can find them oh ill find them if theyre still alive had either of them reason to kill gloria not that i know of they were simply part of a group we went around with though billy joe i remember did have a violent temper and px was rather smitten with gloria did she go out with him not to my knowledge you couldnt he wasnt i mean he just seemed so young and so shy did you notice any blood in bridge cottage after glorias disappearance no obviously if i had done i would have been suspicious and called the police but then i cant say i was actually looking for blood not one little spot nothing that might in retrospect have been blood nothing anyway what makes you think she was killed in bridge cottage its a logical assumption she could have been killed outside in the backyard or even in the outbuilding where you found her remains possibly banks allowed even so whoever did it was very thorough what happened next nothing we just carried on actually we only stayed on in the village a few weeks longer then we got a council house in leeds i know ive seen it i cant imagine why youd want to do that so youre saying you have absolutely no idea what happened to gloria none at all as i said i simply thought she couldnt face life with matthew anymore in his condition so she ran off and started up elsewhere did you think she might have run off with brad szikorski arranged to meet him over in america or something after all the four hundred fortyeighth bomber group moved out around the same time didnt they i suppose it crossed my mind it was always possible that she had ended up in america did it not surprise you that she never got in touch it did but there was nothing i could do about it if she wanted to disappear sever all ties as i said shed done it before did you ever try to find her no did anyone not that i know of what about matthew what about him did you kill him i did not he committed suicide why it wasnt related to glorias disappearance he was ill confused depressed in pain i did my best for him but it was ultimately no use he shot himself didnt he yes with a colt fortyfive automatic was it im afraid i know nothing about guns where did he get the gun the gun im sorry i dont follow simple question ms elmsley where did matthew get the gun he shot himself with he always had it always since when i dont know since he came back from the war i suppose i cant remember when i first saw it from the japanese pow camp yes banks got to his feet shaking his head whats wrong chief inspector vivian asked hand plucking at the turkey flap at the base of her throat everything said banks none of it makes any sense think over what youve just told us will you youre telling us you believed that gloria simply upped sticks and left without leaving a note taking her clothes and a few personal belongings with her in a cardboard suitcase if youre telling the truth then whoever killed gloria must have packed the suitcase and either taken it away with him or buried it somewhere to make it look as if she had run off then five years later your brother matthew shot himself with an american service revolver he just happened to bring back from a japanese pow camp you write detective novels ask yourself if your inspector niven would believe it ask yourself if your readers would believe it he reached in his pocket heres my card i want you to think seriously about our little talk well be back soon dont bother yourself well see ourselves out once they were out in the hot street again annie turned to banks whistled and said what was all that about all what she was lying couldnt you tell of course she was banks looked at his watch want to grab a bite to eat yes im starving they found a small café and sat outside annie had a greek salad and banks went for the prosciutto provolone and sliced redonion sandwich but why was she lying annie asked when they had sat down with their food i dont get it banks swatted a fly away from his sandwich shes protecting herself or someone else after seeing her annie said id say she was probably big and strong enough to kill and bury gloria fifty years ago anyway did you notice her hands yes and gloria shackleton was petite so what do we do now nothing said banks well leave her to stew overnight and then have another go at her tomorrow i get the impression she has a lot on her conscience there was a definite struggle going on inside her if im right shes near the end of her tether on this its amazing how guilt has a way of gnawing away at you through the small hours she wants to tell the truth but she still has a few things to weigh up to settle with herself she doesnt quite know how to go about it yet its like that character in her book the one you were reading on the train guilty secrets yes and what did he do banks smiled and put his finger to his lips that would be telling i wouldnt want to spoil the ending for you annie thumped his arm bastard and in the meantime vivian elmsleys not going to do a runner shes too old and too tired to run she also has nowhere to go first well go see if we can find francis henderson and then if its okay with you id like to head out to bethnal green and see my son his bands playing there weve got a few things to talk over of course i understand maybe ill go to the pictures what about later remember that naughty weekend you mentioned annie nodded i dont know if youre still interested but theres this discreet little hotel out bloomsbury way and it is friday even cid get to work regular hours sometimes well let vivian elmsley sleep on it if she can annie blushed but i didnt bring my toothbrush banks laughed ill buy you one last of the big spenders she turned to him the corner of her mouth twitching in a smile i didnt bring my nightie either dont worry said banks you wont need your nightie fifteen over the next couple of weeks as i continued to mourn charlie i noticed no improvement in matthews condition he remained at bridge cottage with gloria i dont really think it mattered to him at that point where he was if indeed he even knew as long as his basic creature comforts were taken care of there wasnt a day went by when i didnt spend time sitting with him talking to him though he never responded and hardly even acknowledged that he heard he just stared off into space with that intense inward gaze of his as if looking on horrors and agonies we could never even imagine in our wildest nightmares the london doctor was as good as his word and we soon got matthew fixed up with dr jennings a psychiatrist attached to the staff of the university of leeds he had his office in one of those big old houses in the streets behind the campus houses where large families with servants used to live before the first war once a week either i or gloria would take him to his appointment spend an hour or so looking around the shops then collect him and take him home dr jennings admitted to me privately on the third visit that he was having little success with straightforward methods and that he was considering narcosynthesis despite the problems matthew wasnt any trouble he just wasnt there he did however get into the habit of going to the shoulder of mutton every night and sitting alone in a corner drinking until closing time friends and neighbors who knew him would approach at first and ask how he was doing but soon even those who remembered him most fondly left him alone once in a while he would have an angry outburst and smash a glass or kick a chair but these were infrequent and soon passed over gloria gave me a key so i was able to pop in and out of bridge cottage whenever i could she took as much time off from the farm as possible of course but she needed the income and i dont think she could have borne the pain and the heartbreak of being with him twentyfour hours a day it was hard to believe that the war was almost over after all this time even though you could smell victory in the air the americans had crossed the rhine and so had montys men the russians had berlin surrounded in april and may we started hearing the first rumors about concentration camps and human atrocities on a scale that had only been hinted at in the reports about lublin the previous year all the newspapers seemed at a loss as to how to describe what the liberating armies had found at places such as belsen and buchenwald in addition to reading about japanese cannibalism and the appalling tortures inflicted on prisoners like matthew i also read about the german camps where hundreds of thousands of people or so we thought at the time were shot starved beaten or made the subject of medical experiments along with all our personal losses such as charlie and matthews ruined health it was impossible to take it all in i dont think we even tried we had suffered five years of fear and hardship and we were damned if we were going to be cheated out of the big party when it was all over banks walked into the cavernous victorian pub all smoked and etched glass brass fittings and mirrors somehow it had survived the blitz as much of east london hadnt years of cigarette smoke had turned the high ceiling and the walls brown it wasnt far from mile end where gloria shackleton had been born she may have even been here banks fancied though he doubted it people tended to stick very close to home hardly venturing more than a street or two away except on emergencies or special occasions he and annie had just been to dulwich to see francis henderson only to find him out a neighbor told them she thought he had most likely gone on holiday as he had canceled his newspapers and milk banks slipped his card with a note through the letter box and left it at that what more could he do as far as he was concerned francis henderson wasnt guilty of any crime or if he was it was nothing to do with the gloria shackleton case he wanted to meet francis mostly out of curiosity to see what he was like and find out what he knew if anything but he could hardly justify the expense of a manhunt the dna would be helpful but not essential it was half past five and the band was due to start at six to draw in the afterwork crowd not that anyone banks could see in the audience looked as if they had been at work unless they were all students or bicycle couriers brian stood on the low wooden stage along with the others setting their equipment up maybe they were making money but they clearly couldnt afford a crew of roadies yet the mountain of speakers made banks a little nervous he loved music and he knew that rock sometimes benefited from being played loud but he feared deafness perhaps even more than blindness back in his notting hill days he had been to see just about all the major bands live the who led zeppelin pink floyd jimi hendrix the doors and more than once he had woken up the next day with ringing ears brian waved him over he looked a little nervous but that was only to be expected after all he was with his mates and here was his old man coming to a gig they would no doubt tease him about that he introduced banks to andy the keyboard player jamisse the bassist who was from mozambique and the percussionist ali banks didnt know if brian had told them he was a detective probably not he guessed there might be a bit of pot around and brian wouldnt want to alienate himself from his friends ive just got to tune up said brian then ill come over okay fine pint sure banks bought a couple of pints at the bar and found an empty table about halfway down the room occasionally feedback screeched from the amps ali hit a snare drum or jamisse plucked at a bass string it was a quarter to six when brian apparently satisfied with the sound detached himself from the others and came over banks hadnt realized until now how much his son had changed brian wore threadbare jeans trainers and a plain red tshirt his dark hair was long and straight and he had a three or four days growth around his chin he was tall maybe a couple of inches more than bankss five foot nine and being skinny he looked even taller he sat down and scratched his cheek avoiding bankss eyes banks didnt want to launch right into the midst of things the last thing he wanted was another row im looking forward to this he said nodding toward the stage i havent heard you play since you used to practice at home brian looked surprised that was a long time ago dad i hope ive got better since then me too banks smiled cheers they clinked glasses then banks lit a cigarette still got that filthy habit then said brian banks nodded fraid so ive cut down a lot though what kind of music do you play youll have to wait and hear it for yourself i cant describe it blues not straight blues no that was the band i was with a couple of years ago we broke up ego problems lead singer thought he was robert plant robert plant i wouldnt have thought youd have heard of him why wouldnt i have you were always playing stairway to heaven when you werent playing bloody operas the long version he smiled i dont remember doing that banks complained anyway who writes the songs all of us really i do most of the lyrics jamisse does most of the music andy can read music so he arranges and stuff we do some cover versions too anything an old fogy like me would recognize brian grinned you might be surprised got to go now will you be around after how longs the set fortyfive minutes give or take banks looked at his watch six plenty of time he was a short walk from the central line and it wouldnt take him more than an hour to get to leicester square i dont have to leave until about eight he said great brian walked back up to the stage where the others looked ready to begin the pub was filling up quickly now and banks was joined at his table by a young couple the girl had jetblack hair pale makeup and a stud in her upper lip was she a goth he wondered but her boyfriend looked like a beatnik with his beret and goatee and brians band didnt play goth music matching the fashions with the music used to be easy parkas and motor scooters with the who and the kinks brylcreem leather and motorbikes with eddie cochran and elvis moptops and black polonecks with the beatles and later tiedye and long hair with pink floyd and the nice skinheads braces and bovverboots with the specials torn clothes and spiky hair with the sex pistols and the clash these days though all the fashions seemed to coexist banks had seen kids with tiedye and skinhead haircuts leather jackets and long hair he was definitely overdressed in his suit even though he had put his tie in his pocket long ago but he hadnt brought a change of clothes maybe he was just getting old the next thing he knew the band had started brian was right they played a blend of music difficult to pin down there was blues underlying it definitely variations on the twelvebar structure with a jazzy spring andys ghostly keyboards floated around it all and brians guitar cut through the rhythms clear as a bell when he soloed which he did very well his sound reminded banks of a cross between early jerry garcia and eric clapton not that he was as technically accomplished as either but the echoes were present in his tone and phrasing and he got the same sweet tortured sounds out of his guitar in each number he did something a little different the rhythm section was great they kept the beat of course but both jamisse and ali were creative musicians who played off one another and liked to spring surprises there was an improvisational jazzy element to the music but it was accessible popular for a few songs they were joined by a soprano saxophone player banks thought his tone was a bit too harsh and his style too staccato but bringing the instrument in was a good idea if only they could find a better player they paused between songs and brian leaned into the microphone this ones for an old geezer i know sitting in the audience he said looking directly at banks the girl with the stud in her lip frowned at him and he felt himself blush after all he was the only old geezer in the place it took a few moments for banks to recognize what the song was so drastically had the group altered its rhythm and tempo and so different was brians plaintive reedy voice from the original but what emerged from bankss initial confusion was a cover version of one of his favorite dylan songs love minus zerono limit this time it swung and swayed with interlaced afro rhythms and a hint of reggae andys organ imbued the whole piece and brians guitar solo was subdued and lyrical spinning little riffs and curlicues off the melody line dylans cryptic lyrics didnt really mesh with brians own songs mostly straightforward numbers about teenage angst lust alienation and the evils of society but they resonated in banks the same way they did the first time he heard them on the radio at home all those years ago before the song was over banks got a lump in his throat and he felt his eyes prick with tears he lit another cigarette his fourth of the day he wasnt feeling emotional only because his son was up there on a stage giving something back but the song also brought back memories of jem after jems death no one came to the bedsit to claim his belongings the landlord whose musical taste ran more toward skiffle than sixties rock let banks take the small box of lps being more into harold robbins than baba ram dass he also let banks take the books banks and jem had listened to bringing it all back home a lot and the first time he took it out to play in jems memory he found a letter stuffed inside the sleeve it was addressed to jeremy hylton at an address in cambridgeshire at first he wasnt going to read it respecting jems privacy but as it usually did his curiosity got the better of him according to the postmark the letter was dated five years earlier he had known jem was older than him but not by how much the letter was very short dear jeremy im writing to your parents address because i know youre going home for whitsuntide and i wont be here when you get back im sorry ive been trying to tell you that it just isnt working between us but you wont listen to me i know this is the cowards way out and i know its hurtful to you but i dont want the baby and its my body my lifelong burden i have made arrangements with a good doctor so you neednt worry about me ive got the money too so i dont need anything from you after that im going a long way away so dont even try to look for me im sorry jeremy really i am but things were going badly between us before the pregnancy you must know that i dont know how you could think that having a baby would bring us closer together im sorry clara banks remembered being puzzled and upset by what he read jem had never mentioned anyone named clara nor had he ever mentioned where his family lived or what they did he looked at the address again croft wynde it sounded posh he hadnt a clue what jems background was his accent was neutral really and he never spoke about the world he had grown up in he was clearly educated wellread and he introduced banks to a whole world of writing from kerouac and ginsberg to hesse and sartre but he never said anything about having been to university still everyone was reading that kind of stuff then you didnt need a university course to read on the road or howl when banks had finished thinking about what hed just read in the letter he made a note of the address he decided to drive out to see jems parents the least he could do was offer his condolences his time in london had been lonely and would have been a lot more so if not for the shared conversations music and warmth of jems tiny bedsit the song finished and the audiences applause brought banks out of his reverie that was weird the kid next to him said the blackhaired girl nodded and gave banks a mystified glance i dont think they wrote it themselves banks smiled at her bob dylan he said oh yeah right i knew that after that the band launched into one of brians songs an upbeat rocker about race relations then the first set was over the band acknowledged the applause then brian came over banks bought them both another pint the couple at the table asked banks if he would please save their seats then they wandered off to talk with some friends across the room that was great banks said i didnt know you liked dylan i dont really i prefer the wallflowers it used to drive me crazy when i was a kid and you played him all the time that whiny voice of his and the bloodyawful harmonica its just a nice structure that song easy to deconstruct banks felt disappointed but he didnt let it show i liked the ones you wrote too he said brian glanced away thanks there was no point putting it off any longer banks thought taking a deep breath soon the band would be starting again and he didnt know when he would get another chance to talk to his son look he said about what we said on the phone the other day im disappointed of course i am but its your life if you think you can really make a go of this im certainly not going to stand in your way brian met bankss gaze and banks thought he could see relief in his sons eyes so his approval did matter after all he felt curiously lightheaded you mean it banks nodded it was just so boring dad youre right i screwed it up and im sorry if i caused you any grief but it was only partly because of the band i didnt do enough work last year because i was bored by the whole subject i was lucky to get a third banks had felt exactly the same way about his businessstudies course bored so he could hardly get on his moral high horse well he could but he managed to put a rein on his parents voices this time have you told your mother yet brian looked away and shook his head youll have to tell her you know i left a message on her machine shes always out she has to work why dont you go over and pay her a visit shes not far away brian said nothing for a while he swirled the beer in his glass pushed back his hair the place was noisy and crowded around them banks managed to focus and cut out the laughter and shouted conversations just the two of them on a floodlit island the rest of the world a buzz in the distance brian is there something wrong nah not really come on brian sipped some beer and shrugged its nothing its just sean thats all banks felt a tingling at the back of his neck what about him hes a creep he treats me like a kid whenever i go over there he cant wait to get rid of me he cant keep his hands off of mum either dad why cant you two get back together why cant things be the way they were he looked at banks brow furrowed tears of anger and pain in his eyes not the cool accomplished young man anymore but for a moment the scared little kid who has lost his parents and his only safe reliable haven in the world banks swallowed and reached for another cigarette its not that easy he said do you think i didnt want to didnt a lots changed you mean youve got a new girlfriend if it were possible to inflect the word with more venom than brian did banks couldnt imagine how thats not the point he said your mother has made it quite clear over and over again that she doesnt want to get back together ive tried i did have hopes at first but what more can i do try harder banks shook his head i dont know he said it takes two to do that and im getting no encouragement whatsoever from her quarter ive sort of given up on it im sorry about sean sorry you dont get along hes a plonker yeah well look when you get a bit of free time why dont you come up to gratly you can help me work on the cottage you havent even seen it yet we can go for long walks together remember the way we used to semerwater langstrothdale hardraw force i dont know said brian pushing his hair back were gonna be really busy the next while whenever im not asking you to put a date to it its an open invitation okay brian looked up from his beer and smiled that slightly crooked smile that always reminded banks so much of his own father okay he said id like that its a deal soon as we get a few days break ill be knocking on your door a bass note and drum roll cut through the buzz of conversation as if to echo what brian had said he looked up gotta go dad he said be around later i dont think so said banks ive got work to do ill stick around for part of the set but i might be gone before youre through its been great seeing you and dont be a stranger remember my offer theres a bed there for you whenever you want for as long as you want thanks dad whats it they say homes the place where they have to take you in wish i knew where mine was take care banks stuck out his hand and brian shook it then feeling guilty he checked his watch time to hear a few more songs before slinking off to keep his date with annie one day gloria came to me and asked if i would mind closing the shop for an hour or so and walking with her she looked pale and hadnt taken her usual pains with her appearance it was the beginning of may i remember and it was all over but the shouting hitler was dead the russians had berlin and all the german troops in italy had surrendered it could only be days from the end now i closed the shop as she asked and we walked into rowan woods leaving the road behind and wandering in the filtered green light of the new leaves the woodland flowers were all in bloom clusters of bluebells here and there wild roses violets and primroses birds were singing and the air was pungent with the smell of wild garlic now and then i could hear a cuckoo call in the distance i dont know what to do with him gwen she said wringing her hands as we walked close to tears nothing i do to try to reach him does any good i know i said we just have to be patient let the doctor do his job time will heal him even as i spoke them i felt the triteness and inadequacy of my words its all right for you hes not your husband gloria hes my brother she put her hand on my arm oh im sorry gwen thats not the way i meant it im just too distraught but its not the same hes taken to sleeping on the chesterfield now when he gets in from the pub you dont i mean he doesnt not since he came back its not fair gwen i know im being selfish but this isnt the man i married im living with a stranger its getting unbearable are you going to leave him i dont know what to do i dont think i can brad is still pestering me to run off back to america with him as soon as his new orders come in he says he might have to go out to the pacific first the wars not over there yet but he says hell send for me just imagine it gwen hollywood a new life in the sunshine under the palm trees in a faraway magical land a young healthy handsome vigorous man who dotes on me endless possibilities of riches and wealth i could even become a movie star ordinary people like you and me can do that over there you know but she turned away eyes downcast a dream thats all i cant go silly isnt it a few years ago i did exactly that walked away from a life i didnt want and ended up here but youd lost your whole family then you had nothing to stay for anyone can understand your doing that havent i lost matt now its not the same youre right its not anyway id walked away even before i lost them what do you mean she paused and touched my arm again lightly there are things you dont know about me gwen i havent been a good person ive done terrible things ive been selfish ive hurt people terribly but i want you to know one thing this is important what matt is the only man i have ever truly loved not brad not brad not never mind what were you going to say gloria paused and looked away from me i told you ive done terrible things if i tell you you must promise never to tell anyone else i promise she looked at me with those blue eyes of hers i was shocked that i hadnt noticed the tragedy in them before i wont ask you to forgive me she said you might not be able to do that but at least hear me out i nodded she leaned back against a tree when i was sixteen she began i had a baby i didnt love the father not really oh i suppose i was infatuated george was a few years older than me goodlooking popular with all the girls i was advanced for my age and flattered by his attentions we well you know all about it we only did it once but i didnt know anything about you know then and i got pregnant our families wanted us to get married george would have done it like a shot he said he loved me but i knew i knew deep down that it would be the worst mistake of my life i knew if i married george i would be unhappy he loved me then but how long would it last he drank like they all did down on the docks and i really believed it was just a matter of time before he would start beating me looking upon me as his slave id seen it in my own home my own father i hated him that was why i wanted so desperately to escape i used to listen to the wireless for hours trying to learn to speak the way i thought real people spoke if my dad caught me hed either laugh at me or beat me depending on how much hed had to drink so i left them all where did you go to a friends house not far away i didnt know anyone from outside the east end except for my uncle jack in southend and hed have just sent me right back home and you were with this friend when your parents were killed yes i was heartbroken about joe my little brother but my father can rot in hell as far as i was concerned and my mother she was harmless i suppose but she did nothing to stop him in a way she was better off dead she didnt have much of a life i dont remember ever seeing her smile but what about the baby again gloria paused as if struggling for words i hated being pregnant i was sick all the time after i had francis i got very depressed and i didnt i didnt feel what they said a normal mother should im ashamed to say it but i didnt like holding him i felt revolted that such a thing could have come out of me i hated my own baby gwen thats why i could never be a real mother to him or to anyone else she sobbed and fell forward into my arms i held her and comforted her as best i could i didnt understand i had no idea that a mother could not love her child i knew nothing about postnatal depression in those days im not sure that anybody did my heart felt hot and too big for my chest sniffling dabbing her handkerchief to her eyes gloria went on francis is alive georges sister ivy cant have any children of her own they live on the canal her husband johns a lockkeeper i know hes teetotal and ive met ivy once or twice theyre decent people not like the others theyd got away and bettered themselves they said they would take care of francis i knew he would be better off with them what did george say he already knew that whatever there had been between us was over though it never stopped him trying but he couldnt understand it when i didnt object to giving up francis to ivy and john george is a simple man traditional he believes in family he believes a mother should love her baby simple as that of course he agreed he could hardly bring up francis on his own he said i would still be the boys mother no matter what happened that a boy needed a real mother to love when i agreed without any fuss and said i didnt mind if they kept him forever george refused to believe me thats what he always did when i had one of my funny turns as he called them refused to believe me he wasnt a bad man gwen thats not what im saying its me whos bad i think he loved his son more than i did he wanted to be a father as much as he could but he got called up of course like all the rest anyway he always thought i would change my mind hes stubborn the way some men are hes already been up to see me once with francis he said he still loves me urged me to go back i told him i was married and we had an argument he went off but hell be back gwen he wont give up that easily are you afraid of him i dont know maybe a little hes got a temper like his own father especially when hes been drinking i didnt know what to say say you dont hate me gwen please i couldnt bear it if you hated me youre my only real friend of course i dont hate you i just dont understand thats all i dont know if i do either but dont you see thats exactly why i cant leave no matter what life is like with matt because of what i did before oh i have plenty of excuses i was too young it was a mistake i wasnt in love i thought i was cut out for better things but thats just what they are excuses when it came right down to it i was selfish i was a coward im not going to be a coward again this is my punishment gwen dont you see matt is my penance i think so i said she smiled through her tears good old gwen ill bet there arent many in hobbs end would give me that much credit dont you think ive heard their tongues wagging already she imitated the local accent shell be off they say off with one of them yanks before hes been back ten minutes you just mark my words well i wont gwen let them talk but i wont are you and brad still sometimes dont be angry i tried to stop seeing him when matt first got back i really did but when i found out that he couldnt i mean brad brings me comfort from time to time and as long as matt doesnt know to be honest though hes more trouble than hes worth right now i just cant keep him off the subject of running away together its all getting to be too much of a strain i told him if he didnt stop pushing me id run off and leave the whole lot of you behind him included i cant say that i approved of glorias seeing brad after matthew had returned but i said nothing i only felt that way because i was being protective toward matthew i wasnt a moral busybody like betty goodall these were extraordinary times and gloria was an extraordinary woman she laughed you know i dont know what id do without px its funny isnt it but in times like this when things are so grim its the little things that give you a moments cheer a piece of beef a new shade of lipstick a little whiskey a packet of cigarettes new stockings hes a gem what about billy joe have you had any more trouble from him no not really i saw him the other day i got the impression he was secretly pleased that matt had come back and spoiled things for me and brad he had that look in his eye too as if he thought he had a chance of getting me in bed again i dont think he gives a damn about what its all doing to me well he wouldnt would he i cant say i ever did really trust him hes got a nasty violent streak you know billy joe oh i can handle him hes nothing but a big child really she leaned back against the tree but youre right he can be violent i dont like that in a man she paused averting her eyes look gwen i dont know if i should be telling you this but i have to talk to someone ive been having a few problems with michael michael good lord you dont mean hes dont be a fool gwen the mans only interested in boys the younger the better no well i suppose ill have to tell you now but you mustnt say a word to anyone promise what a day for secrets all right i promise last summer and autumn you might have noticed i spent quite a bit of time at his studio yes guess what he was painting you oh you guessed well it wasnt difficult i mean he is an artist but thats wonderful gloria can i see it is it finished yes and its very good so whats wrong its a nude i swallowed you posed in the nude for michael stanhope she laughed why not there certainly wasnt much chance of him trying to put his hands on me was there anyway the point is i went over to see him yesterday and begged him not to exhibit it or even to sell it privately as long as matthew is alive i know he just seems to sit there like a zombie between going to the pub and drinking himself to sleep but i just dont know how it would affect him or if it would the thing is i dont want to take the chance you know what this village is like matthews health is hanging by a thread already who knows if seeing a nude painting of his wife done while he was suffering in a japanese pow camp wont send him right over the edge that sounds reasonable i told her what did michael stanhope have to say oh he agreed in the end but hes not happy about it thinks its one of the best things hes done blahblahblah opens up a new direction for him says his career needs a boost and this could give it one he also argued that matthew wouldnt be any the wiser and that even if he did see it he wouldnt recognize who it was hes probably right im being silly but he did agree he complained a lot but yes he agreed in the end he likes to play the miserable cynic but hes pretty decent deep down hes got a good heart and there she finished we walked back to hobbs end enjoying the sound of the breeze through the leaves and the songs of the birds in the high branches i didnt see gloria again until a couple of days later on the afternoon of the seventh of may and by then everyone knew germany had surrendered the war was over and everywhere people started putting up flags and closing up shop the last party had begun enjoy the film banks asked when he met annie outside the leicester square odeon at nine oclock she had been to see the latest megamillion specialeffects extravaganza by one of those highly touted directors who used to make television adverts not much said annie i suppose it had its good points what the end for one banks laughed leicester square was crowded with tourists as usual street kids buskers jugglers clowns and sword swallowers were all working hard to prize a quid or two out of the punters pockets while the pickpockets took an easier route the hare krishnas were back in force too banks hadnt seen them in years how were things with your son annie asked we mended a bridge or two and the band pretty good though i suppose im biased well go see them if they ever play up north and you can make your own mind up its a date banks took annie to a small bistrostyle restaurant he knew just off shaftesbury avenue the place was busy but they managed to get a table for two after a short wait at the bar im starving said annie as she squeezed herself into the chair between the table and the wall twisting around and setting her packages down behind her but i can see that eating with you is going to become a serious problem what do you mean this kind of place hardly caters to the vegetarian eater she whispered just look at the menu banks looked she was right lamb beef chicken fish seafood but little in the way of interesting vegetarian dishes other than salads still as far as banks was concerned interesting vegetarian dish was up there with corporate ethics as far as oxymorons went sorry he said do you want to try somewhere else she put her hand on his arm no it doesnt matter next time though its my choice visions of tofu and seaweed are already dancing before my eyes idiot it doesnt have to be like that indian restaurants do great vegetarian dishes so do italian ones you didnt complain about the meal i made last week did you it was delicate timing i didnt want to offend you just before i made a pass annie laughed well theres something to be said for honesty i suppose i wasnt being honest i was being facetious it was a great meal dessert wasnt bad either there you go again anyway youre right next time its your choice okay deal how about some wine they chose a relatively inexpensive claret relatively being the key word and banks went for the roast leg of lamb with rosemary while annie pulling a martyred expression settled for a large green salad and some bread and cheese the waiter who must have been imported from france along with the decor and food style grunted with disapproval and disappeared their food arrived quicker than banks expected and they paused until the waiter had gone the lamb was tender and succulent still pink in the middle annie turned her nose up at it and said her salad was okay there was a tape of romantic dinner music playing in the background and beyond the bustling waiters the hum of conversation clinking of cutlery and glassware banks could hear strains of the andante cantabile from tchaikovskys string quartet number after his talk with brian he felt as if a burden had been lifted from his mind there were still problems sean for one but brian would just have to learn to live with the way things were banks had to admit that this sean sounded like a real prick not for the first time he speculated about going over there and kicking the shit out of him really mature way to deal with the problem he told himself a lot of good that would do everyone concerned the important thing at the moment was that he and his son were talking again and from what he had heard the kid had talent he might make it in the business yet banks tried to imagine being father to a famous rock star when he was old and gray would brian buy him a mansion and a mercedes the candlelight brought out the slight wineflush on annies cheeks and filled her dark eyes with mysterious shadows and reflections she was still wearing the same business suit she had worn that morning but she had loosened her hair so that it tumbled over her shoulders in sexy waves it would probably just brush against the tattoo over her breast what are you thinking about she asked looking up and pushing some stray hair back behind one ear perhaps this was the moment banks thought emboldened by his buoyant mood to take the plunge anyway annie can i ask you a personal question she arched her eyebrows and banks sensed a part of her scurry back into the shadows too late now of course she said but i cant promise to answer it fair enough what are you doing at harkside what do you mean you know what i mean its a nowhere posting its the kind of place they send naughty boys and girls youre bright youre keen youve got a future ahead of you if you want it but youll not get the job experience you need at harkside i think thats rather insulting to inspector harmond and the others up there dont you oh come on annie you know as well as i do thats where they want to be its their choice and its not an insult that they choose the easy life well maybe its what ive chosen too is it i didnt promise to answer your question her mouth took on a sulky cast banks hadnt seen before the corners of her lips downturned her fingers drummed on the tablecloth no you didnt banks said leaning toward her but let me tell you something jimmy riddle hates my guts he isnt in the business of putting me in the way of anything i might find even remotely pleasant now given that he knows who you are and given that whats happened between us since could never in a million years fulfill his idea of the circle of hell he thinks hes cast me into i find myself wondering why or waiting for the punch line what isnt that what youre saying you think somethings wrong you think theres some sort of a plot to get you you think im part of it thats not what i said said banks who realized guiltily that the thought had crossed his mind annie turned her head away her profile looked stern annie he said after a few moments silence im not saying i havent been suspicious but believe me the only reason im asking you now is because ive come to because im afraid youre being used too she glanced at him not moving her head eyes narrowed how i dont know what else can i say riddle had to have some reason for putting us together something he thought would be unpleasant for me i hope you agree that it hasnt turned out at all that way do you blame me for wondering whats going on her expression softened a little she tilted her head perhaps this is it she suggested what he expected in what way that wed get together somehow break the rules and get caught that way he could be rid of both of us no thats not enough its too easy what were doing isnt i mean its only the same kind of thing he thought i was doing before he has a far more sadistic mind than that and to be honest i dont think hes as clever as that either what is it the spies call it a honey trap jimmy riddle feels no need to give me honey only arsenic jimmy riddle didnt give you anything okay sorry you know what i mean annie shook her head slowly and the shadows danced through her hair dessert came but she left it untouched for a while then she seemed to come to some kind of decision she picked up her spoon tasted a mouthful then looked at banks all right she said ill tell you but only if youll tell me something too yorkshire weather has a very ironic sense of occasion on the eighth of may it poured down all morning despite the fact that this was veday by early afternoon the rain was tapering off and we were left with clouds and light showers i closed the shop at lunchtime and gloria came down from the farm that afternoon leaving mother and matthew together the two of us bicycled into harkside and went to see a matinee of phantom of the opera at the lyric all over harkside we heard excited talk of parties and dances people on the streets were hanging streamers and putting out flags all the church bells were ringing we bumped into some people we knew on the village green and they suggested we come back that evening to the celebration dance at the mechanics institute to be followed by a street party the americans from rowan woods would be there they assured us we said we would try to come as soon as we had done some celebrating in hobbs end first after tea the sun lanced through the raggedy black clouds sending shafts of light into rowan woods soon all the clouds had gone and it was as beautiful a warm may evening as you could ever ask for the grass green and moist from the rain gloria gave me a pair of stockings she had got from px and helped me with my makeup first we spent an hour or so at the hobbs end street party people had brought little tables and put them together in a row all along high street it was a dull affair though as there were so few people left in the village and the whole thing felt more like a wake than a celebration mother sat at one of the tables with her friend joyce maddingley and she told us to behave ourselves when we slipped away to harkside with cynthia garmen matthew refused to come out of the cottage at all he wouldnt budge mother said not to worry she would look in on him from time to time and make sure he was comfortable the three of us set off taking the long way around on the roads so we wouldnt get our ankles and court shoes wet in the grass harkside was much wilder than hobbs end most of the soldiers and airmen from the nearby bases had come so there were men in uniform all over the place from the minute we got to the village green we were swept into a mad whirl it didnt take gloria long to meet up with brad billy joe was there with his new girlfriend and px was tagging along too i felt a sudden pang of missing charlie then i tried to enter into the spirit of victory first we went to the dance there was a big band playing glenn miller duke ellington and benny goodman tunes and people kept throwing colored streamers across the dance floor out in the streets between songs we could hear fireworks and people whooping with joy at one point when i was dancing a waltz with billy joe and trying to explain how matthew took up so much of our time i noticed gloria and brad slip outside it was over an hour before i saw them again and gloria had retouched her makeup she couldnt hide the ladder in one of her stockings though i resolved to say nothing since our talk a few days ago i had thought a lot about gloria and what she was sacrificing to care for matthew and i decided that she deserved her little pleasures as long as she remained discreet about them the band was still playing when we piled out into the street there was a huge bonfire on the village green and people were singing dancing and setting off fireworks all around it just like guy fawkes night the air was full of the acrid smell of smoke and the sky full of exploding colors someone had made up an effigy of hitler and they were heaving it on top of the fire everyone was drunk i dont know where cynthia got to i was with a group of people and i could see gloria and brad through the flames having an argument at least they looked as if they were shouting at one another but i couldnt hear for all the singing and explosions at one point we went to someones house and drank some whiskey it was a wild party people were packed in like sardines and i felt hands all over my body as i pushed my way through the crowd to go to the toilet the house was full of smoke and it stung my eyes gloria was dancing but i couldnt see brad someone fell down the stairs at one point im sure i saw a negro dancing on the piano px was drunk eyes closed almost to slits and i saw him try to kiss a woman she pushed him away and his face turned red then he stormed off cynthia reappeared with a sailor in tow i dont know where shed managed to find him as we were at least fifty miles from the coast it was almost one oclock and we were back out on the street again when i told cynthia and gloria it was time for us to go the three of us were a little drunk it was the emotion and excitement as much as the alcohol i think we didnt even bother trying to cadge a lift but danced and laughed our way home instead hobbs end was quiet as a tomb bridge cottage was dark i went in with gloria to make sure everything was all right and we heard matthew snoring on the chesterfield as soon as we opened the door gloria put her finger to her lips and gestured me toward the kitchen with the door shut she poured us both another whiskey which was probably the last thing we needed when she put her handbag down on the countertop it slipped off and fell on the floor i bent over to pick it up for her and noticed how heavy it was curious i opened the clasp and nearly fainted when i saw a gun gloria turned with the bottle and glasses in time to see me you werent supposed to see that she said but gloria where did you get it from one of the americans at the party he was so drunk he wont miss it not brad no not brad nobody we know but whoever he was hell get into serious trouble i dont think so anyway i dont care it serves him right for being so careless doesnt it he was trying to put his hand up my skirt at the time what do you want a gun for she shrugged war souvenir gloria all right she was whispering as loudly as she could so as not to wake matthew maybe i just feel a bit more comfortable knowing its there thats all but matthews harmless he wouldnt hurt you she looked at me as if i were the biggest fool she had ever met who said anything about matthew she said not even bothering to whisper then she took the gun from me and put it in one of the kitchen cupboards behind the meager supplies of tea and cocoa now will you have that drink vivian elmsley was having a difficult time close to midnight she was sitting in her sparse living room her third gin and tonic in her hand and some dreadful rubbish on television sleep refused to come her mysterious caller hadnt rung again but she still regarded the telephone as an object of terror ever on the verge of destroying what little peace of mind she had left she wondered if she should have told the police about him but what could they do it was all so vague she had known the police would find out who she was and come for her eventually she had known that the minute she knew glorias body had been dug up but she hadnt been prepared for the effect that their visit would have on her they knew she was lying that was obvious chief inspector banks wasnt a fool he knew that nobody who had been as close to the people involved as vivian had could know so little as she had professed and she wasnt a good liar why hadnt she told them the truth fear for her own wellbeing partly she didnt want to go to jail not at her age but would they really prosecute her after so long no matter what the law books said when they heard her full story would they really go ahead and put her through the pain and humiliation of a trial and a jail sentence were there not such things as mitigating circumstances she didnt know what they would do and that was the problem when it comes right down to it we fear the unknown more than anything else on the other hand if she didnt tell them then they would never find out the truth about what happened that night nobody else knew living or dead if she was careful vivian could take her secret to the grave with her only one thing was certain the police would be back she had seen it in the chief inspectors eyes tonight she had to make her decision youre right about one thing annie began im in harkside because i was a naughty girl what happened depends on your point of view they called it an initiation rite i called it attempted gang rape look im not going to tell you where it was or who was involved all im saying is it happened in a big city and it wasnt in yorkshire okay okay go on this is hard annie spooned down some more chocolate mousse harder than i ever thought you dont have to she held up her hand no ive come this far the waiter drifted by and they both ordered coffee he didnt give any indication that he had heard but the coffee arrived in a matter of moments annie pushed aside her dessert bowl it was empty she played with the spoon it was when i made ds she said nearly two years ago now id done my stint in uniform there and i wasnt sure where they were going to send me next but i didnt care i was happy just to be back in cid again after well you know what i mean patrols shifts exactly anyway there was a celebration at the local coppers pub the private room upstairs i suppose i was dead chuffed with myself id always wanted to be one of the boys naturally we closed the place it got down to just four of us left one of them suggested we go back to his place and drink some more and we all agreed that was a good idea she was speaking very quietly so that no one would hear there wasnt much chance of that the restaurant was packed now full of laughter and loud voices banks had to strain to hear her and somehow that made what he heard so much more affecting that it was delivered in not much more than a whisper he sipped some black coffee through the occasional hush in the background noise he could hear the lush romantic strains of liszts liebestraum we were already three sheets to the wind annie went on and i was the only female i didnt know the others well things were getting pretty wild i suppose i should have known what was coming by the way the conversation was going in the taxi you know flirting sexual innuendos casual touches that sort of thing call me naive the other three kept making veiled references to initiation ceremonies and there was a lot of nudging and winking going on but id been drinking too and i didnt really think much of it until wed been at the flat for a while and drunk some more one of them grabbed my arm and suggested we go in the bedroom said he could tell id been wanting it all night i laughed and brushed him off i thought he was joking he got angry things got out of hand the other two grabbed me and held me down over the back of the settee while he pulled up my skirt tore off my underwear and raped me banks noticed that annie was gripping the spoon handle tightly in her fist her knuckles were white she took a deep breath and went on when hed finished they started rearranging positions and i knew what was coming it was like there were no individuals in the room anymore they were all caught up in this blind male lust and i was the object of it it overwhelmed everything conscience decency its hard to describe i was terrified but id sobered up pretty damn quickly over the last few minutes soon as i got my chance i slipped free from their grip kicked the one whod raped me hard as i could in the balls and caught another on the jaw with my elbow id done some martialarts training i dont know maybe if i hadnt been drinking my reflexes wouldve been quicker my coordination a bit more accurate anyway i managed to put two of them out of action long enough to make it to the door the third one caught me and by then the one id hit with my elbow was up again they were sweating red in the face and mad as hell one of them punched me in the stomach and the other hit me hard in the chest i went down i think i was sick i thought that was it again that they were going to do what theyd intended but theyd lost their bottle it had all got too real for them suddenly they were individuals again each looking out for number one and they knew what theyd done it was time to close ranks they called me a lesbian bitch told me to get out and if i knew what was good for me i wouldnt say a word i left did you report it for crying out loud annie youd been raped she laughed harshly isnt that so easy for a man to say to sit in judgment over what a person in that position should or shouldnt do to be oh so understanding about it she shook her head you know what i did i walked the city most of the night in a complete daze people must have thought i was crazy i wasnt drunk anymore i was plain cold sober but i was drained numb i couldnt feel anything i remember trying to feel some sort of emotion thinking i ought to feel anger or pain i was really angry at myself for not feeling angry i know it sounds impossible but thats the only way i can describe it there was nothing just a deep cold numbness when i finally found myself back at my flat i had a long hot bath hours i must have lain there just listening to the radio news weather normal life that was soothing somehow and do you know what i understand every one of those rape victims who never comes forward to report the crime banks could see tears glistening at the corners of her eyes but as she noticed him looking she seemed to draw them back in what happened he asked by morning id got a bit of nerve back first thing i went to see the chief super to tell him what they did know what what two of the others had got there before me and queered the pitch preemptive strike they told the super thered been a spot of bother at a party last night just an initiation rite that got a bit out of hand nothing serious like but that id probably be coming to complain making up all sorts of wild allegations according to them id got totally ratarsed and gone way over the top telling them id take them all on and then backing down when it came to it and he believed them their word against mine besides they were all mates people around the station already thought i was a bit weird some of them even used to call me the hippie cop behind my back or so they thought you know i did yoga and meditation and i didnt eat meat and watch sport on the telly and talk about sex all the time thats enough to make you seem weird for a start i also had a reputation around the place for not being very interested in men just because i didnt find any of the blokes i worked with particularly attractive im sure they all thought i was gay that hits a certain kind of male the wrong way he thinks all a lesbian needs is a big hard cock in her and shell soon come to her senses and of course hes just the bloke to give it to her as it happened i did have a boyfriend at the time nothing serious but i kept my private life separate from the job did you tell the chief super what really happened yes every detail what was his reaction he looked very embarrassed didnt he initiate some sort of inquiry like i said their word against mine and apart from a pair of torn knickers id pretty much destroyed the evidence hadnt i even so these days what about these days annie there are procedures to guard against these things procedures hah tell that to the chief super he also told me by the way that no one wants that sort of internal investigation going on it hurts everyone and it especially hurts the force he said the officers involved would be disciplined for their excessive high spirits but it would be best for all concerned if it went no further than his office he told me to put the good of the force as a whole above my own selfish concerns you agreed to that what choice had i he should have been kicked off the force im glad you agree so all that happened was they got a slap on the wrist and you got shipped off to the middle of nowhere not quite not immediately annie looked down into her coffee cup there were complications what complications she wrapped a strand of hair around her forefinger and stared down into her cup for a few more seconds before looking up at banks remember i told you i kicked one of them in the balls yes what about it something went wrong they had to operate he lost them both of them the devil of it was that he was the youngest of the three and the most junior in rank just a ds himself and only married a year planning a family jesus i can imagine you were a popular woman around the station after that exactly for a while i thought of leaving the force altogether but im stubborn the chief super suggested it might be better for all concerned if i transferred somewhere else he said hed look into some possibilities and they came up with harkside millicent cummings was immediately sympathetic of course and i think our acc used to work with chief constable riddle so riddle knows all about what happened he knew my chief supers side of the story yes which means that to him youre a troublemaker a ballbusting lesbian bitch annie mustered a crooked smile well ive been called worse but thanks for the compliment no wonder he put us together never was much of a judge of character though wasnt jimmy riddle im surprised he got as far as he did im sorry about what happened to you annie sorrier than i can say all water under the bridge im also amazed you would even consider getting involved with me a dci i would have thought that what happened would have been enough to put you off your fellow coppers for life especially senior cid ranks oh come on alan you do yourself a disservice do you really think im that stupid thats insulting to both of us ive never not for one moment seen any similarity whatsoever between you and the men who assaulted me i didnt even know you were a dci when i first saw you and i fancied you right away the thing is i thought id faced up to it and got on with my life havent you you seem to be doing all right to me ive been in hiding i shut myself away i thought i was over it and that id simply chosen a quieter life the celibate life of reflection and contemplation theres a laugh i thought that was my choice but it was really a result of what happened of not facing up but id already practiced meditation and yoga had done for years and i came from a small seaside town so it seemed only natural to dig in my heels at harkside you arent happy there whats happiness something you measure in relation to unhappiness i get by i have my nice safe little life at the center of the labyrinth as you so astutely pointed out i have few possessions i go to work i do my job and then i come home no social life no friends i certainly didnt dwell on what had happened to me i didnt have recurring nightmares about it i suppose i was lucky that way and i felt no guilt about what happened to that young ds that might sound harsh but ive probed myself deeply enough to know its the case he was egged on by his superiors true caught up in the spirit of drunken revelry i suppose some people might excuse him by saying he was too weak to resist or he simply lost his rag temporary insanity but i was the one he raped and i was the one who saw his face while he was doing it he deserved all he got the only real shame is that i didnt get the chance to do it to the other two as well she paused but lets face it i havent even done any serious detective work in harkside i know im good at the job im quick im bright and im hardworking but until this case came along its all been breakins vandalism the occasional runaway kid and now she shrugged now i dont know youre the first person ive told since it happened you didnt tell your father ray no hed be sympathetic but he wouldnt understand he didnt want me to join the police to start with a hippie artist i shouldnt think he did hed probably have led a protest march to new scotland yard she paused and played with her hair again now its your turn remember you promised to tell me something too did i uhhuh what do you want to know did you really punch jimmy riddle banks stubbed out his cigarette and slipped his credit card on the little tray the waiter had left it was snatched up almost immediately the theaters had come out now and people were queuing at the restaurant door yes he said i did she laughed bloody hell i wish id been there the waiter finished with the card in no time flat banks signed the receipt annie gathered her packages and they walked out into the busy west end evening the streets were packed with people standing drinking outside the pubs four men blocked the pavement all talking and laughing at once into a mobile phone banks and annie skirted them across the street banks saw a drunken woman in a tartan schoolgirl mini black thigh stockings and fuckme shoes try to carry on an argument with her boyfriend and walk at the same time she failed teetered at the edge of the pavement and went sprawling in the gutter cursing all the way sirens blared in the distant city night dont laugh at this said annie but that time you know in the backyard when you put your arm around me yes well i was sort of expecting something might happen and i didnt know if i was ready for it yet i was going to tell you i was a lesbian just to let you down lightly to make you think it wasnt anything personal you know that it wasnt that i didnt fancy you or anything but that i just didnt go for men id got it all worked out why didnt you when the time came i didnt want to believe me i was probably just as surprised as you were about what happened just as scared i know i invited you to my house and fed you drinks but i really wasnt planning to seduce you i didnt think you were i was going to offer you the couch and i would have accepted gracefully but when it came to it i wanted you i was terrified it was the first time since the night ive just told you about but i wanted to do it as well i suppose i wanted to overcome my fear sometimes its the only way they walked along charing cross road past all the closed bookshops and crossed oxford street as they turned onto great russell street annie slipped her arm through bankss it was only the second time they had had any little intimate physical contact in public and it felt good the warmth the gentle pressure annie leaned her head a little so it rested on his shoulder her hair tickled his cheek neither of them had been to the hotel yet banks had simply phoned earlier to book a room and said they would be arriving late it was only a small place he had stayed there twice before while on police business in london both times alone and had been impressed by the general cleanliness and level of service not to mention the reasonable rates they passed the dark mass of the british museum set back behind its railings and courtyard then crossed russell square conversation and laughter carried on the night air from a pub around the corner a couple walked by arms wrapped around one another here we are said banks did you buy a toothbrush yup annie held up one of her bags and a new pair of jeans new shoes a skirt and blouse undies you really did go shopping didnt you hey its not often i get to the big city i bought a nightie too i thought i said you wouldnt need one she laughed and moved closer oh dont worry its only a little nightie i promise youll like it and they walked up the stone steps to the hotel i couldnt stop thinking about the gun usually the way the scene ran in my mind was that gloria shot matthew first and then herself the images were so vivid i could even see the blood gush from their wounds finally i determined i had to do something as i said i had a key to bridge cottage it wasnt that matthew locked himself in but he sometimes wouldnt bother getting up to answer the door most of the time he was in a sort of comatose state from alcohol anyway when he wasnt at the pub he was sipping whiskey at home whiskey that gloria got from px so the next time it was glorias turn to take matthew to see dr jennings in leeds i let myself in even if someone saw me it wouldnt seem at all strange because i was in and out of bridge cottage all the time and everyone in the village knew about matthews condition i found the gun in the same place gloria had left it behind the cocoa and tea in the kitchen cupboard i put it in the shopping bag i had brought with me put the cupboard back in order and left i didnt know how long it would take her to miss it but the best i could hope for was that by the time she did she wouldnt feel the need for it anymore and would realize what a favor i had done her we can be such fools for love cant we sixteen it was about eleven oclock on saturday morning when banks and annie arrived back at vivian elmsleys building before banks could even press the buzzer the door opened and vivian almost bumped into them going somewhere ms elmsley asked banks you she put her hand to her heart i didnt think so soon i was just youd better come in they followed her upstairs to the flat she was carrying a large buff envelope which she dropped on the hall table as she entered the room banks glanced at it saw his name and the eastvale station address on it she turned to face them as they entered her living room i suppose i should thank you for coming back she said youve saved me the postage what were you sending me banks asked a confession of sorts yes i suppose you could call it that so you were lying yesterday fictions my trade sometimes i cant help it you should know the difference between what fiction and reality ive learned to leave that to the most arrogant among us theyre the only ones who seem to think they know everything she turned walked back to the hall and picked up the envelope anyway she went on handing it to banks im sorry for being flippant ive found this whole thing extremely difficult i tend to hide behind language when im frightened id like you to grant me the favor of taking this away with you and reading it i had a copy made this morning if youre worried about my fleeing from justice please dont im not going to run anywhere i promise you why the change of heart conscience would you believe i thought i could live with it but i cant the telephone calls didnt help either in the early hours of the morning i arrived at the end of a long struggle and i decided to tell the truth what you do with it once you know is up to you id just rather do things this way than answer a lot of questions at the moment i think it will help you understand of course youll have questions eventually i have to be in leeds next week to do some booksignings so youll soon have the opportunity will you allow me this much at least it was an unusual request and if banks were to go by the book he wouldnt let a murder suspect hand him a written confession then go away and leave her to her own devices but it was time for a judgment call this had been an unusual case right from the start and he believed that vivian elmsley wasnt going anywhere she was in the public eye and he didnt think she had anywhere to run even if she wanted to the other possibility was suicide it was a risk to be certain but he decided to take it if vivian elmsley wanted to kill herself rather than suffer through a criminal trial that cost the taxpayers thousands and drew the media like blood draws leeches who was banks to judge her if jimmy riddle found out about it of course bankss career wouldnt be worth a toss but since when had he let thoughts of jimmy riddle get in his way you mentioned telephone calls he said what do you mean anonymous calls sometimes he says things others he just hangs up what kind of things does he say nothing really he just sounds vaguely threatening and he calls me gwen shackleton have you any idea who it might be no it wouldnt be too difficult for anyone to find out my real name and my numbers in the directory but why what about the accent is it american no but its hard to say exactly what it is the voice sounds muffled as if hes speaking through a handkerchief or something banks thought for a moment we cant really do anything about it i wouldnt worry too much though in most cases people who make threatening phone calls dont confront their victims thats why they use the phone in the first place theyre afraid of personal contact vivian shook her head i dont know he didnt sound like one of those heavy breathers or nutcases it seemed more personal perhaps your line of work attracts one or two crackpot fans banks suggested someone who thinks hes giving you an idea for a story or helping you know what its like to experience fear i honestly wouldnt worry too much but you should get in touch with your local police station as soon as possible theyll be able to help do you have any contacts there yes theres detective superintendent davidson he helps me with my research even better talk to him banks held up the envelope well do as you ask he said but how do we know this is the truth and not just more fiction you dont actually its a bit of both but the parts youll be interested in are true youll just have to take my word for it wont you the day it happened began like any ordinary day if any day could be deemed ordinary in those extraordinary times i opened the shop took in the ration coupons apologized for shortages made lunch and tea for mother and settled down to an evenings reading and the wireless the americans were having a farewell party up at the base that night as they had heard they would be moving out in a matter of days we had been invited but neither gloria nor i had felt like going somehow that part of our lives seemed over charlie was dead and gloria had made it clear to brad after their last fling on veday that she was sticking with matthew and it would be best if they didnt see each other anymore id like to say i felt some sort of premonition of disaster some sense of foreboding but i didnt i was distracted and found it hard to concentrate on trollopes the last chronicle of barset but i had a lot on my mind charlies death matthews illness glorias problems mother i wouldnt normally have gone to bridge cottage so late in the evening except that cynthia garmen had dropped off some parachute silk on her way to harkside i hadnt seen gloria for two or three days and i thought she might appreciate a small gift she had been very drawn and depressed since veday and hadnt been taking care of herself at all i cant say that i heard any small voice telling me to go nor can i recollect any great feeling of apprehension any involuntary shudder or burning of the ears i couldnt concentrate on my book and gloria was on my mind it was as simple as that this is where my diary stops but however much i have tried over the years to expunge the events from my memory i havent been able to succeed it was just after ten oclock and mother had gone to bed distracted i put my book aside and fingered the silky material i thought the prospect of a new dress to make might cheer gloria up i was also feeling guilty over stealing the gun i suppose and i wanted to know whether she had noticed it missing yet if she had she certainly hadnt said anything i assumed matthew would still be at the shoulder of mutton so i thought i would call in there first and persuade him to walk home with me even though he didnt communicate i believed that he knew who i was and knew that i loved him i also think he felt comfortable being with me as it turned out he had been asked to leave a little earlier because he had had one of his little tantrums and broken a glass i walked down the dark deserted high street to bridge cottage over the river i could hear music and laughter from the duke of wellington where it seemed the veday celebrations were still going on over a week after the day itself moonlight silvered the flowing water and made it look like some sort of sleek slinking animal there was light showing between the curtains in bridge cottage new curtains i noticed now we didnt have to worry about the blackout or even the dimout anymore i knocked at the door but no one answered i knocked again i didnt think gloria would be out she rarely went out in the evenings except to the pictures with me she certainly wouldnt go out and leave the lights on besides matthew should be there where else would he have gone after being ejected from the shoulder of mutton i knocked again still nothing i put my key in the lock turned it and entered calling out glorias name there was no one in the living room but i noticed a strong smell of whiskey i called out glorias name again then thought i heard a movement in the kitchen puzzled i walked over and when i got to the doorway i saw her gloria lay on the flagstone floor legs and arms splayed at awkward angles like a rag doll a sulking child has tossed aside one of her little fists was curled tight as if she were about to hit someone except for the little finger which stuck out there wasnt a lot of blood i remember being surprised at how little blood there was she was wearing her royalblue dress with the white lace collar and the stains on the material looked like rust they were all over the place breast stomach ribs loins everywhere the royal blue dress was stained with blood yet very little of it had flowed to the floor not far from her body lay a broken whiskey bottle the source of the smell i had noticed earlier bourbon an unopened carton of lucky strikes sat on the countertop above it the cupboard was open and tea and cocoa had spilled all over the counter and the floor nearby along with knives and forks from the cutlery drawer beside her holding a bloody kitchen knife matthew knelt in a small pool of blood i went over to him took the knife gently out of his hand and led him through to his armchair he accompanied me as meekly as a weary defeated soldier goes with his captors and flopped back in the chair like a man who hasnt slept for months matthew what happened i asked him what have you done youve got to tell me why did you do it i gave him pencil and paper but he just drew in on himself and i could tell i would get nothing out of him i put my hands on his shoulders and shook him lightly but he seemed to shrink away bloodstained thumb in his mouth i noticed more blood on the cuffs of his white shirt i dont know how long i tried to get him to communicate something but in the end i gave up and went back to the kitchen i wasnt thinking clearly i suppose if i assumed anything at all it was that someone must have told him there was nasty gossip going around about what his wife got up to while he was out i already knew that he had had a tantrum in the shoulder of mutton and i guessed that one way or the other it had set off the explosion that had been building in him the way pressure builds in a boiler now gloria was dead and matthew was empty of his rage as i stared down at poor glorias body still half unable to believe what had happened i knew i had to do something if anyone found out about this matthew might be hanged or more likely found insane and put in the lunatic asylum for the rest of his days however difficult his life was right now i knew he wouldnt be able to bear that it would be purgatory for him or worse i would have to care for him from now on as for gloria my heart wept for her i had come to love her almost as much as i loved matthew but she was dead there was nothing i could do for her she had no other family i was the only one who knew her story it didnt matter now what happened to her or so i told myself i still had some vestiges of religion in me back then though most of it had disappeared during the war especially after matthews death and resurrection which seemed to me a very cruel parody of easter but i didnt particularly give any thoughts to glorias immortal soul a proper burial or things like that the church didnt come into it i didnt think of what i was doing in terms of right or wrong nor did i really consider that i would be breaking the law all i could think about was what to do to protect matthew from all the prying policemen and doctors who would torment him if word of this got out did i think of matthew as a murderer i dont think i did though there was undoubted evidence of this at my feet in a strange way i also saw gloria as my partner in wanting to protect matthew from further cruelty and suffering she wouldnt want him to go to jail i told myself she wouldnt want him put away in a lunatic asylum she had sacrificed so much to protect him his comfort and ease were all she had lived for after his return he was her penance after all and that was why she would never leave him that was why she was dead gloria wanted me to do this i offer no more excuses the blackout cloth was still rolled up below the windows in the living room where it had been left after i helped gloria take it down a couple of months ago i carried it into the kitchen and gently rolled gloria onto it then i wrapped it around her tightly as a shroud before i had finished i bent over kissed her gently on the forehead and said goodbye sweet gloria goodbye my love she was still warm where could i hide her the only place i could think of was the old outbuilding they never used in the light of a small oil lamp i started to dig the hole i wanted to make it deeper but i couldnt manage more than about three or four feet before exhaustion overcame me i went back to the house where matthew hadnt moved and managed to find the energy to drag out the roll of blackout cloth and drop it in the hole there was no one around the cottage next door was empty and there was neither a light nor a sound out back only the black night sky with its uncaring stars with tears running down my cheeks i shoveled back the earth some heavy stone slabs stood propped against the wall and i levered them down on top of the makeshift grave it was the best i could do that left only the inside of the house first i swept up the broken glass the spilled tea leaves and cocoa powder and put the tins back in the cupboard as i said there was very little blood and i managed to scrub that off the floor easily enough there might have been minute traces left but nobody would be able to tell what they were if things went according to plan nobody would even look i say plan now but it was just something i had come up with while burying gloria i had to explain where she had gone after i had managed to lead matthew upstairs and wash and undress him i put him to bed i packed his bloody shirt and trousers in a small suitcase and added as many of glorias favorite clothes as i could fit in then i went and picked up her personal odds and ends and put them in the suitcase too after checking the kitchen carefully to make sure that i had collected everything of importance and cleaned up to the best of my ability i wrote a note on the same paper i had got out for matthew earlier glorias childlike handwriting and style were easy to imitate after that carrying the suitcase i took the back way to the shop i didnt want to leave matthew god knows but what else could i do things had to appear more or less normal he didnt seem aware of what was happening and i had no idea how he would face the next day whether he would remember what he had done feel remorse or guilt would he even notice she was gone early the next day i went to bridge cottage found matthew still in bed found the note and proceeded to tell everyone we knew including mother that gloria had run away during the night because she couldnt bear her life with matthew anymore she said she loved him and she always would but she couldnt be responsible for her actions if she stayed then i showed them the note which said exactly that she ended by saying that we shouldnt go looking for her because we would never be able to find her there was no reason to call in the police everyone believed the note without question hadnt gloria already told me she had heard people predicting that she would run off with a yank at the first opportunity of course she hadnt gone off with a yank and brad for one would know that but i would cross that bridge when i came to it i gave up bridge cottage sold the contents including the radiogram and the records gloria loved so much and brought matthew back to live with us above the shop one evening when mother was at joyce maddingleys i took matthews bloodstained clothes and glorias dresses and burned them in the grate i cried as i watched all those beautiful dresses catch fire the blackredandwhitechecked dorville dress she had bought in london the black velvet vneck dress with the puff sleeves wide padded shoulders and red felt rose that she had worn to our first dance with the americans at rowan woods her fine underwear i watched it all flare and twist then collapse into ashes i disposed of her trinkets in leeds the next time i went there on shop business i just stood on leeds bridge at the bottom of briggate and dropped them one by one into the river aire as i had expected it was brad who gave me the most trouble on his last day at rowan woods he came to the shop and pestered me with questions he just couldnt believe that gloria had simply left if she wanted to go he argued then why didnt she go with him he had asked her often enough i told him i thought she wanted to escape from everyone she needed a completely new start he said she could have had that in california again i argued that living with him in los angeles would always have felt tainted to her because of the circumstances in which it came about no matter what she would still have been matthews wife it hurt him deeply which i hated to do but he had to accept what i said in the end after all she had told him she didnt want to see him anymore after veday absolutely no one suspected anything like the truth the th bomber group moved out of rowan woods and i heard nothing more from brad it was all over michael stanhope expressed sorrow that such a beautiful spirit had left the community he said something about hobbs end having glimmered briefly then turned dark again he was free to sell the nude now not that i ever saw or heard anything of it again perhaps it wasnt as good as he thought it was as for matthew he never really showed any sign that anything was different he was a little more withdrawn perhaps but he went on with the same drinking and staring into space as before i had to stop the visits to dr jennings of course who knew what narcosynthesis might draw out of matthew should it work though the doctor protested i think he was quite relieved doctors dont like failures and dr jennings had been getting nowhere with matthew soon we were hearing rumors that the village was to be sold as a reservoir site and when i looked around it didnt surprise me hobbs end had turned into a ghost village i hadnt noticed it happening because of other matters but hardly anyone lived there anymore those who had come back from the war had a taste of more interesting locales or had been trained for jobs they could only get in the cities even the women who had perhaps gained the most in terms of employment were heading off for factory jobs in leeds and bradford the mill closed buildings fell into disrepair old people died finally there was nobody left a strange incident occurred before we left for leeds though gloria had in a way predicted it one day a man in a brown demob suit came into the shop with a little boy of about eight or nine and asked to see gloria i knew immediately who they were though i didnt want to admit it to them are you a relative i asked him no he said nothing like that just an old friend thats all i was passing this way so i thought id look her up he sounded rather sad and i noticed he had a cockney accent just as gloria did when she let her guard slip and of course nobody just passes hobbs end way i asked him more questions to show interest and politeness but i could get nothing more out of him most of all i wanted him to be satisfied by my explanation of glorias disappearance i certainly didnt want him to come back and pester matthew and me i neednt have worried when he left he just said if you do see her again tell her george called will you he looked down at the boy tell her george and little frankie dropped by and send their love i assured him i would the little boy had said nothing at all but i felt him staring at me the whole time as if he were etching my features onto the tissue of his memory on impulse i gave him a quarter ounce of gumdrops quite a rarity as sweets were still rationed he thanked me solemnly and then they left the following week matthew mother and i moved to leeds and hobbs end ceased to exist our life in leeds was not without incident but thats another story if we go to the cps with vivian elmsleys story banks said to annie theyll laugh us out of the office it was sunday morning and they were both lounging about bankss cottage rereading vivian elmsleys manuscript and drinking coffee it had been against annies better judgment to take up bankss suggestion of spending the weekend together what she had meant to do after getting in her car at york was drive straight home and spend the rest of the weekend in blissful idle solitude but next friday she was taking two weeks holiday and was planning to go down to stay with her father at the colony best enjoy some time together now she thought she would have plenty of time for long lonely coast walks when she got to st ives so on sunday morning she was lying back in bankss front room barefoot wearing shorts her feet dangling over the arm of the settee reading about gwen shackletons war why would they laugh she said its a confession of sorts isnt it she does admit to interfering with the body that makes her an accessory i very much doubt that any judge would admit the manuscript as evidence all she has to do is say its fiction the crown knows that its a load of bollocks annie just as well the woman writes fiction and doesnt have to solve real crimes but she uses real names doesnt matter any decent lawyer would make mincemeat of it as a confession to aiding and abetting look at what weve got weve got a woman in her seventies who presented us with a manuscript she wrote nearly thirty years ago hinting that she covered up a murder she thinks her brother committed over twenty years before that in a village that no longer exists add to that she makes her living writing detective fiction he ran his hand across his head believe me the cps have enough of a backlog already they cant even keep up with todays crimes let alone put staff on prosecuting yesterdays on evidence so flimsy a puff of wind would blow it away so thats it we go no further she goes scotfree do you want to see her in prison not particularly im just playing devils advocate to be honest it looks as if the poor womans suffered enough to me what a blighted life i dont know shes had a fair amount of success sometimes that doesnt mean as much as those who dont have it seem to think it does well banks went on we always knew the case might end nowhere matthew shackleton is dead i think vivian elmsley wanted to get what she did off her chest she wanted us to know not for our sake so we could solve the mystery but for hers so she wouldnt have to bear the burden alone anymore the discovery of gloria shackletons skeleton was a tremendous catalyst for her it pushed her toward some sort of catharsis and when we found out who she was it was just a matter of time i would imagine now it seems less important to her to protect matthews memory than it did all those years ago hes in no position to hang or spend his days in a psychiatric institution she still committed a crime though yes but shes not the killer unless shes lying in the story i dont think so she did what she did to protect her brother who had already suffered terribly in the war and she kept the secret to protect herself and matthews name if shed called the police at the time its almost certain he would have been convicted of glorias murder unless unless what unless he didnt do it there are a number of things in gwens version that bother me look at the scenario gwen walks into the cottage and sees matthew bent over glorias body a kitchen knife in his hand so far so good annie nodded she also notices that glorias fist is clenched and the little finger appears to be broken right right and glorias body is still warm yes which means that the clenched fist wasnt caused by rigor mortis it was caused by a cadaveric spasm what if the killer the real killer had been trying to take something out of glorias hand when he was disturbed by matthew coming home chucked out of the pub early for causing a ruckus something that might have incriminated him the button it makes sense doesnt it its certainly possible banks shook his head but theyd still probably have arrested matthew depending on the copper in charge remember most of the bright young detectives were at war the crazy husband would have looked the most obvious suspect and the button even if they had found it could have been explained away from vivians point of view if matthew had even a scrap of sanity left before all hell broke loose he wouldnt have had any by the time it was over so she committed a crime and a serious one at that but not only would the cps throw it out if it ever got as far as a jury they would chuck it out too think of the sympathy angle any decent barrister and ill bet you vivian elmsley can afford a morethandecent barrister would have the whole courtroom in tears so what do we do next we could hand the report to jimmy riddle and get on with our lives or or look into those one or two little inconsistencies i mentioned for a start im not convinced that the doorbell rang banks went to answer it curious annie let the manuscript drop on her lap maybe its that hardworking ds hatchley of yours on a sunday morning thatd be stretching credibility too far banks opened the door annie heard a womans voice then banks stepped back slowly and in she walked blond hair black eyebrows attractive good figure nicely dressed in a pastel skirt and a white blouse she noticed annie out of the corner of her eye and turned for a moment she seemed speechless a slight flush suffusing her pale complexion then she moved forward and said hello i dont think weve been introduced feeling foolish annie took the manuscript off her stomach and stood up annie cabbot she said ds cabbot she felt acutely aware of her bare legs and feet sandra banks said the other pleased to meet you banks closed the door and stood behind them looking uncomfortable ds cabbot and i were just discussing the thornfield reservoir case he said maybe youve read about it sandra looked down at annies bare feet then gave banks a withering glance yes of course she said and on a sunday morning too such devotion to duty she started moving back toward the door annie felt herself blush to her roots anyway banks gibbered on its really nice to see you would you like some coffee or something sandra shook her head no i dont think so i just came up to eastvale to see to some things at the community center im staying with harriet and david while i was in the area i thought id drop by to get some papers signed and talk to you about our son but itll do some other time no hurry dont let me interrupt your brainstorming session as she spoke she grasped the handle and opened the door nice meeting you ds cabbot she said over her shoulder and with that she was gone annie stood facing banks in silence for a few moments aware only of her fast and loud heartbeat and burning skin i didnt know what to say she said i felt foolish embarrassed why should you said banks ive already told you sandra and i have been separated for almost a year but you still love her annie thought where did that come from she pushed the thought away yes i know it was just a shock meeting her like that banks gave a nervous laugh you can say that again look lets have some more coffee and go sit outside okay put vivian elmsley and her problems on the back burner for a while its a beautiful day shame to waste it staying indoors maybe this afternoon we can go for a long walk fremington edge okay annie followed him outside still feeling dazed she sat on a striped deck chair feeling the warmth of the canvas against the backs of her bare thighs the feeling that always reminded her of summers in st ives banks was reading the sunday times book section trying to pretend everything was just fine but she knew he was rattled too perhaps even more than she was after all he had been married to the woman for more than twenty years annie stared into the distance at a straggling line of ramblers walking up witch fell whose massive shape like a truncated witchs hat took up most of the western skyline crows wheeled over the heights are you okay banks asked looking up from his paper fine she said mustering a smile fine but she wasnt she told herself she should have known how fleeting happiness was how foolish it is to expect it at all and what a mistake it is to allow oneself to get too close to anyone closeness like that stirs up all the old demons the jealousy the insecurity all the things she thought she had mastered the only possible outcome is pain a shadow had blotted out her sun just the way witch fell obscured the sky a snake had crawled into her eden what she wondered would be the cost seventeen vivians manuscript haunted banks long after he had read it there were so many inconsistencies so many branches in the road to glorias murder on wednesday when they still hadnt found glorias son he started thinking about the trip george and francis henderson had made to try to find gloria after the war gwen had denied her in a way and that set banks thinking about his visit to jems parents as vividly as if it were yesterday he remembered the latemay afternoon when he drove his ailing vw beetle to cambridgeshire in search of jems parents he didnt even know why he was making the journey and more than once he thought of turning back what could he say what right had he to intrude on their grief after all he had hardly known jem knew nothing about his life on the other hand they had been friends and now his friend was dead the least he could do was offer his condolences and tell them they had a son they should be proud of no matter how ignominious his death besides he was curious to see what sort of background jem came from it was a fine day and banks drove with his window down through the north london suburbs and into open countryside the wind blowing through his hair which at that time was well over his collar he turned off the main road just south of cambridge a number of images of the drive came back tim buckley on the radio singing dolphins just outside saffron walden a whitewashed pub wall a herd of cows blocking the road as they were moved udders swinging from field to field by a slow farmer unconcerned about the minor traffic jam he was causing the air smelling of warm straw and manure banks stopped in the village newsagents and asked for directions to the hylton house the shopkeeper looked suspicious as if she thought he was out to rob the place but she told him the house mansion rather stood at the end of an unpaved drive about half a mile from the village center it was originally tudor by the look of it but was crusted with so many centuries of additions like barnacles on the bottom of a boat a conservatory here a garage there a dormer window that it seemed on the verge of buckling under its own weight banks sat in his car and stared for a moment hardly able to take in that this was where jem came from he stubbed out his cigarette the area was quiet except for a few birds singing and the sound of someone talking on a radio deep inside the house surely they must have heard him arrive especially with the odd hiccuping sounds his beetle was making those days banks got out of the car and looked around beyond a neatly trimmed croquetsize lawn the land dipped away revealing a patchwork landscape of green and brown fields under a canopy of blue sky as far as the eye could see a few small copses and a church steeple were all that broke the monotony this was the old england the place of order of the laborer at work in the fields and the lord at ease in his manor it was a far cry from peterborough and notting hill banks had visited the countryside before of course but he had never been to a house so opulent had never known anyone who came from such a house the old class insecurities began to surface and if he had been wearing one he would probably have knocked on the door cap in hand he felt selfconscious of his accent even before he opened his mouth a sweetsmelling honeysuckle bush stood beside the old oak door and banks could hear the bees droning around the blossoms he banged the heavy knocker against the wood the sound echoed through the countryside and sent a nearby flock of starlings flapping off into the sky it seemed forever before banks became aware of someone approaching the door a creak of a floorboard perhaps or swish of a skirt when it opened a crack he found himself looking at a darkhaired woman with high cheekbones and sunken brown eyes she seemed old to him back then when he had hardly turned twenty but he realized that she was probably only in her early forties about the same age he was now she raised an eyebrow yes what is it mrs hylton im mrs hylton what can i do for you ive come about jem she frowned who jem sorry jeremy your son a man appeared behind her and she opened the door all the way he had white hair a red face and watery pale blue eyes what is it darling he asked putting his hand on the womans shoulder and frowning at banks who is he what does he want she turned to her husband with a puzzled expression on her face someone come about jeremy banks introduced himself i lived across the hall from jeremy in notting hill he said we were friends i just wanted to come and say im sorry about what happened i dont understand said the man our son died a long time ago its a bit late to be coming round with condolences dont you think jem jeremy hylton i am at the right house arent i oh yes said the woman but the thing is our jeremy died five years ago but but it was only about a month ago i mean i knew him i found him we are speaking about the same person arent we did jeremy have a brother perhaps we had only one son the man said and he died five years ago now if you dont mind i think my wife has been disturbed enough dont you good day he started to close the door banks made one lastditch attempt he stuck his foot in the door and said please you dont understand jem died last month i dont mean to upset you but mr hylton opened the door a fraction and banks slipped his foot out if you dont go away and get off our property immediately im going to call the police he said is that clear and this time he slammed the door shut before banks could move for a few moments banks stared at the weathered oak his mind spinning he saw a curtain move and assumed they were watching ready to phone the police so he got in his beetle turned and drove away at the end of the drive an elderly man wearing a cloth cap waved him down banks stopped and the man leaned down to the open window he had about five days growth on his cheeks and his breath smelled of beer what you been bothering them there for then he asked i wasnt bothering them banks said i just came to offer them my condolences on their sons death the man scratched his cheek and what did they say banks told him all the time glancing in his mirror to see if the hyltons had followed him down the drive well the man said see as far as theyre concerned their jeremy died the day he dropped out of university and went off to london to be one of them drugsmoking hippies he scrutinized banks for a moment as if trying to make up his mind where he fit in the scheme of things i noticed they had the police around a while back and wondered what it were all about jeremys really dead now then yes said banks after another quick glance in the mirror drugs were it looks that way im sorry to hear it ive known him since he were a babe in arms nice young lad he were till he went bad he were going to be a doctor like his dad at cambridge he was you know i dont know what went wrong he pointed with his thumb back at the house they never recovered dont talk to anyone dont have any visitors he shook his head slowly poor little jeremy they never even gave him a funeral service then he wandered away along the road shaking his head and muttering to himself banks was left alone at the intersection of the drive and the road with only the birdsongs and his own gloomy thoughts of estrangement and denial for company he had a pretty good idea of what went wrong for jem having read claras letter but it seemed that nobody wanted to know horns blaring on market street broke into his reminiscences now he had another denial on his mind jems parents had convinced themselves their son had died five years before he really did just because he had disappointed their expectations gwen shackleton told george and francis henderson that gloria had run away when she was well aware that gloria was actually dead and buried out back somehow the two denials seemed like curious mirror images to banks a knock at the door interrupted this train of thought sergeant hatchley walked in coffee break banks looked up and dragged himself back from a long distance what oh yes you all right sir you look a bit pale fine just thinking thats all can be painful thinking thats why i try to avoid it they walked across market street to the golden grill for toasted tea cakes and coffee rain had finally come to the dales and the place was almost empty doris the proprietor claimed they were only the fourth and fifth customers to pass through her door that day does that put us in line for summat special like hatchley asked maybe a free cuppa she slapped his arm and laughed get away with you worth a try said hatchley to banks never ask never get i used to know a bloke years back who claimed he asked every girl he met if shed go to bed with him said he only got slapped in the face nine times out of ten banks laughed then he asked have you heard anything on that nationwide inquiry you put out yet something came in this morning as a matter of fact said hatchley thats what i wanted to talk to you about lass called brenda hamilton bit of a tart by all accounts not a prossie by trade but she wasnt averse to opening her legs for anyone who looked like he had a bob or two to spare anyway she was found dead in a barn mo strangled and stabbed in that order it certainly sounds promising hatchley shook his head dont get your hopes up theres a couple of problems what problems location and time frame it happened near hadleigh suffolk in august i only mentioned it because it was the same mo banks chewed on his tea cake and thought it over any suspects naturally the farmer who owned the barn came in for a close look but he had a watertight alibi id have sent for more details but well its not likely to be connected with our business is it banks shrugged wouldnt do any harm to ask a few more questions maybe not but thats seven years after gloria shackleton was killed its a long gap for the kind of killer were looking at it also happened in another part of the country there could be reasons for that and i doubt thered be any american air force personnel around by then would there i mean the war was long over most of them went off to the pacific after veday and the rest buggered off home as soon as they could youre probably right jim but lets be thorough get onto east anglia and ask them for more details ill ask ds cabbot to contact the usafe people again and see if she can find out anything will do back in his office banks put off phoning annie at harkside smoking a cigarette instead and staring out of the window a warm slow rain fell on the market square darkening the cobbles and the ancient market cross it wasnt bringing much relief the air was still sticky and humid but slowly the clouds were gathering the humidity increasing one day soon it would break and the heavens would open there were only a couple of cars parked in the square and the few people in evidence ambled around under umbrellas looking gloomily at the shops radio three was playing a program of british light music and banks recognized the signature theme of childrens favourites the reason he was avoiding talking to annie was that sunday had gone badly after sandras visit both banks and annie had been on edge conversation awkward and she had eventually left just after lunch forgoing the afternoon walk claiming she had things to see to back in harkside they hadnt spoken to each other since at the time banks had not been sorry to see her go he was more upset than he had let on by sandras visit and it annoyed him that he felt that way after all she had a new boyfriend sean why did she have to turn up just then when everything was going so well what gave her the right to burst in and act so shocked that he was seeing someone knocking everyones feelings out of kilter how would she like it if he just dropped in on her and sean without even phoning first and he had wanted to talk to her especially after his little hearttoheart with brian now god only knew when he would get the chance again he also realized that sandra had been upset by what she saw too the withering coolness and sarcastic tone were her way of reacting to her own discomfort he still had feelings for her you cant just lose your feelings that quickly for someone you loved for so long love lost or rejected may first turn to hate but only over time does it become indifference finally he plucked up the courage and picked up the phone hows it going he asked fine you sound distracted no im not just a bit busy really its fine banks took a deep breath look if its about sunday im sorry i had no idea sandra was going to turn up i also didnt think it would have so much of an effect on you well you dont always know about these things till they happen do you as i said im fine except ive got a lot on my plate right now whats on your mind okay if thats how you want to play it get onto your military contacts again and see if you can find out anything about us air force presence in suffolk in what about it find out if there were any bases left for a start and if there were which was the nearest one to hadleigh if there was one id also like a list of personnel right can you do it today ill try tomorrow at the latest annie what cant we get together and talk about things theres nothing to talk about really look you know im off home on holiday in a couple of days ive got a lot to do before i go maybe when i get back okay in the meantime ill get that information to you as soon as i can goodbye feeling more depressed than ever after that pointless conversation banks glanced at the pile of paper beside the computer on his desk soco search results postmortem forensic odontology none of it contradicted what they had previously estimated nor did any of it tell him anything more what would have happened if gwen had done as she should and reported finding glorias body a good copper might have asked around and not simply tried to pin the murder on matthew and maybe not too late for asking questions now they were all dead except vivian poor gloria she saw matthew as her penance somehow that told banks more about her than anything else and what if vivians ending was the real lie the ultimate irony what if gwen herself had committed the murder vivian elmsley put her book down as the train pulled out of wakefield westgate on thursday it would only be a few more minutes to leeds now and built up the whole way a typical northern industrial landscape of shabby red brick housing estates lowrise office buildings sparkling new shopping centers factory yards full of stacked pallets wrapped in polythene kids fishing in the canal stripped to the waist the only untypical thing was the sticky sunlight that seemed to encase everything like sugar water the publishers rep was supposed to meet vivian at the station and accompany her to the metropole hotel where she would be staying until sunday she had booksignings in bradford york and harrogate as well as in leeds but it made no sense to move everything lock stock and barrel from one hotel to another every day the cities were close enough together the rep would drive her around not that vivian needed any help to find the hotel the metropole wasnt more than a couple of hundred yards from city square and she knew exactly where it was she had stayed there with charlie the time they went to michael stanhopes exhibition in what an evening they had made of it after the show they went to a classical concert and then to the club where they had danced until late that was why she had asked to stay there again this trip for memorys sake she was nervous it wasnt anything to do with this evenings reading at armley library or the radio leeds interview tomorrow afternoon but with meeting chief inspector banks and his female sidekick again she knew they would want to interview her after studying the manuscript there was no doubt she was guilty of something but what could she do she was too old and too tired to run she was also too old to go to jail the only way now was to face up to whatever charges might be brought and hope her lawyer would do a good job no one she supposed could stop the press finding out the details eventually and there was no doubt that they would go to town on the scandal she wasnt sure she could face public humiliation perhaps if they didnt arrest her she would leave the country again the way she had done so many times with ronald why not she could work anywhere and she had enough money to buy a little place somewhere warm bermuda perhaps or the british virgin islands once again vivian cast her mind back to the events of fifty years ago was there something she had missed had she got it all wrong had she been so ready to suspect matthew that she had overlooked the possibility of anyone else being guilty bankss questions about michael stanhope and about px billy joe charlie and brad had shocked and surprised her at first now she was beginning to wonder could one of them have done it not charlie certainly he was dead by then but what about brad he and gloria had been arguing a lot toward the end she had even seen them arguing through the flames at the veday party perhaps the night she died he had gone to put his case forward one last time and when she turned him down he went berserk vivian tried to remember whether brad had been the kind to go berserk or not but all she could conclude was that we all are given the right circumstances then there was px he had certainly lavished a lot of gifts on gloria in that shy way of his perhaps he had hoped for something in return something she hadnt wanted to give and while billy joe seemed to have moved on to other women quite happily vivian remembered his bitterness at being ditched for a pilot the smoldering class resentment that came out as gibes and taunts people said they didnt have a class system in america but billy joe had definitely been workingclass like the farm laborers in yorkshire charlie was from a wellestablished ivy league background and brad had come from new west coast oil money vivian didnt think the americans lacked class distinction so much as they lacked the tradition of inherited aristocratic titles and wealth which was probably why they all went gaga over british royalty the train was nearing leeds city station now wheels squealing as it negotiated the increasingly complicated system of signals and points it had been a much faster and easier journey than the one vivian had made to london and back with gloria she remembered the pinprick of blue light the soldiers snoring her first look at the desolation of war in the pale dawn light she had slept most of the way back to leeds a six or sevenhour journey then and after she got back to hobbs end london had grown more and more distant and magical in her imagination until it might easily have been mars or ancient rome looking back she began to wonder if perhaps it was all just a story as the years race inexorably on and as all the people we know and love die does the past turn into fiction an act of the imagination populated by ghosts scenes and images suspended forever in water glass wearily vivian stood up and reached for her overnight bag there was something else she had steeled herself to do while she was in leeds and she had set aside friday afternoon after the interview for it before that though she would make time to call at the art gallery and see michael stanhopes painting when the phone rang on thursday morning banks snatched the receiver from its cradle so hard he fumbled it and dropped it on the desk before getting a good grip alan whats going on you almost deafened me oh sorry its jenny i know i recognized your voice how are you well dont sound so excited to hear from me im sorry jenny really its just that im expecting an important call your girlfriend the case im working on that one you told me about the war thing its the only one ive got jimmy riddles made sure my cases have been thin on the ground lately well i wont take up much of your time it just struck me that i was rather well emotional on our last meeting i want to apologize for dumping all over you as they say in california what are friends for anyway jenny went on by way of an apology id like to invite you to dinner if you think you can tolerate my cooking that is its bound to be better than mine she laughed a little too quickly and a little too nervously dont count on it i thought we could you know just talk about things over a meal and a bottle of wine a lots happened to both of us this past year when how about tomorrow sevenish sounds fine are you sure it wont cause any problems why should it i dont know i just then her voice brightened thats great ill see you tomorrow about seven then youre on ill pick up some wine after he hung up banks sat back and thought about the invitation dinner with jenny at her place that would be interesting then he thought about annie and that cast a shadow over him she had basically cut him dead on the phone yesterday after such quick and surprising intimacy her coldness came as a shock it was a long time since he had been given the cold shoulder by a girlfriend he had known for only a few days and the whole thing brought back shades of adolescent gloom time to break out the sad songs again cry along with leonard cohen and learn how to get the best out of your suffering but he was anxious to hear from annie about the east anglia connection she had said today at the latest after all he toyed with the idea of phoning her but in the end decided against it whatever their personal problems he knew she was a good enough copper to let him know the minute she got the information hed asked for shortly before eleven she did im sorry for the delay she said what with time differences and faulty fax machines well im sure you know thats all right just tell me what youve discovered banks had already come to one or two conclusions of his own since his last talk with annie and he felt the tingling tremor of excitement that usually came as the pieces started to fall together it was a feeling he hadnt experienced in quite a while first off annie said there definitely was an american air base near hadleigh in what were they doing there well the us armed forces cleared out of england after the war but a lot of them stayed on in europe especially berlin and vienna the war hadnt solved the russian problem anyway the americans came back to operate from british air bases in during the berlin blockade and airlift the first thing they did was deploy longrange b bombers from four air bases in east anglia all this is from my contact in ramstein apparently there were so many bases by that they had to change their organizational structure to deal with them any familiar names just one guess who ran the px edgar konig the very same you dont sound so surprised not really what did you find out about him he left rowan woods in may with the rest of the four hundred fortyeighth and spent some time in europe then he returned to america he was assigned to the base near hadleigh in summer he stayed in the air force all that time seems that way i suppose he had a pretty good job lots of perks tell me why doesnt it surprise you why not one of the other americans the whiskey and the luckies what in vivian elmsleys manuscript she said there was a bottle of whiskey smashed on the floor and an unopened carton of lucky strikes on the kitchen counter its hardly concrete evidence of anything but i dont think a carton of luckies would have stayed unopened for very long in wartime do you brad could have brought them possible but it was px who had easiest access to the stores px who always supplied the goodies the manuscript also mentioned a farewell party at rowan woods that night px must have got drunk and finally plucked up courage hed sneaked out of the base and brought the presents that night one lastditch attempt to buy what he yearned for gloria resisted and matthew only came in afterward the poor sod any idea where px was between and no i can ask mattie to check if its important youre thinking there might have been others possibly do we know anything more about him no mattie said shed try to find out what she can such as when and why he was discharged and if hes still alive but she doesnt hold out a lot of hope its not their official position to give out such information but matties a mystery fan and it seems ive piqued her curiosity shes become quite an ally good see what you can do lets see if we can link him to any other murders how old will he be now if hes still alive according to matties information hed be about seventyfive a possibility then could be ill talk to you later when annie had hung up banks felt restless sometimes waiting was the most difficult part that was when he smoked too much and paced up and down bad habits from his met days he hadnt quite got rid of there were a couple of things he could do in the meantime first he dialed jenny fullers number alan she said dont tell me you want to cancel no no its nothing like that actually i need you to do a little favor for me of course if i can didnt you say at lunch the other day that you trained with the fbi profilers at quantico yes and you said you thought profiling was a load of bollocks forget that for now do you have any contacts there anyone close enough to ask a personal favor jenny paused a moment well there is one fellow yes why do you ask banks filled her in on the new developments then said this edgar konig id like you to ask your friend to check his record if hes the sort of man i think he is the odds are that hell have one ds cabbots working with the military authorities but any information they can supply us with is limited im sure bill will be happy to oblige if he can said jenny just let me get a pencil then you can tell me what you want to know when banks had finished giving jenny the details he asked ds hatchley to call east anglia and find out if a us airman called edgar konig had ever been questioned or suspected in connection with the brenda hamilton murder after that he sat back and told himself there was no rush nobody was running anywhere even if konig did turn out to be the killer even if he was still alive there was no way he could know the north yorkshire police were on to him after all this time eighteen on friday the rep dropped vivian back at her hotel a little later than she had expected there had been a delay at the radio station when the sound technician discovered halfway through the interview that vivians microphone was faulty she had to do the whole thing again it was after four oclock when she got out of the car and the sky looked heavy and dark the air crackling with prestorm tension in the distance she could hear hesitant rumbles of thunder and see faint lightning flashes even the metropoles facade lovingly restored to its original orange terra cotta looked as black as it had when she had stayed there with charlie all those years ago she would have liked nothing better than to rest in her room for an hour or so perhaps take a long bath but it would be fully dark before long she supposed she could put off her trip and go another time tomorrow would be taken up with signings in york and harrogate but she could always catch a later train and make the visit on sunday morning no she would not procrastinate there was also something ironically appealing to the writer in her about visiting the place during a storm she called the concierge and asked him to arrange for a taxi then she put on her raincoat and waterproof boots the car was waiting downstairs and she ducked in the back with her umbrella and gave the driver directions the rain had started spotting now making huge dark blobs on the pavement the driver a young pakistani tried to practice his english by making conversation about the weather but he soon gave up and settled in to concentrate on his driving woodhouse road was busy with people leaving work early for the weekend and the worsening weather made it a matter of stop and start beyond the city limits though things eased up as vivian gazed out of the rainstreaked window hypnotized by the slapping of the windscreen wipers she thought about her visit to leeds city art gallery yesterday seeing the nude painting of gloria had evoked such a complex response in her that she still hadnt been able to sort out all the strands she had never seen gloria naked before had never accompanied her and alice and the others on their skinnydipping expeditions out of shyness and out of shame at her body so to see the smooth skin and the alluring curves as interpreted by michael stanhopes expert eye and hand came as a revelation what disturbed vivian most of all was the pang of desire the painting engendered in her she had thought herself long past such feelings if she had ever indeed experienced them at all true she had loved gloria but she had never admitted to herself had never even realized that she might have loved her in that way now as she remembered the innocent physical intimacies they had shared painting one anothers legs the dancing lessons when she had felt glorias body close to hers and breathed her perfume the little kiss on her cheek after the wedding she wasnt sure how innocent it had all been the feelings the urges had been there but vivian had been ignorant of such things and had suppressed them in the art gallery she had felt like a pervert looking at pornography not because there was anything pornographic about stanhopes painting but because of her own thoughts and feelings attached to it she thought of that moment when she had kissed glorias stillwarm forehead before covering her with the blackout cloth goodbye sweet gloria goodbye my love pardon me said the driver turning his head what oh nothing nothing vivian shrank into her seat beyond otley there was very little traffic the roads were narrow and they got stuck behind a lorry doing only about thirty for a while it was after five oclock when the driver pulled up in the car park near thornfield reservoir the rain was coming down hard now pattering against the leaves at least vivian thought in this weather she could be sure of having the place to herself she told the driver she would only be about fifteen minutes and asked him to wait he picked up a newspaper from the seat beside him a second car pulled up in the other car park behind the high hedge but vivian was already walking through the woods and she failed to notice it the path was treacherous as if the parched earth had been yearning for the chance to suck up every drop of rain that fell and vivian had to be really careful not to slip as she made her way slowly down the embankment poking her umbrella in the ground ahead and using it as a sort of brake god only knew how she would get back up again the ruined village lay spread out before her under the dark sky rain lashed the crumbled stones and every few seconds a flash of lightning lit the scene like a stanhope painting vivian paused to get her breath by the fairy bridge unfurled her umbrella then walked forward and stood at the humped center she rested her free hand on the wet stone hardly able to believe that this was the same bridge where she had stood and chatted with gloria matthew alice cynthia betty and the others all those years ago the last time she had been there it had been under water the rain was already finding the old rivers channel by the high street and a small stream had formed heading toward harksmere thunder hammered across the sky and vivian shuddered as she moved toward bridge cottage there was nothing left of the place except the foundations a dark stone outline two or three feet high but she remembered where every room and cupboard had been especially the kitchen at the back where she had found glorias body the area around and inside the cottage had been dug up and was still surrounded by police signs warning that it might be dangerous they had been looking for more bodies vivian supposed well they would wouldnt they inspector niven would have done exactly the same thing now she was standing there in the driving rain which dripped off her umbrella and ran down inside her boots she was beginning to wonder why she had come there was nothing here for her now at least when hobbs end was under water she could imagine it as she had done as a place preserved in water glass now it was nothing but a heap of rubble she ambled through the mud up what had been the high street past the shoulder of mutton where billy joe had his fight with seth and where matthew spent his evenings after his return from luzon past halliwell the butchers where she had swapped capstans for suet and pleaded for an extra piece of scragend and past the newsagents shop where she had lived with mother and sold her bits and pieces built up her private lending library met gloria for the first time that blustery april day she came by in her new landgirl uniform asking for cigarettes it was no good there was nothing of the place left but memories and her memories were mostly painful she hadnt known what to expect had in mind only a simple sort of pilgrimage an acknowledgment of some sort well she had done that time to head back to the hotel for a hot bath and a change of clothes or she would catch her death lost in her thoughts she hadnt noticed the gaunt stringyhaired man who had followed her taxi all the way from leeds when she passed bridge cottage on her way back and turned toward the fairy bridge he stepped from behind the outbuilding and held out a gun then he moved forward quickly grabbed her around the throat and she felt the hard metal pushing at the side of her neck her umbrella went flying and landed upside down on high street like a large black teacup then his hand appeared in front of her holding a dogeared photograph creased with age it took her a few moments to realize that it was gloria her hair was darker and straighter and it looked as if it had been taken perhaps a year or two before she had come to hobbs end rain spattered the photograph and the hand that held it such a small hand glorias hand she thought remembering that first meeting when she had shaken hands and vivian had felt heavy and awkward holding that tiny moist leaf what was he doing with hands like glorias by six oclock on friday evening banks was starting to get nervous about his dinner date with jenny the thunder and lightning and driving rain that buffeted his tiny cottage didnt help he had already showered and shaved agonizing over whether to put on any aftershave and finally deciding against it not wanting to smell like a tarts window box now he was surveying his wardrobe what little there was of it trying to decide which version of casual he should put on tonight it was a decision made a lot easier by the overflowing laundry basket the marks amp sparks chinos and the light blue denim shirt almost ready at last banks stood in front of the mirror and ran his hand over his closely cropped hair nothing to write home about he thought but it was the best he could do with what nature had given him he wasnt a vain man but today he seemed to take longer than a woman getting ready to go out he remembered how he had always had to wait for sandra no matter how much time he gave her it had got so bad that when they had to be somewhere for seventhirty he told her seven oclock just to get an edge he thought of annie did he owe her fidelity or were all bets off after the way she had cut him he didnt know at the very least he owed her an explanation of the case given all the hard work she had put in late that afternoon bill gilchrist of the fbi had sent him at jennys request a sixpage fax on edgar px konig and banks had been gobsmacked by its contents ds hatchley had also determined that konig had been questioned in connection with the brenda hamilton murder he wasnt a serious suspect but the two had been friendly rationing was in force until so px still had his uses among the locals as late as annie wasnt at the section station when he phoned her he had tried her at home too but either she had already left for st ives or she wasnt answering her phone next he dialed her mobile number but still got no answer maybe she didnt want to talk to him banks went downstairs and lit a cigarette miles daviss bitches brew was playing on the stereo bringing back more memories of jem during one of those periods when the met had brought in a new broom and corruption charges were flying right left and center banks again saw the man he had first seen walking up the stairs on the night of jems death a dealer his name was malcolm and he had been brought in to give evidence against a certain ds fallon who was charged with extorting heroin from importers he busted instead of arresting them fallon then set up his own distribution network which included malcolm in bankss eyes that made malcolm partly responsible for jems death and when he saw ds fallon he recognized immediately the pockmarked face and cynical smile of the cop who had rifled his bedsit after hed reported jems death no wonder no charges had ever been laid fallon was arrested and sentenced he hadnt been more than eighteen months in wormwood scrubs before a lifer who recognized him stabbed him through the ear with a fileddown length of metal karma after five years or more it was hardly instant but it was karma nonetheless jem would have liked that sense of symmetry banks stubbed out his cigarette and was just heading into the bathroom to brush his teeth when the telephone rang the sound startled him he hoped it wasnt jenny phoning to cancel with annie going all cold on him he had been entertaining some pleasant fantasies about the forthcoming dinner as soon as he heard the voice though he realized there could be much worse things in the world than jenny phoning to cancel dinner why is it banks growled chief constable riddle that you manage to make a pigs arse out of everything you do sir you heard me sir its after six on a fri i dont give a monkeys toss what bloody time it is or what day it is i give you a perfectly simple case to work on nothing too urgent nothing too exacting out of the goodness of my heart and what happens all my good intentions blow up in our faces thats what happens sir i dont know what youre talking about you might not but the rest of the bloody country does dont you watch the news no sir ive been getting ready to go out then youd better cancel im sure shell forgive you not that i care about your sex life do you know where im calling from no sir im calling from thornfield reservoir listen carefully and youll hear the rain and the thunder let me fill you in shortly over an hour ago a woman was taken hostage she had taken a taxi out here and told the driver to wait while she went to look at something when he thought hed waited long enough he went to look for her and saw her standing with a man who appeared to be holding a gun to her head the man fired a shot in the air and shouted his demand and the taxi driver ran back to his car and phoned the police the womans name is vivian elmsley ring any bells bankss heart lurched vivian elmsley yes shes i know damn well who she is banks what i dont know is why some maniac is holding a gun to her head and demanding to talk to the detective in charge of the gloria shackleton investigation because thats what he demanded the taxi driver report can you fill me in on that no sir no sir is that all you can say banks fought back the urge to say yes sir instead he asked whats his name he hasnt said we however have gone into full bloody hollywood production mode out here with a big enough budget to bankrupt us well into the millennium are you still listening to me banks yes sir a hostage negotiator has spoken with him briefly from a distance and all he says is that he wants to see justice done he wont say any more until we get you to the scene theres an armed response unit here already and theyre getting itchy fingers apparently one of their marksmen said he can get a clear shot for crying out loud get yourself down here man now and this time you really will need your wellies its pissing down cats and dogs when riddle hung up banks reached for his raincoat and shot out the door he had a damn good idea who vivian elmsleys captor might be and why he was holding her behind him miless mournful trumpet echoed in the empty cottage annie had managed to get away from the station early before the shit hit the fan and by six oclock she was approaching blackburn on the m shuttling from lane to lane to pass the convoys of enormous lorries that seemed to cluster together at regular intervals it was friday rush hour the sky dark with storm clouds that gushed torrential rain over the whole of the north lightning forked and flickered over the humped pennines and thunder rumbled and crashed like a mad percussionist in the distance annie counted the gaps between the lightning and thunder wondering if that really did tell you how far away the storm was what was the gap between her and banks now could it be counted like that between the thunder and the lightning she knew she was being a coward running away but a little time and distance would give her a clearer perspective and a chance to sort out her feelings it was all getting to be too much first there was the annoyance she had felt when he went out boozing with his mate in leeds instead of going to dinner with her then the time in london he had gone to bethnal green to meet his son and made it clear she wasnt welcome and then the last straw sandras appearance at the cottage on sunday morning she had made annie feel about an inch high and banks still loved her that was obvious enough to anyone it wasnt bankss fault it wasnt because of him she was running but because of herself if every little thing like that was going to rub up against her raw nerve ends then where would she find any peace she couldnt blame banks for making time for friends and family but nor could she allow herself to be drawn so deeply into his life tangled up in his past all she wanted was a simple nostrings relationship but there were already too many complications if she stayed with him she would have to meet his son eventually and audition for the dadsnewgirlfriend test there was a daughter too and she would probably be even harder to win over she would no doubt also meet the redoubtable sandra again even though no one needed a corespondent in divorce cases these days annie was beginning to feel like one and there would be the divorce something else theyd have to go through she didnt think she could face all the emotional detritus of someone elses life impinging on her own she had enough to deal with as it was no she should cut her losses and get out now it was time to go back home regroup recuperate then return to her labyrinth her meditation and yoga with any luck in a couple of weeks banks would have let her go from his thoughts and found someone else annie had the electronic gizmo in the car stereo set so that no matter what program she was listening to the nearest local station would cut in with its weather and travel updates she hadnt a clue how this worked some sort of electronic signal she assumed but sometimes the interruption continued beyond the traffic and weather into the local news bulletin just as she was overtaking a convoy of lorries churning up so much water she could hardly see the weather cut in and she also caught the beginning of a news bulletin about a hostage situation at thornfield reservoir unfortunately the same gizmo that caused the bulletins to cut in also cut them off at the most inappropriate times and this happened halfway through the item all she had discovered was that the detective writer vivian elmsley was being held by an armed man at thornfield reservoir annie turned off the tape and jabbed at the search buttons sending the lcd lights into a digital frenzy she got country and western a gardening program and a classical concert but the scanner couldnt find the damn newsbreak she swore and thumped the wheel swerving dangerously then tried again searching manually this time when she finally did get the right frequency all she heard were the final words bizarre twist in the affair it seems the hostagetaker has asked to talk to the detective in charge of the socalled hobbs end skeleton case believed to be detective chief inspector banks of the eastvale cid well give you more details as they come in well annie thought on the outskirts of blackburn there was nothing else for it she would have to go back she negotiated her way carefully across the lanes of traffic took the next exit crossed the overpass then followed the signs heading east in this weather it would take her about an hour she calculated and these were no conditions for impatient driving she hoped she wouldnt be too late to find out what the hell was going on banks arrived at thornfield car park put on his wellington boots and hurried through the short stretch of woods to the scene riddle hadnt been far wrong when he compared it to a hollywood production it probably cost as much as waterworld though the patrol cars armed response vehicles and technical support unit vans couldnt drive right to the rim of the reservoir because of the trees some of them had forced their way through as far as they could and long thick wires and cables trailed the rest of the way the local media people were there too the entire bowl of hobbs end was floodlit and the occasional lightning flash gave everything a splitsecond blue cast at the center of it all two small pathetic figures were cruelly illuminated just beyond the fairy bridge riddle stood by the phalanx of tv cameras and microphones clustered well behind the police tape banks ignored him and went straight over to the hostage negotiator he looked young banks guessed he had a psychology degree and this was his first reallife situation officially the local superintendent was in charge of the scene but as a rule the negotiator called the shots banks couldnt see any police sharpshooters but he knew they were around somewhere im dci banks he said sergeant whitkirk said the negotiator banks nodded toward the two figures let me go and talk to him youre not going down there whitkirk said thats against the rules do your talking on this he held a loudhailer out banks didnt take it instead he lit a cigarette and gazed out over the eerie scene a set from a horror film perhaps the same film that began with the skeletal hand scratching at the edge of a tombstone he turned to sergeant whitkirk how old are you sonny whats that got youre clearly not old enough to realize that not all wisdom comes out of books whats it called this rule book of yours the handy pocket guide to hostage negotiation now you listen to me no you listen to me banks pointed to the two figures i dont know how many scenes like this youve handled successfully but i do know this situation i know what its all about and i think ive got a hell of a lot better chance than you or anyone else of making sure no one gets hurt whitkirk thrust his chin out there was an angry red spot in the cleft you cant guarantee that leave it to the professionals hes obviously a fucking madman hes not a fucking madman what do you professionals intend to do shoot him whitkirk snorted we couldve done that an hour ago if thats what we wanted were containing the situation bully for you how do you know hes not a madman banks sighed because i know who he is and what he wants how can you know that he hasnt communicated any demands yet except to talk to me thats right and our first rule is that we dont comply he hasnt done anything yet has he no why not do you think how would i know all i know is hes a fucking nutter and hes unpredictable we cant give in to him and you cant just go walking into the situation look at it this way he asked for you maybe youre the one he really wants to kill ill take my chances no you wont im in charge of the scene here and youre not going in what do we do then we play for time banks felt like laughing but he held it back and in time whats your plan first we do all we can to turn an imprecise situation into a precise one oh stop quoting the fucking textbook at me banks said how long have you been here already an hour hour and a half have you turned your imprecise situation into a precise one yet weve established communication banks looked down at the loudhailer yes great communicators those whitkirk glared at him we offered to send down a phone but he refused look said banks hes asked for me we might not know what he wants but he must have something to tell me and you and i both know theres only one way to find out i think i can talk him out of doing any harm cant you give me a bit of leeway whitkirk chewed on his lip for a moment securing the scenes my responsibility he said let me go in banks pointed over to the chief constable believe me theres a bloke over there will give you a medal if i get shot whitkirk managed a thin smile one condition he said what is it you wear a bulletproof vest all right whitkirk sent someone to pick up the vest from the armed response vehicle then he told the hostage taker over his loudhailer what he was planning send him in the man shouted back whitkirk stood aside and banks kitted out with his bulletproof vest trod his cigarette in the mud and set off down the side of the reservoir he heard whitkirk whisper good luck as he went about halfway down he slipped and went the rest of the distance on his backside not very dignified though it probably did more harm to his pride than to his clothing it also reminded him that he had put on his best trousers for dinner with jenny a dinner he was very unlikely to be having now especially as he had forgotten his mobile in all the excitement and hadnt been able to phone her and cancel when he got to the bottom of the embankment he heard a curse behind him and turned to see annie cabbot come sliding down after him also on her bum feet in the air at the bottom she got to her feet and flashed him a grin sorry it was the only way i could give them the slip i take it you dont have a bulletproof vest no i could be gallant and give you mine but were a little too close to the scene now just stay back behind me we dont want to scare him they approached the fairy bridge banks told the man who he was he indicated that it was okay and told the two of them to stop at the far side they faced one another over the bridge vivian elmsley looked frightened but otherwise unhurt as far as banks could see the gun looked like a automatic this is ds cabbot banks said shes been working on the case with me is it okay for her to be here the man looked at annie and nodded i know who she is he said i saw her on television the day you found the skeleton then down here that night a week or so ago so it was you annie said what were you doing surely you werent looking for anything after all this time perhaps i was not the sort of thing you mean but perhaps i was looking for something ive been here a lot at night thinking why did you run i recognized you from the television you walked right past me and didnt even see me but i saw you i couldnt risk being caught having to explain myself before id finished what i had to do banks decided it was time to take charge he held his hands up and gestured for annie to do the same rain dripped down the back of his neck were not armed francis he said we dont want to hurt you we just want to talk let ms elmsley go so you know who i am francis henderson clever but my names stringer now frank stringer he licked his lips so he had adopted his mothers maiden name strange that told banks something about the situation they were dealing with frank looked twitchy and banks wondered if he had been drinking or if he was on drugs again if its hard to make an imprecise situation precise he thought then its a bloody sight harder to make a hallucinatory situation real anyway frank went on im not ready to let anyone go yet i want to hear it all first i want to hear her confess to you then ill decide whether to kill her or not it makes no odds to me okay frank what do you want to hear she killed my mother i want to hear her say so and i want to know why she didnt kill anyone frank what are you talking about youre lying youre trying to protect her his grip tightened on vivian banks caught her sudden intake of breath and saw the gun barrel pushed into the flesh under her ear listen to me frank he said its important you listen to me you asked for me to come here you want the truth dont you i already know the truth i want to hear it from your mouth i want to hear her confess in front of you i want to hear what she did to my mother it didnt happen the way you think it did frank it didnt happen the way any of us thought it did we were all wrong my mother was murdered yes she was murdered and this this bitch here lied to my father and me when we went and asked about her no said banks she didnt lie she thought she was telling you the truth he noticed the look of confusion in vivians eyes all those years frank went on as if he hadnt heard do you know he worshiped her my father even though she left us he said she was a dreamer a free spirit a beautiful butterfly who just had to spread her wings and fly away but i hated her for leaving us for depriving us of all that beauty why couldnt she share it with us why couldnt we be part of her dreams we were never good enough for her i hated her and i loved her all my life dominated and blighted by a mother i never even knew what do you think mr freud would make of that dont you think thats funny banks looked away he didnt want to tell frank the truth that his mother had turned her back on him at birth all those years george had fed him on illusions gloria certainly had been wrong about the father of her child he hadnt turned out so bad after all no he said i dont think its funny at all frank my father used to tell me how she always wanted to be one of those hollywood actresses used to spend hours in front of the mirror practicing her makeup and the way they talked even before i was born it was nogo for them she was too young he said made just one mistake thats all me it was enough she was very young frank when she got pregnant she was frightened she didnt know what to do so she had to run away and leave us for some people it seems like the only solution she obviously wanted the child you to live she didnt have an abortion she must have told your father where she was going did she keep in touch he sniffed a postcard every now and then telling him she was doing fine and not to worry when my dad came home on leave once he took me up to hobbs end to see her it was the only time i the only time i really remember seeing her being with her hearing her voice she told me i was a finelooking boy i loved her then she was a magical creature to me dazzling like someone from a dream she seemed to move in a haze of light so beautiful and so tender but they argued he couldnt help asking her to come back when he saw her but she wouldnt she told him she was married now and had a new life and we should leave her alone if we wanted her to be happy what did your father do what she asked he was devastated i think hed always hoped that one day perhaps she would come back we tried once more when it was all over he turned so he was speaking into vivians ear but this lying bitch here told us she had run away and she didnt know where all my life i believed that believed my mother had run away and abandoned us forever i tried to find her im good at finding people but i got nowhere now i find out she was dead all the time murdered and buried right here let her go frank banks shouted over a peal of thunder she didnt know what do you mean she didnt know she must have known frank tore his attention away from vivian and glared at banks his eyes were wild his lank hair was plastered to his skull and rain dripped from his eyes like tears i want to hear it all i want to hear her admit it to you i want the truth youve got it all wrong frank vivian didnt kill gloria listen to me even if she didnt do the actual killing she was involved she covered for somebody who was it nobody what do you take me for vivian had nothing to do with your mothers death as he spoke banks noticed vivians eyes fill with curiosity despite the gun at her neck annie stood beside him now and frank didnt seem to care about her presence banks was aware of the activity in the background but he didnt think anyone would make a move yet thunder rumbled and lightning flashed his raincoat and trousers stuck to his skin and rain stung his eyes what do you mean she had nothing to do with it frank said she told my father that my mother had gone away when all the while she was buried up here she lied why would she do that unless shed killed her or knew who had as far as she was concerned banks said your mother had gone away she had spoken about running away often since matthew got back from the war hed been badly hurt by the japanese he wasnt the man she had married life was miserable for her it seemed only natural to everyone who knew her that shed go just like she left you and your father in the first place no franks grip tightened on vivians throat and she gasped banks felt his heart lurch he held his hands out palms toward frank okay frank he went on calm down please calm down and listen to me they waited a moment the four of them all silent but for the pattering of the rain and the storm disappearing into the distance the occasional crackle of a police radio from the rim then banks felt things relax the same way as when you undo a tight button matthew drove her away he went on it was only natural for gwen to assume that was what happened your mothers suitcase was gone her things were gone frank didnt say anything for at least a minute banks could see him processing information trying to shore up his defenses the storm passed into the distance now and the rain eased off leaving the four of them soaked to the skin if it wasnt her who was it frank said eventually ill bet you cant tell me that can you i can frank annie stepped forward and spoke frank turned to her and blinked the rain out of his eyes who frank asked and dont you lie to me his name was edgar konig annie said he ran the px at rowan woods usaaf base about a mile from here px vivian gasped i dont believe you said frank its true said banks picking up the thread he realized that annie didnt have the full story yet konig killed your mother he also killed at least one other woman over here the same way down at east anglia there were others too in europe and america frank shook his head slowly listen to me frank edgar konig knew your mother and her friends from the dances they went to he was attracted to her from the start but he had serious problems with women he was always tonguetied around them he brought her presents but even then she didnt offer herself to him she wouldnt help him overcome his shyness she went out with other men he watched and waited all the time the pressure was building up in him you say he killed other women yes how do you know it was him we found a collar button from an american airmans uniform we think your mother must have torn it off as they struggled then we looked into the unsolved murder in suffolk and found he had been questioned in connection with that too are you listening frank im listening franks grip around vivians throat had loosened a little and banks could tell that he had relaxed the hand holding the gun edgar konig went to bridge cottage that night to collect what he thought your mother owed him while her husband matthew was at the pub as usual the bomber group was due to move out in a couple of days and that had pushed him to the brink he didnt have much time hed been torturing himself for over a year hed been drinking that night getting more and more lustful and he thought he had plucked up the courage thought he could overcome his inadequacies something shortcircuited though she must have rejected him maybe laughed at him and the next thing he knew hed killed her in a rage do you understand what im saying frank there was something wrong with him a psycho no not technically not at first anyway he became a sex murderer the two things sex and murder became tangled up in his mind the one demanded the other if thats how it happened why did no one know about it slowly banks reached for his cigarettes and offered frank one gave them up years back he said thanks for the offer though banks lit up definite progress frank seemed less tightly wound more willing to listen to reason and he didnt appear to be drunk or on drugs better not cock it up now no one knew about it banks went on because edgar konig realized what hed done that sobered him up fast he covered his tracks well banks looked at vivian elmsley as he spoke she averted her eyes he cleaned up the mess and he buried the body in the outbuilding then he packed a few of her clothes and belongings in a suitcase to make it look as though she had run off he even faked a note it was wartime people went missing all the time everyone in the village knew gloria wasnt happy with matthew what a burden she had to bear why should they question that shed just done a moonlight frank spoke in vivians ear is that right what hes saying banks couldnt hear her but he saw her mouth form the word yes frank banks pressed on playing his advantage the gun i know you dont want to hurt anyone but its dangerous its easy to make a wrong move nobodys been hurt yet no harms been done frank looked at the gun as if he were seeing it for the first time banks stepped onto the fairy bridge and moved forward slowly holding his hand out he knew there were probably two or three trained marksmen aiming in his direction and the thought made his stomach churn give the gun to me frank its all over vivian didnt kill your mother she had nothing to do with it she loved gloria like a sister it was edgar konig frank let his gun hand drop and released his grip on vivian elmsleys throat she staggered aside and slipped down one of the muddy holes the socos had dug in the bridge cottage floor annie ran to help her frank handed the gun to banks it weighed heavy in his hand what happened to him frank asked this konig did he ever get caught ill tell you all about that later frank said banks taking frank by the elbow just for now though were all a bit tired and wet okay i think we should leave here go somewhere to dry off and get some clean clothes dont you frank hung his head banks draped an arm across his shoulder as he did so he noticed something on the ground partially covered by mud he bent and picked it up it was a photograph of a sixteenyearold gloria shackleton her beautiful determined defiant face staring out at the camera it was damaged by the water but still salvageable several police officers had already come dashing and sliding down the embankment two went to help annie get vivian out of the pit and two of them grabbed frank roughly and started handcuffing him theres no need to be so rough with him said banks leave this to us sir said one of the officers banks sighed and handed over the gun then he held up the photograph of gloria ill get this cleaned up for you if you want frank he said frank nodded please he said and dont worry about me ill be all right its not the first time ive had the cuffs on banks nodded i know they hustled frank stringer away practically dragging him up the muddy slope and banks turned to see annie and the other policemen helping vivian elmsley stumble over the fairy bridge vivian stopped in front of him covered in mud while the others went on ahead thank you she said you saved my life i lied for you said banks i also sullied glorias loyalty to matthew she paled and whispered i know i appreciate what you did im sorry there was a chance you know maybe just a small chance but a chance if youd come forward after you found gloria dead if you hadnt destroyed all the evidence if youd gone to the police banks held his anger in check this was neither the time nor the place for it ah to hell with it too late now vivian bowed her head believe me i know what ive done banks turned and slogged on alone through the mud it was difficult but he made it up the edge without falling down at the top he was aware of annie standing beside him before he could say anything jimmy riddle came running over and grabbed his arm im glad youve salvaged at least something out of this situation banks he hissed but youre bloody incompetent i dont want incompetent officers under my command ill be talking to you first thing monday morning then he turned to annie as for you ds cabbot you disobeyed a direct order i dont like insubordinate officers either ill be talking to you too banks shook his arm free turned on his heel and walked back toward his car all he wanted was a long hot bath a large laphroaig and a change of clothes and annie she was already leaning against her car arms folded are you all right banks asked im fine fine as anyone can be whos spent the last half hour standing in the rain wondering if someone was going to get her head blown off frank stringer wasnt going to hurt anyone easy for you to say i respect what you did out there by the way what do you mean you lied to protect frank stringers feelings i told you my mother died when i was six i like to remember her as a beautiful dazzling creature moving in a haze of light the same way he remembers gloria and i wouldnt want anyone to spoil that illusion for me no matter what the truth i lied to get us all out of there alive annie smiled whatever it worked both ways what next annie stretched arching her back and reaching her arms toward the sky onward to saint ives after ive stopped at home for some dry clothes i was already on my way when i heard i couldnt just leave it of course not thanks for being here you home i suppose banks remembered dinner with jenny too late now especially the state his clothes were in but he could at least borrow a mobile from someone and phone her apologize annie nodded look ill be gone for two weeks right now im still a bit mixed up about my feelings why dont you phone me when i get back maybe we can have that talk okay she grinned at him crookedly if there werent so many policemen about id kiss you goodbye not a good idea no see you then and with that she opened the car door and got in banks ignored his cuttingdown program and lit another cigarette aware that his hands were shaking without looking back annie started her car banks watched the red taillights disappear down the muddy track epilogue after a long rainy winter and overdue repairs by yorkshire water thornfield reservoir filled up again and hobbs end once more disappeared on july of the year after the gloria shackleton murder had entered and left the publics imagination vivian elmsley lay on a kingsize bed in her florida hotel room propped up with pillows and watched the local news channel vivian was in the midst of a national book tour seventeen cities and while gainesville wasnt on the itinerary she had enough clout with her publishers for this brief diversion she would have come anyway tour or no tour yesterday she had been in baltimore bethesda and washington dc tomorrow she was going to dallas but tonight she was in gainesville for tonight was the night that edgar konig had his appointment with old sparky and after everything she had been through vivian desperately needed some sense of an ending it was a sultry mosquitoridden night but that didnt seem to deter the crowds that gathered outside the gates of starke prison about twentyfive miles away one or two were quietly carrying placards that asked for an end to capital punishment but by far the majority were chanting fry konig fry konig bumper stickers echoed the same sentiments and the crowd had created what the commentator called a tailgateparty atmosphere it wasnt big enough to attract any of the national networks after all executions in florida were as common as muggings but the konig case had caught a lot of local interest frank stringer would have come too and vivian would have willingly paid his way but he was in jail english gun laws are far stricter than they are in florida besides no matter how good his reasons for taking vivian hostage at thornfield the past september he had committed a serious crime and occasioned a hugely expensive and highly publicized police operation vivian had visited him several times in jail and told him she would help him get back on his feet when he came out it was the least she could do for glorias memory in his turn frank had told her how his fathers sister ivy and her husband john had taken good care of him during the war and how he had thought of them as his parents when his real father came home on leave they would spend time together that was when they had made the first journey north in and he had seen his mother after the war his father married and took him away from ivy and john franks stepmother turned out to be a drunk and a shrew who had no time for her husbands bastard son increasingly isolated and neglected he got involved with crooks and gangs and one thing led to another the only constant was that he had always worshiped his true mothers memory frank also told vivian how the death of his father that spring and the reemergence of hobbs end from thornfield reservoir had caused his obsession with the past to escalate his father had been the first to recognize gwen shackleton as vivian elmsley on television but frank had confirmed it he had memorized her eyes and her voice all those years ago when he was eight the same way he had also memorized his mothers face he couldnt explain why he had taken the trouble to find out where vivian lived and why he had followed her and approached her at the bookshop it was just that she was the only one left the only one who had known gloria he said that he meant no harm at first that he might even have found the courage to approach her eventually then the skeleton was discovered and he knew she must have lied all those years ago he hated her after that he telephoned to scare her to make her suffer he could have taken her anytime but he enjoyed the anticipation after all once he had confronted her it would be all over so he followed her watched her when she got the taxi outside her hotel he knew where she was going and he felt it was fitting that things should end there where they began but tonight vivian was alone in gainesville with her memories the television a bottle of gin ice and tonic water and an execution they had already shown a fairly recent photograph of edgar konig vivian hadnt been able to recognize the gangly babyfaced young airman with the shy eyes and the blond brush cut his hair was gone his cheeks had sagged and wrinkled his brow was creased and his eyes were deep dark pits in which slimy monsters squirmed as she watched the coverage vivian imagined the officials carrying out the preliminary steps of statesanctioned murder with swift and impersonal efficiency much like dentists or doctors first they would settle the patient in the heavy oak chair and buckle thick leather straps around his arms and legs then they would place the bit between his teeth and attach electrodes to his body as if they were carrying out an ekg she wondered if the leather straps smelled if they were sour with the sweat and fear of previous victims how many hands and legs had they strapped down before or were they replaced after every execution what about the chair itself how many bladders and bowels had emptied there then they would clamp the metal skullcap on vivian shook her head to clear the images she felt dizzy and she realized she was already a bit drunk if anyone deserved this sort of end she told herself ambivalent as she was about the idea of capital punishment it was probably edgar konig vivian had been shocked when banks told her the day after franks arrest that glorias murderer was not dead but on death row in a florida prison did he think of gloria now vivian wondered now the end was so close did he spare a thought for a beautiful young woman all those years ago in a village that no longer existed in a war long since won and what about the others how many had there been even banks hadnt been able to give her a definite number did he think about them if he was like most such killers she had read about in the course of her research he probably felt nothing but selfpity and spent his last moments cursing the bad luck that resulted in his capture what banks had told her a few days after the scene at hobbs end did nothing to dispel that idea bankss fbi contact had interviewed konig last december and sent in a report konig said he remembered the first one he did was in england during the war he couldnt remember her name or the circumstances but he thought maybe she was a blonde he did remember that he had been giving her stockings and gum and cigarettes and bourbon for more than a year and when he came to collect she didnt show a scrap of gratitude hed been drinking he remembered the way the pressure had been building and building in him all that time until hed had too much that night and the dam finally burst she wouldnt have anything to do with him a lowly px grunt oh no she was fucking a pilot it was always the drink he said if it hadnt been for the drink he would never have done any of them but booze made something deep inside him just snap and the next thing he knew they were dead at his feet then he was angry at them for dying and he used the knife it was like that with the second one berlin when he didnt get found out the first time when he realized there wasnt even going to be an investigation he thought he must be leading a charmed life it was all her fault if she hadnt stopped to straighten her stockings as he was driving by hiking her skirt up and showing those long white legs in his headlights then he would never have done her if he hadnt been drunk too which he wouldnt normally have been while driving if he hadnt known the lonely road like the back of his hand if if if his life was a tragedy of cruel ifs she was willing enough to go into the field with him he hadnt planned to hurt her he had only seen her flashing her legs for him on the road back there and wanted a piece like any normal guy would but she had shown no patience with him and his little problem it happened sometimes when hed been drinking and she had asked him for money that made him see red literally see red the knife yes he usually carried a knife with him a habit from the farm days back in iowa when he used to whittle pieces of wood the third woman back stateside in he didnt really remember at all and of the second one in england all he remembered was something red happening in a barn again it was the drink konigs daddy had been a vicious alcoholic who regularly beat poor edgar to within an inch of his life his mother was a drunken whore whod do it with anyone for a dime all his life the drink had caused his problems it made him do these evil things and then he had the bad luck to be caught on that highway in california so went edgar konigs story the drink vivian looked at her glass then with a shaking hand she poured herself another tumbler of gin and grasped a fistful of ice cubes from the bucket on the bedside table tossing them in the glass carelessly so a little gin splashed on the table an american habit she had picked up that ice in her drink it was almost time edgar konig just turned seventysix was finally getting what he deserved vivian still felt a twinge of guilt when she realized that banks was right that she might have helped put an end to his killing all those years ago after gloria the very first victim she was partly responsible for konigs feeling that he led a charmed life of murder without consequence she had tried to rationalize it to herself so many times since banks told her what had happened and turned his back in scorn that evening when the storm broke at hobbs end even if she had reported what happened she told herself they would have still probably arrested matthew he wasnt well enough to face that sort of treatment though banks was a little easier on her when they spoke the next day she could still feel his censure and it stung but what could she have told the police that would have pointed them specifically toward edgar konig the whiskey and lucky strikes on the kitchen counter they were hardly evidence gloria could have got them anywhere and they could have been lying there on the counter for a couple of days she and gloria had known plenty of american air force officers in the area and she had no reason at the time to suspect any of them of murder it was all very well for banks to say in retrospect that she was responsible for all those deaths that she could somehow have stopped all this had she acted differently but it wasnt fair twentytwenty hindsight and who wouldnt given the chance go back and change something time the first shock would boil his brain and turn all the nerve cells to jelly the second or third shock would stop his heart his body would jerk and arch against the straps his muscles would contract sharply and a few small bones would probably snap most likely the fingers the fingers he had used to strangle gloria if he didnt have a leather band strapped across his eyes the heat would cause his eyeballs to explode the death chamber would be filled with the smell of burning hair and flesh steam and smoke would puff out from under the hood the hood itself might catch fire when it was over someone would have to turn on an air vent to get rid of the stench then a doctor would come pronounce him dead and the public would be informed besides vivian told herself as she watched the people chanting outside the prison gates others could have stopped him too if the system had worked properly it wasnt only her fault she had acted only from the purest of motives love of her brother these past few weeks she had read all the articles on edgar konig and his impending doom there had been plenty of them konig had finally been caught in california in the late sixties when he was about fortyfive attacking a young female hitchhiker by the side of a lonely road fortunately for her another motorist had happened along even more fortunate this man wasnt the kind who scared easily or who didnt want to get involved he was an exserviceman and he was armed when he saw a woman in trouble he stopped and managed to disarm and disable konig before calling the police already the girl was unconscious from strangulation she had five stab wounds but she survived konig served nine years of a fourteenyear sentence he was released early because of good behavior and prison overcrowding a lot of people in the know opposed his release regarding him as extremely dangerous and suspecting but never being able to prove his involvement in at least four murders the prison officials said there wasnt much else they could do at the time but let him go after his release in the late seventies for years konig was driven from one community to another as people found out what he was trying to get work as a store clerk more often than not failing and going on welfare just a few years ago he had finally settled in the small florida town where it all came to a messy and predictable end his neighbors had already started protesting and one local business had even offered him money to up sticks and move elsewhere but konig stayed on then one day a couple of jehovahs witnesses came to call and saw through the screen door konig with a knife in his hand standing over the body of a woman who turned out to be a local prostitute they called the police on their mobile phone konig was drunk he offered no resistance after that of course came the obligatory years of waiting for trial for sentencing the failed appeals death row and it was all over now a cheer went up from the crowd outside the prison news had come out edgar konig was dead why was it that vivian felt no relief felt nothing but the stirrings of a bad headache she closed her eyes and pressed her fingers to the lids all over all over she was so tired konigs statement to the fbi had been bald and unembellished but with her morbid imagination vivian was able to fill in the nuances and the emotions she saw gloria run into the kitchen as she became frightened by pxs erratic behavior behavior she had witnessed in embryo at the veday party saw her frantically pulling tins of tea and cocoa out of the kitchen cupboard looking for the gun shocked and scared to find that it wasnt there did she realize in the last moments of her life that gwen must have taken it next vivian saw px grab gloria put his hands around her throat felt the breath going out of her then she saw him pick up the kitchen knife from the counter felt one sharp pain then another another everything starting to slip away from her vivian put her hand to her throat the gun she was the one who had taken the gun the one thing that might have saved glorias life if she had got to it in time and brenda hamiltons life and all the others then for all those terrible years she had cared for matthew in his fallen state believing he was a murderer poor gentle matthew who wouldnt harm a soul who couldnt even kill himself no more than her husband ronald could despite the pain vivian had helped them both ronald with an extra dose of morphine and matthew all those years ago before she started crying she had a vivid memory of that afternoon in leeds when she came back from the shops and saw matthew sitting in the chair with the gun in his mouth the gun she had taken from gloria kept and brought all the way from hobbs end he was trying to find the courage willing himself to pull the trigger but he couldnt do it just like all the other times he had tried and failed he had such a forlorn expression on his face such a hopelessness about him his eyes pleaded with her and this time almost without thinking she walked over to him tenderly wrapped her hand around his kissed his forehead and pressed his finger on the trigger outside starke prison the crowd was dancing and chanting shaking up bottles and spraying beer at each other in the hotel room vivian elmsley let her tears flow freely for the first time in over fifty years and reached again for her gin acknowledgments many people
