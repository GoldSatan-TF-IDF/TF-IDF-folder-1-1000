anne perry pentecost alley sorry sir inspector ewart said quietly as pitt stared down at the womans body sprawled across the big bed at her face swollen in the asphyxia of death but this one you ought to see so i assume pitt said wryly since his promotion to command of the bow street station he no longer dealt with ordinary episodes of violence theft and fraud the assistant commissioner had directed that he reserve his attention for those crimes which had or threatened to have political implications those which involved persons of social prominence and might provoke embarrassment in high places if not dealt with both rapidly and tactfully so his being sent for at two in the morning to come to this whitechapel slum over the murder of a prostitute required some explanation the palefaced constable who had ridden with him in the hansom had said nothing as they clattered through the august night the streets narrowing becoming meaner the smell of sour smoke crowded middens and the sharp odor of the river stronger as they moved eastwards they had stopped at old montague street opposite the culdesac of pentecost alley the light from the gas lamp on the corner did not reach this far holding his bullseye lantern high the constable had led pitt past refuse and sleeping beggars up the steep creaking steps of the tenement building in through the deepstained wooden door and along the passage to where ewart was waiting the sound of weeping came from somewhere farther back sounding frightened and carrying a rising note of hysteria pitt knew ewart by reputation and he nurtured no doubts that there was some very real reason why he had been sent for and so urgently if nothing else ewart would be highly unwilling to yield command of his case to another officer especially one who had risen from the ranks as pitt had and who only a short while ago had been his equal like many regulars in the police force ewart believed that the only man with a right to such a position was one born to it as had been pitts predecessor micah drummond a man of independent wealth and military experience pitt looked at the woman she was young it was difficult to tell a prostitutes age the life was harsh often short but the skin on her bosom where her dress was torn open was still unmarred by drink or disease and the flesh was firm on her thighs where her redandblack skirt had been lifted her left wrist was tied to the bedpost with a stocking and there was a garter around her arm just above the elbow a blue satin rose stitched to it the other stocking was tied in a noose around her neck tight biting into it almost cutting the top half of her body and all the bed around it was drenched with water the sound of weeping was still audible but it was quieter now and there were other voices as well and footsteps in the passage light and quick pitt looked around the room it was surprisingly well furnished the walls had been papered a long time ago and though they were marked by the incessant damp and mold and faded where the light had struck them there was still a recognizable pattern the fireplace was small the dead ashes in it graywhite the fire had been a gesture something flickering and alive rather than a source of heat the one chair was a cheerful red with a handstitched cushion on it and there was a rag mat on the floor an embroidered sampler hung over the shallow mantel and the wooden chest for clothes and linens was polished even its brass handles gleamed the washstand held a single ewer and basin on the floor beside the bed were the girls high black boots not side by side but half over each other the round shiny buttons of the left one had been fastened through the buttonholes of the right one a bonehandled buttonhook lay beside them it was a ridiculous distorted gesture and one that could only have been done deliberately pitt drew in his breath and let it out in a sigh it was ugly and sad but there was nothing in it to cause ewart to have sent for him prostitution was a dangerous way to make a living murders were not unique and certainly not reason for scandal in high places or even in low ones he turned to look at ewart whose dark face was unreadable in the light from the bullseye his eyes black evidence ewart answered the question he had not asked too much of it to ignore saying what pitt felt a chill beginning to eat inside him in spite of the mild night gentleman ewart replied of a very well connected family pitt was not surprised he had feared it would be something of the sort pointless and destructive something with which there was no graceful way to deal he did not ask ewart why he thought so it would be better to see the evidence and make his own deductions there was a noise along the passageway a creaking of footsteps and another man appeared in the doorway he was twenty years younger than ewart no more than thirty at the most his skin was fresh his hazel eyes wide his face thin aquiline his features had been formed for humor and tenderness but the marks of pain had scored them deeply already and in the flickering light he was haggard he brushed his hair back off his brow unconsciously and stared first at ewart then at pitt he carried a brown leather bag in his hand lennox surgeon ewart explained good morning sir lennox said a little huskily then cleared his throat and apologized there was no need pitt had little regard for a doctor who could look at violent death and feel no shock no sense of outrage or loss he stood back a little so lennox could see the body better ive already examined her lennox declined i was called at the same time as inspector ewart ive just been with some of the other women in the building they were a bit upset what can you tell me pitt asked lennox cleared his throat again he looked straight at pitt his eyes averted from the woman on the bed even the spread of her hair and the bright rose on her arm shes been dead several hours he answered i should say since about ten oclock last night not later than midnight its cool in here now but it must have been warmer then the ashes in the fire still have a little heat in them and its not really a cold night youre very precise about ten oclock pitt was curious lennox flushed sorry there was a witness who saw her come in pitt smiled or perhaps it was more of a grimace and midnight he asked another witness that was when she was found sir lennox shook his head minutely what else can you tell me about her pitt continued i would guess she was in her midtwenties and in good health so far children pitt asked yes and what lennoxs face was tight with pain her fingers and toes have been broken sir three fingers on her left hand two on her right and three toes dislocated left foot pitt felt a shiver of ice inside him as if suddenly the temperature of the room had plummeted recently he asked although he knew the answer had they been old wounds lennox would not have mentioned them he would probably not even have noticed them yes sir almost certainly within the last few hours just before death in fact theres hardly any swelling i see thank you pitt turned back to the bed he did not want to look at her face but he knew he must he must see what and who she had been and what had been done to her here in this shabby lonely room it was his job to learn why and by whom she was handsomely built of roughly average height as far as he could tell her features had been regular pleasing in their way the bones under the puffy flesh were difficult to see but the brow was good the nose neat the hairline gently curved her teeth were even and only just beginning to discolor in another walk of life she might have been a married woman looking forward to a comfortable maturity perhaps with three or four children and thinking of more what is this evidence he asked still looking down at her nothing he had seen so far suggested anything more than some mans taste for pain and fear having gone too far a badge from a gentlemans private club ewart answered then stopped and drew in his breath with a name on it and a pair of cuff links pitt swiveled around to look at him lennox was watching his eyes wide almost mesmerized what name pitts voice fell into the silence ewart put up his finger and eased his collar his face white finlay fitzjames outside the constables footsteps creaked on the floorboards and river fog dripped beyond the dark windows the weeping in the other room had started again but fainter muffled pitt said nothing he had heard the name augustus fitzjames was a man of considerable influence a merchant banker with political ambitions and a close friend of several noble families who had held high office finlay was his only son a young diplomat rumored to be in line for an embassy in europe in the nottoodistant future and witnesses ewart added his eyes on pitts face pitt stared back at him to what he asked guardedly ewart was obviously profoundly unhappy his body was tense his shoulders tight his mouth dragged down at the corners he was seen he answered not by people who know him of course and the description could fit more than him ordinary enough but it was obviously someone of position he seemed about to add something more perhaps about gentlemen who frequented such places then decided it did not matter they both knew there were men bored with their wives frightened of censure or commitment if they used women nearer their own class or simply excited by the forbidden the frisson of danger or there were a hundred other reasons why they might choose to purchase their pleasures in alleys and rooms like this and the cuff links as well lennox added from the doorway his voice still husky gold he laughed abruptly hallmarked pitt looked slowly around the room trying to imagine what had happened here only a few hours ago the bed was rumpled as though it had been used but nothing was torn that he could see there was a slight smear of blood close to the center but it could have come from anyone tonight or a week ago he would ask lennox after he had examined it if he thought it meant anything his gaze moved around the walls and the sparse furniture nothing else was disturbed but unless a fight was very violent and between people of something like equal weight or strength it would hardly mark this ancient wallpaper or overturn the chair or the wooden washstand with its bowl and cracked and mended blue jug as if reading his thoughts ewart broke in theres nothing interesting in the wardrobe just half a dozen dresses petticoats and an outdoor cape there are underclothes two towels and a clean pair of sheets and pillow covers in the chest chamber pot under the bed and one black stocking daresay she dropped it some time ago and couldnt see it in the dark we wouldnt have found it without two of us and the bullseye where did you find the cuff links and the badge pitt asked not under the bed ewart pushed out his lip one cuff link actuallyat least the two halves for one sleeve behind the cushion in the chair he pointed towards it jammed down between the seat and the upright suppose he took off his shirt and put it over the back and maybe it got caught perhaps he sat on it or something left in a panic and never thought of it until too late of course theres nothing to say it was left here last night he looked at pitt waiting for his answer possibly pitt agreed they both knew how unpleasant it would be if they had to pursue a man of fitzjamess rank it would be so much easier if it could be some ordinary man someone local with no defenders no power behind him yet the evidence was there and had to be followed and it was pitt who would have to do it ewarts trying to evade the issue was understandable but it was no real help it proves someone was here with expensive tastes pitt said wearily and the badge proves either that fitzjames was here himself at some time or someone who knew him was where did you find it was that down the chair as well suddenly ewarts urgency evaporated leaving him sad and anxious his face heavily lined weariness in every crease his dark eyes were almost black in the candlelight puckered at the corners on the bed he replied his voice little more than a whisper under the body there was no need to add that it could not have been there before it was too wretchedly obvious pitt put out his hand ewart fished in his coat pocket and brought out a small round piece of gold enamel faced a pin across the back of it he dropped it into pitts open palm pitt turned it over looking at it carefully it was about half an inch across the sort of thing a man might wear on his lapel the enamel was gray discreet easily lost against the fabric of a suit on it were written in gold two words hellfire club and the date nine years ago he turned it over towards the light even so it took him several moments before he could discern the very faint hairfine writing on the back behind the bar of the pinfinlay fitzjames but once he read it there could be no argument he looked up at ewart then at lennox still standing just inside the doorway his face white drained of life and color his eyes full of pain did you find it pitt asked ewart yes the constable didnt move her he says he didnt touch anything he could see she was dead and he raised the alarm why did he come in what brought him here in the first place it might not matter but he should ask did he know her by sight ewart replied with a shrug her names ada mckinley worked this area the last half dozen years or so constable binns says he saw a man come running out in a panic and he stopped him there could have been something wrong made him go back in thinking he may have got mixed up in a scuffle tried to cheat one of the girls or something seems that he was a customer of one of the other girls rose burke and on his way out from her saw adas door open and being a nosy sort of bastard took a look in hoping to catch someone in the act i suppose anyway saw more than he bargained for ewarts nose wrinkled in disgust came running out as if the devil were after him but he couldnt have done it he was with rose till seconds before constable binns saw him rosell swear for that shes one of the witnesses who saw the man go in whoever he was weve got her waiting for you and the man him too ewart let out his breath in a little grunt cross as two sticks but still here swearing fit to turn the air blue theyre all cross for that matter bad for business he pulled a sour face isnt it a bit late for business pitt asked ruefully when did all this happen when binns saw him come out ewarts eyes widened about midnight i got here just after one i took a look around then as soon as i saw that badge i knew we were going to have to get you in so i sent constable wardle for you sorry but the way i see it its going to get nasty whatever we do no way out of it he took a deep breath of course fitzjames may be able to give us a proper explanation and then we can look elsewhere maybe pitt said doubtfully what about money do you know if anything was taken ewarts face brightened a light flickered for a moment in his eyes and he hesitated before he replied considering as he spoke her pimp that would be a very much easier answer i mean easier to understand to believe he stopped so was there money pitt pressed there was a small leather purse in the linen box ewart said reluctantly about three guineas in it pitt sighed not that he had really hoped if shed been keeping it from him it wouldnt be there now first place hed look he said sadly there was a shrill whistle from a kettle towards the back of the house and someone swore perhaps they quarreled and he killed her before he searched ewarts voice was keen again he panicked and ran itd make more sense teach the other girls a lesson theyd not forget more reason to kill her than a customer like fitzjames what about the boots lennox asked from the doorway his voice thick i could see him torturing her but why would someone killing her for money fasten her boots together like that or put the garter round her arm god knows ewart said impatiently perhaps that was the client before he came he knew she was salting away too much of what she earned and he came as soon as he saw the customer leave she had no time to undo the boots or take off the garter i can understand her not having time to undo the boots lennox said with harsh sarcasm but did the customer go leaving her tied to the bed by one hand and she stayed like that while she argued with her pimp i dont know ewart said maybe the pimp tied her up while he searched for money he would do to torture her and didnt find it lennoxs eyebrows rose maybe there was more perhaps under the mattress or something anyway why would a man like fitzjames kill a woman like that ewart eyed the body in the bed with a strange mixture of pity and distaste probably for the same reason he used her in the first place lennox said bitterly he turned to pitt i havent moved her do you need to see her any more or can i at least cover her cover her pitt answered seeing the urgency of distress in his face and liking him so much more than he did ewart even though he understood ewarts feelings his weariness his familiarity with such scenes and lives and the people who lived them if he had ever had romantic delusions about young women in the streets they were long since destroyed by reality he was not unfeeling it was simply that for his own sanity he must limit his emotions and more immediate than that to do his job and be of any use his brain must be clear driven by thought not emotion ada mckinley was beyond human help but other women like her were not but pitt still preferred lennoxs vulnerability it sprang from some kind of hope and a different sort of care lennox shot him a look of gratitude then came forward across the room first he pulled down the dead womans skirt to cover her legs then took the quilt from the bed and spread it over her hiding her distorted face as well did you find anything else you havent mentioned yet pitt asked ewart do you want a list of her belongings ewart said tartly not yet ill see constable binns then the other witnesses in order here ewart looked around his eyes avoiding the bed is there anywhere else the other womens rooms thats all ill see binns here and the women in their own rooms i need some idea of the geography of the house ewart was satisfied it was what he would have done binns was about thirty fairhaired bluntfaced still looking shaken and rubbing his hands he was not used to standing motionless on guard his feet were numb pitt knew from the careful clumsy way he walked sir he stood facing pitt his eyes studiously away from the bed tell me what you saw pitt directed binns stood at attention yessir i were following me usual beat which is spittalfields end o whitechapel road up ter beginnin o mile end road an north ter anbury street and back again he took a deep breath still staring straight ahead i gets ter corner o old montague street and sees this feller come boltin out o the entrance o pentecost alley lookin like ed seen a ghost or summink e were abaht ter scarper orff westwards towards brick lane way but i reckoned as there must be summink wrong or ed a walked normal instead o keep dartin a look over is shoulder like e were afraid someone was arter im he swallowed so i nabbed im sharp by the back o is collar and brought im up short e squealed like the devil ad im so then i knew ed like seen summink bad e were scared witless pitt nodded in commendation neither ewart nor lennox moved standing back in the shadows listening i made im go back binns continued moving a little to ease his cramped feet as the circulation returned i thought itd be one o these rooms up ere other sides a sweatshop e could a nicked summink but e didnt ave nuffink with im so i came in ere his eyes wandered momentarily but ignored ewart and lennox as if he did not see them this is the first room the door were alf open so i come in his voice dropped almost to a whisper and he glanced at the bed poor little cow i knew straight orff as she were dead so i didnt touch nuffink i shut the door an took im wif me and raised the alarm wif me whistle seemed like ferever till someone eard me but i spose it werent no moren five minutes pc rogers were passing along wentworth street an e come runnin i sent im for mr ewart what time was that pitt asked binns flushed i dunno sir first i were too busy oldin the witness ter take out me watch and then wen i saw er i never thought ter i know thats right unprofessional but i knew er ysee an it fair shook me what can you tell me about her pitt asked watching the mans face he shifted his weight but still remained at attention bin ere six year or thereabouts dunno were she come from pinner way i think country anyow miles from ere pretty she were then all roses and cream he shook his head his face crumpled said she were a parlor maid in one o them big ouses up belgravia way lorst er character he said it almost expressionlessly as if it were an old tragedy too familiar to arouse anger anymore butler got er inter trouble she told the lady o the ouse an they kept the butler an sent er packin child come early didnt live poor little beggar though that could a bin fer the best his face pinched and his eyes looked far away death is better than the workouse or some o them baby farms so she took ter the streets smart she were an i guess she were bored and angry too the gentleness ironed out of his features his face set shed a liked terve got even wi that butler pitt had no doubt that if she had binns for one would have been blind that moment as a constable pitt might have too now he could not afford such a luxury maybe she tried blackmail on the butler ewart spoke for the first time and there was a lift in his voice and he killed her why lennox said slowly his employer already knew her story and didnt care its irrelevant pitt cut across them no one would have taken her word against his not now in a sentence he had reduced her to what she was and he knew it the only reason he had been called to her murder was because of finlay fitzjamess name on the badge some men in ewarts position would have suppressed it and gone through the motions of searching for her killer then simply marked the case unsolved and left it perhaps if lennox had not been there he would have but lennox had seen him find the badge under the body and he would not have remained silent there was no discretion in his face no cynicism only an aching wornout hurt there was silence in the rest of the house but the sound of the first traffic could be heard in the street outside and the smear of dawn paled a little beyond the windows pitt turned to binns is that all yessir i waited till mr ewart come then i told im what i saw an done an anded it over to im that were a little arter one oclock thank you you acted well thank you sir he turned to leave with straighter shoulders his head high his feet still numb wed better see the witness pitt nodded to ewart in here a few moments later another constable escorted in a lean narrowshouldered man with a brown jacket and dark trousers concertinaed over his boots handmedowns from someone taller his face was graywhite and twitching with fear whatever the pleasure he had purchased that night it had been at a price he would never willingly have paid whats your name pitt asked him obbadiah sskeggs he stuttered his face twitching i never touched er i swear to gawd i never did his voice was rising in what he intended to be sincerity and was all too obviously terror ask rosie he gestured to where he imagined rosie was shell tell yer honest rosie is shed never lie fer me she dont know me from nuffink he looked at pitt then at ewart i swear pitt smiled in spite of himself rosie doesnt know you no then how do you know her i dont i mean he saw the trap but he had already stepped into it he breathed in and tried to swallow choking himself you dont have to make up your mind pitt said dryly ill ask rosie anyway shell no doubt know whether youre a regular or not she wouldnt lie fer me skeggs said desperately gasping between splutters she dont even like me no i dont suppose she does pitt agreed do you know what time you got here no he was not going to risk any more traps no i were leavin wen that rozzer nabbed me an that were unjust it were i never done nuffink as is agin the law he became plaintive a mans allowed a little pleasure an i always paid fair rosiell tell yer that how would she know pitt raised his eyebrows skeggss face tightened venomously you thought youd entertain yourself a little more pitt continued so when you saw adas door open you peeped round only instead of finding her fornicating with a customer you saw her lying dead sprawled over the bed tied to it her stocking wound round her throat and the garter on her arm skeggs let out an agonized blasphemy and you fled when constable binns caught you pitt finished i were going ter raise the alarm skeggs protested glaring at pitt and then at ewart as if to bear out his story call the plice like i should fast as me legsd carry me thats why i were runnin so why didnt you tell constable binns about ada pitt enquired skeggs looked at him with murder in his eyes did you see anyone else pitt went on outside the light was broadening there was more noise in the street people coming and going calling to each other the sweatshop opposite was opening up yer mean like im wot done it skeggs demanded indignantly course i didnt or id a told yer fink id stand ere bein suspected if i knew ood really done it wot yer fink i am stupid pitt forbore from answering but skeggs read the silence as affirmative and bristled with offense he followed the constable out glancing over his shoulder still searching for something cutting to say pitt saw rose burke in her own room two doors farther along it was a different shape and perhaps a foot or two wider but essentially similar a large bed occupied most of the space also rumpled and obviously lately used the sheets had a gray look down the center and were heavily creased there was a stale smell of sweat and body dirt apparently skeggs had had his moneys worth at least up to that point lennox looked ashenfaced there was no need for him to have followed and pitt wondered why he had perhaps he thought rose might need him but rose was of sterner stuff she was broadshouldered handsomebosomed of no more than average height her hair was dark brown but had been bleached in a paler streak across the front it was startlingly becoming in fact she was a beautiful woman even if her skin had coarsened from its youthful duskiness and her teeth were already going she might have been anything between twentyfive and forty she was too composed to offer any remark before she was asked she stood in the middle of the room ignoring lennox and looking at pitt waiting arms folded only a slightly rapid rise and fall of her chest betraying that she was under any stress at all pitt did not know if it was indifference to adas fate or courage he thought perhaps at least some of the latter rose burke yeah her chin lifted tell me about your evening from eight oclock onwards pitt commanded then as her face lit with a contemptuous smile im not interested in doing you for prostitution im after who killed ada hes been here once if we dont get him he could come again you might be next jeez she sucked in her breath respect and loathing bright in her eyes do you want me to tell you it never happens he asked more gently its not true he broke her fingers and toes then he strangled her with her own stocking like a hangmans noose he did not mention the garter or the boots better to leave something unspecified you think hell do it just the once lennox winced and seemed about to say something then changed his mind and silently went out pushing the door closed behind him rose breathed the lords name in what might even have been a prayer because almost as if she did not register what she was doing she crossed herself now the blood was gone from her face leaving the rouge garish though it was skillfully applied pitt waited she began slowly i ad someone at ten djer ave ter ave is name sbad fer business yes she hesitated only a moment chas newton e were ere till near eleven generous arent you pitt said dubiously a whole hour is business slow lately e paid double she snapped her pride stung he could believe it she was a handsome woman and there was an air of knowingness about her as if little in the way of tastes or skills would be outside her capacity and when hed gone he prompted i dressed an went out o course she said tartly wot jer think i was gonna do go ter sleep i went down ter the alley an was turnin ter go between the ouses ter whitechapel road an i saw this geezer comin in on the other side the other end pitt interrupted you mean old montague street no i mean the other side o ol montague street she said impatiently could a bin springheel jack or farver christmas from all i saw if itd bin the end o the alley were i were there int no lamp there dont yer notice nuffink you saw him pass under the lamp pitts voice quickened in spite of himself yeah she was still standing in the middle of the room with arms folded describe him pitt directed taller n me less n you bit more n usual mebbe well built kind o young twenty thirty pitt said quickly not that young thirty int easy ter tell wi a toff life int so ard fer them live soft live longer how was he dressed he must not put words into her mind she considered for a moment decent coat must a cost a quid or two no at though cos i saw the light in is air fair it looked an thick wavy wish my air waved like that she shrugged wouldnt want is face though sort o mean summink abaht is mouf good enough nose like a good nose on a man she looked at pitt speculatively then changed her mind physical relationships were a matter of business for her there was no pleasure in them ever seen him before he asked ignoring the glance cant say why not cos i dunno o course she snapped her face pinched fear and sorrow struggling with each other if i knew ood a killed ada id tell yer be there ter watch yer string the bastard up elp yer fer that poor little cow she were a greedy bitch and thought erself a bit above some o us but she dint deserve that you dont know if youve seen him before he challenged in the dark all cats are gray she made a gesture of disdain int you never eard that before i dont look at mens faces only the money but e dont jog me memry none i dont think as ive seen im sure as ells on fire i dont know is name or id tell yer hells on fire he repeated the words carefully what makes you say that cos its abaht the one thing as im sure of she retorted looking him up and down wot jer spec me to say sure as eavens sweet i wouldnt know she looked away from him at the tawdry overfamiliar room dont believe in it int fer me fer ada if it was ask the preachers theyll soon tell yer women like me is gonna burn in ell fer corruptin an leadin astray the likes o gentlemen she gave an oath so coarse even pitt was jolted by hearing it from her stillbeautiful mouth have you ever heard of the hellfire club he asked amusement flashed across her face no wots that them as is gonner burnor them as is gonner stoke believe me that sods gonner burn if i ave ter carry the coals meselfgentleman or no was he a gentleman he asked after a moments hesitation her eyes met his squarely looked like it e werent ard up an as sure as ells on fire mister e come just about the time poor ada were croaked i were along the whitechapel road fer alf an hour an i didnt see no one else go past till i got another gent meself an come in again you didnt see the other end pitt pointed out int my pitch she said reasonably ask nan about that you said ada was greedy pitt prompted did she take from you i never said she stole rose was annoyed again her eyes were sharp and bright i said she were greedy always wanted more always thinkin o ways to get a bigger cut not jus for erself but for us too i never knew nobody so angry ate er up at times did she say who with she shrugged and her lip curled lousy butler wot took er character i spose then lied abaht it dunno what she expected bit green she were her face pinched and the sorrow returned poor little cow there was a bang outside and a clatter of hooves someone shouted there were footsteps in the corridor and a door slammed somewhere upstairs the vibrations shivering through the room did she ever mention this butlers name pitt asked her eyes widened you reckon it was im as did er why would e she couldnt do nuffink to im safe as big ben e were still is no i didnt think so he conceded what time did you see this man dunno ten praps then what she was uninterested i got another couple o jobs nuffin special alf hour each mebbe the next were skeggs sorry little bastard that e is takes im an hour to get isself goin likes ter look at other people her voice was thick with disgust e left me and went snoopin on ada ter see if e could catch some other stupid sod wif is pants orff makin a fool of isself and maybe doin it good she put her hands on her hips oo knows anyway the little swine got moren e bargained for saw ada dead an damn near wet isself time i know that cos this time i looked i were ungry and reckoned as id done well enough as i could get summink decent ter eat i were goin down ter the pie stand on the corner o chicksand street till the rozzer come back and all the row started ad ter stay ome and im fair starvin now pitt said nothing she stared at him with sudden anger think im an eartless bitch doncher she demanded her voice hard full of resentment well i felt sick as you at first but thats two hours ago or like an i aint eaten proper since yestday death comes often ere not like up west were its all soft an folk die easy an that doc were real fair e told me as she probably dint feel much fer long made nan put on a kettle and get us all a cup o tea an e laced it wif a drop o brandy never known a bloke be so she was lost for a word she had no term of praise to convey what she meant the sudden warmth the feeling that for a moment her emotions and her grief had been truly more important to him than his own it eased the bitterness out of her face till pitt could see the woman she might have been had time and circumstance been different nan sullivan was at least ten years older than rose and long hours and too many bottles of gin had blurred her features and dulled her hair and eyes but there was still a softness in her some spark of memory left a gentleness behind it and when she spoke there was an echo of the west of ireland in her voice she sat on her bed frowsy tearstained and too tired to care sure i was at the other end o the alley she agreed looking at pitt without interest took me a while to find anyone i had to walk along to brick lane it was obviously a defeat she no longer bothered to hide i got back just as ada come indoors so you saw the man who went in pitt said eagerly sure i did least i saw the back of his head and his coat she sighed and the ghost of a smile touched her mouth lovely coat it was good gabardine i know good gabardine when i see it used to work in a sweatshop master o that had a coat o gabardine his was brown as i recall but it sat on the shoulder the same way neat and sharp it was no rumples no folds where there shouldnt be what color was this one he was sitting in the one chair about a yard away from her this room opened onto the midden and he could not hear the sounds of the street this one she thought for a moment her eyes far away blue or mebbe black wasnt brown anything about the collar sat fine sort o curve you dont get in a cheap coat not fur or velvet he asked or lambskin she shook her head no just wool cant see the cut with fur what about his hair thick unconsciously she brushed her fingers through her own hair thinning with time and abuse an fair she added saw the light on it from the candles in adas room poor little bitch her voice dropped nobody should have done that to her did you like her he asked suddenly she was surprised she had to think for a moment i spose i did she brought trouble but she made me laugh an i had to admire her fight pitt felt a moments irrational hope who did she fight with she went up west sometimes had nerve ill say that for her didnt often sell herself short so who did she fight with nan she gave a sharp jerky little laugh oh fat georges girls up near the park thats their patch if it had bin a knife in her id ave said wee georgied done it but hed never have strangled her or done it in her own room either hed have done it in the street and left her there besides i know fat george when i see him and wee georgie that was unarguable pitt knew them both too fat george was a mountain of a man unmistakable for anyone else let alone finlay fitzjames and wee georgie was a dwarf added to which whatever the trespass into their territory they would have beaten her or crippled her or even disfigured her face but they would not have brought down the police upon themselves by killing her it would be bad for business you saw this man going into adas room pitt returned to the subject yes he frowned you mean she opened the door for him she didnt take him in she didnt bring him from the street her eyes widened no no she didnt come to think on it he must have come here on his ownsort of reglar or like that do you get many regulars then he saw instantly from her face how tactless the question was ada might have but she did not a flicker of understanding crossed her features and knowledge of all the nuances of failure and his perception of what it meant and his momentary regret she forced herself to smile made it almost real not reglar like calling see the same faces but nobody makes appointments might come on the chance sure enough ada was popular her face crumpled her shoulders sagged and suddenly her eyes filled with tears she was quick with her tongue poor little beggar and she could make you laugh she took a deep shaky breath and people like to laugh she looked at pitt she gave me a pair of boots once we had the same size feet they had a real pretty heel shed done better than me that week and it was me birthday the tears spilled over her cheeks and ran down the paint on them but she did not contort her face there was a strange kind of dignity in her a genuineness of grief which made nothing of the shabby room with its unmade dirty bed the garish clothes the smell of the midden coming up from the yard even her weary body too often used too little loved all pitt could offer was to lend ada mckinley the same worth im sorry he said quietly and without thinking placing his hand for a moment over hers ill do everything i can to find who did this to her and ill make him answer whoever he is will you she asked swallowing awkwardly even if hes a gent even if hes a gent pitt promised he went through the same questions with the third woman in the house whose room was next to adas her name was agnes salter she was young and plain with a long nose and wide mouth but there was a vitality to her which would probably serve her well enough for at least another ten years with the bloom gone from her skin and the firmness from her body she might find it much harder to make her way most probably she was as aware of that as he course i knew ada she said matteroffactly she sat straight in a hardbacked chair her skirts hitched up almost to her knees her legs were excellent her best feature no doubt she knew that too she was not regarding pitt as a man he could see in the total disinterest in her expression that it was merely habit and possibly quite comfortable bit cocky but not bad she went on referring to ada willin ter share lent me a garter once she smiled knew i ad better legs n er not that ers were bad mind but moneys money i did well wi that some geezers get igh on garters guess fancy ladies dont wear em all whalebone stays and cotton drawers pitt did not comment it was now daylight outside and there was traffic on the street beyond the alley and the sweatshop opposite was hard at work cant tell yer nuffink agnes went on dont know nuffink id see the bastard quartered if i could theres risksand theres risks her fingers were clenched knuckles white belying her studied casual air yer spect ter get beat up nown again its part o life an mebbe the odd cuttin which can go too far if yer mans had a skinful but this int right poor sow she never asked fer this she pushed out her large lower lip and her face was filled with anger not that i spose any o you lot give a toss just another tart got done theres moren enough tarts in london anyway mebbe its some oly joe cleanin up the place she gave a laugh a little high and sharp and pitt heard the fear in it i doubt it he said sincerely although it was a possibility he had not thought of in this instance it should not be ruled out oh yeah she was curious why not ada were a tart just like the rest of us he did not quibble the use of words he answered honestly there are evidences which suggest it could have been a man of wealth and possibly position she didnt bring him up according to nan he came here and ada let him in sounds as if hed been here before yeah she was surprised and at least to some degree comforted mebbe e were someone as she knew who did she know she considered for a while pitt had asked only out of diligence he still believed it would prove to be finlay fitzjames there was no other likely explanation for the hellfire club badge under the body someone asd kill er she said thoughtfully i spose anyone oo quarreled wiv er id a said some other tart as she pinched a customer from cept shed a fought and thered a bin one ell of a row an i never eard nuffink anyway she shrugged yer might scratch someones eyes aht or if yer was real vicious take a knife ter their faces ter mark em but yerd do it in the street wouldnt yer yerd ave ter bin a real mad bitch ter foller em ome an do it cold like an ada werent that bad that bad he asked but she did take other peoples customers agnes laughed sharply yeah course she did oo wouldnt she were pretty an smart she ad a quick tongue made em laugh some toffs like ter laugh makes em feel less like theyre in the gutter feel like its a real woman them as cant laugh wiv their ladida wives oo are all corsets and starch she lifted her lip in a sneer which still had a remnant of pity in it poor cows probly never ad a decent laugh in their lives aint ladylike ter laugh he said nothing a dozen images crowded through his mind but she would understand few of them and it would serve no purpose trying to explain to her in the house somewhere above them a door slammed and feet rattled down the stairs someone shouted and o course theres them as likes the gutter agnes went on frowning like pigs in muck somethink in it excites em the contempt was thick in her voice jeez if i dint need their bleedin money id stick the bastards meself pitt did not doubt it but it led him nowhere nearer to who had killed ada mckinley without a fight there was no blood in the room and her body was hardly marked except for the coldly deliberately broken fingers and toes there were no scratches no bruising such as would have been caused by a drawnout fight one fingernail on her right hand had been torn that was all who did she know that would have called on her here he repeated i dunno tommy letts mebbe ed come ere or e would ave she dont work for im no more got someone better she said bragged about it jammy bitch could the man you saw have been letts nah she swung her feet es a dirty little weasel black air like rats tails an abaht my size this geezer were tall an thick air wavy all clean like a gent an tommy never ad a coat like that even if e stole it you saw him pitt was surprised nah i never did but rose did an nan taken bad nan were soft cow that doc were good to er for a rozzer e were alf uman she pulled a face young o course ell change there was little more to learn he pressed her about having heard anything but she had been busy with her own clients and the fact that she claimed to have noticed no sounds at all was only indicative that there had been no screams or crashes of knockedover furniture pitt had already assumed as much from the nature of the death and the comparative order of the room whoever had killed ada mckinley had taken her by surprise and it had been quick it had been someone she had trusted pitt left agnes and went back to the corridor outside where ewart was waiting for him ewart glanced at him and saw from his expression that there was no escape no new knowledge to free them from the necessity of going to finlay fitzjames a glimmer of hope faded from his black eyes and he looked smaller somehow narrower although he was a solid man pitt shook his head fractionally ewart sighed the air blew up the stairs from the open door out to the alley lennox waited at the bottom in the shadows his face lit yellowly by the constables bullseye lantern fitzjames he said aloud a curious lift in his voice ewart winced as if he had caught an eagerness in it his teeth ground together he seemed on the edge of saying something then changed his mind and let his breath out in a sigh im afraid so pitt answered ill see him at breakfast therell just be time to go home and wash and shave and eat something myself youd better do the same i shant need you for several hours at least yes sir ewart agreed although there was no relief in his voice the time was put off not removed lennox stared up at pitt his eyes wide shadows on his face in the darkness unreadable but there was a tension in his thin body under the loose jacket and pitt had a momentary vision of a runner about to move he understood his own anger was intense like a whitehot coal somewhere deep inside him he left ewart to post a constable in pentecost alley the room had no lock and it would have been futile to trust to that anyway there were enough picklocks within a hundred yards of the place to make such a gesture useless not that there was much evidence to destroy but the body would have to be removed in a mortuary wagon and lennox would have the grim duty of a closer examination it would be very unlikely to produce anything helpful but it must be done he wondered as he rode home through the earlymorning streetshectic with traffic drays market carts even a herd of sheepwhether ada mckinley had any relatives to receive the news that she was dead anyone who would grieve she would almost certainly have a paupers grave in his own mind the decision was already made that he would go to whatever form of funeral she was given even if it was simply an interment he rode west through spittalfields and st lukes skirting holborn it was quarter past seven bloomsbury was stirring areaways were busy with bootboys and scullery maids smoke trickled from chimneys up into the still air housemaids were starting the fires in breakfast rooms ready for the day when he reached his own house in keppel street and paid off the cabby there was a streak of blue sky eastwards over the city and the breeze was stirring perhaps it would blow the clouds away the front door was already unlocked and as soon as he was inside and had hung up his coat he smelled the warmth and the odor of cooking there was a scamper of feet and jemima arrived at the kitchen door papa she shouted happily and started towards him at a run she was eight years old now and quite conscious of her own dignity and importance but not too ladylike to love to be hugged or to show off she was dressed in a blue underfrock with a crisp white pinafore over it and new boots her hair dark brown and curly like pitts was tied back neatly and she looked scrubbed and ready for school he held out his arms and she ran into them her feet clattering with amazing noise for one so slim and light he was still mildly startled by how loud childrens feet were he hugged her and picked her up quickly she smelled of soap and fresh cotton he refused to think of ada mckinley is your mother in the kitchen he asked putting her down again course she replied daniel lost his stockings so were late but gracies making breakfast are you hungry i am he opened his mouth to tell her she should not repeat tales but she was already leading him towards the kitchen and the moment was gone the whole room was warm and full of the smells of bacon and new bread scrubbed wood and steam from the kettle beginning to sing on the stove their maid gracie was standing on tiptoe to reach the tea caddy which charlotte must inadvertently have put on the middle shelf of the dresser gracie was nearly twenty now but had not grown appreciably since they had acquired her as a waif of thirteen all her dresses still had to be taken up at the bottom and usually lifted at the shoulders and tucked at the waist as well she made a final jump and succeeded only in pushing it to the back of the shelf pitt walked over and picked it up fank you sir she said almost abruptly she had immense respect for pitt and it grew with each new case and she was perfectly used to being helped in such manner but the kitchen was her domain not his one must keep an order in things charlotte came in with a smile her eyes bright to see him but also searching they had been married too long and too closely for him to be able to hide from her the nature of the call he had received or how it had affected him the details he could and would refuse her she looked at him carefully his tired eyes his unshaven cheeks the sadness in the lines around his mouth can you eat she asked gently you should he knew he should yes a little porridge yes please he sat down on one of the smooth hardbacked chairs jemima carried the milk jug over from the larder carefully using both hands it was blueandwhitestriped and the word milk was written on it in block letters the door burst open and sixyearold daniel came in waving his socks triumphantly ive got them he saw pitt with delight too often he was already up and gone before the children came for breakfast papa whats happened arent you going to work today he looked at his mother accusingly is it a holiday you said i have to go to school you do pitt said quickly ive already been to work ive only come back for breakfast because its too early to call on the people i have to see now put your socks and boots on and then sit down and let gracie bring your porridge daniel sat on the floor and pulled on his socks then considered his boots carefully before deciding which one went on which foot finally he climbed onto his chair still regarding his father who are you going to see charlotte was looking at him too waiting a man called fitzjames pitt answered them both he has his breakfast later why daniel said curiously pitt smiled half of daniels conversation consisted of whys ill ask him pitt promised a marmaladestriped kitten came running in from the scullery then stopped suddenly its back arched and took half a dozen steps crabwise its tail bristling a coalblack kitten charged in after it and there were squawks and squeals as they tumbled with each other spitting and scratching harmlessly to the childrens entertainment porridge was ignored and no one argued pitt sat back as jemima disappeared under the table to watch and daniel pushed his chair back so he could see too it was all immensely comfortable trivial and a different world from pentecost alley and the people who lived and died there it was nearly nine oclock when pitt alighted in devonshire street and went to the front door of number thirtyeight the police station at bow street had sent him a messenger with fitzjamess address and a note from ewart to say that he would inform pitt of any further evidence should he discover it he was about to question ada mckinleys pimp and see if he could locate her earlier clients of the evening but he held little hope pitt knocked on the door and stepped back the wind from the east had risen and cleared some of the overcast it was brighter and warmer the morning traffic was no more than the occasional hansom it was too early for ladies to be making calls even upon their dressmakers so there were no private carriages out yet an errand boy strode past whistling and tossing a sixpenny piece reward for his diligence the door opened to reveal a longnosed butler with a surprisingly agreeable expression good morning sir may i help you good morning pitt said quickly taken aback by such pleasantness he pulled out his card more elegant than his old ones stating his name but not his calling police were never welcome no matter how senior i am afraid a matter has arisen in which it is necessary i see mr finlay fitzjames most urgently he explained indeed sir the butler offered his tray it was small and of most exquisitely simple georgian silver and pitt dropped his card onto it the butler stepped back to allow pitt inside into the magnificently paneled hall which was hung with portraits most of them were grimfaced men in the dress of the previous century there were also one or two scenes of farmland and cows grazing under heavy skies which pitt thought if they were originals would be extremely valuable i believe mr fitzjames is taking breakfast sir the butler continued if you would care to wait in the morning room it faces the garden and will not be disagreeable are you acquainted with mr fitzjames sir it was a polite way of asking if fitzjames had the slightest idea who pitt was no pitt confessed unfortunately the matter is urgent and unpleasant or i would not have called without making an appointment i regret it cannot wait just so sir i will inform mr fitzjames and he left pitt in the cool blueandbrown morning room filled with dappled light while he performed his errand pitt looked around he had already been aware even before he had come into the house that the fitzjames family had a great deal of wealth most of it had been acquired through speculation by augustus fitzjames using the money his wife had inherited from her godmother pitt had picked up this piece of information from charlottes younger sister emily who before her present marriage to jack radley had been married to the late lord ashworth she had retained the money he had left her and his aristocratic associates and also an inveterate curiosity for details about people the more intimate the better the fitzjames morning room was extremely comfortable if a little chilly it did not have the usual plethora of glasscased trophies dried flowers and stitched decorations which many families relegated to a room in which they spent little time instead there were two very good bronzes one of a crouching lion the other of a stag bookcases lined the farthest wall and the shafts of sunlight slanting in between the heavy brocade curtains showed not a speck of dust on the gleaming mahogany surfaces pitt walked over and glanced at the titles probably the books fitzjames read were in the library but still it would be interesting to note what he wished his guests to believe he read he saw several histories all of europe or the empire biographies of politicians religious discourses of an orthodox nature and a complete edition of the works of shakespeare bound in leather there were also translations of the works of cicero and caesar there was no poetry and no novels pitt smiled without being aware of it this was how augustus fitzjames wished to be perceived a man of much learning and no levity or imagination it was no more than ten minutes before the butler returned still smiling mr fitzjames regrets he is extremely busy this morning sir but if the matter is as pressing as you say perhaps you would care to join him in the dining room it was not at all what pitt wanted but he had little alternative perhaps when he realized the nature of the enquiry fitzjames would elect to discuss the matter alone thank you pitt accepted reluctantly the dining room was splendid obviously designed to accommodate at least twenty people with ease the velvet curtains framed three deep windows all looking out on to a small very formal garden pitt glimpsed topiary hedges and box trees and a walkway paved in an exact pattern the table was laid with silver porcelain and crisp white linen on the sideboard were dishes of kedgeree another of bacon sausage and kidney and a variety of eggs any one of which would have fed half a dozen people the aroma of them filled pitts nostrils but his mind was forced back to pentecost alley and he wondered if ada mckinley had ever seen as much food as this at one time in her life he must remember fitzjames was not necessarily guilty there were four people at the table and they commanded his attention at the head sat a man of perhaps sixty years narrowheaded with powerful features it was the face of a selfmade man owing no obligation to the past and possibly little to the future it was a face of courage and intolerance he regarded pitt with challenge for having interrupted the domestic peace of his breakfast at his side was a handsome woman also of about sixty her features were marked by patience and a degree of inner control she understood myriad rules and was used to obeying them she might have assumed pitt was a banker or dealer in some commodity she inclined her head courteously but there was no interest whatever in her wideset eyes her son resembled her physically he had the same broad brow wide mouth and squared jaw he was about thirty and already there was the beginning of extra weight about him a fading of the leanness of youth this must be finlay and his magnificent fair wavy hair fitted exactly the description both rose and nan had given the last member of the party was quite different the daughter must have inherited her looks from some ancestor further back she had nothing of her mother in her and little of her father except a rather long nose but on her it was slender giving her face just enough eccentricity to stop it from being ordinarily pretty she had an air of daring and vitality she regarded pitt with acute interest although that might be simply because he had interrupted the usual monotony of breakfast good morning mr pitt the senior fitzjames said coolly looking at pitts card which the butler had offered him what is it that is so urgent you need to address it at this hour it is mr finlay fitzjames i wish to see sir pitt replied still standing since he had not been invited to sit you may address him through me the father replied without reference to finlay possibly he had consulted him before pitt was admitted pitt controlled an impulse to anger he could not yet afford to offend the man this was just conceivably some form of error although he doubted it and if it should prove as he feared and finlay was guilty it must be handled so that there would be not the slightest ground for complaint he had no illusion that fitzjames would not fight to the bitter end to protect his only son and his family name and therein also himself pitt began very carefully he understood only too well why ewart clung to the hope that some other evidence would be turned up to indicate any other answer are you acquainted with a group calling themselves the hellfire club he asked politely why do you wish to know mr pitt fitzjamess eyebrows rose i think you had better explain yourself why should we give you any information about our business this card offers your name and no more yet you say your business is urgent and unpleasant who are you has there been an accident mrs fitzjames asked with concern someone we know fitzjames silenced her with a glare and she looked away as though to tell pitt she did not expect to be answered i am a superintendent in the metropolitan police force pitt replied presently in charge of the bow street station oh my goodness mrs fitzjames was startled and uncertain what she should say she had obviously never been faced with such a situation before she wanted to speak and was afraid to she looked at pitt without seeming to see him finlay was also quite openly amazed i used to be a member of a club which used that name he said slowly his brow furrowed but that was years ago there were only four of us and we disbanded about oh eightyfour somewhere about then i see pitt kept his voice level will you give me the names of these other members please sir have they done something awful miss fitzjames asked her eyes bright with curiosity why do you want to know mrpitt is it it must be very terrible to have sent the head of a police station i think ive only ever seen constables before be quiet tallulah fitzjames said grimly or you will excuse yourself and leave the room she drew breath to plead then saw his expression and changed her mind her mouth pulled tight her eyes down fitzjames dabbed his lips and laid down his napkin i dont know why on earth you should concern me with such a matter at home mr pitt and at this hour of the morning a letter would have sufficed he made as if to stand from the table pitt said with equal sharpness the matter is a great deal more severe than you think i thought it would be more discreet here but i can deal with it at bow street if you prefer it may possibly be explained without that necessity although if that is what you wish of course i shall oblige you the blood darkened fitzjamess narrow cheeks and he rose to his feet as if he could no longer tolerate pitts standing where he was obliged to look up at him he was a tall man and now they were almost eye to eye are you arresting me sir he said through a tight jaw it was not my intention mr fitzjames pitt replied he would not be intimidated by the man once such a pattern was set it would be impossible to break he was in charge of bow street and he owed this man nothing but courtesy and the truth but if that is the way you care to view it then you may take it so fitzjames drew in his breath sharply was about to retaliate then realized the matter must be far more serious than he had originally supposed or pitt could not have had the audacity to speak so i think you had better explain yourself he turned to his son finlay we shall retire to my study we do not need to trouble your mother and sister with this mrs fitzjames shot a pleading look at him but she had been dismissed and she knew better than to argue tallulah bit her lip in frustration but she also kept her peace finlay excused himself then rose and followed his father and pitt from the dining room across the picturehung hall and into a large booklined study there oxbloodred leather chairs surrounded a fireplace with a club fender in brass leather bound also it was a comfortable place for four or five people to sit facing each other and read or talk there was a silver tantalus on a side table and half a dozen books out of the glassfronted cases well fitzjames said as soon as the door was closed why are you here mr pitt i assume there has been an offense or a complaint my son was not involved in it but if he knows anything that may be of assistance to you then naturally he will inform you of such details as you require pitt looked at finlay and could not tell whether he resented his fathers assumption of control or was grateful for it his bland handsome face revealed no deep emotion at all certainly he did not seem afraid there was no purpose in prevarication any longer fitzjames had robbed him of any subtlety of approach and the surprise it might have given him he decided to attack instead there has been a murderthe east end he replied calmly looking at finlay a hellfire club badge was found on the site he had expected fear the flicker of the eyes when the blow falls however expected the sudden involuntary pallor of the skin he saw none of it finlay was emotionally unmoved could have dropped at any time fitzjames said dismissing the news of murder he indicated a chair for pitt to sit in then himself sat directly opposite finlay took a third chair between them to pitts left i assume you consider it necessary to speak to all those who are or have been members fitzjames continued coldly i dispute the necessity do you imagine one of them may have witnessed it his flat eyebrows rose slightly surely if that were so they would already have reported the matter to some police station or other people do not always report what they see mr fitzjames pitt replied for various reasons sometimes they do not realize that it is important other times they are reluctant to admit they were present either because the place itself embarrasses them or else the company with whom they were thereor simply that they had said they were elsewhere of course fitzjames relaxed a trifle in his chair but he still sat forward in it his elbows on either arm his fingers over the ends it was a position of command and control reminiscent of the great statues of the pharaoh ramses drawings and photographs of which were printed in the newspapers with what hours are we concerned yesterday evening from nine until midnight or a little later pitt replied fitzjamess face was under tight control deliberately expressionless he turned to his son we can end this matter very quickly where were you yesterday evening finlay finlay looked embarrassed but resentful rather than afraid as if he had been caught in an indiscretion but no more it was the first threadthin whisper of doubt in pitts mind as to his involvement out i i went out with courtney spender went to a couple of clubs gambled a bit not much thought of going to a music hall and changed our minds he looked at pitt ruefully didnt see any crimes inspector and to be frank havent had anything to do with the other club members in years im sorry to be of no use to you pitt did not bother to correct him as to his rank he was almost certain finlay was lying not only because of the badge but because he so perfectly answered the description of the man rose and nan had both seen there was a faint flush in his cheeks and his eyes met pitts steady and overbright fitzjames moved restively but did not interrupt and finlay did not look at him would you be good enough to give me mr spenders address sir pitt asked politely or better still if he has a telephone we can clear up the matter instantly finlays mouth fell slack i i can give you his address no idea if he has a if he has a telephone i daresay your butler would know pitt said quickly he turned to fitzjames may i ask him fitzjamess face froze are you saying that my son is telling you less than the truth mr pitt i had not thought so pitt said sitting in a mirror position in his own chair hands on the arms finlay sat upright on the edge of his seat fitzjames drew in his breath sharply then changed his mind he reached for the bell i i think that may have been the day before is it yesterday evening we are enquiring about finlay looked confused his cheeks were red and he clenched his hands fidgeting and moving uncomfortably where were you last night sir pitt could not afford to relent ah well to tell you the truth inspector he looked away then back at pitt again i i drank rather too much and i cant remember precisely around the west end i know that werent anywhere near the east end no reason not my sort of place you know were you alone no no of course not then who was with you sir finlay shifted in his seat a little ohvarious peopledifferent times good god i dont keep a list of everyone i see most fellows take a night out occasionally do the odd club and hall you know no i dont suppose you do know he was not sure whether he intended it as an insult or not the uncertainty was clear in his face perhaps you will let me know if you should be fortunate enough to remember pitt said with controlled politeness why finlay demanded i didnt see anything he laughed a little jerkily wouldnt make a decent witness in my state anyway fitzjames finally broke in mr pitt you have come into my home unannounced and at a most inconvenient hour you said there has been a new murder somewhere in the east end a large and nonspecific area you have not told us who is dead nor what it has to do with anyone in this house beyond the fact that a badge has been found of some club or other of which my son was a member several years ago and is not presently to the best of our knowledge it no longer exists you require some better reason to continue to take of our time the murder was in pentecost alley in whitechapel pitt answered he turned again to finlay when did the hellfire club last meet mr fitzjames for gods sake man finlay protested still no more than irritated years ago what does it matter anyone could have dropped a badge in the street orin a club for that matter he gestured with his hands doesnt mean a thing could have been there for i dont know months even years theres rather a sharp pin on it pitt pointed out i think a prostitute would have noticed it in her bed in quite a short time say five minutes at the outside less in this particular circumstance since she was lying on it well where did she say it came from fitzjames said angrily you arent going to take the word of a common whore over that of a gentleman are you any gentleman let alone my son she didnt say anything pitt looked from one to the other she was dead her fingers and toes broken she was drenched with water and then strangled with her own stocking finlay gagged and went putty gray his body slack fitzjames took a very slow deep breath and held it while he steadied himself then let it out in a sigh he was white around the mouth and there were two spots of color in his cheeks he met pitts eyes with a cold defiant stare how regrettable he had difficulty keeping his voice level and under control but it has nothing to do with us he did not take his eyes from pitts as if by strength of will he could mesmerize him finlay you will give the inspector the names and addresses of all those you know to be members of this unfortunate association beyond that we cannot be of assistance pitt looked at finlay the badge we found has your name on it he has already told you that he has not associated with them for years fitzjames said his voice rising no doubt the badge was handed back to whoever was the president in charge of the club and he has since misplaced it it has nothing to do with the identity of whoever killed this unfortunate woman i imagine with an occupation like hers it is a natural hazard pitt waited to allow his anger to subside to make some remark that would crush the unthinking arrogance of the man and make him see ada mckinley and the women like her as he did himself not beautiful not witty or innocent but at least as human as anyone else she had been as capable of hope or pain as his own daughter sitting in the dining room in her gorgeous muslin dress with its lace embroidery her life before her in which she would probably never know hunger or physical fear and her worst social sin wearing the same gown as her hostess or laughing at the wrong joke but there was nothing he could say that would hold any meaning in all the ways they could understand ada mckinley was exactly what fitzjames thought she was of course he said coldly but police do not have the luxury of choosing whose murder they will investigate or where that investigation will lead them he allowed it to be as doubleedged as he intended even if neither man grasped it naturally fitzjames agreed with a frown the conversation seemed to have become pointless it was obvious from his expression he turned to finlay when did you last see this badge if you can recollect finlay looked wretched his extreme discomfort could be attributed to half a dozen possible reasons his distress at being drawn into the murder of a woman of the streets his embarrassment at having been so drunk he could not account for his movements last evening fear at now being in a position where he was going to have to name his friends and draw them in also perhaps it was even the suspicion that one or several of them might actually be involved or simply anticipation of what his father would say to him once pitt had gone i really dont know he faced pitt squarely but still sitting with his arms folded across his upper stomach perhaps it hurt after his indulgence certainly the skin around his eyes was puffy and pitt could well believe his head ached its years ago im sure of that he said unwaveringly five at least he avoided his fathers cold gaze i lost it then i doubt any of my friends had it unless it was accidental a jape or something pitt was perfectly sure there was a lie in it somewhere but when he looked at fitzjames he met a blank wall of denial there was not a shadow or flicker of surprise in him he had expected this answer as if he had known the precise words was it rehearsed the names of the other members pitt asked wearily now his lack of sleep was catching up with him his inner tiredness from too much misery dark streets and alleys which smelled of refuse and hopelessness i require their names mr fitzjames someone had that badge last night and left it under the body of a woman he murdered fitzjames winced with distaste but he did not move except his fingers tightened a fraction on the arm of his chair finlay still looked very pale and white around the mouth as if he might be sick in the corner a standing clock ticked steadily with a heavy resonant tone outside the footsteps of a maid clicked softly across the parquet floor there were only four of us finlay said at last norbert helliwell mortimer thirlstone jago jones and myself i can give you helliwells last address and thirlstones i have no idea where jones is i havent seen or heard of him in years someone said hed taken up the church but they were probably joking jago was a damn good fellow as much fun as anyone more likely gone abroad to america maybe hes the sort of chap who might go westtexas or the barbary coast he tried to laugh and failed if you would write the other two addresses for me pitt requested i dont suppose they can help you perhaps not but it will be somewhere to start pitt smiled the man was seen you know by at least two witnesses he had expected to rattle finlay perhaps even to break him he failed utterly finlays eyes widened was he then you know it wasnt me thank god not that i know such a woman he added hastily it was a lie and not even a good one this time he colored and seemed about to withdraw it it was fitzjames whose face tightened with a lightning flash of uncharacteristic fear gone again the instant it had come his look at pitt now was one of anger perhaps because he thought pitt might have recognized it after all he had caused it and that he would not forgive i doubt it was helliwell or thirlstone either finlay went on to cover the silence but if you insist then youll discover that jago jones i cant answer for because you might find him a great deal harder to trace i dont even know if he has family one doesnt always ask these things if it isnt obvious kinder not to if a fellow comes from nowhere in particular as he seemed to there was not a great deal more pitt could do he considered asking to see the coat finlay had worn yesterday evening but unless he destroyed it the valet could always answer that later there is the matter of a cuff link he said finally a rather distinctive one dropped down the back of a chair in the womans room it has ffj engraved on it and is hallmarked not the sort of thing i think her average customers would possess fitzjames went white his knuckles shone where he gripped the chair arms he swallowed with some difficulty his throat seemed to have contracted as if his collar choked him finlay on the other hand was totally at a loss his handsome blurred face showed nothing but confusion i used to have a pair like that he mumbled my sister gave them to me i lost one but years ago never liked to tell her clumsy of me felt a fool because i knew they were expensive always meant to get another one made so she wouldnt know how did it get in ada mckinleys chair mr fitzjames pitt said with a faint smile god only knows finlay answered as i said i dont frequent places like that ive never heard of her she is the woman who was killed i presume fitzjamess face was dark with anger and contempt for gods sake boy dont be such a damn fool of course youve used women like that in your time he turned to pitt but that cuff link could have been there for years you cant connect it to last night or anything that happened then go and look for these other young men see if you can find out something about the damned woman she was probably killed in a quarrel over money or by a rival in her trade thats where your job is he rose to his feet his joints momentarily stiff as if he had been constricting himself with such a tension of muscles his bones had locked we will write these addresses for you now i must be about my own affairs i am overdue in the city good day to you sir and he walked out without looking behind him leaving pitt alone with finlay finlay hesitated awkwardly he was embarrassed by having not only been caught in a lie but reprimanded for it in front of pitt it was stupid and he had no excuse it was an instinctive act of cowardice the instant will to deny to escape not something for which any man could be proud now he was about to give his friends names and addresses to pitt and that also was something he could not avoid and yet it sat ill with him it would have been so much more honorable more gentlemanly to have been able to refuse ive no idea where jago jones is he said with satisfaction havent seen him for years he could be anywhere he was always a bit of an odd one i daresay someone will know pitt replied with a bleak smile army records or the foreign office perhaps finlay stared at him his eyes wide yes possibly mr helliwell pitt pressed oh yes taviton street number seventeen i think or fifteen thank you pitt took out his notebook and pencil and wrote it down and mr thirlstone cromer street thats off the greys inn road number fortysomething cant recall what sorry pitt wrote that as well thank you finlay swallowed but they wont have had anything to do with this you know i dont know where that damned badge came from but but ill swear it wasnt anything to do with them it was a damn stupid club in the first place a young mans idea of a devilish good time but all very silly really no harm in it just oh he shrugged rather exaggeratedly a little too much to drink gambling rather more than we could afford to lose drinking too much that sort of thing immature i suppose but basically quite decent fellows i expect so pitt agreed halfheartedly a lot of people one presumed decent had darker more callous sides as i said the badge could have gone missing years ago finlay went on frowning staring at pitt with a degree of urgency i cant remember when i last saw mine god knows yes sir pitt said noncommittally thank you for the addresses and he bade him goodbye and took his leave shown out by the stillgenial butler norbert helliwell was not at home he had gone riding in the park early so his butler informed pitt and after a large breakfast had decided to spend the morning at his club that was the regency club in albemarle street although the butler expressed his doubtnot in his words but in his expressionthat it would be acceptable for pitt to call upon him there pitt thanked him and took a cab south and then west towards piccadilly the more he thought about it the less did he feel he would be likely to learn anything of use from norbert helliwell there were aspects of his visit to the fitzjames house which had surprised him he had expected evasion anger possibly embarrassment he was not unprepared to find augustus fitzjames a domineering man willing to defend his son guilty or innocent he sat back in the hansom as it bowled along the busy streets passing all manner of other carriages in the midmorning it was now pleasantly warm the breeze balmy ladies of fashion were taking the air seeing and being seen there was more than one open landau and several gigs a brewers dray lumbered past great shaggy horses gleaming in the sun brasses winking coats satin smooth businessmen about their affairs strode along the pavements faces intent raising their tall hats now and again as they passed an acquaintance it was finlay fitzjames who confused pitt he was lying of that he had no doubt at all but not as he had expected him to lie of course he had known women like ada mckinley to deny it was merely a reflex reaction a selfdefense in front of a stranger and he was profoundly afraid but not of the things he should have been the mention of adas death produced no reaction in him at all except the shallow regret such a thing might have evoked in any such young man could it really be that he regarded her as barely human and the act of killing her produced no shame at all not even the fear that he could in any way be brought to pay for it was the use of a prostitute a little like riding the hounds a gentlemanly sportthe chase was all the kill merely the natural outcome and perhaps foxes were vermin anyway his thoughts were interrupted by his arrival at the entrance of the regency club he alighted paid the cabby and crossed the pavement to go up the steps are you a member sir the doorman enquired his face was expressionless but the overemphasized enquiry in his voice made it profoundly plain that he knew pitt was not no pitt replied forcing himself to smile i require to speak to one of your members about a matter of delicacy and extreme unpleasantness perhaps you would convey that message to him and then find some place where i may do it in private and avoid the embarrassment for him of approaching him in public the doorman regarded him as if he were a blackmailer pitt kept his smile i am from the police he added the bow street station i see the doorman did not see at all pitt was not what he expected of such persons if you please pitt said a trifle more sharply my business is with mr norbert helliwell his butler informed me he was here yes sir the doorman could see no other way of dealing with a deplorable situation which was threatening to get completely out of hand he instructed the steward to show pitt to a small side room possibly kept for such needs he could not be left in the hallway where he might speak to other members and make the matter even worse the steward did so then turned on his heel and went to inform helliwell of his visitor norbert helliwell was in his early thirties of very ordinary appearance he could have been mistaken for any young man of good family and comfortable means good morning sir he came in and closed the door prebble tells me there has been some unpleasantness with which you think i can help you do sit down he waved directly to one of the chairs and sat comfortably in the one opposite it what is it pitt had never seen a man look less guilty i can give you ten minutes helliwell went on magnanimously then i am afraid i have to meet my wife and motherinlaw theyve been shopping the ladies like to do that you know he shrugged no perhaps you dont but they can get very upset if left waiting not proper at all gets oneself misunderstood sure you can see that only two sorts of women what he smiled at least waiting around the streets there are remember that perfectly awful business of that perfectly respectable woman arrested out shopping there was derision in his voice and indeed the case did not reflect well on the police then i shall come immediately to the point pitt replied aware that he was gaining an opinion of this man too rapidly he was allowing the mans assumptions to make him also prejudge were you once a member of a young gentlemens association known as the hellfire club helliwell was startled but there was no alarm in his bland selfconfident face a long time ago why has someone resurrected it he shrugged very slightly not very original im afraid rather obvious sort of name when one thinks of it speaks of regency dandies a bit dont you think he leaned back and crossed his legs much more fashionable to be an aesthete now if you have the emotional energy personally i couldnt be bothered to stir up so much passion about art too busy with life he laughed very slightly was there an edge to his voice or did pitt imagine it used you to have a badge about so big pitt held up his finger and thumb half an inch apart enamel on gold with your name engraved on the back i really dont recall helliwell said meeting his eyes unblushingly i suppose we might have why what on earth can it matter now it was years ago havent met since he drew in his breath he was definitely a trifle paler now i dont know well before i was married six years at least he smiled again showing excellent teeth bachelors sort of thing you know so i imagine pitt agreed do you still have your badge he overlooked helliwells uncertainty as to whether there had been one at all no idea he looked startled and even slightly amused shouldnt think so why look youd better explain what this is all about so far you havent said anything remotely urgent or important you told the doorman it was a matter of unpleasantness either come to the point or i shall have to leave you he took out a heavy gold watch on an equally heavy gold chain and looked at it ostentatiously i must go in three minutes anyway a woman was murdered last night and a hellfire club badge was found underneath her body pitt replied watching his eyes his face helliwell swallowed convulsively but he did not lose his composure it was a moment or two before he answered im very sorry but if it is my badge then i can assure you i had nothing whatever to do with it i was dining with my fatherinlaw and went straight home in the carriage my wife will attest to that as will my own servants who was she his voice was growing firmer as he continued his color was returning was it my badge the least i can do is to determine where i lost it or if it was stolen although i doubt it will be much use it could have been years ago no sir it was not your badge but helliwell rose to his feet anger flushing his cheeks then what in the devil are you doing bothering me he demanded this is outrageous sir so whose he stopped abruptly one hand in the air yes pitt enquired rising to his feet also ill walk with you you were going to say whose helliwell gulped whose badge was it he went a step towards the door i understand there were only four of you pitt continued is that correct ah helliwell quite transparently considered lying and then abandoned it yes yes thats right at least in my time i left inspector er superintendent more could have joined after of course he forced a smile pitt went to the door and opened it holding it for him i mustnt delay you from meeting your wife and motherinlaw no well sorry i couldnt help helliwell went through and continued on across the hallway to the front door nodding to the doorman pitt followed him half a step behind what can you tell me about the other members in your time he asked helliwell went through the door and down the steps oh nothing much decent fellows all a bit older and wiser now of course he dismissed the whole idea he did not ask again whose badge it had been mortimer thirlstone pitt increased his step to keep up with him on the pavement as helliwell strode out in the sun along albemarle street towards piccadilly walking so fast he all but bumped into passersby a landau with three ladies taking the air did not outpace him havent seen him in a dogs age helliwell said breathlessly really couldnt say how hes doing finlay fitzjames helliwell stopped abruptly causing a gentleman in striped trousers two paces behind him to trip and cannon into him im sorry the man said although it was manifestly helliwells fault i say sir do take a little care what helliwell was startled he had been unaware of anyone but himself and pitt oh in your way for heavens sake go around me the man set his hat straight glared for a moment then swinging his umbrella proceeded on his way finlay fitzjames pitt repeated youll have to speak to him yourself helliwell said swallowing again i daresay he lost his badge years ago no need to keep it now you really must excuse me i can see my family on the corner there he swung his arm to where a carriage was indeed slowing up and a very well dressed young woman was looking towards them an older couple of immense dignity sat well back comfortably in the seat beside her the gentleman facing backwards the ladies forwards pitt inclined his head towards them and they nodded in reply helliwell was left with no alternative but either to take pitt forward and introduce him or to dismiss him with what could only be construed as the utmost rudeness which he would then have had to explain helliwell swore under his breath and made his decision he strode forward a fixed smile on his face his voice artificially hearty my dear adeline mamainlaw papainlaw what an excellent day may i introduce mr pitt we met by chance in my club a few acquaintances in commonin the past not the present mr pitt my wife and my parentsinlaw mr and mrs joseph alcott introductions performed helliwell made as if to climb into the carriage and mr jago jones pitt said cheerfully can you tell me where i might be able to find him not the slightest idea helliwell said instantly sorry old chap havent seen him in years a trifle eccentric an acquaintance of chance rather than any common bond you understand cant help you at all he put his hand onto the carriage door and mr thirlstone pitt pressed was he an acquaintance of chance also before helliwell could answer his wife leaned forward looking first at her husband then at pitt do you mean mortimer thirlstone sir no not chance at all we know him quite well indeed wasnt he at lady woodvilles soiree the other evening he was with violet kirk i remember distinctly there is some talk that they may become betrothed quite soon i know that because she told me so herself you shouldnt speak of it my dear helliwell said huskily his face reddening not until it is announced it could cause profound embarrassment what if it were not true after all he opened the door and was about to climb in when his wife spoke across him again still addressing pitt she had a charming face and the most beautiful brown hair did i hear you ask for the whereabouts of mr jago jones adeline asked pitt yes maam pitt said quickly are you acquainted with him no but im sure miss tallulah fitzjames could tell you he used to be a close friend of her brother finlay whom we all know she glanced at helliwell whose answering look should have frozen her she kept her sunny smile on pitt i am sure if you were to ask her and explain to her how important it is to you she would be able to help she is a delightful creature and most kind she is a flighty young woman with whom i should rather you did not associate mr alcott said suddenly you are too generous in your opinions my dear you should listen a little more to what people say mrs alcott added then you would know that her reputation is becoming less attractive as she grows older and does not marry i am sure she must have had offers she made a delicate gesture with one gloved hand her father has money her mother has breeding and the girl herself is certainly handsome enough in her way if she does not marry soon people will begin to speculate as to why not i agree helliwell said hastily far better you are no more than civil to her if you should happen to meet which is unlikely she moves with a set you would have nothing to do with i think flighty is a very kind word mamainlaw i should have chosen one less flattering his tone was final he turned to pitt delightful to have met you sir he swung up into the carriage and closed the door good day to you and he signaled the driver to proceed leaving pitt standing on the footpath in the sun superficially mortimer thirlstone was a vastly different man he was tall and lean and affected a manner and dress of an artist his long hair was parted in the center he wore a soft silk shirt and widely flowing cravat tied meticulously and a casual jacket but he had the same easy air of confidence as helliwell as if he knew he looked well and was perfectly comfortable that his appearance would continue to earn him the courtesy to which he was accustomed he stood in the center of the pathway that wound gently through regents park towards the botanical gardens he stared upwards into the hazy sunshine with a smile on his face it had taken pitt since midmorning to find him and only by dint of persistent enquiry had he succeeded mr thirlstone he enquired although he was already certain of his identity indeed sir thirlstone answered without lowering his gaze is it not a magnificent afternoon can you smell the myriad aromas of the flowers indigenous and exotic which lie just beyond our gaze what a marvelous thing is nature we appreciate it far too little she has given us senses and what do we do largely ignore them sir largely ignore them what can i do for you apart from bringing you to mind of your olfactory perceptions some years ago i believe you used to belong to an organization known as the hellfire club pitt began organization thirlstone lowered his head then looked at pitt with amusement hardly sir organized it never was i abhor organization it is the antithesis of pleasure and creativity it is mans puny attempt to lay his mark on a universe he cannot begin to comprehend it is pathetic a bumblebee meandered lazily by he watched it with delight nature organizes he continued we merely watch in profound ignorance and usually fear awe sir that is proper fear is stultifying the difference is the span of all pure feeling what about it pitt was lost the hellfire club sir thirlstone explained what about it folly of youth personally i have moved on woken to the better pursuits of life did you want to join he shrugged his face lifted again to the sun i cannot help you start one of your own dont wait for others begin anew try some of the gambling clubs horse races music halls houses of ill repute and so on youll find likeminded men pick and choose as you will that was the sort of place you frequented pitt tried very hard to make his voice sound interested and yet not naive he knew he failed it was an impossible task thirlstone lowered his gaze and stared at him as if he were some rare plant he had just observed what else would you expect sir horticulture poetry if your taste is not to drinking gambling fine horses and willing women what do you want with a hellfire club the charade had been brief and it was over the names of the original members a summary of their present whereabouts pitt replied still a trifle mendaciously thirlstones eyes widened in amazement my dear fellow whatever for it disbanded or should i say dissolved of its own accord years ago it can be no possible use to you now a butterfly drifted past them fluttering in the sun far in the distance a dog barked a hellfire club badge was found under the body of a murdered woman last night pitt replied good god how extraordinary thirlstones black eyebrows shot up wrinkling his brow dramatically why does it concern you are you related to her im fearfully sorry he extended his hand in a gesture of sympathy no no im not pitt said with some awkwardness then youre not police are you you dont look like police you are he seemed almost amused as if the fact had some esoteric humor of its own how unutterably squalid what in heavens name do you want from me i know nothing about it who was she her name was ada mckinley she was a prostitute thirlstones face showed a trace of pity something lacking in finlay fitzjames and helliwell then suddenly he was absolutely sober the slight air of banter vanished completely under his superficial manner his concentration was total his eyes were narrowed his body motionless so that suddenly pitt was aware of the breeze and the slight stirring of the flowers there were only four of us superintendent and each badge had a name on it thirlstones voice was so level it was unnatural are you saying it was my badge you found no sir thirlstones body relaxed and he could not keep a flood of relief from his face im glad i havent seen it for years he swallowed but one never knows he regarded pitt with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension whose was it i i cannot believe any of us would be so foolish as to he did not complete his sentence but his meaning hung in the air unmistakably a young couple walked past a dozen yards away their footsteps crunching on the gravel i have already spoken to mr fitzjames and mr helliwell pitt said almost casually but i have not been able to find jago jones it would hardly be jago this time there was complete conviction in thirlstones voice why not my dear fellow if you knew jago you wouldnt need to ask i dont know him why not oh thirlstone shrugged spreading his hands helplessly perhaps i dont know as much as i imagine its your job to find out thank god not mine where would i find mr jones pitt did not expect an answer he did not receive one only a shrug and a bemused look no idea im afraid none whatsoever in the streets in the slums thats the last thing i remember hearing him say but i have no notion if he meant it thirlstone lifted his face to the sun again and pitt was effectively dismissed he walked back past an army officer on leave splendidly dressed in red coat and immaculate trousers buttons gleaming to the excitement of several young ladies in pastel dresses all muslin and lace and the envy of a nursemaid in a white starched apron wheeling a perambulator the noise of a barrel organ drifted from somewhere beyond the trees at four oclock pitt had eaten a late luncheon but he was so tired his eyes felt gritty and his head ached from lack of sleep he had no real belief that jago jones might somehow have dropped finlay fitzjamess belongings in pentecost alley but he must prove it were it only for elimination it was not impossible he returned to devonshire street and asked the genial butler if he could speak to miss tallulah fitzjames he knew it was a time of day when she might quite easily be at home before dressing for the evening and going out to dine and be entertained she came into the morning room in a swirl of soft fabric of so pale a pink it was almost white a blush pink rose at her waist long satin ribbons hanging had her face been rounder less full of intelligence and will the effect would have been cloyingly innocent as it was it presented a challenging contrast and from the way she stopped just inside the door and leaned against the knob pitt was quite certain she knew it well she said in surprise you back again i heard about that poor creatures death but you cant possibly imagine finlay could have anything to do with it its too preposterous i mean why should he mama would like to think he never goes near such places but then ones parents tend to be rather like the very best carriage horses dont they work excellently together as long as the harness lasts look very good in town are the admiration of ones friends and cant see a thing except whats directly in front of them we blinker ours to keep their attention from straying or have them take fright at things on the footpath pitt smiled in spite of himself actually it was the address of mr jago jones i came for he saw her body stiffen under its silk and muslin gown and her slim shoulders set rigid he could imagine her hands clenched at the doorknob behind her very slowly she straightened up and came towards him why do you think jago did it you cant know how ridiculous that is but i assure you id sooner suspect the prince of wales come to think of itmuch sooner you have a very high regard for mr jones pitt said with surprise not especially she turned away and the sunlight caught her unusual profilenose a little too big mouth wide and full of laughter and emotion dark eyes bright hes hes rather proper actually something of a bore she still looked studiously out of the window at the sun on the leaves beyond but he couldnt do anything like that she went on hes about finlays age and when finlay was in his twenties and i was about sixteen jago was fun he could tell the best jokes because he could make his face look like all the different characters and his voice too she shrugged elaborately as if it could be of no possible interest to her but hes religious now all good works and saving souls she swung around to look at pitt why does the church make people such crashing bores the church pitt did not hide his surprise didnt you know no i suppose you didnt finlay was stupid pretending he didnt know the hellfire club anymore i suppose it might be his idea of protecting them it must be norbert helliwell or mortimer thirlstone if its any of them she shook her head slightly it wouldnt be jago and of course it wasnt finlay most likely the woman stole it and then someone else killed her it seems fairly obvious doesnt it her eyes challenged him why would one of the other members have finlays badge anyway if they wanted one they had their own not on purpose pitt explained but the engraving on the back is very small and very fine it would be easy enough to pick up someone elses in error oh she breathed in deeply the sheer silk draped across her shoulders and bosom rising the light gleaming in it yes of course i hadnt thought of that where would i find mr jones saint marys church whitechapel pitt drew in his breath sharply he knew st marys it was a few hundred yards from pentecost alley old montague street ran parallel to the whitechapel road before it turned into mile end i see thank you miss fitzjames why do you look like that saint marys means something to you i can see it in your face you know it there was no point in lying to her the woman was killed in an alley off old montague street is that close she was too anxious to be offended that he might think her familiar with such an area yes oh she turned away again presenting a silkswathed shoulder to him well you wont find jago jones involved he couldnt be after a woman like that except to save her soul there was a sudden hurt in her voice almost bitterness i presume she wasnt bored to death no miss fitzjames she was strangled she winced if i could help you i would she said quietly but i really dont know anything youve given me mr joness address which i appreciate thank you for seeing me at what must be an inconvenient time good evening she did not reply but stood in the middle of the floor staring at him as he went to the door and let himself out it took him until after six to get back to whitechapel and the church of st marys when he did the verger told him the vicar was out somewhere down coke street way helping the sick if pitt did not find him there he could go in the other direction and try chicksand street the lowering sun was hidden by the high grimy tenement houses but the pavements still gave back the claustrophobic heat and the sour smells of the day the gutters ran sluggish trickles of waste this was whitechapel where two years ago about this season a madman had murdered and ripped open five women leaving their bleeding bodies in the street no one had ever found him he had disappeared as completely as if hell had opened up and swallowed him back yet walking towards coke street pitt could see women standing in doorways and alleyway entrances with that peculiar air of readiness that marked them as prostitutes it was a directness in their eyes an angle to the hips quite different from the weary dejection of women at the end of a days labor in a sweatshop or factory or bringing wet laundry in and out of boilers twisting the dolly and heaving and wringing the sheets were they afraid but so hungry they did not care or had they already forgotten the ripper and the terror of him which had paralyzed london a young woman approached him her wide brown eyes looking him up and down her skin still country fresh he felt suddenly sick and angry for her that she was reduced to this whether by circumstances beyond her or immorality within he controlled himself with an effort im looking for the reverend jones he said grimly have you seen him her face settled in resignation yeah es round the corner she jerked her hand to indicate the direction want your soul saved too do you good luck to yeri can earn me own dinner and cheaper at the price and with that he lost her attention and she sauntered off towards the whitechapel road and some likely custom pitt did not know what he expected of jago jonesperhaps some dilettante priest seeking a dramatic gesture or a younger son unsuited for the military who had chosen the church instead this might be a first step towards a major preferment in the future whatever dim prejudgment had been in his mind he was unprepared for the man he met in coke street ladling hot thick soup out of a churn into tin mugs for a crowd of skinny children several of them dancing from one foot to the other in anticipation jago jones was dressed in shapeless black clothes no flash of white clerical collar was visible but such things were immaterial anyway his face was too arresting for a uniform of any sort to matter he was lean to the point of being almost gaunt his thick hair swept back above dark brows and eyes of extraordinary intensity his nose was strong highbridged his cheekbones accentuated by the deep lines around his mouth it was the face of a man burning with his own emotions and so certain of his course that nothing would deflect him he looked across at pitt with interest jago jones pitt asked although he had no doubt yes what can i do for you he did not stop ladling the soup and passing the full tin mugs to the children are you hungry it was an offer but not really an enquiry one glance at pitts clothes not only their quality but their cleanliness and the fact that they were in good repair placed him beyond the kind of need joness parishioners knew thank you pitt said but it would be better used as it is jago smiled and continued he was nearly at the bottom of his supply and the end of his queue then what is it you need me for my name is thomas pitt then the minute he had said it he wondered why he had introduced himself that way as if it were a friendship he was expecting not a policeman on duty interviewing a witness possibly a suspect how do you do jago jones bowed very slightly jago jones reverend at least in spirit if not in manner you dont belong here what brings you the murder of ada mckinley in pentecost alley last night pitt replied watching his face jago sighed and dispensed the last of the soup to a grateful urchin the boys large eyes were on pitts face but hunger was more pressing than curiosity even though he could sense a rozzer when he saw one i was afraid so jago said sadly seeing the urchin off poor creature its a hard occupation destructive of both body and soul although not usually as quickly or as violently as this and it seems on this occasion at least as if it were someone elses soul in greater jeopardy than hers she was not a bad woman a little greedy at times but she had courage and laughter and a kind of loyalty to her own ill see she has a decent burial youll bury her from saint marys pitt said with surprise jagos face hardened if you object to that mr pitt i suggest you take it up with god he will decide who can be forgiven their faults and weaknesses and who cannot it is not your prerogative and i know it is not mine pitt smiled quite honestly for which i am profoundly grateful he said but you are unusual mr jones i hope your parishioners will not cause you difficulty but perhaps they are too close to the questionable lines of survival and morality to judge one another jago snorted and made no comment but his anger softened and he released the tension in his body as he put away the ladle and the soup container into the handcart behind him half a dozen urchins mugs in hand were creeping back to stand on the corner staring the word had gone out there was a rozzer asking questions information was precious did you come to ask me about ada jago said after a moment or two i dont know what i can tell you that would be of use it was probably some customer whose own inner devils broke from their usual control and temporarily overcame him many of us deal badly with our pain or our need to feel as if we are in control of the world even if we cannot control ourselves pitt was taken aback not by the remark but by the fierceness with which it had been made there was a depth of feeling behind it a perception as if he were not angry with such a man for the senseless moments outrage but from a deep thought which had lain within him a long time was it perhaps a selfexamination the idea was suddenly and violently repugnant to pitt but he could not avoid it it could have been he said quietly jago was still looking at him his eyes steady is that what youre following it seems the most likely but not the only possibility jago leaned against the cart why are you telling me this mr pitt all i can tell you about ada is what you probably already guess she was an ordinary prostitute like a hundred thousand others in london when girls are thrown out of domestic work or unfit for it in the first place cant take the sweatshops and match factories or dont want to then they sell the only thing theyve got their bodies his eyes did not waver from pitts its a sin to me a crime to you but to them its survival i dont know whose fault this is and frankly im too close to it to care all i see is individual women battling for the next meal this weeks roof and not to get beaten by their customers or their pimps or slashed by a rival from another patch hope to god they can put off the time they get some disease theyll probably die young and they know it society despises them half the time they despise themselves ada was just one more a woman walked past with a bag of laundry on her hip did you know her personally pitt moved over and leaned on his elbow resting his weight on the other end of the barrow he was appallingly tired he should have accepted the soup yes jago gave a tight smile but im not privy to her client list most of them are casual anyway the one youre looking for could be from anywhere occasionally shed go to the west end its not so far she was handsome she could have picked up someone from piccadilly or the haymarket or for that matter it could be a sailor from the port of london passing through thank you pitt said tartly it was time he said what he had really come for the longer he evaded it the harder it would be actually i came to you because you used to belong to a gentlemans association called the hellfire club underneath his shapeless jacket jago was rigid his face in the waning light was curiously stiff that was a long time ago he said quietly and not something of which i am proud what has it to do with adas death the club disbanded six or seven years back ada wasnt even here then when did she come about five years ago why i dont think it really makes any difference pitt confessed i think it is exactly as you say a man whose violence and need is his own and has nothing to do with her except that she was the one to provoke it or perhaps she was merely there at the wrong time and it would have happened to whoever the woman was it might have been her face her hair a gesture a tone in her voice that jarred loose some memory in him and he lost control of the hatred there was inside him and destroyed her fear jago said his mouth tightening fear of failure fear of not being what you want what other people want he saw pitts face and thought he read something in it or perhaps he expected to i dont mean a simple fear of impotence i mean a spiritual fear of being weak to the very soul the fear which makes you hate because you are too selfobsessed to love too consumed by rage that you are not what you wished that the road is harder the price tougher than you thought pitt said nothing ideas raced through his mind as to how much jago jones was speaking of himself his demands and expectations of his role as priest had he needed a woman and used a prostitute because all decent women were closed to him in his chosen role had she then mocked him in her own disillusion he could hardly be the vehicle of god to her when she had seen his fall from his selfimposed virtue was this strange confrontation a kind of admission of guilt we found a hellfire club badge under her body he said in the pool of silence in the street noises of wheels horses and a man shouting from beyond the crossroads sounded remote in another existence not mine jago said carefully i threw mine in the river years ago why have you come to me mr pitt i dont know anything about it if i did i should have come to you you would not have needed to look for me pitt was not sure if he would or not jago jones had the face of a man who followed his own conscience whatever the law and whatever the cost had it been one of his parishioners confessing in terror or remorse he doubted jago jones would have come with it to bow street or anywhere else i know it wasnt yours he said aloud it was finlay fitzjamess it was too dark to see the color of jagos face but the sudden jerk of his head the haggard look in his eyes and mouth betrayed the emotion which tore at him the silence was unbroken heavy like the gathering darkness what horror was filling jagos mind the death of a woman he knew made suddenly more vivid fear for his erstwhile friends peril his embarrassment or guilt because perhaps he had done as thirlstone had suggested and accidentally picked up finlays badge instead of his own and left it at the scene of the crime you dont protest his innocence mr jones pitt said very quietly does that mean you are not surprised it it doesnt jago swallowed it doesnt mean anything mr pitt except that i was grieved i dont believe finlay guilty but i cant offer any explanation that would be of value to you and certainly not any you wont already have thought of yourself he shifted his weight a little perhaps finlay was there at some other time and dropped the badge although im surprised he still wore it very surprised indeed perhaps he even gave it to ada in in payment the fact that she had it does not necessarily mean she obtained it that night you are struggling to be loyal to a friend mr jones pitt replied wearily which i respect but i do not agree of course i shall pursue every piece of evidence and every meaning it could have if you should think of anything more about ada mckinley or anything that happened last night please let me know leave a message at the bow street station bow street jagos dark eyebrows rose not whitechapel i work from bow street superintendent pitt a bow street superintendent why are you concerned with the murder of a whitechapel prostitute his voice dropped and there was a ripple of fear in it do you fear we have another ripper pitt shivered cold in the center of his stomach no i was called in because of the evidence implicating mr fitzjames its too slender jago swallowed hard again his eyes on pitts face almost pleading a man answering his description was seen by two witnesses at exactly the right time and with ada jago looked as if pitt had struck him oh god he sigheda prayer not a blasphemy reverend jones do you know something which you should tell me no the word came from a dry throat stiff lips pitt wanted to believe him and could not the honesty which had been between them had vanished like the yellow in the sky over the rooftops the lamplighter had passed unnoticed the gaslit moons made bright intervals along the way back towards the whitechapel road and the route home can i help you with the cart pitt said practically no thank you im used to it and it isnt heavy jago refused moving at last and bending to pick up the handles they walked side by side up coke street and turned the corner towards st marys neither of them spoke again until they reached it and parted then it was a simple farewell pitt arrived home in bloomsbury tired and unusually depressed he ate the dinner which charlotte had kept for him then afterwards sat in the parlor with the french doors to the garden ajar the warmth of the day fading rapidly and the smell of cut grass filling the air charlotte sat under the lamp sewing she had asked him about the case which had taken him out so early and kept him so late he had told her only that it was a murder in whitechapel and that the evidence implicated someone of importance and therefore was politically explosive he sat watching her now the light on her hair which was clean and bright coiled on her head shining like mahogany in the highlights almost black in the shadows her skin was smooth a faint blush in her cheek she looked comfortable her gown was old rose and became her as much as anything she owned her fingers worked stitching and pulling threading back into the cloth again the needle catching silver as it moved they were only a few miles from whitechapel as the sparrow flew yet it was a world so distant it was beyond imagination charlottes world was safe clean its values secure honesty was easy and chastity hardly a challenge she was loved and she could surely never have doubted it she had no compromises to make no judgments of value against survival no weariness of soul endless doubt and fear and selfdisgust no wonder she smiled as she sat what would jago jones think of her would he find her unendurably selfsatisfiedunforgivably comfortable in her ignorance charlotte pulled the needle in and out watching because she could not work otherwise she wanted to have something to do with her hands it was easier the day had been long she had woken when pitt did and not really gone back to sleep again her sister emily had called in the middle of the morning she had said little of any importance but there was a restlessness in her which was uncharacteristic it was not one of unused energy but rather of seeking something she could not find or perhaps even name she was critical and had taken offense at several remarks which were not meant unkindly that was unlike her charlotte had wondered if it was the difficulty of having their grandmother resident in the house since their mother had remarried grandmama had refused to stay under the same roof with carolines new husband he was an actor and several years carolines junior the fact that they were extremely happy only added to the offense but emilys dissatisfaction was not particular and she left without explaining herself now pitt was sitting brooding silently his brow furrowed his mouth pulled down she knew it was the case which troubled him his silence had a particular quality she had grown used to over the years he was sitting crookedly in his chair one leg crossed over the other when he was relaxed he put his feet on the fender whatever the time of the year and whether the fire was lit or not on a summer evening like this were he not absorbed in his thoughts he would have walked to the end of the lawn under the apple tree and stood there breathing in the quiet scented air he would have expected her to go with him if they had talked at all it would have been of trivia several times she had considered asking him about it but his expression was closed in and he had offered nothing he did not want to speak of it perhaps he did not want its ugliness or its threat to intrude into their home this was the one place where he could be free of it or if not totally free then at least if it were mentioned at all it would be of his own choosing and not hers she knew he had been to whitechapel and she knew what it was like he could not have forgotten the numerous times when she had seen slum tenements smelled the stinking gutters the dark narrow houses with their generations of filth seeped into the walls the tired hungry and anxious people but in order to help one had to keep ones own strength agonizing for people accomplished nothing useful to help the masses one needed laws and change of heart in those with power to affect an individual one needed knowledge and perhaps money or some appropriate skill above all one needed nerve and judgment one needed all ones own emotional strength so she sat quietly and sewed waiting until pitt was ready to share with her whatever it was that bothered him or to deal with it by at least temporarily forgetting and allowing himself to restore his spirit with what was good emily radley charlottes sister about whom she had been concerned was indeed dispirited it was not a specific problem she had everything she considered necessary to be happy indeed she had more her husband was charming handsome and treated her with affection she was unaware of any serious fault in him when they had met he had been wellborn living largely on his value as a lively delightful companion and guest his exquisite manners and his ready wit emily had been fully aware of the risks entailed in falling in love with him he might prove shallow spendthrift even boring after the first novelty had passed she had done it just the same she had spent many hours telling herself how foolish she was and that there was even a high possibility he sought her primarily for the fortune she had inherited from her first husband the late lord ashworth she smiled as she thought of george memory was very powerful a strange mixture of sadness loss sweetness for the times that had been good and a deliberate passing over of those which had not all her fears had proved groundless far from being shallow jack had developed a social conscience and a considerable ambition to effect changes in society he had campaigned for a seat in parliament and after his first defeat had returned to battle and at the second attempt had won now he spent a considerable amount of his time and his emotions in political endeavor it was emily herself who seemed a little trivial a little spendthrift edward her son and georges heir was in the schoolroom with his tutor and baby evangeline was upstairs in the nursery where the maid was caring for her seeing to the laundry the feeding the changing emily herself was largely unnecessary it was late in the morning and jack had long since departed to the city to various engagements before the house of commons met watching him fight for his selection then campaign lose and campaign again she had gained a respect for him which added very greatly to her happiness he was consolidating his position with skill so why was she standing in the sun in the great withdrawing room in her lovely town house dressed in lace and coffeecolored tussore and feeling such a sense of frustration edward was in the schoolroom evie was upstairs in the nursery jack was in the city no doubt fighting for reform of some law he believed outdated cook would be with the butler preparing luncheon they would not need to serve dinner tonight emily and jack were due to dine out she had already asked her maid to prepare her clothes for the occasion she had a new silk gown of dark forest green trimmed with ivory and pale gold flowers which complemented her fair skin and hair she would look beautiful she had seen the housekeeper the accounts were attended to her correspondence was up to date there was nothing to say to the butler she wondered what charlotte was doing probably something domestic cooking or sewing since pitts promotion she could afford more help but there was still much she was obliged to attend to herself what about pitt his world was completely different he would be investigating a crime perhaps only theft or forgery but possibly something much darker his problems would be urgent to do with passions violence greed he would be using the skill and imagination he possessed working until he was exhausted seeking to unravel the tangle of events and find the truth to understand the good and the evil to bring some sort of justice to it or at least a resolution in the past she and charlotte had helped him in the pursuit of the hyde park headsman they had contributed a great deal she smiled without being aware of it the sunlight streamed through the long windows onto a bowl of late delphiniumsthe second bloomingcatching their blue and purple spires it had taken jack a little while to forgive her for the risks she had run in that affair she could hardly blame him she could have been killed she had known better than to offer any excuses just apologies if only something would arise in which she and charlotte could help again lately she had hardly even seen pitt since his promotion he seemed to have been involved in cases which concerned more impersonal crimes crimes whose motives lay outside her world such as the treason in the foreign office just a month or two ago what are we having for luncheon a querulous voice demanded from behind her you havent bothered to tell me in fact you dont tell me anything i might as well not be here emily turned around to see the short black figure of her grandmother standing just inside the doorway from the hall the old lady had been obliged to move from her own home when emilys mother had remarried and since charlotte had not room for her and emily had abundant room and means there had been no reasonable alternative it was not an arrangement either of them cared for emily because the old lady was extraordinarily illtempered and the old lady because she had determined that she would not on principle it was not her own choice well she demanded i dont know what is for luncheon emily replied i left it to cook to decide seems to me you dont do anything around here the old lady snapped coming forward into the room leaning heavily on her cane banging it down it was a borderpainted wooden floor and she disapproved of it too ornate she said plain wood was quite good enough she was dressed entirely in black a permanent reminder to everyonein case they should forgetthat she was a widow and should be regarded and sympathized with as such cook rules your kitchen housekeeper runs your servants she said critically butler runs your pantry and cellar ladies maid decides what youll wear tutor teaches your son nursemaid looks after your daughter all that done for you and you still cannot find time to come and talk to me you are thoroughly spoilt emily comes of marrying above your station first and beneath it next i dont know what the worlds coming to im sure you dont emily agreed you never did know much about it you assumed one half and ignored the other the old lady was aghast she drew herself to her full but negligible height what did you say her voice was shrill with indignation if you wish to know what is for luncheon grandmama ring down to the kitchen and ask if you would care for something different i expect they can accommodate you extravagance the old lady clicked her teeth disapprovingly eat whats put in front of you in my day its a sin to waste good food and with that parting shot she turned and stumped out of the room her heavy feet echoed on the polished parquet of the hallway at least this way they had avoided discussing carolines latest whereabouts and the general selfishness of her having remarried and thrown everyones lives into consequent disarray nor had there been another diatribe about actors in general or jewish actors in particular and how they were if such a thing were possible socially even more of a disaster than policemen the only thing good about it in the old ladys vociferous opinion was that at least at carolines age there would be no children no doubt at least one if not all of these subjects would arise over the luncheon table emily spent the afternoon writing letters more for something to do than any necessity and then went upstairs to spend a little time in the nursery with evie and then with edward she heard from him of his latest lessons and his elaborate plans to build a model castle like the one the knights templar had built in the holy land during the crusades jack came home a little after five he had been in the city all day but there was still a spring in his step when he came into the withdrawing room leaving the door swinging behind him excellent day he said enthusiastically bending to kiss her brow and touch her hair gently i think i might really have got old fothergill on my side i had luncheon with him today i took him to that new restaurant in the strand more expensive than it was worth but the decor is gorgeous and he was suitably impressed he sat sideways on the arm of one of the chairs letting his leg swing the thing is he went on he actually listened to me i was explaining about the importance of nonfeepaying education for the whole population as an investment in the industrial base jack had been fighting to obtain better education for the poor ever since his entry into parliament emily had watched its future wax and wane im very pleased she was pleased but she found it hard to invest her smile with as much delight as she should have maybe hell make a difference she dressed for the evening with great care as a matter of selfesteem and at half past eight was seated at an enormous dinner table between a large military gentleman with very forthright opinions on india and a merchant banker who firmly believed that women were totally uninterested in anything except fashion gossip and the theater so confined his conversation accordingly opposite her was a man of about thirty whose sole preoccupation was the breeding of fine bloodstock but next to him was a most unusuallooking young woman whose nose was a trifle too long her mouth a little wide and her expression one of such humor and vitality that emily found herself staring at her often enough to catch her eye and let her know that they had exactly the same thoughts of exasperation and boredom at the same moment jack was nearer the head of the table as a matter of political duty wooing people of influence who might be of further assistance with the education bill it was important to emily also but the only part she could play here was to be decorative and charming and the idea of doing that indefinitely was wearing very thin the dining room was sumptuously decorated in french blue and gold the long windows were curtained in velvet displayed in rich folds skirted out over the floor in the approved fashion to show a wealth of fabric the table glittered with silver and crystal so many facets gleamed and glinted it dazzled the eyes one could barely see the faces of the people at the farther end for the reflected lights diamonds sparked fire around white throats and the luster of pearls shone softly silver on porcelain clicked discreetly beneath the buzz of conversation footmen refilled glasses course after course came and went entrees soup fish removes pudding dessert fruits and then finally the hostess rose and invited the ladies to retire and leave the gentlemen to their port and the more serious discussions of the evening it was of course the purpose for which they had come obediently emily rose and followed the ladies out in a rustle and swirl of gorgeous colored skirts on the way she managed to fall in step with the young woman who had sat opposite her at the table she glanced sideways and caught her eye as they crossed the hallway and entered the ornate withdrawing room decorated with portraits of family ancestors posed against unreal rural scenery isnt it ghastly the young woman whispered raising her fan so her words were concealed from the ladies to their left fearful emily whispered back i have never been more bored in my life i feel as if i know what everyone is going to say before they say it that is because it is exactly what they said last time the young woman replied with a smile oscar wilde says it is the artists duty always to be surprising then it must be the politicians duty always to say and do precisely what is expected of him emily returned that way no one is ever caught off guard and nothing is ever interesting or funny my name is tallulah fitzjames i know we havent been introduced but we obviously know each other in spirit emily radley emily replied oh is jack radley your husband there was a spark of appreciation in her eye yes emily acknowledged with satisfaction then added honestly i wouldnt be here otherwise they walked over to a sofa just large enough for the two of them to sit side by side and be perfectly polite in including no one else i cant think why im here tallulah sighed i am with my cousin gerald allenby because he wanted me to so he could pay court to miss i forget the name her fathers got a huge place up in yorkshire or somewhere glorious in the summer and like the north pole in winter im here to be decorative and smile at the right people emily said ruefully tallulahs eyes brightened are you allowed to glare and make faces at the wrong people she said hopefully emily laughed possibly if i could only be sure who they were the trouble is one days wrong people are another days right ones and you cant take back a glare no you cant can you tallulah was suddenly serious in fact you cant take back anything much people remember even if you dont emily caught the note of pain underneath the light voice without warning there was reality in the emotion the rest of the room fell away from emilys consciousness the polite chatter the tinkle of appropriate laughter some people forget she said quietly its an art if you want to go on loving someone you have to learn it i dont want to go on tallulah said with a tight little smile of selfmockery id give a great deal to know how to stop emily asked the next and obvious question is he married that seemed to tallulah to be funny in a bitter way emily did not want to pry but she sensed that the other woman had a need to share something which obviously hurt her and which perhaps she could not speak of to her family they might not know or if they did maybe they disapproved if he were married they could hardly do anything else no hes not married tallulah answered at least he wasnt the last time i saw him i dont imagine hell ever marry and if he does it will be someone earnest and beautiful with innocent eyes and hair which curls naturally and a permanently sweet disposition emily thought about it for a moment she did not want to make a clumsy remark and it was not easy to read through the flippant words the true nature of tallulahs pain she did not know whether to be witty in return or to be noncommittal or to show that she saw the depth if not the totality of the wound over on the far side of the room a large woman with fair hair and magnolia skin tilted her head back and laughed daintily the gaslight shone in a riot of beautiful colors silk skirts spread out like poppy petals oranges and plums and shot lavenders a glory of gleam and shade beyond the windows the summer evening was barely dark an afterglow still shooting shreds of apricot between the branches of the trees above the garden wall i dont think i should like to be married to someone with a permanently sweet disposition emily said candidly i should feel intensely inferior and i should also never be quite sure if they meant what they said tallulah stared at her long slender hands resting on her skirt jago wouldnt feel inferior she replied hes the best man ive ever met emily was at a loss to answer that jago whoever he was sounded like a bore and more than a little unreal or perhaps that was unjust it could be only the way tallulah saw him but looking sideways at tallulahs unhappy face it was hard to believe she would find someone she saw as so good of the slightest interest except as a curiosity even deep in thought her own face was full of vitality and daring her mouth was too wide full of humor her nose too strong and yet utterly feminine her eyes were lovely wide and intelligent it was the face of a rebel unpredictable far from wise perhaps selfindulgent but always brave best at what emily asked before she thought clearly of her words tallulah smiled in spite of herself best at honor and caring for people real people she answered and at working all the hours there are at giving away his goods to feed the poor at giving his whole life in service if he sounds boring or unlikely thats only because you dont know him are you sure you do tallulah looked up oh yes hes a parish priest in whitechapel i havent been there of course its the most fearful place they say even the smell is enough to turn your stomach open middens everywhere you can taste them in the air all the people are dirty and thin and terribly poor emily thought of her own experiences with poverty the times she had helped charlotte or pitt and seen the reality of hunger people crowded ten or twelve to a room sleeping on the floor always cold without privacy even for the most intimate functions she knew far better than tallulah what they were speaking of perhaps this jago really was good how do you know him she said aloud hes not exactly your circle i cant see him at something like this her eye strayed to the giggling women their corseted waists their flowing skirts their gleaming white shoulders and necks colored with gems if anyone here had gone hungry it would be for vanitys sake but to be fair at least in the unmarried ones among them beauty was survival he used to be tallulah responded she looked at emily frankly you think im seeing him through a romantic haze dont you that i have no idea what the real person is like that i only see his calling and his professional self she shook her head thats not true hes the same age as my brother finlay and they used to be friends finlays older than i am eight years but i can remember jago coming to the house often when i was about sixteen just before i came out into society he used to be awfully sweet to me then but he isnt now tallulah looked at her with bitterness of course not hed be polite if we chanced to meet naturally hes polite to everyone but i can see the contempt in his eyes the very fact that he speaks at me through a glass wall of good manners as if im not a real person to him at all says just how he despises me why should he despise you isnt that pretty intolerant tallulahs face set into misery again losing all its brightness and courage not really perhaps despise is too strong a word he just has no time for me i spend my life indulging myself i go from one party to another i eat wonderful food which i dont work to buy i dont even cook it myself she lifted one elegant shoulder to be frank i dont even know where it comes from i simply order it from the kitchen and it arrives on the plate ready for me to eat and when its finished someone removes it and does whatever they do wash it put it away i suppose she smoothed her hands over the silk of her skirt her fingertips caressing the soft bright fabric and i wear gorgeous dresses which i dont make and i wouldnt begin to know how to care for she went on i even have a maid to help me put them on and take them off she sends them to the laundry maid who washes them except the best ones like this which she will do herself i think some of them even have to be unpicked to be cleaned properly im not sure yes they do emily told her its a very long job you see no lots of people live like that dont you like it tallulahs head came up her mouth pressed into a thin line her eyes fixed on emilys yes i do i love it of course i love it dont you dont you want to dine and dance look beautiful spend your time in beautiful places watch plays and laugh with witty people dont you want to be outrageous at times lead fashion say shocking things and spend time with marvelous people emily knew exactly what she meant but she could not help smiling and allowing her eyes to wander to the group of staid and very proper ladies a dozen feet away who were sitting uprighta necessity in whalebone corsetsand discussing in hushed voices the very minor improprieties of an acquaintance perhaps his idea of marvelous people is not the same as yours she suggested of course it isnt tallulah said sharply although the flash of humor in her face betrayed that she took the point i think oscar wilde is marvelous he is simply never ever a bore and never speaks down to one except artistically which is quite different and he is sincerely insincere if you know what i mean ive no idea emily confessed waiting for an explanation i mean tallulah searched for words i mean he does not delude himself there is no pomposity in him he is so preposterous you know that he is laughing at everything and yet it all matters intensely hes hes fun he never goes around trying to improve other people or making moral judgments and his gossip is always witty and entertaining to repeat and does no harm she looked around the room this is so crashingly tedious not one person has said a single thing worth remembering let alone recounting to anyone else emily was obliged to agree so what is it about jago that holds you from what you say he is as unlike mr wilde as it would be possible to be i know tallulah admitted but then i like to listen to oscar wilde i wouldnt ever want to marry himthats quite different perhaps she did not realize what she had said emily looked at her and saw the earnestness in her face the selfmockery lying just beneath it and realized whether she had intended to speak it aloud or not it was what she meant i dont know why tallulah went on i dont think i want to know why they were prevented from discussing the matter any further by the arrival of the gentlemen jack looked very serious he came in deep in conversation with a heavily whiskered man with a ruddy complexion and the scarlet ribbon of an order across his chest he glanced at emily held her eyes then continued on that moment was intended to convey that he could not be interrupted and she understood she also understood nearly an hour later when he came over and told her with much apology that he was obliged to leave the party early and go to the home office with the gentleman of the whiskers and he would leave the carriage for her to return home when she wished she should not wait up for him as he could not say when his business might be concluded it was just conceivable that it might last all night he was very sorry indeed so it was that twenty minutes later so bored that it was difficult for her to make sensible answers to trivial questions she was delighted to see tallulah fitzjames again i cant bear this anymore tallulah said in a whisper my cousin is apparently succeeding with miss whateverhernameis and i can safely leave him to enjoy his victory her tone suggested how little she thought that was worth reggie howard has invited me to go to a party he knows of in chelsea the sort of people we were talking about will be there artists and poets people of ideas theyll discuss all manner of things now she was full of enthusiasm some of them have been to paris and met the writers there indeed i heard that arthur symons is just back a month or two ago and could tell us of his meeting with the great verlaine it has to be immeasurably more interesting than this it was clearly an invitation and emily hesitated she ought simply to excuse herself and take her own carriage home she had acquitted her duty and it would be acceptable but she was weary of doing her duty to those who expected it and were barely aware of her she was not needed by jack or her children the house ran itself her decisions were merely a matter of form she was asked only out of politeness the cook the butler and the housekeeper would all do precisely the same whether she was there or not her mother was remarried and far too absorbed in her own happiness to need either company or counseling even charlotte had not needed or wanted her help lately pitt had not had a case in which they could assist she did not even know what he was involved with at the moment but tallulah fitzjames had a grief to which she might offer some very good advice it was there on the edge of her tongue as she thought about it the answer was a matter of priorities and inner honesty no one could have everything and somehow choices needed to be made one should make them with candor and courage and then have the sense to see that one accepted the decision and realized the consequences and it might be great fun to hear what was going on in paris in the way of outrageous ideas how exciting she said with decision i should love to come reggie will take us tallulah said instantly come on reggie do you know mrs radley the honorable reginald howard and without waiting for them to do more than nod to each other she led the way to their hostess to say their farewells and emily sent her own carriage home without her the party in chelsea was as different from the event they had left as it was possible to conceive it was held in several rooms all of them large filled with books and comfortable chairs and chaise longues the air was hazy with smoke some of which had the peculiar sweetness of incense quite unfamiliar to emily everywhere people a far greater preponderance of men than women were engaged in intense conversation the first man emily noticed individually had a dreaming face large nose humorous eyes and small delicate mouth his hair seemed fair in the gaslight and he wore it long enough to touch the white laceedged collar of his velvet jacket i think thats richard le gallienne tallulah whispered the writer she looked ahead to where another earnest young man wavy hair parted in the center rich mustache decorating a full upper lip was describing something to his audience to their entranced delight and thats arthur symons she went on her voice rising eagerly he must be telling them about paris i hear he met simply everyone there they were welcomed very casually by a middleaged woman with powerful features dressed in garb which could have come straight from an artists impression of an eastern traveler it was flattering but highly eccentric she held a cigar in one longfingered hand and seemed to know tallulah and therefore to be happy to accommodate anyone who accompanied her emily thanked her then gazed around with interest and a touch of apprehension a large potted palm nearly obscured a corner of the room where two young men sat so close to each other they were all but touching one of them appeared to be reading to the other out of a very thin leatherbound volume they were oblivious of everyone else on a chaise longue near the farther wall a middleaged man with a florid face was either asleep or insensible arthur symons was holding forth about his recent trip to paris where he had indeed visited paul verlaine we went to his home he said excitedly gazing at his audience where we were most cordially received havelock ellis and myself i wish i could describe to you the atmosphere everything i saw and heard he entertained us with the last wine all the while he smoked like a bonfire i swear i shall never smell smoke again without it bringing to my mind that evening imagine it he held up his hands as if grasping a whole world precious and complete everyone within earshot was staring at him no one made the slightest move to leave his face glowed with the rapture of the moment although emily wondered whether it was memory which burned so hotly in him or delight at being so absolutely the center of interest and the envy of his peers havelock and i sitting in the home of verlaine himself how we talked we spoke of all manner of things of philosophy and arts and poetry and what it is to be alive it was as if we had always known each other there was a murmur around the small circle a sigh of admiration perhaps of longing one young man seemed almost intoxicated by the very thought of such an experience his fair face was brightly flushed and he leaned forward as if by being in such close proximity he could touch or feel it for himself he invited us to return the following day symons continued and of course you did the young man said urgently of course symons agreed then a curious expression crossed his features anger laughter sorrow unfortunately he was not in beside emily someone drew in her breath sharply we left in the utmost dejection symons went on looking even now as if some tragedy had just struck him it was appalling our dreams crashed to the ground the cup broken the very instant it was at our lips he hesitated dramatically then at the very moment we were leaving we encountered him returning with a friend and someone prompted vaguely again the mixture of emotions crossed symonss face he had not the faintest idea who we were he confessed he had forgotten us completely this tale was greeted with a mixture of responses including a gasp of amazement from reggie howard and an outburst of laughter from tallulah but symons had their attention and that was all he required he went on to describe in minute witty and most colorful detail their earlier visits to cafes theaters concerts and various salons they visited several artists and made a long trip out to the suburbs where they went to the workshop of auguste rodin who barely spoke to themor to anyone else utterly different and holding his audience to even more rapt attention was the tale of his visit to the cafe moulin rouge colorful hectic and seedy with its music and dancers its mixture of high and low society he told them of his encounter with the brilliant and perverse henri de toulouselautrec who painted the cancan girls and the prostitutes emily was fascinated it was a world of which she had barely dreamed of course she knew the nameseveryone did even if some of them were spoken in a whisper they were the poets and thinkers who defied convention who set out to shock and usually succeeded they idolized decadence and said so from listening to arthur symons she moved into the next room and eavesdropped on a conversation between two young men who seemed oblivious of heran experience she had not had before at least not at a party in her circle where politeness was exercised often in defense of very obvious truth and compliments were the usual currency of exchange this was outside all she knew and invigorating because of it no one mentioned the weather or who was courting whom politics need not have existed or bankers or royalty either here it was all art words sensations and ideas but he wore green one young man said in horror his face twisted as if he suffered physical pain the music was the most obviously purple i have ever heard all shades of indigo and violet melting into darkness green was absolutely so insensitive so utterly devoid of understanding did you say anything to him the other asked quickly i tried was the reply i spent ages with him i explained all about the interrelationship between the senses how color and sound are part of each other how taste and touch combine but i really dont think he understood a word he gestured intensely with his hands fingers spaced and then clenched i wanted him to grasp a complete art he is so onedimensional but what can one do shock his companion said instantly with something so sublime he will be forced to reconsider everything he has ever believed the first man dashed the heel of his hand against his brow but of course why didnt i think of that thats what dear oscar says the first duty of the artist is continually to astonish his friend leaned forward my dear did you read lippincotts monthly magazine last month both of them were completely unaware of emily a bare six feet away the young man thought for a moment no i dont think so you mean july why what was in it has oscar said something outrageous he touched the other lightly on the arm do tell me absolutely its almost too marvelous the reply was so eager the words almost fell upon each other a story of a young and beautiful manguess who well anyway he falls in with a depraved dandy an older man with a wonderful wit to whom he says one day that he wishes he could never grow old but would always have the looks and the youth that he has at that moment his eyebrows rose he is very lovely you understand so you said what of it the young man leaned back precariously close to the potted palm behind him we would all be delighted to retain such beauty as we have such a thought is hardly worthy of oscars invention and certainly not shocking oh but this story is he was assured you see another man a largely honorable man paints a portrait of himand his wish is granted his face is beautiful he held up one longfingered white hand but his soul grows steadily more and more harrowed as he indulges in a life of utter pleasure seeking regardless of the cost to others which is high even to life at times still ordinary my dear a mere observation of the obvious he leaned back against the chinese cushions behind him exhibiting his boredom do you really imagine oscar would ever be obvious the first mans high eyebrows rose even farther how unimaginative you are and what a poor judge of character well it may not be obvious to you dear boy but it is to me his companion rejoined then tell me the ending he challenged there is no ending it is merely life that is where you are wrong he wagged his finger he remains as young and utterly beautiful as ever years and years go by his face is unmarked by the squalor of his soul and the viciousness of his life wishful thinking but the portrait is not week by week the face on the canvas grows more terrible what he sat suddenly upright knocking off one of the voluptuous cushions emily suppressed her instinct to pick it up and replace it the face on the canvas grows more terrible the man continued his tale all the sin and meanness the disease of his soul is stamped on it till the very sight of it is enough to freeze the blood and make you lie awake at night for fear of sleeping and dreaming of it he had his friends total attention my god then what what is the end he murders the artist who has guessed his secret the man said triumphantly then at last terrified at the hideousness of his own soul which he sees in the painted face he stabs it emily drew in her breath in a gasp but neither of them heard her and the man demanded it is himself he has killed he is inextricably bound with the painting he is it and it is he he diesand the body takes on the monstrosity of the portrait which now becomes again as beautiful and as innocent as when it was first painted but the story is full of marvelous wit and wonderful lines as oscar always is he shrugged and sat back smiling of course there are those in the establishment who are furious saying it is depraved evil and so on but what do you expect a work of art accepted by everyone is damned from the start there can hardly be a more explicit way of demonstrating that it has nothing whatsoever to say if you dont offend anyone at all you might as well not bother to speak you obviously have nothing to say i must get lippincotts immediately there is talk he may publish it in a book what is it called i must know the picture of dorian grey wonderful i shall read itprobably several times so shall i emily thought to herself moving away as the two men started to discuss the deeper implications of the story but i shall not tell jack he might not understand she was beginning to feel a little dizzy and certainly very tired she was not used to so much smoke in the air in polite society gentlemen retired from the main apartments in order to smoke there were rooms specifically set aside for it so as not to offend those who did not and special jackets worn not to carry the smell back into the rest of the house she looked across and saw tallulah she was flirting with a languid young man in green but it seemed more a thing of habit than of any real intent emily had no idea what time it was but all intelligence said it must be very late indeed she had no way of going home except with tallulah she could not leave alone and wander the streets looking for a hansom at this hour of the morning any men around any policemen would take her for a prostitute since the uproar four years ago about prostitution generally and the purge on pornography all sorts of decent women had been arrested walking about in daylight in the wrong areas let alone at this hour a fraction unsteadily she made her way across the room stopping by the chair and looking down at tallulah i think it is time we excused ourselves she said clearly at least she meant it to be clear it has been delightful but i should like to be home in time for breakfast breakfast tallulah blinked oh she sat upright sharply oh yes the mundane world that eats breakfast i suppose we must return she sighed it seemed as if she had already forgotten the young man and he did not seem disconcerted his attention turned as easily to someone else they found reggie quite quickly and he was amiable enough to be willing to leave wandering outside with emily on one arm and tallulah on the other he woke his coachman and they all climbed into the carriage half asleep reggie closing the door behind them with difficulty there was already a pale fin of light in the east and the earliest traffic on the roads no one had asked emily where she lived and as she sat jolting gently as they moved along the riverbank then turned north she looked at the sleeping figure of reggie howard in the light of the lamps they passed under and hesitated to ask him to take her home first they were going in the wrong direction she would have to wait they stopped rather abruptly in devonshire street reggie woke with a start ah home he said blinking let me assist you he fumbled to open the door but the footman was there before him offering his hand to tallulah and then to emily youd better stay with me tonight tallulah said quickly you dont want to arrive home at this hour emily hesitated only a moment perhaps this was also a polite way of allowing her to know that reggies carriage was not available for her any further it was quite true it would be easier to explain to jack that she spent the night with tallulah than that she was out until four in the morning at a party in chelsea with artists and writers of the highly fashionable decadent school thank you she scrambled out with more haste than grace that is most generous of you she also thanked reggie and the footman and then as the carriage rumbled away she followed tallulah across the pavement through the areaway doors and into the back yard where the scullery entrance was apparently unlocked tallulah stood in the kitchen she looked surprisingly fragile in the first cold daylight away from the gas lamps glow and the velvet hangings she was framed instead by the wooden dresser with the rows of dishes the copper pans hanging on the wall and the flour bins the black kitchen range to the left clean linen hung on the airing rack above and there was a smell of dried herbs and strings of onions in the air it would not be long before the first maids were up to clear out the stove and black it and light it ready for cook to begin breakfast the same would shortly be happening in emilys own home tallulah took a deep breath and let it out soundlessly she turned to lead the way up towards the stairs emily followed tiptoeing so as not to be heard by the earlywaking servants on the landing tallulah stopped outside a guest room door ill lend you a gown she said very quietly and ill send my maid in the morning she winced at least about eight oclock nobodyll breakfast very early i dont think actually she looked at emily with a sudden misery in her face actually its not a very good time at the moment something rather wretched has happened her voice was no more than a whisper a woman of the streets was murdered off the whitechapel road somewhere and the police found an old club badge there that belonged to my brother they actually came to the house asking questions she shuddered of course he didnt have anything to do with it but im terrified they wont believe him she stared at emily waiting for her to say something im sorry emily said sincerely it must be awful for you perhaps theyll discover the real person quickly then her habitual curiosity broke through where did they find the badge in her room where she was killed tallulah bit her lip and her fear was naked in her face accentuated in the sharp shadows cast by the faint light of a gas lamp glowing dimly at the stairhead and the daylight beginning to show through the landing windows oh there was nothing comforting emily could say to that she was not shocked that tallulahs brother should use a prostitute she was worldly enough to have known such things for years it was not even impossible that he had actually killed her somebody had perhaps he had not meant to it could have been a quarrel over money she might have attempted to rob him emily knew from pitt that such things happened it did not take a great deal of imagination to think how it could come about a rich young man expensively dressed gold cuff links gold watch perhaps cigar cutter card case studs money in his pocket to spend on satisfying his appetites and a desperate woman who was tired hungry and not even certain of a roof over her head next week she might even have had a child to feed it was only surprising it did not happen more often but that was hardly the thing to say to tallulah although perhapslooking at her pale face tiredness smudging shadows under her eyes fear bleaching the vitality and the spark from herit was something she already knew emily forced a smile bleak and a little shaky there must have been lots of other people there too she said hopefully it was probably someone she knew they have men who take their money and look after them you know it was more likely he the police will know that i expect they only came here as a matter of form do you tallulah asked he was very polite he spoke beautifully i mean like a gentleman but he was rather scruffy to look at his collar was very clean but crooked and his hair was all over the place if i didnt know he was a policeman i would have thought he could have been an artist or a writer but i dont think he was a fool he wasnt afraid of papa and most people are emily had a sudden feeling of chill a ripple of familiarity like a scene from a dream when you know what is going to happen before it does dont worry she said as confidently as she could hell find the truth hell never charge the wrong person your brother will be all right tallulah stood motionless outside a cart rattled along the street and someone on the footpath was whistling as he walked it was almost daylight the scullery maid could be coming down the back stairs any minute thank you she said at last ill see you at breakfast ill fetch the nightgown emily smiled her gratitude and determined to find a telephone the moment she could and at least inform her ladies maid that she was perfectly well and spending the night with a friend if jack was home that would serve for explanation to him as well if he should rise in the morning and find her late for breakfast he would understand emily woke with a start the sun was streaming through the open curtains into a room she had never seen before it was all yellow florals with a little gray and blue there was a maid pouring hot water into a large china bowl and fresh towels over the back of the chair mornin miss the girl said cheerfully nice day again looks to be set for sunshine and warm miss tallulah said as if youd care to borrow one of her dresses for the time bein youd be welcome seein as your gowns a bit formal for breakfast she did not glance at emilys green dinner gown with its ivory and yellow roses spread over the chaise longue its skirts fanned out its deepcut bodice and flimsy sleeves looking like wilted flowers in the sharp morning light nor was her expression anything but politely helpful she was a very good maid indeed thank you emily accepted she would dislike intensely turning up at augustus fitzjamess breakfast table looking as if she had been up all night and the cream muslin dress offered was certainly very attractive it was a trifle young for her but not unsophisticated with its swathed bodice and delicate embroidery she went downstairs with tallulah in order that her presence might be duly explained and she be properly introduced the dining room was large formal and extremely attractive but she had no time to do more than notice it momentarily her attention was taken entirely by the three people who sat around the table at the head of it was augustus fitzjames his long powerful face set in lines of severity as he studied the morning newspaper he had it folded in front of him but he did not look up when the two young women came in until he realized that there was someone present he had not expected good morning papa tallulah said cheerfully may i present mrs radley i invited her to stay the night with us because the hour was late and her husband had been obliged to take their carriage on an urgent call of government business she lied quite adroitly as if she had considered the matter beforehand augustus regarded emily with a slight frown then as he connected the name with a member of parliament he inclined his head in acknowledgment good morning mrs radley im delighted we were able to offer you hospitality please join us for breakfast he glanced at the woman at the foot of the table her hair was perfectly coiffed her morning gown immaculate but her face was creased with tiny lines of anxiety my wife he said expressionlessly how do you do mrs fitzjames emily said with a smile thank you for your kindness in allowing me to stay here it was a formality something to say in the stiff silence aloysia had been totally unaware of her presence you are most welcome aloysia said hastily i hope you slept well very thank you emily sat on the chair indicated for her while the maid set an extra place for tallulah my son augustus continued gesturing with his rather bony hands to the young man who sat opposite emily how do you do mr fitzjames she responded looking at him with a far greater interest than she could ever have had had tallulah not confided in her his disastrous connection with the murder in whitechapel she tried to smile brightly noncommittally as if she knew nothing but she could not help trying to read his face he was handsome he had a good nose a wide mouth and a broad firm jaw his hair was beautiful it sprang back from his brow in thick fair waves it was the face of a man who would never be lost for female admiration what uncontrolled appetite or unseen weakness had taken him to find a prostitute in whitechapel of all places looking at him across the family breakfast table she thought how little of a person one sees in the inbred manners and the traditional dress the neatly barbered hair how do you do mrs radley he replied without interest morning tallulah have a good evening tallulah sat down next to emily and picked at a bowl of fruit then set it aside and chose toast and apricot preserve instead yes thank you she replied noncommittally he was not asking with any interest emily was offered smoked haddock or eggs and declined both she too said toast would be sufficient she must return home as soon as she decently could it would be difficult enough to give a satisfactory explanation of her nights absence as it was where did you go augustus asked tallulah his tone was not peremptory but there was an underlying assumption in it that he would be answered and answered truthfully tallulah did not look up from her plate to lady swaffhams for dinner did i not mention it yes you did he said grimly and you did not remain there until after two in the morning i know lady swaffham better than that they had not mentioned the time they came in presumably two was the time he had gone to bed himself and he knew she was not home i went on with reggie howard and mrs radley to a literary discussion in chelsea tallulah replied glancing up at her father at two in the morning his eyebrows rose sarcastically i think madam that you mean a party at which certain young men who imagine themselves writers sit around striking poses and talking nonsense was oscar wilde there no he looked at emily to confirm or deny the statement i dont believe any of his set were there she said with complete honesty actually she was not sure who his set were anyway and she resented being put in the position of having to answer for tallulah or make her a liar i dont care for young howard augustus continued taking another slice of toast and pouring himself more tea he did not look at his daughter you will not go out in his company again tallulah drew in her breath and her face hardened augustus faced his wife it is time you took her to more appropriate places my dear it is your job to find her a suitable match this year i think it is past time you did so as long as she does not jeopardize her reputation too far by wasting her time in loose company then she is eminently eligible regardless of behavior she will not remain so indefinitely he was still looking at aloysia not tallulah but emily saw tallulahs cheeks flush with humiliation i will make a list of desirable families he concluded and bit into his toast his other hand reaching for his cup desirable to whom tallulah said hotly he turned to her there was not a shred of humor or light in his eyes to me of course it is my responsibility to see that you are well provided for and that you make a success of your life you have everything that is necessary except selfdiscipline you will now apply that beginning today had she thought anyone was taking the slightest notice of her emily would have been embarrassed but even finlay seemed absorbed in what his father was saying apparently such total command did not surprise any of them she did not need to look at tallulahs downcast head to know that augustus fitzjamess list of acceptable suitors for his daughters hand would not include the jago she had referred to the virtue she was so sure he possessed would not endear him to a socially ambitious father tallulah needed to do some very serious evaluating of her own desires and some weighing of costs and rewards if she were to have any chance of happiness emily looked across at finlay still eating toast and marmalade and finishing his last cup of tea any sympathy he might have felt for his sister did not register in his face without warning augustus turned on him and it is past time you found a suitable wife you cannot take up an embassy post of any importance unless you have a wife capable of maintaining the position she should have breeding dignity the capacity to hold intelligent conversation without forcing her own opinions into it and sufficient charm to appeal but not so much as to cause gossip and speculation wholesomeness is preferable to beauty naturally her reputation must be impeccable that goes without saying i can think of a dozen or more who would be suitable at the moment finlay began then stopped abruptly augustuss face froze i am quite aware that at the moment there are other matters to be cleared up his face was tight and hard and he did not look at his son when he spoke i trust that that will not take more than a few days i should think not finlay said unhappily staring at his father as if willing him to look up and meet his eyes i had nothing to do with it and if they have any competence at all they will soon know that he said it as if it were a challenge and he did not expect to be believed without proving it and yet emily heard the sincerity sharp in his voice tallulah ignored her unfinished toast and her tea grew cold she looked from her father to her mother and back again of course they will aloysia said meaninglessly it is unpleasant but there is no need whatever to worry augustus regarded her with a world of contempt in his eyes and the tired lines around his mouth deepened no one is worried aloysia it is simply a matter of dealing with things so that nothing unpleasant does happen as a result of incompetence or other misfortune we cannot prevent he turned to tallulah you madam will deport yourself in a manner which raises no eyebrows whatsoever and gives no malicious tongues the fuel with which to spread gossip and you sirhe looked at finlaywill conduct yourself like a gentleman you will confine your attentions to your duty and to such pleasures as are enjoyed by the sort of young lady you would wish to marry you might escort your sister there are soirees exhibitions and other appropriate gatherings all over london finlay looked desperate otherwise augustus continued this matter may not be as easily contained as you would wish i had nothing to do with it finlay protested a rising note of desperation in his voice possibly augustus said dryly continuing with his breakfast the discussion was over he did not need to say so in words the finality in his voice was total argument with it would have been useless tallulah and emily finished the remains of their meal in silence then excused themselves as soon as they were in the hallway and out of earshot tallulah turned to emily im sorry she said with distress that must have been dreadful for you because im sure you know what he was talking about of course they will clear it all up but it could take ages and what if they never find out who it was her voice sharpened as panic mounted inside her they never found the other whitechapel murderer he killed five women and that was two years ago and still no one has the faintest idea who he was it could be anyone no it couldnt emily said steadily she was speaking empty words but she hoped tallulah would not know it that other failure had very little to do with this she believed pitt could find the truth but probably all the truth which even if finlay were as innocent as he claimed might include a few facts about him which were embarrassing or painful or both the trouble with an investigation was that all manner of things were discovered perhaps irrelevant to the crime private sins and shames which it was afterwards impossible to forget and when people were afraid they too often behaved badly one might see them far more clearly than one ever wished there was more to fear than simply a discovery of guilt it is probably someone in her daily life she went on very steadily thinking even as she was saying it that augustus fitzjames was not certain of his sons innocence emily knew from the edge in his voice the way he overrode his wifes comfortable words that a needle of doubt had pricked him why why would a man have so little confidence in his own son as to allow such an awful possibility into his mind yes of course it is tallulah agreed im just upset because papa is going to try to force me to marry some bore and become a bland uninteresting wife sewing useless embroidery and painting watercolors no one wants to look at thank you emily smiled at her tallulah blushed scarlet oh god im so sorry what an unpardonable thing to say i didnt mean it like that emily blinked at the blasphemy but said frankly yes you did and i dont blame you plenty of women spend their whole lives doing things they despise i bore myself to tears sometimes and i am married to a politician and usually he is very interesting i was bored last night because he has been so busy i have seen little of him lately and i have done nothing to interest myself i need a good issue to fight for gradually the color subsided in tallulahs cheeks but she still looked mortified emily took her by the arm and led her back up the stairs towards her temporary bedroom i have a greataunt by marriage she continued who is never bored a day in her life because she is always concerned with something usually battling some injustice or ignorance she doesnt take on anything easy so everything tends to last she could have mentioned that she had a mother who had just married a jewish actor seventeen years her junior and a sister who had married beneath her to a man in the police force and brought drama into all their lives by becoming involved in the worst of his cases but just at the moment that would be tactless not to mention overwhelming does she tallulah said with a flicker of interest her husband doesnt mind actually hes dead and he doesnt count emily conceded if he were alive that would make it harder what about this jago that you mentioned jago tallulah laughed jerkily can you see papa allowing me to marry a parish priest in whitechapel i should end up with about two dresses to my name one to wash one to wear and live in a drafty room with cold water and a roof that leaked socially i should cease to exist i thought priests had vicarages emily argued standing at the top of the stairs on the bright sunlit landing with its yellow carpet and potted palms a housemaid in crisp lacetrimmed cap and apron walked across the hall below them her heels clicking on the parquet there might be vicarages in whitechapel but they were still another world from this tallulah bit her lip i know that but i would have to give up so much no more parties no more beautiful gowns witty conversations that last all night no more trips to the theater and the opera no more dinners and balls and coming home in the dawn i wouldnt even be warm enough half the time or have enough to eat i might have to do my own laundry it was all perfectly true do you want to change jago into something he isnt emily asked her no tallulah drew in her breath slowly no i dont of course not i she stopped she did not know what she meant the decision was enormous no one gets everything emily said softly if what you care for in him is that part which clings to his own values then you have to accept all that goes with it perhaps it is time to weigh up exactly what life with him would mean and what life without him would be for you and then decide what you really want dont let it go by default it is too important for that it could be your whole life tallulahs curious face was twisted in selfmockery but there were tears in her eyes theres no decision for me to make jago wouldnt even look at me in that way he despises everything i am its just a matter of trying to help finlay through this and i cant even think of a way to do that and then not letting papa marry me to anyone too stultifyingly tedious she sniffed maybe hed marry me to someone very old and theyd die then i can be a widow like your greataunt and do as i please below them the dining room door opened again and finlay came out walking quickly and a little angrily towards the front door jarvis he shouted wheres my hat and my stick i left them in the stand last night whos moved them a footman materialized duly deferential your stick is there sir and i took the hat to brush it oh thank you finlay reached for the stick well fetch the hat jarvis why did you take it anyway i dont need a hat brushed every time i wear it a bird unfortunately jarvis began tallulah smiled in spite of herself and took emily by the arm to guide her back to the room to make the necessary arrangements to have her own dress packed so she could take it with her on her return home emily made her farewells then rode home in the fitzjameses second carriage augustus having taken the first her thoughts were engaged in tallulahs problems was it possible that finlay was guilty why would he do such a thing what was there about him that his father knew or suspected which made him so cold so uncertain and yet unhesitant to defend him or had she misread the emotions in his face she had been an onlooker at one meal perhaps she was being foolish absurdly overrating her own judgment she wondered idly what jago was like that he could have captured tallulahs dreams so completely apparently he was the opposite of everything she treasured in her present life perhaps that was it not reality at all simply an enchantment with the idea of the different whatever it was she liked tallulah liked her vividness her ability to care and the fact that she was teetering on the edge of dreams for which she would have to pay for the rest of her life she was worthy of all the help emily could give her there was no decision to be made about that when she arrived she thanked the fitzjameses coachman alighted and went up her own front steps the butler opened the door to her without raising his eyebrows good morning jenkins she said calmly walking in good morning maam he replied closing the door behind her mr radley is in the study maam thank you she passed him the package containing her dinner gown with instructions to give it to her ladies maid then feeling a trifle odd in tallulahs muslin morning dress she walked head high to the study to explain herself to jack good morning he said coolly when she opened the door he was sitting at the desk with a pile of papers a pen in his hand his expression unsmiling i received your message rather incomplete where were you she took a deep breath she found herself resenting the need to account but she had known it would be unavoidable i accepted a ride to another party and did not realize how late i had stayed they were interesting people and i met someone she still had not made up her mind whether to pass it off as help to a friend in trouble or enquiring into pitts current case looking at jacks displeased face did not assist her whatever she said it had better be something she could substantiate yes he prompted his eyes chilly she must decide immediately or it would look like a lie he was not as easy to mislead as she sometimes wished she had once assumed that his attention could be diverted by a smile and she had been wrong im waiting emily i met a young woman i liked very much and she was in great distress because her brother has been accused of murder thomas is investigating the case i couldnt leave it jack i had to find out all i could about it for her sake and thomass and for the truth itself indeed he sat back in his chair regarding her skeptically so you stayed the night in her home what did you learn in this generous effort is he guilty dont be sarcastic she replied tartly even i cant solve a murder over breakfast she looked at him with a hesitant smile it will take me at least until dinner maybe even longer and with that she met his eyes for an instant saw the beginning of humor in them then turned and went out closing the door behind her in the hall she gave a sigh of relief and ran swiftly upstairs to change at the time emily was talking to tallulah at the stairhead and finlay was taking his hat and stick from the footman and going out of the door pitt was sitting in a hansom on the far side of devonshire street with rose burke beside him as the door to number thirtyeight opened and finlay came out she leaned forward peering out of the side her body stiff she remained watching her head turning very slowly to follow his path along the pavement until he disappeared around the corner of upper wimpole street then she sat back again well pitt asked he did not know what he wanted her to say if she identified him it would be the beginning of a very unpleasant gathering of facts for an arrest and prosecution the fitzjames family would muster all its resources to fight back there would certainly be accusations of police incompetence rose herself would be attacked and every attempt would be made to undermine her resolve slander her characterwhich would not be hardand generally discredit her testimony on the other hand if she did not identify him or worse than that said it was not him then they were thrown back to the cuff link and the badge and to searching for any resolution which explained their presence but excluded finlay from the murder itself rose turned and looked at him she might have relished her moment of power he expected to see it in her eyes instead there was only anger and a bright hard hatred yeah it was im she said in a tight harsh voice thats im wot i saw goin in ter ada just afore she were killed arrest im get im tried so they can ang im pitt felt his chest constrict and his heart beat harder are you sure she swung around to glare at him yeah im sure you gonna argue cos e lives in a posh ouse in a fancy street an got money ter pay is way abaht her lip curled with disgust close to hatred no rose im not he said softly but when i go after him i want to be sure i have everything exactly right i dont want any clever lawyer finding mistakes and getting him off because of them yeah she settled back mortified yeah well i suppose so but yer got im this time this time he asked although with a little twist of misery he knew what she was going to say yeah well yer never got jack didjer her body was stiff her shoulders rigid under her shawl es still around fer all we know waitin in some dark doorway ter cut someone again well get this bleedin murderer an top im before e does another poor cow he would have liked to tell her this was not another serial murderer that that would never happen again that it was only one hideous aberration but he was not sure there was an air of compulsion about this murder an inward rage that had been momentarily beyond control if it could happen once it could perhaps would happen again its no help to you rose if we get the wrong man he said watching her face its hard handsome lines were set rigid with hate and fear her skin still smooth across her cheekbones if it were not for a certain brashness in her expression and the quality of her clothes she could have been a lady like any of the others along devonshire street or this part of mayfair e int the wrong one she replied now i int got all day ter sit ere talkin ter you i charge fer me time you charge for your services rose he corrected her and i dont want them youll give me as much time as i need im taking the cab back to bow street you can have it from there if you want oos payin fer it she said immediately i will he offered with a smile this once you can credit me for next time i want to speak to you she said nothing she would not commit herself to words but there was the slightest of smiles he leaned forward and gave the driver instructions and when they were at bow street he alighted and paid for the rest of the way to whitechapel he had learned nothing more from rose on the journey she was frightened she remembered the outrage of far too sharply the fear that had gripped london so tightly that even the music halls which laughed at everything and everyone made no jokes about the whitechapel murderer she needed the police and she hated that she saw them as part of an establishment which used her and at the same time despised her four years ago new laws had been passed initially intended to protect women and curb pornography and prostitution in effect they had only meant that the police had harassed and arrested more women and while some brothels had been closed down others opened up many men still believed that any woman who walked along in certain areas including some in the west end was by definition doing so to invite trade pornography flowed as freely as ever it was all one giant hypocrisy and rose saw it as such and hated all those who supported it or benefited from it pitt went into bow street station nodded to the desk sergeant and went on up to his office tellman was waiting for him his lanternjawed face sardonic his eyes hard morning sir theres a report from a dr lennox on your desk came about fifteen minutes ago couldnt tell him when youd be in so he didnt stay looked wretched like hed got an invitation to his own funeral its this whitechapel murder i spose yer toff is guilty looks like it pitt agreed reaching across his desk with its beautiful green leather inlay and picking up the sheet of paper covered in generous sloping handwriting tellman shrugged thatll be ugly there was some satisfaction in his voice although it was not possible to judge whether it was at pitts discomfort or at the prospect of a family like the fitzjameses being exposed to such a public indignity tellman had risen from the ranks and was only too familiar with the bitter reality of hunger humiliation and the knowledge that life would never offer him its great rewards pitt sat down and looked at the report lennox had left him ada mckinley had died of strangulation between ten oclock and midnight there were no bruises or scratches to indicate that she had fought her attacker her fingers had been broken three on her left hand two on her right three toes had been dislocated on her left foot on her right hand one fingernail was broken but that was probably from her attempt to tear the stocking from around her neck the only blood under her fingernails was almost certainly from the scratches on her own throat there were stretch marks on her abdomen from the child she had borne one or two old bruises on her thighs and one on her shoulder which was yellowish green and obviously had predated the night of her death other than that she was in good enough health as far as lennox could judge she was in her middle twenties there was little else to say pitt looked up tellman was waiting his long harsh face grim youre still in charge here pitt said dryly im going to see the assistant commissioner enough for an arrest tellman asked looking very directly at pitt an edge of surprise and challenge in his voice close pitt replied how difficult for you tellman observed without sympathy he smiled as he turned and went to the door i suppose youd better be sure dont want it to fail in court because you didnt get everything right he went out with his shoulders square and his head high john cornwallis had been assistant commissioner a very short timein fact a matter of a month or so he had been appointed to fill the vacancy left by the dramatic departure of his predecessor giles farnsworth at the conclusion of the arthur desmond case he was a man of average height lean broadshouldered and he moved with grace he was not handsome he had strong brows his nose was too powerful his mouth too wide and thin but he had a commanding presence a quality of stillness which was a kind of inner confidence one barely noticed that he had no hair whatever good morning sir pitt said as he closed the office door and walked in this was only the second time he had been back since his battle with farnsworth the room was the same in all essentials the tall windows facing the sun the large polished oak desk the armchairs yet the stamp of a different personality was on it the faint odor of farnsworths cigars was gone and in its place was a smell of leather and beeswax and something vaguely aromatic perhaps it came from the carved cedarwood box on the low table that was new the brass telescope on the wall was also new and the ships sextant hung beside it cornwallis was standing as though he had been looking out of the window he had been expecting pitt he was there by appointment good morning sit down cornwallis waved towards the chairs spread out comfortably facing each other the sunlight made a bright pool on the red patterned carpet im afraid this business in pentecost alley is turning very ugly did he do it your opinion rose burke identified him pitt replied the evidence is strong cornwallis grunted and sat down pitt sat also but not conclusive cornwallis asked searching pitts face he had caught the hesitation in his voice and was probing it pitt was not sure what he thought he had been turning it over in his mind since leaving rose she had seemed certain beyond doubt at all she had described him before she had seen him again in devonshire street so had nan sullivan there were the cuff link and the hellfire club badge its pretty tight he answered and so far theres no one else indicated then why do you hesitate cornwallis frowned he did not know pitt except by reputation he was seeking to weigh his judgments understand what held him from a decision never mind the ugliness if hes guilty ill back you i dont care whose son he is pitt looked at his tense candid face and knew it was the truth there was none of farnsworths deviousness in him none of his evasive selfinterest but it was possible there was also not his diplomatic skill either or his ability to persuade and cajole those in power because farnsworth was ambitious and capable of lies he understood others who had the same nature cornwallis might be more easily outflanked and misled thank you pitt said sincerely it may come to that but im not sure yet she identified him cornwallis pointed out sitting forward in the chair what worries you do you think the jury will disbelieve her because of what she is its possible pitt conceded thoughtfully what worries me more is that she may be overkeen to catch a man because shes afraid and angry and shell identify anyone out of her own need whitechapel hasnt forgotten the ripper two years is not long memories come back too easily especially to women of her trade she may have known long liz or mary kelly or any of his other victims and the badge you found cornwallis pressed she didnt imagine that no pitt agreed cautiously but it is possible someone else left it there or he lost it at some other time i agree its not likely but that is what he is claiming that he has not had it in years or the cuff links either do you believe him cornwalliss eyebrows were high his eyes wide no hes lying but hes not as afraid as i would have expected pitt tried to analyze his impressions as he spoke there is something i dont yet know something important i want to investigate it a little further before i arrest him cornwallis sat back theres going to be a great deal of pressure of course he warned its already started ive had someone from the home office calling this morning half an hour ago warned me about making mistakes being new to the position and not understanding things his lips tightened and there was anger in his eyes i understand a threat when i hear it and the sound of the establishment closing ranks to protect one of its own he pressed his lips together what do you know about finlay fitzjames pitt what sort of a young man is he i dont want to press charges then discover hes a model of every virtue perhaps we need more than the circumstantial evidence of his presence at the scene is there any suggestion of a motive other than the private vice of a weak and violent man no pitt said quietly and if it is fitzjames i dont imagine well ever find anything if hes ever abused a woman before or indulged in a touch of sadism the family will make very sure there is no evidence of it now anyone who knew will have been paid off or otherwise silenced cornwallis stared across the room at the empty fireplace his brows drawn down in thought the august sun was hot in the bright patch between them and a wasp bounced furiously on the windowpane youre right cornwallis agreed anyone involved anyone who knew would be in his own circle and they wouldnt betray him to us he looked at pitt suddenly what did you think of his father does he believe him innocent pitt paused for a moment remembering augustuss face his voice and the speed with which he had taken control of the interview im not sure i dont think hes convinced of his innocence either that or he has no trust in us at all and believes we may lie or misinterpret the evidence that surprises me cornwallis admitted hes a selfmade man but he has great respect for the establishment he should have he has a great many friends highly placed in it ive heard it said he expects finlay to achieve supreme office even possibly the premiership one day hell want him cleared of even a whisper against his name it will be the destruction of his dreams if this goes against him it could be that fear you saw or the will to protect him regardless pitt pointed out he may consider the death of one london prostitute no more than a regrettable accident in an otherwise wellplanned life i dont know you say he has powerful friends cornwalliss expression quickened you think he might have powerful enemies as well pitt sighed finlay no i think hes an arrogant young man who takes his pleasures whenever he wants to he answered one night in his hunger to feel powerful in control of other people he went a little too far and killed a prostitute when he saw what he had done he panicked and left her i think hes not as frightened as he should be because he imagines his father will somehow get him out of it in order to preserve his own dreams his voice hardened he doesnt feel the guilt he should because he barely thinks of ada mckinley as of the same species as himself its a bit like running over a dog its regrettable you wouldnt do it on purpose but then neither would you allow it to ruin your life cornwallis sat motionless for several moments his face filled with thought and a certain sadness you are probably right he said at last but my god if we charge him wed better be sure we can prove it is there anything more i should know no sir not yet pitt shook his head where are you going next back to pentecost alley if the evidence still stands up and its a slim hope theres anything new then ill start enquiring into the character and the past of finlay fitzjames i dont want to do it until i have to hes bound to learn of it cornwallis smiled bleakly hes already expecting it and hes begun taking appropriate steps pitt was not surprised although it was sooner than he had foreseen perhaps he should have he rose to his feet thank you for warning me sir ill be careful cornwallis rose also and held out his hand it was a spontaneous gesture and one pitt found peculiarly attractive he grasped cornwalliss hand hard for a moment then turned and left with a new warmth inside him ewart was already at the house in pentecost alley in the daylight he looked tired and harassed his receding hair had gray threads in it and his clothes were crumpled as though he had had no time or interest to spend on his appearance anything new pitt asked as he joined the inspector on the steps going up to the door no did you expect anything ewart stood back for pitt to go up first rose burke identified fitzjames pitt said as he reached the top it was hot the air stale smelling of old food and used linen ewart climbed up behind him in silence are you going to arrest him on that he said when they were inside the door his voice was tense rasping as though he were out of breath you shouldnt the jurys not likely to believe her over a man like fitzjames well lose pitt faced him in the dim light of the passage it was harder to see but there was no mistaking the urgency in him almost panic do you think hes guilty pitt asked almost casually ewart stared at him that isnt the point what i think is irrelevant there was a bang as someone slammed a door at the end of the passage and behind them in the street a carter was shouting at someone who was blocking his way not to me pitt said quietly what he looked disconcerted its not irrelevant to me pitt repeated oh ewart let out his breath in a rush well i dont know i just go by the facts so far it looks as if he did but we dont have enough yet i mean why would he far more likely someone she knew personally his voice gathered conviction youve got to consider the life of a woman like that she could have made all kinds of enemies they told us she was greedy she changed her pimp you know and one should look more into money property who owns this house for example what ewart said was true but pitt felt it was irrelevant in this case of course prostitutes got killed for a variety of reasons most of them to do with money one way or another but the broken fingers and toes the water and the boots buttoned together had no part in a crime of greed surely ewart must know that as well who does he asked aloud a woman called sarah barrows ewart replied with satisfaction and three other houses too farther west this is just rented out but at least two of the others are run as regular brothels she rents the dresses out as well in them the women here say they dont rent their clothes but thats beside the point ada didnt have to work only from here several of them dont you know they live one place and use shillinganhour rooms up the haymarket and leicester square area she could have skipped from there with dress money an all and some man followed her here and strangled her pitt said with disbelief why not ewart retorted some man followed her from somewhere and strangled her what is more likely a pimp she bilked or a gentleman customer like fitzjames i ask you let me put it differently pitt answered still keeping his voice low which is more likely that she used other rooms and cheated the owner who then followed herand i grant that brothel owners do have people hired to follow girls although its more often a prostitute past her working days than a young strong man one of the women came out of a door to their left and looked at them curiously for a moment then walked past and disappeared around the corner at the end of the passage but let us grant that she took a dress he continued and her earnings and came back here and was followed this man instead of warning her taking the money and the dress perhaps knocking her around a bit to teach her a lesson he breaks her fingers and toes he noticed ewart wince and saw the distaste in his face but ignored it he takes off the stocking and strangles her with it he went on he ties her garter round her arm and then after she is dead buttons her boots to each other throws a pitcher of cold water over her and leaves ewart opened his mouth to protest but was too filled with disgust and confusion to find the words or alternatively pitt suggested a customer does these things as part of his particular fetish he likes to threaten cause a little pain or fear thats what excites him but this time it goes too far and the girl is really dead he panics and leaves what do you think ewarts face was sullen and there was a flicker of unmistakable fear in his dark eyes the passageway was hot and the air close there was sweat on his skin and on pitts also i think weve got to be damned careful we dont make a mistake he said harshly fitzjames wont deny he was here sometime if it comes to facing him with it his lawyerll advise him to do that lots of respectable men use prostitutes we all know it you cant expect a young man to curb his natural feelings all his youth and he might not be able to afford a good marriage until hes in his late thirties or more its better not talked about but if we force it into the open no onell be surprised just angered by the bad taste of speaking about it he took a deep breath and rubbed the back of his hand across his brow the carter was still shouting outside hell say he was here but not that night she must have stolen the badge hed not be the first man to have something pretty stolen at a brothel good god man in times past there were places in bluegate fields and saint giles where a mand be lucky to get out with his skin whole he gestured sharply with his arm ive seen em running out without shirt or trousers naked as a jaybird and scared out of their wits covered in bruises and scars nor would he be the first to go back in a temper and beat the thief pitt pointed out i dont think hed be well advised to try that story but there wasnt a fight ewart said with a sudden smile lennox said that and we saw it for ourselves which proves what ewarts eyes opened wide that that he took her by surprise of course that he was someone she knew and wasnt afraid of not a customer from whom shed just stolen something ewart was losing his patience i dont know what it proves except weve a long way to go yet he turned away and pushed the door to adas room it swung open and pitt followed him inside it was exactly the same as when they had first come except that the body of ada was no longer there the window was closed and it was oppressively hot ive searched right through it ewart said wearily theres nothing here except exactly what youd expect it doesnt tell us anything about her no letters if she had anyone either they didnt write or she didnt keep them pitt stood in the middle of the floor they probably couldnt write he said sadly many people cant no way to keep in touch any pictures that was a forlorn hope too people like ada would have little money for photographs or portraits no ewart shook his head oh theres a pencil sketch of a woman but its fairly rough it could be anyone theres nothing written on it he walked over and took it out of a small case inside the chest where it was kept with a few handkerchiefs pins and a comb he gave it to pitt pitt looked at the piece of paper it was bent around the edges a little scarred across one corner the sketch was simple as ewart had said of a woman of perhaps thirty with a gentle face half smiling her hair piled on her head it had a grace in the lines but it was only a rough sketch the work of a few moments by an unskilled hand perhaps it was adas mother all she had of her past of a time and place where she belonged suddenly he was so choked with anger he could have beaten finlay fitzjames black and blue himself whether he had killed ada or not simply because he did not care sir ewarts voice broke across his thoughts what he said looking up sharply ive already asked around and learned a lot about her life the sort of customers she had where she went regular if she could have crossed up someone its always possible you know that the boots and the garter were from her last customer and not necessarily to do with whoever killed her have you pitt asked and what did you discover ewart looked profoundly unhappy his face was puckered and the sweat on his skin gleamed wet she was cheeky a bit too much brass for her own good he said slowly changed her pimp a short while ago chucked him over and got someone new now he could be taking it hard she was a nice bit of income for him and he could have had a personal interest not impossible she was handsome what did he look like pitt asked trying to quell the flicker of hope inside him ewarts eyes avoided his thin he answered dark he tailed off the pimp was nothing at all like the man rose burke and nan sullivan had described it was pointless to discuss it any further of course they must know all they could about adas life and then about finlay fitzjamess as well well youd better follow up the new pimp pitt said wearily ill speak to these women again in fact pitt had considerable trouble raising anyone but a quarter of an hour later he was sitting on a hardbacked wooden chair in the kitchen with nan sullivan who looked exhausted blowsy and blearyeyed every time he changed his balance the chair tilted and threatened to tip over he asked her to tell him again what she remembered of the night ada had been killed it was not that he expected any new evidence he wanted to weigh up what impression she might make on a jury and whether anyone would believe her rather than finlay fitzjames she stared at pitt her eyes blinking unfocused describe the man you saw going into adas room pitt prompted steadying himself on the chair again a couple of flies droned lazily around the window there were two pails standing with cloths over them probably water fair hair he had nan answered him thick and a good coat thats all i can say for sure she looked away avoiding pitts eyes wouldnt know him again only saw his back expensive sort of coat i do know a good coat she bit her lip and her eyes filled with tears i used to work in a shop making coats after me man died but you cant keep two little ones alive on what they pay you worked all day and half into the night i did but still only made six shillins a week an whatll that get you couldve kept me virtue an put the baby to one o them farms but i know what happens to them sell em they do into holy mother knows what or if theyre sickly let the poor souls die leave them to starve so they do pitt said nothing he knew what she said was true he knew sweatshop wages and he had seen baby farms there was no sound in the rest of the house the other women were out or asleep from outside in the street came the distant noise of wheels and hooves on the stones and a man calling out the sweatshop opposite was busy all heads bent over the needle they were already five hours into their day or i could have gone to the workhouse nan went on slowly but then theyd have taken the little ones away from me i couldnt bear that if i went on the streets i could feed us all what happened to your children he asked gently then instantly wished he had not he did not want to be compelled to share her tragedy she smiled looking up at him grew up she answered mary went into service and done well for herself bridget got married to a butcher out camden way pitt did not ask any more he could imagine for himself what two girls would do to keep the precious gift their mother had given them they might think of her now and again might even have some idea of what their wellbeing had cost but nothing would bring them back here to pentecost alley and it was probably better so she could imagine their happiness and they could carry only early memories of her before she became worn out shabby and stained by life well done he said and meant it profoundly steadying himself on the chair as it tilted dangerously adas child died poor thing she did not say whether her pity was for the child or for ada herself id tell you who did it if i knew mister but i dont anywayshe shrugged her wide shouldersas mr ewart said whod believe me anyway pitt felt a wave of anger again did mr ewart say that not in them words but thats what he meant an hes right int he that depends on several things pitt said evading the question he could tell the truth she would not have thanked him for it but if you arent sure then it doesnt matter anyway tell me more about ada if it wasnt fitzjames who do you think it was she was silent so long he thought she was not going to answer flies droned against the glass there was a banging upstairs and along the corridor someone swore finally she spoke well if it werent for the boots all buttoned up id have said costigan hes her new pimp nasty piece of work he is an no mistake pretty she said the word with condemnation thinks every woman should want after him temper like a mousetrap all cheese one minute an then bang takes off your legs she shrugged but hes a coward i know that sort the moment hed seen she was dead hed have taken off scared for his life hed never have stopped to do up the boots an put the garter round her arm she looked at pitt blankly so i reckon as it was her customer fitzjames or not she had not mentioned the broken fingers and toes but then she did not know about them perhaps it was the customer who did the boots and the garter he suggested and then costigan came in before she had time to undo them it was a reasonable thought nan shook her head me or rosied have seen him if thered have been two or agnes it may look as if no one sees who comes and goes in these rooms but it isnt that way we look out for each other have to mostly its old madge who watches never know what a customer might do some of them have too much to drink and get nasty some want you to do things a sane person wouldnt ever think of she blinked and sniffed hard wiping her nose on a piece of rag thats whats funny about it youd have thought shed have shouted out wouldnt you she cant have had any idea until the stocking was round her throat poor little bitch that doesnt sound like a firsttime customer pitt reasoned rather someone shed had before and expected to do something odd like that was costigan her lover as well as her pimp he leaned forward forgetting the chair which tipped violently hed like to have been she said with a curl of her lip she ignored the chair she was used to it dont think he was but then i dont know everything maybe but if she let him whyd he kill her i dont know thank you nan if you think of anything else tell meor mr ewart yeah yeah course i will she watched as he stood up and the chair righted itself with a clatter pitt spent several hours tracing all he could of adas daily life and found nothing different in it from the pattern of most women who made their living on the streets she rose in the middle of the afternoon dressed ate her main meal then started to walk the pavements very often she stayed in the whitechapel area there were plenty of customers but sometimes if it was a fine evening and especially in the summer she would go up to the traditional areas for picking up wealthier men windmill street the haymarket leicester square there the theater crowds elegant ladies and men about town paraded side by side with prostitutes of all classes and ages from the welldressed expensive courtesans down to the ten or twelveyearold children who ran along tugging at sleeves whispering obscene offers desperate for a few pence ada had been beaten the occasional time usually by her former pimp a man named wayland a meanfaced parttime drayman who supplemented his income by sometimes bullying sometimes protecting girls in the pentecost alley area he had lodgings opposite and spent much of his time lounging around watching to see that the girls were not actually molested in the open once they were inside any restraint of a violent or dishonest client was up to them there was a woman old madge the one nan had referred to who had been a prostitute herself in her better days and who roomed in the back of the house and she would come if anyone screamed her sight was poor but her hearing was excellent and she could wield a rolling pin with accuracy and the full benefit of her twenty stone she had half killed more than one client whose demands she had considered unreasonable but like anyone else even agnes in the next room she had heard nothing from ada the night of her death wayland could be accounted for all that night by one of his new acquisitions a plainfaced girl of eighteen or so whose extremely handsome figure earned them both a comfortable income and as ewart had admitted he looked nothing whatever like the man rose and nan had described he was small and thin with dark straight hair like streaks of black paint over his narrow skull there had been hasty quarrels in adas life flares of temper and then quick forgiveness she had not been one to hold a grudge there were impetuous acts of kindness the sharing of clothes the gift of a pound when times were hard praise sometimes when it was least merited she had sat up all night with old madge when she was sick fetching and carrying for her washing her down with clean hot water emptying slops all when she could have been out earning and sitting back in the kitchen again on the same rickety chair looking at madges wornout red face pitt thought that if they found who had killed ada he would be better off with the law than left to madge looked arter me good she did she said staring at pitt fixedly i should ave eard er wy dint i ear er call out eh id a killed the swine afore id a let im urt er i int no use no more grief puckered her huge cheeks and her voice high for so vast a woman was thick with guilt look wot i done for ernuffink were were i wen she needed me ere alf asleep like as not great useless mare she didnt cry out pitt said quietly and it could all have been over quite quickly anyway yer lying ter me she said forcing a smile yer mean ter be kind which int nuffink bad but i seen folk choked afore they dont die that quick an leastways i mightve caught the bastard id ave finished im with me pin she gestured towards the rolling pin on the table near her right hand then you couldve topped me fer it an idve gorn glad i wouldnt have topped you for it madge he said honestly id have called it selfdefense and looked the other way yeah mebbe yer would an all but even though he also went and found albert costigana brash man of about thirty sharply dressed and with thick brown hairpitt learned nothing either to confirm or disprove his belief in finlay fitzjamess guilt pitt decided to learn all he could about finlay himself it would be difficult and he was afraid of prejudicing any information he might acquire simply by the act of having sought it had there been time it was the type of investigation charlotte would have helped with and had done so excellently in the past it needed subtlety and acute observation simple questions were not going to uncover what he wanted to know pitt had already asked discreetly in the force about finlayand learned nothing other police superintendents knew only his name and then only in connection with his father pitt had made an appointment to see micah drummond who had been his superior before he had inherited the position drummond had gone to live abroad with his new wife finding london social life intolerable for her after the scandal of her first husbands death micah returned home from time to time and fortunately this investigation coincided with one of those occasions he would at least be honest with pitt and have the courage to disregard the political implications perhaps emily was the one to ask she moved in society and might hear whispers which would at least tell him in which direction to look jack would not be pleased that she should be given even the slightest encouragement to meddle again but all pitt wanted was information he thought of helliwell and thirlstone they were the ones who would know finlay best but they would close ranks as they had begun to already it was part of the creed of a gentleman that he did not betray his friends loyalty was the first prerequisite pitt was an outsider they would never speak ill of finlay to him no matter what they thought privately or possibly even knew at the foreign office he went in and gave the name of the man with whom he had made his first appointment he was shown upstairs and along a wide gracious corridor into an outer office where he was obliged to wait for nearly a quarter of an hour eventually a handsome grayhaired man came in his face composed his dress faultless he closed the door behind him the room was charming a french impressionist painting all sunlight and shadows hung on one of the paneled walls there was a tree beyond the window do sit down superintendent pitt im so sorry for having kept you waiting but you explained your errand in your letter and i wished to have ready for you all the information you could possibly find useful he looked at pitt pointedly i do hope you will be able to clear up this matter quickly most unfortunate pitt sat down as if he had every intention of remaining for some time thank you mr grainger i hope so too he crossed his legs and waited for grainger to sit also he did so reluctantly towards the edge of his chair i dont know what i can tell you of relevance he said frowning mr fitzjames has never given cause for anxiety as to his private life of course before considering him for an ambassadorial post it would be most satisfactory if he were to make a fortunate marriage he shrugged very slightly but no doubt he will he is young thirtythree pitt pointed out quite a good age to consider such a step and he is most eligible what has any of this to do with your investigation you are considering him for an ambassadorial appointment grainger hesitated unwilling to commit himself when he was beginning to sense the possibility of something embarrassing you are not pitt concluded you have found him not entirely suitable after all i did not say that grainger replied tartly stung to be so bluntly interpreted i really do not wish to discuss it with you so freely it is a highly confidential matter pitt did not move if you considered him mr grainger pitt went on then you will have made your own enquiries into his personal life he made it a statement not a question i realize your findings are confidential but it would be a great deal pleasanter for mr fitzjames if i were to learn what i need from you who enquired for the most honorable of reasons rather than on my own behalf when i am investigating a particularly sordid murder in whitechapel you make your point mr pitt grainger said with a sudden tightening of his face i should be reluctant to have you do that for the embarrassment to his family and for the shadow it would cast on his career which i am sure you understand of course that is why i came to you very well grainger began resignedly six or seven years ago he was a very raw and arrogant young man who took his pleasures wherever he wished he drove far too fast his father had bought him a very fine pair of horses which he raced against other young men frequently in the public streets he stared at pitt with cold blue eyes but no one was ever seriously hurt and it is something many rich young men do hardly a matter for comment he made a steeple of his fingers he gambled but always paid his debtsor his father did anyway he left no dishonor no one with ill feeling and he certainly never cheated which of course would be unforgivable i assumed that pitt agreed with a smile what about women he flirted naturally but i never heard that anyone had cause for offense left a few broken hearts and was occasionally disappointed himself at one time his name was linked with one of rutlands daughters i believe but nothing came of it but there was no talk nothing against either of them i daresay she just received a better offer altogether a faultless young man pitt said a trifle sarcastically grainger drew in a deep breath keeping the irritation from his features with an obvious effort no of course not you know mr pitt that that is not so or i would merely have stated it and left you to your investigation he frequented a good few houses of ill repute he spent his share of time in the haymarket and the surrounding areas and a lot of nights a great deal more drunk than sober his tastes were at times rather more lurid than one would wish and his selfindulgence something better forgotten he leveled his stare at pitt but it has been forgotten superintendent i daresay as a young man you had a few episodes you would prefer were not raised again and perhaps of which your wife remains ignorant of course you have so have i he said it like a rehearsed speech without a shadow of humor pitt felt himself blush and it surprised him there was nothing in his past which was shockingsimply clumsy and extremely selfish things he would far rather charlotte never knew they would alter the way she saw him could that really be all there was to finlay fitzjames as if reading his thoughts grainger went on you understand superintendent there are parts of all our lives which fate usually allows us to bury decently it is only when some other circumstance arises which compels us to face examination that they can be raised again for a few of us unfortunate enough to be at the wrong place at the wrong moment or of course to have enemies he left it in the air more than a suggestion less than a statement something pitt could complete for himself more effectively in his own imagination he thought about it for a moment was it conceivable that finlay or his father had enemies clever enough and unscrupulous enough to have planted finlays badge at the scene of a murder it would be an extraordinary coincidence he looked at graingers smooth face he was a diplomat used to thinking of death far away in other countries of other sorts of people whom he never saw perhaps to a man like him dealing with men only as names and pieces of paper such an enemy was not unimaginable there was a bird on the tree he could see through the window enemies who would murder a woman in order to embarrass fitzjames he said with heavy doubt in his voice not finlay perhaps grainger conceded but his father augustus fitzjames is a very wealthy man and he was ruthless in the early days of his climb i agree that to murder someone simply to incriminate someone else is very extreme but it is not impossible mr pitt if hatred and ambition both run deep enough he held his hands apart then put them together again gently it seems to me at least as likely as the probability that a man such as finlay fitzjames who has everything to lose and nothing whatever to gain should visit a whitechapel prostitute and murder her superintendent i am sure you want to see justice done as much as i do not only in the courts but in the broader sense as well a reputation ruined a promotion lost cannot be set right again with an apology or a retraction i imagine you are as aware of that as i he stared at pitt with wide eyes and a very slight smile pitt left the foreign office with new shadows in his mind he lunched with micah drummond then the two of them walked slowly up the mall past ladies in beautiful dresses with narrow almost nonexistent bustles just a clever draping of the fabric that was the fashion of the moment their sweeping hats added an impossible grace parasols were folded and used elegantly almost like sticks he was here to talk about finlay fitzjames but even so he could not help occasionally glancing sideways with admiration and a distinct pleasure other men did the same gentlemen in beautifully cut suits and tall shiny hats soldiers in uniform ribboned and medaled there was laughter in the warm air and faraway snatches on the breeze of a barrel organ and children shouting in the park their feet made a slight crunch on the gravel a ruthless man micah drummond said using the same word grainger had he was speaking about augustus fitzjames of course he had enemies pitt but hardly the sort who would frequent whitechapel or find themselves in a pentecost alley tenement most of them are his own age for a start elderly gentlemen use prostitutes as much as anyone else pitt said with impatience and you must know that of course i know it drummond conceded wrinkling his nose he looked extremely well not quite as thin as in the past and his skin had the warmth of the sun on it but not in the whitechapel area think about it pitt he raised his hat as he passed a lady who was apparently an acquaintance and then turned back to pitt if the sort of man you are describing were to kill a prostitute in order to implicate fitzjames hed choose one of the better class of women the sort he would use himself around windmill street or the haymarket he wouldnt enter into an area he didnt know and where hed be remembered as different but he was remembered pitt half turned towards him thats just the point perhaps he was afraid hed be recognized in his own haunts and when did he get the hellfire club badge drummond added i dont know perhaps he got it by chance and that gave him the idea opportunism drummond was skeptical perhaps pitt agreed and maybe the chance to use the murder was opportunism as well drummond looked sideways at him his long face full of wordless disbelief although pitt conceded im listening to the evidence it probably was finlay i daresay he has a vicious streak in him which hes kept under control pretty well until now and this time he went too far he wouldnt be the first wellbred man to enjoy hurting people and be willing to pay for his entertainment he took a deep breath or the first to lose control and end in killing someone a small black dog trundled past them nose to the ground tail high no drummond said sadly and im afraid it fits in with what little i know of him from my days in bow street pitt stopped abruptly drummond put his hands in his pockets and continued walking but more slowly pitt increased his pace to catch up with him we had to cover up one or two unpleasantries a few years ago drummond went on seven or eight years almost one incident was a brawl in one of the alleys off the haymarket several young men had drunk too much and it ended in a very nasty affray one of the women was fairly badly beaten you said one or two pitt prompted the other i recall was a fight with a pimp he said fitzjames had asked for something unusual and when it wasnt given had refused to pay apparently hed already had the regular services and when she wouldnt do whatever it was he became very unpleasant unusually the pimp came off quite badly there was a knife but both of them seem to have been cut with it not seriously but that was hushed up too pitt was not sure whether he was surprised or not the picture was becoming uglier more into the pattern both he and ewart feared well there wasnt a crime drummond pointed out touching his hat absentmindedly to another acquaintance passing by unless you want to call disturbing the peace a crime it didnt seem worth a prosecution hed have fought against it and the pimp was hardly a good witness what was it fitzjames wanted the girl to do pitt remembered the boots buttoned together in pentecost alley the cold water and the garter around ada mckinleys arm he assumed the broken fingers were a cruelty peculiar to this particular incident i dont know drummond confessed what was the pimps name pitt went on what date was it i can look it up in the records you did keep a record didnt you no i didnt drummond looked uncomfortable im sorry pitt i think i was a little more naive then he did not say any more about it but they both knew the world of experience they had seen since then the corruption and the ugliness of influence misused the inner dishonesties they walked in silence for fifty yards no sound but their feet on the gravel of the path do you remember his name pitt asked at length drummond sighed yes percy manker but it wont do any good he died of an overdose of opium the river police pulled him out of limehouse reach im sorry pitt said nothing they walked a little farther in the sun then turned and retraced their steps they did not speak any more about fitzjames choosing instead to think of pleasanter things domestic and family matters drummond asked after charlotte and told pitt about his own wifes happiness in their new home and the small businesses of daily life pitt had no hope of learning anything of value about finlay fitzjames from helliwell or thirlstone he had thought he might persuade jago jones that truth in this case was a higher good than personal loyalty joness parishioners had the right to expect a certain loyalty from him as well and ada had been a parishioner in however loose a sense he found jago alone in the church itself the sunlight streaming in through the windows into bright patterns on the stone floor and across the worn pews he turned in surprise when he saw pitt walking up the aisle thank you for coming he said pitt knew he did not mean this occasion but the brief half hour he had spent at adas funeral two days before he smiled there was no answer to make what brings you now jago asked walking down towards where a longhandled broom was resting against the first pew do you know who killed ada i think so jagos eyebrows rose but you are not sure that means you dont have proof i have a very strong indication it just seems such a stupid thing to have done i need a clearer picture of the man in order to believe it i already have a picture of ada jago shook his head well ada i could have helped you with the man i doubt i know he picked up the broom and began to sweep the last area of the floor which still needed doing you dont mind not at all pitt conceded sitting on the pew and crossing his legs youre wrong you do know the man or at least you did jago stopped still standing with the broom in his hands his shoulders back he did not turn to look at pitt you mean finlay yes because of the badge i told you he could have lost that years ago possibly but he didnt leave it in ada mckinleys bed years ago reverend jago said nothing the unlikelihood of someone elses having stolen the badge or found it by accident and chancing to have left it by the dead womans bed and the cuff link also lay unspoken between them jago continued sweeping the floor carefully directing the dust and grit into a little pile pitt watched him the sunlight slanted in through the windows in bright dusty bars you knew him well a few years ago pitt said at last have you seen him at all since then very little jago did not look up i dont frequent the places he does i never go to mayfair or whitehall and he doesnt come to saint marys you dont say that he doesnt come to whitechapel pitt pointed out jago smiled thats rather the matter at issue isnt it have you ever seen him here no or heard that he was here jago straightened up no superintendent i have never heard of finlay being here nor have i reason to suppose that he has been pitt believed him yet there was something in jagos attitude which disturbed him there was a pain in him an anxiety which was more than merely sadness for the violent death of someone he had known however slightly when he had first told him they had found finlays badge he had looked like a man in a nightmare he changed his approach what was finlay like when you knew him jago swept up the dust in a pan and set it aside before he answered propping the broom up against the wall younger and very much more foolish superintendent we all were i am not proud of my behavior in those times i was extremely selfish i indulged my tastes whenever i could with disregard for the consequences to others it is not a time i look back on with any pleasure i imagine it may well be the same for finlay one grows up one cannot undo the selfishness of youth but one can leave it behind learn from its mistakes and avoid too quick or too cruel a judgment on those who in their turn do likewise pitt did not doubt his sincerity but he also had the feeling it was a speech he had prepared in his mind for the time he should be asked you have told me a lot about yourself reverend but not about finlay fitzjames jago shook his head very slightly theres nothing to tell we were all selfindulgent if you are asking me if finlay has also changed grown up then since i have not seen him above a couple of times in the last three years i cannot answer you from my knowledge i imagine so i learned where to find you through his sister presumably you are still acquainted with her pitt pressed jago laughed very slightly tallulah yes in a manner of speaking she is still in that stage of selfishness and the allconsuming pursuit of pleasure that the members of the hellfire club indulged in six or seven years ago she has yet to see the purpose of any other kind of existence he said no more in words but the expression of weariness in his face the slight tightness to his lips showed vividly how little regard he had for her it was as if he did not wish to despise her but could not help himself he despised his own past life at the same time as he asked compassion for finlay why was it a fear that finlay had not in fact grown beyond it at all but like tallulah still placed his pleasures above honor or responsibility why has your friendship lapsed so completely pitt asked as if he were no more than mildly curious jago did not move he stared at pitt without speaking he drew in his breath as if to reply then let it out again somewhere beyond the church a woman called out to a child and a dog scampered past the open door pitt waited i suppose i suppose our paths just diverged jago said at last his eyes wide and dark he was saying something far less than the truth and even as he did so he knew that pitt knew it pitt did not bother to argue i admire your loyalty reverend he said very quietly but are you sure that it is as commendable as you think what about your loyalty to ada mckinley who was one of your parishioners whatever her trade what about the other women like her they may be whores but if you have set yourself as their shepherd dont you also have a loyalty to the truth and to the path youve chosen jagos face was white the flesh seemed to be pulled tight as though by some desperate inner strain i do not know who killed ada superintendent i tell you before god i do not nor do i have any reason to believe that finlay was here in whitechapel that night or any other if i did i would tell you he took a deep breath as to my friendship with the fitzjames family it lapsed because of a difference of opinionof purpose if you like finlay could not understand my taking this calling nor my wish to devote my life to it it is not something i could explain except in terms he did not believe or respect he thinks i am eccentric as does his sister eccentric jago laughed this time there was real amusement in his voice oh not in any admirable sense she admires the aesthetes men like oscar wilde and arthur symons or havelock ellis who are endlessly inventive always saying or doing or believing something new their purpose is to shock and cause comment and i suppose possibly also to make people think they see me as an utterly different kind of eccentric i am a bore the only thing even their moral tolerance will not forgive it is the one sin that cannot be overlooked pitt searched but he could see no selfpity in jagos face no bitterness whatsoever for him they had missed the real happiness not he and yet there was still the shadow behind his smile the awareness of something he would not tell pitt something which was full of darkness and pain was it knowledge of finlay fitzjames or of himself or was it possibly one of the other members of the hellfire club either the sensual thirlstone or the selfsatisfied helliwell are you still friendly with any of the other members of the hellfire club he asked suddenly what jago seemed surprised oh no no i am afraid not i see thirlstone from time to time but by chance not design i havent seen helliwell in a couple of years hes done nicely for himself i hear married and became respectableand very welloff it was what he always wished once he had had his fling what does finlay want jago smiled again this time with patience im not sure if he knows probably to fulfill his fathers ambitions for him without the hard work and the pressure which they must inevitably involve i dont think he really wants to be foreign secretary still less prime minister but then i suppose augustus will die before it comes to that anyway and hell be able to relax and be what he truly wants if he can still remember what that is he stopped maybe tallulah will marry well and become a duchess or a great countess i doubt she has the intelligence to be a great political wife that requires considerable skill and tact and a profound understanding of the issues and of human nature as well as fashion and etiquette and how to be entertaining she hasnt the discretion for one thing might she not acquire it pitt asked shes still very young theres no good acquiring discretion once youve marred your own reputation superintendent society doesnt forget at least thats not exactly true it will to a certain extent if you are a man but not if you are a woman depends what you do he leaned against the pew relaxing a little at last ive known young men to behave really badly being drunk and extremely offensive and their comrades will hold a trial and decide he is guilty of a breach of behavior which cannot be overlooked then he will be advised that he should volunteer for some foreign service say in africa or india for example and not return pitt stared at him stunned and he will do so jago finished society will discipline its own some things are not accepted he stood upright of course others are sometimes things you or i might find abhorrent it depends on how public the outrage is and against whom if you want me to say finlay never visited a prostitute i cant but then you know that already if that were a crime you could charge half the gentlemen in london where else are they to take their appetites a decent woman would be ruined and they themselves would not want her afterwards i know that pitt agreed is that the issue no jago conceded looking at pitt thoughtfully but old augustus has made a great many enemies you know people he used and threw away in his rise to power people who lost because he won theres more than one family owes its misfortune to him and a great house doesnt forgive its ruin there are a few political ambitions which would be helped along if it were known they had destroyed fitzjames power is cruel superintendent and envy is crueler before you commit yourself to any action against finlay be sure it really was he who left the badge in pentecost alley and not one of his fathers enemies i i find it terribly difficult to believe it was the man i knew and i knew him well then pitt searched his face trying to read in it the emotions behind his words and saw too many conflicting currents but through them all a certainty of gentleness and even in his eyes a restraint from judgment he rose to his feet thank you reverend i cant say that you have helped me greatly but then i shouldnt have expected it he bade him goodbye and walked out into the hot street with its noise and traffic its horses and scurrying people on foot the clatter of hooves voices and film of dirt he felt an even deeper liking for jago jones than before and a conviction that in some fundamental way he was lying well have you learned anything else about fitzjames cornwallis said in exasperation it was the end of the day and the sun had already set in an orange ball behind the wreath of chimney smoke that lay over the rooftops the heat still burned up from the pavements and the smell of horse droppings was pungent where crossing sweepers had shoveled it to one side but no carts had been by to pick it up carriages still bowled along the streets as the lamps came on electric now along the thames embankment people were beginning to think of the theater and the opera restaurant dinners and evening parties the lights of pleasure boats were visible on the river and the sound of music drifted up no pitt answered wearily standing beside cornwallis at the window jago jones wont say more than that they were all wild half a dozen years ago and that he hasnt kept more than casual touch since then and thats easy to believe since hes now a priest in whitechapel he smiled for an instant not exactly fitzjamess territory the foreign office says hes able diligent behaves as well as most young men and better than some and as soon as he marries suitably he is likely to get a very good embassy post he certainly has talent in that direction and a good deal of charm but you have rose burkes identification of him cornwallis insisted turning away from the window to stare at pitt and the badge and the cuff link have you had that identified as his yes cornwalliss face was grave then whats troubling you pitt have you some evidence you havent told me of or are you worried about political pressure he shook his head slightly fitzjamess friends are increasing their pressure but it will never stop me from backing you totallyif you are sure hes guilty and you can prove it thank you sir pitt meant it profoundly it was a gift beyond price to have a superior whose nerve held under fire even when his own position might be threatened he was less certain of his judgment did he really have an understanding of how powerful augustus fitzjamess friends might be and how little innocence or guilt might matter to them so long as there was every chance it would never be exposed and had he also considered that fitzjames might also have enemies who were equally powerful jago joness words rang in his mind and he could not ignore them you havent answered me cornwallis broke the train of his thoughts i wish i had someone else who had seen finlay in whitechapel anyone else at all pitt replied i cant find any evidence of his having been there that night or at any other time ill put tellman on it tomorrow as discreetly as possible doesnt prove anything cornwallis continued he may usually do his whoring in the haymarket doesnt mean to say he didnt go to whitechapel this time have you tried cabbies other street women local constables on the beat ewart has no one has seen him but they know him farther west damn cornwallis swore under his breath when were the cuff link and the badge last seen by his valet or anyone whose evidence is reasonably unprejudiced valets been with him for years and has never seen either pitt replied cornwallis digested this in silence the carriage lamps moved slowly along the street towards them and the sound of wheels and hooves came up through the still air what do you think pitt he said at last i think hes guilty but i dont think weve proved it yet pitt replied surprising himself as he said it but im not sure he added well youd better make sure cornwallis said grimly within the next week yes sir pitt agreed ill try emily spent a very ordinary day like any other during the london season she rose at eight and at nine went riding in the park where she nodded to a score of acquaintances all of whom were agreeable enough but none were particular friends but the day was fine the air brisk and sweet and her horse was an excellent beast she rode well and returned a little after ten feeling invigorated jack had already left for whitehall and edward was in the schoolroom so she ate alone evie was in the nursery being cared for by the nursemaid she spent the next two hours reading and answering correspondence of which there was not a great deal largely she wasted time she planned the days menu over which she could not consult jack because he was not there next she called the housekeeper and discussed half a dozen domestic matters with her regarding linen parlor maids duties the new scullery maid the mark on the library carpet and several other things to discover they had all been dealt with satisfactorily without her advice she spoke to her ladies maid and found that she too had already solved all the minor problems which had arisen the red ink on the sleeve of my morning dress she began she had been leaning over edwards map of india admiring it already done it mlady gwen said with satisfaction gone emily was amazed red ink yes mlady mustard does it smeared a little mustard over it before it was laundered works a treat thank you an if i could have a few drops of gin mlady ill clean up the diamonds in your bracelet theyve got a bit dusty over use i asked cook but she wouldnt give it me without your sayso reckon she thought i might drink it yes of course emily agreed feeling utterly redundant she fared no better with the nursemaid and the cook at noon she left the house in her own carriage and went to call upon her mother only to find that she was out she debated whether to go shopping or visit an art gallery and decided upon the latter it was extremely boring the pictures were all very genteel and to her appeared exactly the same as the exhibition the previous year she returned home where she was joined for luncheon by her grandmother who demanded an account of her morning and her plans for the remainder of the week when she had heard them she dismissed them as trivial scatterbrained and totally frivolous she spoke out of envy because she would dearly have liked to have done the same but emily privately agreed with her you should be supporting your husband the old lady said viciously you should be engaged in some worthy work i was at your age i was on the parish council for unmarried mothers i cant tell you the number of wicked girls whose futures i helped decide god help them emily muttered what did you say the old woman demanded how helpful emily lied she did not want a fullscale battle at half past three she attended an afternoon concert with the wife of one of jacks friends a worthy woman with very limited conversation she found almost everything uplifting at half past four they went together to a garden party and remained for half an hour by which time emily was ready to scream she wished she had paid afternoon calls instead or gone to a charity bazaar alone but it was too late at half past six jack returned home in something of a hurry they dined in haste and then changed before leaving for a theater party with friends they knew only slightly at half past eleven they had supper made a great deal of light very trivial conversation by a quarter to one she was in bed and too tired to think constructively but quite sure the day had been wasted tomorrow she would do something with purpose in the morning she could use the telephone and discover at which social function she could expect to run into tallulah fitzjames she would address the matter of helping her either with her romantic decision regarding jago and how to effect a satisfactory conclusion or else with clearing her brother of the suspicion of having committed the murder in whitechapel or possibly even both at a little after two oclock having lunched early emily dressed in her most gorgeously fashionable afternoon gown an exquisitely cut pink brocade with a confection of silk at bosom neck and elbow and a skirt which moved most flatteringly as she walked she took an outrageous hat one by which even aunt vespasia would be impressed and a matching parasol then set out for a flower show in kensington where she had ascertained tallulah was very likely to be she arrived at three alighted from her carriage and immediately saw several ladies of her acquaintance she was obliged to exchange greetings and to accompany them into the succession of tents and enclosures filled with arrays of flowers and blooming shrubs and trees small wroughtiron tables painted white were set between with two or three graceful chairs by each beautifully dressed ladies wandered from arrangement to arrangement often accompanied by gentlemen in afternoon frock coats cutaway jackets striped trousers and shiny tall hats here and there young girls of twelve or fourteen stood primly in flounced dresses long hair held back with ribbons around their heads or made faces at each other when they imagined no one was looking emilys heart sank she had forgotten how crowded flower shows were how many winding pathways there were between the exhibits arbors under potted trees and places between arrays of blossoms and under overhanging boughs where people might talk discreetly or flirt one could keep assignations with little chance of being seen by those one would prefer to avoid no doubt that was why tallulah had chosen such a place it sounded so respectable what could be more appropriate for a young lady to attend than a flower show how feminine how delightfully innocent no doubt she could learn much about gardens conservatories and the tasteful ways of decorating ones formal rooms for dinners soirees or any other manner of receiving guests all of which would be the last thing on tallulahs mind emily asked quite casually if anyone had seen miss fitzjames inventing some slight reason for wanting to speak to hera friend in common a milliners name it took her nearly an hour before she found her and then it was by chance she came around the corner of a large exhibit of late roses and some highstanding very vivid yellow lilies and saw tallulah sitting in an arbor created out of the twined branches of a vine she was leaning back her feet on the chair as though it were a chaise longue skirts draped carelessly her long slender throat arched her dark hair was beginning to fall a little out of its pins it was a relaxed seductive pose graceful and inviting the young man beside her was plainly entranced he leaned farther and farther forward as she regarded him lazily through halfclosed eyes emily could completely understand the desire to behave shockingly she herself had never done anything of the sort but then she had so far not been severely tempted not yet why tallulah how nice to see you she said utterly ingenuously as if they had bumped into each other walking in the park arent the flowers gorgeous i would never have thought they could find as much as this so late in the year tallulah stared at her in amazement turning to dismay such a breach of tact was inexcusable emily should have withdrawn blushing and suitably taken aback emily stood precisely where she was a bland smile on her face i always think august is a difficult season she went on cheerfully too late for one thing and too early for another there seems to me to be plenty of flowers the young man said pinkfaced he straightened his tie and collar as if he were trying to appear to be doing something else i am sure there are sir emily agreed fixing her eyes on his hands to men there always seem to be plenty of flowers she let the remark hang in the air with its double meaning and turned to tallulah her bright smile back again i have been thinking quite hard about the matter you discussed with me the last time we had an opportunity to talk together i would so like to be of assistance i am sure something could be done tallulah continued to stare at her but gradually the lightness died out of her face she straightened up ignoring her gown and the angle to which it had slipped are you it is much worse you know it is all much worse the young man realized that the conversation had proceeded beyond anything of which he was aware he rose and excused himself doing it with surprising flair in the circumstances and with a bow took his leave tallulah readjusted her gown her face now very somber i saw jago again she said quietly not for very long it was a charity bazaar i knew he would be there for his wretched church so i went he looked through me as if i were some naughty child he was obliged to be civil to as one does when other peoples children misbehave and one cannot do anything because their parents wont permit it she screwed up her face suffering with a weary and tolerant look i was so angry i could have slapped him emily saw the pain in tallulahs eyes and the struggle to know whether she should deny it or try to face and overcome it it was so much easier to pretend it was only anger she felt not pain emily sat down where the young man had been the scent of the flowers was heavy in the air she was glad of the very slight breeze are you sure you dont want him simply because hes unattainable she said frankly tallulah thought about it in silence she sat down again where she had been before only this time more decorously her feet on the ground are you attracted to a man who adores you emily would not be put off no tallulah said immediately then she smiled are you not in the slightest emily confessed he has to be at the very least unsuitable but better he should need to be won as well the harder the battle the more the prize is worth men are the same of course it is simply that we are better on the whole at disguising it and pretending to be uninterested when we are actually enthralled jago is not enthralled tallulah said glumly at least not by me i might have a better chance of engaging his emotions if i were a fallen woman and he thought he could save my soul is that what you were about just now emily asked with a smile falling but tallulah was too hurt to be amused no of course not she said tartly i was merely bored it was all words and ideas if you knew sawyer youd know that everythings a pose with him emily sat back a little farther making herself comfortable it was very warm in the bower and the perfume of so many petals a trifle clinging why dont you simply forget jago she asked without pretense at subtlety the thought of him is only causing you distress a challenge is excellent but not one you cant win thats just depressing anyway what would you do if you had him you couldnt possibly marry him he hasnt any money or do you just want your revenge on him because he despises you or you think he does he does so you want revenge tallulah stared at her with the sunlight dappled on her face she had a kind of beauty one born of courage and a fierce vitality no i dont that would be horrible her voice sharpened in frustration you really dont understand at all do you jago is the best person ive ever known theres an honor in him and a gentleness unlike that in anyone else ive ever met hes honest she leaned forward i dont just mean he doesnt take things that arent his i mean he doesnt even want to he doesnt lie to other people but he doesnt lie to himself either thats rare you know i lie to myself all the time all my family does mostly about why they do things they say they had to when what they mean is they wanted to so they looked around for an excuse ive seen it all the time so have i emily admitted but im not sure i could live with anyone who always spoke the unadulterated truth i dont think i want to know it and im quite sure i dont want to hear it it may be very admirable but i would sooner admire it from a distance quite a large distance tallulah laughed but there was no happiness in it you are deliberately misunderstanding me i dont mean hes tactless or cruel i just mean he has a sort of light inside him hes whole his mind doesnt have lots of different pieces like most peoples all wanting different things and lying to each other so you can try to have everything and telling yourself its all right how do you know what how do you know that emily repeated how do you know what is inside him tallulah was silent two girls in pink and peach walked past them deep in conversation heads close together the brindled light in their hair i dont know why im explaining all this to you tallulah said at last it doesnt really fit into any words i know what i mean i know that he has a kind of courage that most people havent he faces what really matters without evasions and excuses his beliefs are whole she stared at emily do you understand me at all yes emily agreed quietly dropping the challenge from her voice i only wanted to see if you really care for him as much as you think wouldnt you find him a little serious after a while might not so much goodness become a trifle predictable and then ultimately become even boring tallulah turned her head away her profile outlined against the bank of blossoms it really doesnt matter hes never going to look at me as anything but finlay fitzjamess rather shallow sister who wastes her life buying dresses that cost enough to keep one of his whitechapel families in food and clothes for years she looked down at her exquisite skirt and smoothed it over the flat of her stomach this cost fiftyone pounds seventeen shillings and sixpence we pay our best maids twenty pounds a year the scullery maids and tweenies get less than half that i saw it in the household accounts and i have a dozen or more dresses as good as this one she shrugged and smiled and yet i go to church on sundays and pray and so does everyone else i know all dressed in clothes like this it isnt that jago would tell me im wrong if no one buys them then the people who make them have no trade he just wouldnt be bothered with me because i care so much what i look like but then for an unmarried woman thats what matters isnt it it was not a question but a statement of fact emily did not argue nor did she bother to mention money or family influence tallulah knew the rules as well as she did would you marry him she asked softly thinking of charlotte and pitt but charlotte was different she had never been the socialite that tallulah was her wit was far too acerbic her outspokenness seldomnot oftenfunny she was not intentionally outrageous she was a genuine misfit and to be honest it was not as if she had had so many other good offers she rather put people off although in spite of her fathers wealth if tallulah continued to behave as she had done this afternoon and the other evening in chelsea she might not receive any offers in the future there were many women whom people found vastly entertaining but did not marry tallulah sighed and looked up at the flowers overhead her expression a strange mixture of wistfulness and horror and a kind of desperate laughter at herself if i were to marry him i would have to live in whitechapel wear gray stuff dresses and be happy ladling out soup to the poor i should have to be polite to the selfrighteous women who think laughter is a sin and love is telling people what they ought to do i would eat the same food every day answer my own door and always watch what i said in case it offended anyone id never be able to go to the theater again or the opera or dine in restaurants or ride in the park worse than that emily put in youd have to ride on the omnibus crammed in with other people fat out of breath and smelling of onions youd have to do most of your own cooking and count your money to judge whether you could buy a thing or not and the answer would usually be not she was thinking of charlottes early years before pitts last promotion some of them had been hard but they had shared so much that emily now looked back on that time with a kind of envy she seemed to have shared more with jack before he had won his seat in parliament when there was still so much to work for and victory was uncertain and a long way away he had needed her so much more then it wouldnt be so bad as that tallulah argued papa would make me an allowance even if you married a parish priest instead of his choice for you emily said skeptically are you sure tallulah stared at her her eyes wide and dark brown nearly black no she said quietly no hed be furious hed never forgive me hed like me to marry a duke although an earl or a marquis might do i dont think his ambition has any ceiling to be honest if i thought about it harder it would frighten me nothing ever stops him he just finds a way around it people have tried to stand up to him but they never win distant laughter sounded somewhere behind them and a girl giggling it really was getting very hot have you emily asked tallulah shook her head ive never needed to would you to marry jago tallulah turned away i dont know perhaps not but as i said it doesnt matter jago wouldnt have me perhaps thats just as well emily said deliberately that you dont have to make up your mind what you really want to be rich and have pretty gowns parties trips to the theater and marry whoever your father tells you or marry a man you really love and admire and trust and help him in his lifes workin comparative poverty i dont suppose youd ever actually be hungry and youd always have a roof over your headbut it might leak tallulah swung around on the seat to stare at her in a flash of temper i dont suppose your roof leaks mrs radley she snapped even if jack radleys would ill lay any odds the late lord ashworths doesnt it was a reference to emilys first husband and his very considerable wealth emily might have resented the gibe but she knew she had provoked a retaliation and she accepted it as fair no it doesnt she agreed but whether i even took a decision or not is beside the point the thing is for you to recognize the reality of what your choices are no one has everything no relationship does look at jago carefully look at whoever else there is and decide what you want then fight for it you make it sound simple that part of it is no it isnt tallulah sat forward and leaned over putting her hands up over her cheeks it was a gesture of deep and troubled thought an elderly couple walked by heads close together in earnest conversation the womans parasol trailing the mans hat at a rakish angle she said something and they both laughed if this wretched business with finlay doesnt get solved soon tallulah went on suddenly her voice low and filled with anger and fear and the police dont stop asking everyone questions about us then it wont matter anyway well all be ruined and nobody will speak to any of us unless they have to ive known it to happen a story comes out it is whispered around and suddenly no one sees you you are invisible you can walk down the street and everyone is looking the other way you talk to people and they dont hear you her voice was rising with the fear inside her restaurants where you dine frequently find they are full whenever you call dressmakers are too busy to see you milliners have nothing to suit you your tailors cant fit you in you call on people and nobody is ever at home even if the lights are on and the carriages are lined up outside it is as if youd died without being aware of it it can happen over cheating at cards or welching on a debt of honor think what it would do over being hanged for murder this time emily did not rush in so quickly it was much too painful an issue to challenge beliefs or call it selfexamination she would like to have thought beyond doubt that of course finlay was innocent it was only a matter of waiting until pitt found the proof but she had known pitt long enough and seen sufficient cases of human tragedy and violence to have any such comfortable illusion people one loves people one imagines one knows can have aspects to their nature which are full of uncontrollable pain or anger dark needs even they barely understand if they are still investigating him then they have not yet proof she said aloud weighing her words carefully it means they still think he is guilty though tallulah responded instantly her eyes brilliant otherwise theyd leave him alone the heat in the arbor was motionless distant laughter sounded yards away although it was merely around the corner the clink of glass and china came clearly above the buzz of conversation but they were both too intent on the matter at hand to think of refreshment do you know why emily asked quietly tallulahs mouth tightened it was obviously something she had thought about and the answer troubled her yes there were belongings of his found where this woman was killed a badge from that ridiculous club he used to belong to and a cuff link he told them about it he said he lost both of them years ago he hasnt seen them and neither has anyone else her face tightened some sordid little policeman came and questioned his valet but hes only been with us for a few years and hed never seen them at all finlay certainly didnt have them that night she stared at emily defying her to disbelieve nothing else emily asked without changing her expression from one of strictly practical enquiry into fact yes actually some prostitute says she saw a man going into the womans room and swears he looked like finlay but how can they take her word against his no jury ever would she searched emilys eyes would they emily could feel the fear in tallulah as powerfully as the heat of the sun or the clinging scent of the flowers it was more real than the distant chatter or movement of color as a woman in an exquisite gown drifted by but was it fear of social ruin fear of being unjustly convicted or fear that perhaps he was not innocent at all i wouldnt have thought so emily said cautiously where was he that evening at a party in beaufort street i cant remember what number but nearer the river end well cant he prove it emily said with a rush of hope someone there must remember him in fact probably dozens of people do surely hes said so tallulah looked deeply unhappy wasnt he there emily asked yes yes he was tallulahs face creased with confusion and misery i saw him there myself a waiter strode by holding aloft a tray of chilled drinks in longstemmed glasses which chinked as they touched each other in the distance someone laughed emily realized there must be far more to the story something very ugly and very private she did not ask but you cannot say so she concluded the obvious tallulah turned to her quickly i would if i thought anyone would believe me im not trying to protect myself id clear fin in a second if i could but it wasnt that sort of party they were all taking opium and that kind of thing i was only there for about half an hour then i left but i did see fin although i think he was already too far gone to see me the place was full of people all laughing and either drunk or in a daze but you saw finlay definitely emily said with conviction you werent drunk or or on opium no tallulah took a shaky breath but you see when papa asked where i had been in front of mama and the servants and mamas doctor i said i had been somewhere else no one would believe me now theyd think i was just lying to protect fin and who wouldnt think so if i were them thats what id think emily would like to have argued said something comforting but she knew that tallulah was right no one would take her testimony seriously tallulah looked down at her hands lying on her skirt damnation she said fiercely isnt this a mess she clenched her fists sometimes hes so stupid i could hate him emily said nothing she was thinking hard searching for any thread she could grasp that might help this was a practical problem it would not be solved by indulging emotions however justified i remember i used to think he was marvelous tallulah went on as much to herself as to emily when i was young he used to have such exciting ideas he would invent games for us turn the whole nursery into another world a desert island a pirate ship the victory at trafalgar or a palace or the houses of parliament she smiled and her eyes were soft with the memory or a forest with dragons id be the maiden and hed rescue me hed be the dragon as well he used to make me laugh so much emily did not interrupt then of course he had to go away to school tallulah went on i missed him terribly i dont think ive ever been as lonely as i was then i lived the whole term time until he should come back home again to begin with he was just the same but gradually he changed of course he did he grew up he only wanted to play with boys he was still kind to me but he had no patience all his dreams were forward and not backward to where i was it was then i began to understand all the things that men can do and women cant she looked across at a group strolling past a man in a tall hat with a young woman on one arm and an older woman on the other with a magnificent feathertrimmed hat but she did not seem to see them men can go to parliament or become ambassadors she went on join the army or the navy become explorers or bankers or deal in stocks or imports and exports she shrugged dramatically write drama music be philosophers or poets women get married men get married too but only as an incidental i realized that when i understood what papa expected of me and what he hoped for fin he would like to have had more sons mama was always sorry for that i suppose it was her fault emily had a suddenly bleak picture of family life at the fitzjameses a little girl realizing with a rush of coldness how small a part of her life was in her own control how restricted her choices compared with those of her brother her mothers success or failure depended on how many sons she bore and it was not something she could help perhaps tallulah would be the same a failure only one thing of importance would be asked of her and she might not manage to do it emilys own life was the same she had married a man who wanted sons to carry on his title but she had not felt the same pressure she could not recall even doubting herself but then she had had no brothers sometimes when fin was home from school thered be some terrible quarrels tallulah was still staring into the distance living the past papa would call him into his study and fin would come out whitefaced but it was always all right in the end nothing terrible ever happened i was very frightened at first i remember i sat on the landing behind the stair rail and looked down into the hall waiting for him to come out of the study terrified hed been beaten or something i dont know what i really expected but it never happened it was always all right someone laughed in the distance but she barely seemed to hear it fin and papa still made their plans fin went back to school then to university then into the foreign office if this goes away without any scandal hell be posted to a really good ambassadorship probably paris hell have to get married first but that wont be difficult there are dozens of suitable girls whod be happy to have him she took a deep breath and turned to look at emily her eyes bright with tears i wish i could help but i dont even have any idea what i could do he wont talk about it to me but i know hes frightened mama wont talk about it either except to say it will be all right because he cant be guilty and papa will see that he isnt blamed for something he couldnt possibly have done emily had a picture of a frightened woman loving her son but knowing startlingly little about him seeing in her heart only the child she had known so many years ago she did not see the present man who lived in a world outside her experience with appetites beyond her emotional or physical imagination a woman clinging to decency because it was what she lived by perhaps even lived for what did aloysia fitzjames know of reality beyond her very handsome safe front door no wonder modern outrageous tallulah could not speak to her or share her fears it would be cruel and completely pointless even to try who did tallulah talk to her society friends who were all totally occupied in seeking suitable marriages the conventiondefying aesthete set who sat up all night talking about art and meaning the idolatry of the senses the worship of beauty and wit jago but he had time only for the poor he did not see the loneliness or the panic behind her extravagant dresses and defiant face well do something emily stated with absolute determination to begin with well deal with this badge which they say is his if he didnt leave it there then someone else must have either by accident or deliberately deliberately tallulah stared at her you mean they stole it and put it there to try to get finlay hanged she shivered in spite of the heat which was now so intense there was a fine dew of perspiration on her brow and emily could feel the muslin of her own gown sticking to her uncomfortably is that impossible she asked tallulah hesitated only a moment no no it isnt she answered with a catch in her voice papa has quite a few enemies ive come to realize that more lately they might want to strike out at him where it would hurt the most and where he was most vulnerable finlay does behave like a fool sometimes i know that she shook her head a little i think hes half afraid of being an ambassador and then going into parliament in case he doesnt live up to all papas expectations for him its almost as if he wanted to do something to prevent it even before he really tries not really she added quickly with a fleeting smile just at moments when hes when he has no confidence in himself we all get times like that who in particular emily pressed flicking her hand sharply to shoo a fly away tallulah thought for a moment roger balfour for one papa just about ruined him in a business deal with the armyover munitions i think peter zoffany i used to like him he told wonderful stories about living in india i think he rather liked me too i thought papa might marry me to him but then he used him to get to somebody else and there was a terrible row and i never saw him again but fin would never do anything like that she did not add any assurance which made it the more absolute she looked at emily with a frown does it matter who all we could do would be tell the police i wouldnt mind telling mr pitt if he comes again but i wouldnt tell that other miserablefaced man i think his name was tellman or bellman or something like that he looked at me as if i were a leper hed only think i was trying to protect finlay anyway no i dont suppose it matters emily conceded that club badge is the thing if we could throw doubt on that it would weaken this case a great deal but theyve got it tallulah protested what doubt could there be it has fins name engraved on the back he told me anyway ive seen it what is it like emily asked quickly what is it like exactly do you remember certainly about that size she held her finger and thumb apart about three quarters of an inch round gray enamel with hellfire club on the front in gold letters and a pin across the back why and where was his name on the back under the pin why written how what do you mean copperplate gothic roman in copperplate like a signature only neater her expression quickened why she drew in her breath are you thinking we could duplicate it have another one made but what could we do with it well if there are two emily was still juggling ideas in her mind it will at least raise doubts as to which one is real one of them has to be false why not the one found in the prostitutes room at least it would prove that someone could get a false one made and put it wherever they wanted to yes it would tallulah agreed with alacrity sitting forward where should we put it im not sure emily was still thinking i suppose somewhere it could have fallen accidentally so finlay couldnt find it at the back of a drawer or in the pocket of something he never wears but if we find it tallulah pointed out they will know that we put it there or they might do obviously we cant find it emily agreed but we can arrange for the police to search again and they can find it themselves how can we do that i can dont worry about it emily was certainly not going to explain that superintendent pitt in charge of the case was her brotherinlaw ill think of a way wont they check up on all of us to see if we had the copy made tallulah went on i would and tellman may be a horrible little man but ive a feeling hes awfully clever in his own way and mr pitt might come back again he speaks beautifully even though hes a policeman but underneath the good manners i dont think hed be fooled either then its your job to see that you and your mother can account for your time and if possible that finlay can too emily said decisively theres nothing we can do about your father ill take care of getting another badge made you must draw it for me as precisely as you can the right size with the writing exactly like the other one tallulah was alarmed im not sure if i remember exactly then youll have to find out from finlay without him realizing why you want to know dont ask any of the other members they might know what you are doing and even if they wouldnt intentionally betray finlay they might to save themselves even without meaning to yes tallulah said with increasing conviction in her voice she rose to her feet stopping for a moment as the heat and the dizzying perfume overcame her emily stood also yes ill start straightaway tallulah straightened her shoulders ill draw the badge for you and send it in the post youll receive it tomorrow emily thank you i dont know why you should befriend me like this but im more grateful to you than i can say emily dismissed it as gracefully as she could it embarrassed her because she had done it out of boredom and her own sense of having done nothing valuable for months and of being unnecessary to anybody they parted at the entrance surprised to find that everyone else was gone too it was already well into the hour appropriate for final calls or even returning home if one was thinking of an early dinner before the opera or the theater tallulah was as good as her word and in the midday delivery the following day emily received a letter from her hastily and sprawlingly written and accompanying two rather good sketches of a badge both front and reverse one was in minute detail larger than scale so it could be seen easily the other was less exact but of precisely the same size as the original the materials were also described with it was a fivepound note neatly folded to cover the cost and tallulahs repeated thanks emily had already decided where she intended to go in order to get the badge made one or two friends had from time to time had need of a discreet and skilled jeweler who was able to either copy a piece or maybe reproduce it from a drawing or photograph one had accidents an original piece had been pawned and sold against a debt one did not care to mention to ones husband and which could not be met from a dress allowance one misplaced things sometimes there were even occasions when it was not advisable to wear an original a jeweler unknown to the rest of the family and who knew how to keep his own counsel was a friend to be treasured of course emily did not tell him who she was but he was used to ladies who veiled their faces and whose names did not appear in any social register even though both theirclothes and their manners suggested that they should he accepted the commission without demur and promised to have it completed for collection in two days time emily thanked him paid him half the price and promised the rest on completion she returned home only just before jack arrived coming into her boudoir looking harassed and apologetic im sorry he said earnestly and indeed he did look very disturbed about something his usually immaculate jacket was a trifle crooked and his eyes were tired what is it she asked touched with a moments anxiety whats happened she rose to her feet and went over to him her eyes searching his face the home secretary has called a meeting this evening he said ruefully i have to be there or no one will put my point of view im sorry but it really does matter of course you have to she agreed overwhelmed with relief but i promised to take you to the opera we have the tickets and i know how much you wanted to see it she had completely forgotten beside tallulahs troubles it was so unimportant what was an evenings entertainment compared with the fears and the loneliness she had seen only an hour or two ago never mind she said smiling at him it is a matter of priorities isnt it perhaps i shall go and see charlotte or something like that the opera will play again she saw the apprehension iron out of his face and felt a sharp twinge of guilt she already knew exactly what she would do with the late afternoon and evening thank you my dear jack said touching her gently on the cheek standing so close to him she could see the fine lines of tiredness around his eyes and mouth and she realized with a jolt how hard he was working for the first time in his life at making a success of something which was a challenge to him it was something which he cared about for himself and for her and which he feared might be beyond him he had grown up a younger son handsome and idle with a charm which enabled him to live quite easily on those who found his company such a pleasure he could move from one to another of them and never have to think further ahead or behind than a few weeks now because he loved emily and wanted to fit into her life and her circle he had looked for depths in himself and discovered them he had committed himself to a difficult task in which failure was more than possible and many vested interests were ranged against him the time of charm without battles smiling his way out of conflict was past she wanted to reach up to kiss him but she knew it was not the right time he was weary there was a busy arduous and not entirely pleasant evening ahead of him and already his mind was straggling with its problems anticipating them and what he would say or do she caught his hand and held it feeling his fingers close around hers in a moments surprise and warmth dont be silly she said quickly im not going to sulk over an evening at the opera when what you are doing is really important i hope im never so shallow i do know what matters you know he smiled his eyes lighter with amusement and for a moment his tiredness vanished i do she said fiercely more than you know as soon as jack had left for his engagement emily herself dressed for the evening in one of her older gowns something she did not intend to wear again then took the second carriage and directed the coachman to keppel street in bloomsbury when they arrived she alighted gave instructions that they should wait for her and knocked on charlottes door as soon as it was answered by gracie she swept in and went straight through to the parlor where charlotte was mending one of jemimas pinafores please listen to me emily said she sat down in pitts chair without bothering to arrange her skirts i know the case thomas is working on at the moment i have quite a good acquaintance with the sister of his chief suspect and i know a way we might be able to prove his innocence she ignored charlottes surprise believe me he would be very grateful it is not a man he would wish to prosecute but unless someone can show that he was there at the time he may have to charlotte put down her sewing and stared at emily with gravity and growing suspicion i assume from your manner that you already have a plan as to how we shall do this when the police have failed to she said guardedly emily swallowed then took a deep breath and plunged in yes i have actually he does not really remember where he was but his sister tallulah was at a party and she saw him there oh yes charlotte said skeptically and why has she not told the police this because nobody would believe her except you of course charlotte picked up her sewing again the matter was not of sufficient sense to keep her from it emily snatched it away listen to me this really matters she said urgently if finlay was seen at this party in chelsea then he could not have been in whitechapel murdering a prostitute and if we can prove it we will not only save finlay from disaster we will save thomas from having to arrest the son of one of londons wealthiest men charlotte retrieved the sewing and put it away tidily so what are you suggesting why can tallulah tallulah not find some of the other people who were at this party and have them swear that finlay was there what does she need you for or me because she has already denied being at the party emily said exasperatedly please pay attention she was only there for a few minutes perhaps half an hour at the most and she does not remember who else was there either it seems altogether an extremely forgettable party charlotte said with a wry expression too close to laughter for emilys temper do you really believe all this emily its ridiculous she doesnt remember anyone there except him and he not only doesnt remember anyone at all even his own sister he doesnt even remember being there himself they were taking opium emily said furiously the place was a a shambles when tallulah saw what it was like she left she didnt remember the other people because she didnt know them finlay didnt remember because he was out of his senses that last part i can believe charlotte conceded dryly but even if it is all true what could we do go back to the house where the party was and see if it really happened and if it was as she said emily replied although as she heard herself it sounded increasingly foolish well we could at least see if there had been a party that night and if anyone remembered seeing either tallulah or finlay it would prove something i suppose we might find someone charlotte said dubiously but why doesnt tallulah go herself presumably at least she knows these people we dont her eyes narrowed do we no no of course not emily denied it hastily but that is precisely why we would be better we are important witnesses where is it beaufort street in chelsea youd better change into something a little more formal as if you were going to a party since everyone seems oblivious of their surroundings it hardly seems worth it charlotte answered but she did rise to her feet and go towards the door ill be down in a few minutes i hope you know what you are doing emily did not answer half an hour later they were in the carriage turning from the river into beaufort street what number charlotte asked about here emily replied what do you mean about here charlotte said what number is it im not sure tallulah didnt know you mean she didnt remember i suppose charlotte said sarcastically if thomas arrests anyone in that family they can plead insanity and get away with it come to that so could we we are not doing anything to get arrested for emily retorted sharply charlotte did not reply emily called out for the driver to stop and with a challenging look at charlotte she alighted rearranged her skirts and walked across the pavement towards the front of a house where three other carriages appeared to be waiting by the time she reached the door charlotte had caught up with her what are you going to say charlotte demanded you cant just ask if they had an orgy here last friday and do they know who was here of course not emily whispered ill say i forgot something a glove doesnt sound to me like an affair where they wore gloves well id hardly go home without my shoes if you could go home without your memory or your wits why not the odd shoe charlotte said waspishly emily was prevented from replying by the doors opening and a footmans staring down at her he was in full livery and stood a full head above her good afternoon emily smiled dazzlingly at him swallowed convulsively and began i was at a party last friday evening and i believe i may have left behind me er my the footmans stare would have frozen milk i believe that would have been at number sixteen madam this is number six and without waiting for any further remark he stepped back and closed the door leaving emily on the step i gather sixteen has something of a reputation charlotte said with a reluctant smile emily said nothing the color was burning her face in a mixture of embarrassment and anger well come on charlotte touched her arm having come this far we might as well finish it emily would dearly liked to have gone back to the carriage and never returned to beaufort street in her life the look on the footmans face would haunt her dreams come on charlotte said urgently there might even have been laughter in her voice reluctantly emily obeyed and they made their way up the street towards number sixteen this time it was charlotte who rang the bell the door was opened by a young man with an opennecked shirt possibly silk and dark hair which flopped over his brow hello he said with a charming smile ought i to know you forgive my absentmindedness but there are occasions when my mind is absolutely absent off on travels to another world where the most fantastic things happen he regarded her with candid friendly interest waiting for her reply as if his explanation had been utterly reasonable not very well she said sketching the truth but i think i may have left my glove here last friday silly place to wear gloves i know but i told my father i was going to the opera so i had to dress as if i were i came with tallulah fitzjames she added as though it were an afterthought he looked completely blank do i know her too slender dark emily chipped in very elegant and rather a beauty she has a well a long nose and very fine eyes sounds interesting he said approvingly im sure you know her brother finlay charlotte said making a last attempt oh fin yes i know him he agreed do you want to come in and look for your glove they accepted and followed him into a wide hallway and then through a series of rooms all decorated in exotic styles some strongly chinese some turkish or mock egyptian they pretended to look for the glove and at the same time asked the young man more about finlay fitzjames but beyond establishing that he had been there several times they learned nothing else the young man had no idea whether the friday of the murder in whitechapel was one of those occasions or not they thanked him and left without a glove well it could be emily said as soon as they were on the pavement it was certainly the sort of party she described that much at least is true you believe her dont you charlotte said seriously yes i do i really want to help i know what it feels like to be suspected of something you didnt do something you could be hanged for i know charlotte said quickly taking her arm but you really didnt do it i dont think he did either emily replied im going to do everything i can to help the following morning emily wrote a hasty note to tallulah outlining what she further planned and asking if tallulah would come with her if so would she send a reply with the messenger who delivered the letter an hour later a note was returned in tallulahs scrawling hand saying that most certainly she could come she would meet emily at seven oclock at st marys church whitechapel and from there they could follow their campaign as requested she would be dressed very plainly indeed in order to be inconspicuous taken by a casual observer to be a maid on her day off perhaps visiting her family emily was nervous sitting in the hansom clipping smartly eastward from her own highly fashionable street with its elegant windows overlooking wide clean pavements private carriages with liveried coachmen and footmen its front doors and side entrances for servants and tradesmen the surroundings changed as she came through the city itself there were more business premises and shops the traffic became heavier there was far more noise the hansom had to stop frequently where the roads were congested gradually she moved beyond the banks and trading centers and under the great shadow of st pauls closer to the river it was a balmy summer evening there would be pleasure boats out perhaps music but she could not hear it above the clatter of hooves and wheels soon she was on the whitechapel road it was narrower grayer the buildings high and smallwindowed the footpaths sometimes mere ledges where people scurried by heads down with no time to stroll or chatter the traffic was different also now there were carts and drays wagons even a herd of pigs blocking the road and making everyone stop for several minutes the smell of manure was sharp in the air she alighted at st marys church and paid the cabby quickly before she lost heart and changed her mind what if she couldnt find a hansom back again what if she had to walk how far would it be would people take her for a street woman she had heard that perfectly respectable women had been arrested by the police for being alone in the wrong places even in the west end never mind here what would jack think he would never forgive her and who would blame him would he understand that she had come to try to help clear the name of a man who faced ruin for a crime he did not commit charlotte would have done the same not that that was any mitigation where on earth was tallulah what if she did not come emily would have to go home again it was still broad daylight in fact it was sunny and quite warm she did not need to hug her shawl around her as if it were midwinter are you lorst luv she spun around there was a short man with an ugly friendly face staring at her his cap was on crookedly and he had gaps in his teeth there was a smear of dirt across his broad nose no thank you she gulped then forced herself to smile back im looking for someone but she doesnt seem to be here yet this is saint marys church isnt it yeah thats right yer aint lookin fer mr jones are yer the revrent cos es up coke street wi maisie wallace she lorst er little girl yestdy scarlet fever shes taken it ard an e gorn up there ter sit wiv er im sorry emily said quickly her own fears vanishing she thought of evie at home asleep in her clean quiet nursery in the afternoon sun with someone to watch over her all the time and edward his fair head bent over his books as he had been when she left im very sorry bless yer luv it appens appens every day ter some poor soul i suppose so that doesnt stop it being like the end of the world when it happens to you course it dont yer sure yer all right now you int from round ere are yer his eyes narrowed with concern suddenly she realized what he might imaginean elopement or far worse a respectable woman fallen on desperate times and taking to the streets as an attempt to meet impossible debts or worst of all perhaps seeking an illegal abortion she forced herself to smile cheerfully and frankly at him meeting his worried eyes yes i am all right she said firmly but if she doesnt come perhaps you can tell me where i could get a hansom to take me home again i have the fare she added hastily right eres as good as any place he answered or yer could try commercial road that way he pointed stretching out his arm well if yer all right then ill get ome ter me tea gor bless yer and bless you too she said with warmth she watched him walk off and turn down an alley to the left and wondered what he did and what family he was going back to she was still facing the way he had gone when a hansom stopped a dozen yards away and tallulah scrambled out paid and came hurrying towards her she looked untidy very different in a navy stuff dress with no frills and a gray shawl im sorry im late she said breathlessly i had to tell so many lies to get away without papa thinking there was anything odd sometimes i get so tired of being told what to do and now mama has agreed i really must accept the next remotely reasonable offer of marriage if theres a title whether theres money or not papa is going to insist almost unconsciously she glanced at the church then back at emily again her eyes dark with foreboding of course there wont be one if finlays charged do you really think we can do anything of course we can emily said boldly taking her arm and i do believe you about seeing him at the party tallulah looked at her curiously what i mean is emily said quickly i am not merely accepting your word which is pleasant but of no use i went there yesterday evening and met a young man he had no idea who was there on that occasion but he does know finlay how does that help tallulah asked standing in the middle of the footpath her face creased with anxiety well it doesnt prove he was there but it shows he could have been and that you at least know the place and presumably you could prove that you were not where you told your father you were if you had to well yes good and about jago emily proceeded to the next subject that may be hard but well try but first we must find those wretched women who say they saw finlay that night they must be wrong they saw somebody like himthats all maybe it was only a gentleman with fair hair there cant be many round here but there must be thousands in london yes of course there must tallulah agreed she glanced up the street ahead of her isnt it grim around here i think old montague street is that way she gave a little smile i asked the cabby good emily started off at a brisk walk tallulah by her side i didnt think to they crossed the road and went up osborn street then sharp right into old montague street the collected heat of the day shimmered up from the gray cobbles and the smell of middens and drains was thick in the air emily found herself wanting to hold her breath but of course it was impossible memories flashed back to her of going with charlotte into a filthy houseit seemed like years agoand finding a sick woman huddled under old blankets in the corner the pity she felt was almost as sharp now as it had been then and the wish that she had never known so it would not hurt a dray passed them the horses flanks lathered with sweat two women were shouting abuse at each other it seemed to be an argument over a pail of oysters an old man was asleep in a doorway or perhaps he was drunk half a dozen children played a game with a little heap of stones balancing them on the backs of their hands and then tossing them into the air shouting and cheering when someone performed the maneuver with particular skill opposite pentecost alley the sweatshop was still busy the windows were open and they could see the womens heads bent over the needles they had many hours to go yet before they could leave and go home for the short night before half past four and time to return some of them actually lived there tallulah stopped and looked at emily now that it came to the moment both found their courage evaporating could they really go into this brothel and ask to speak to one of the women how would they know which one perhaps it was all rather ridiculous emily drew in a deep breath come on if we stop now well never do it tallulah stood rooted to the spot is finlay innocent or guilty emily whispered fiercely did he strangle that poor woman and leave her no no of course he didnt tallulah clenched her fists and strode forward up the steps with emily behind her there was a wooden door at the top streaked with damp it was closed but there was a tarnished brass bell beside it tallulah yanked on it hard nothing happened and she tugged again still facing it and not looking at emily she was shivering in spite of the close heat a few moments later the door creaked open and an enormous woman with a bloated face peered out we got one room duck cant take two o yer this is an ouse o business we dont need a room thank you tallulah said politely emily standing a step behind her could see her hands clenched into fists nails biting into the palms weve come to speak to one of your residents were not quite sure who but she saw a young man the night poor ada mckinley was murdered and we need to speak to her the larger womans naked eyebrows shot up wot fer yer int rozzers so oo are yer we used to work with ada emily put in before tallulah could speak i was a ladies maid in the same house lula here was laundress my names millie tallulah gulped thats right may we speak to her please well thatd be up to rose ill ask er and with that she closed the door again leaving them standing waiting that was brilliant tallulah said with admiration now well just have to hope ada was in service at some time its a good chance emily replied if not well just have to pretend we got the wrong person if shell see us tallulah added they waited in silence the few moments until the fat woman returned this time smiling she ushered them in thats rosies room she said pointing to a door some way along the passage thank you tallulah straightened her shoulders and obeyed knocking sharply on the indicated door as soon as she heard an answer she opened it and went in emily hard at her elbow in case she should change her mind inside the room was opulent in a garish way lots of red and flounces a huge bed with tattered redpink curtains tied back with cord that would have done for strangling someone emily thought grimly she wondered if that was what he had used if ada had had the same rose herself was a handsome woman probably in her middle thirties there was no paint on her face at this hour and she had had a good days sleep emily could see that in other circumstances cleaner properly dressed she could have been beautiful now she was looking at them curiously leaning back a little in the one chair in the room so you knew ada poor cow she said coolly wot yer want wi me i cant elp yer if yer cared so much abaht er were was yer wen that bleedin butler done er eh tallulah looked blank her face white her eyes almost hollow emily made a quick guess at what she meant she didnt tell us emily said aloud it was all dealt with without any of the rest of us knowing until it was too late did you really see the man who killed her yeah rose shifted position slightly easing herself backwards why wots it ter you yer know im it were some toff from up west we work up west emily pointed out did you see him clearly yeah more or less rosies eyes narrowed whyd you care emily made another guess they had not much to lose we hoped you hadnt not to know him for sure beyond question because we hoped it might be our butler you see hes done it again and this time he might have been caught if anyone had believed ada then suddenly they had roses true attention dyer reckon id love to get that swine fer ada bleedin bastard but are you sure it was this other man emily said doubtfully did you hear him speak nah jus saw im goin past like could it have been our butler yeah course it could were e out that night yes tallulah said quickly she was still standing rigid in the middle of the floor as though to move might bring some catastrophe on her rose let out her breath in a long sigh her eyes bright geez id love ter get that son of a bitch maybe it were im we could nail the sod proper what about what youve told the police emily asked rose shrugged dont matter i int said anythin in court yet they cant do me fer it i didnt swear ter nuthin it were just me and one rozzer in an ansom i thought it were im now im not sure nan int sure anyway so im only goin wi er tallulah let out her breath in a long silent sigh at last her shoulders relaxed a little although her back was still stiff and her feet rooted to the spot thank you she said with passionate sincerity thank you very much when they were outside again they walked rapidly back along old montague street without speaking or even looking at each other until they reached the corner of osborn street and turned down towards the whitechapel road then tallulah stopped abruptly we did it she said almost in a squeak we did it she threw her arms around emily impulsively and hugged her so fiercely that for a moment emily could not draw breath thank you thank you more than i can say not just for helping me to defend fin but for showing that it wasnt really evidence against him she let go and stepped back a bit her eyes bright with tears she sniffed if you hadnt had the courage id still be at home pacing the floor or out at some wretched party pretending to enjoy myself and all the time worried sick hed never prove he was innocent then let us go and address the next problem emily said resolutely if finlay is not involved and there is no charge brought against him then your father will have you married to the next suitable person whose admiration you attract are you prepared for that to happen i shall probably have to be tallulah replied the happiness draining out of her jago really does despise me im not being falsely modest you know then we must change that emily declared too elated with her victory to consider defeat in anything or at least we must try she started walking again towards the church of st marys and tallulah followed reluctantly they reached it just as the reverend jago jones came out and almost strode past them so intent was he upon his errand it was only that emily stopped and let out a cry that drew his attention he swung on his heel and stared at her are you all right maam he asked with concern puckering his brow she was startled by his face then instantly knew she should not have been she had expected something blander handsomer less urgently alive she had expected someone she could manipulate and outwit instead she faced a man whose intelligence she knew instinctively and whose will would not easily be subverted by flattery or irrelevance now that she had drawn his attention what could she possibly say yes thank you she made it almost an apology we were in the area because he glanced at tallulah and did not recognize her he looked back at emily waiting for her to continue because of the death of poor ada mckinley emily went on desperately it touches us closely because because my brother is suspected of the crime tallulah finished i dont think he began then frowned studying her face in the light tallulah his voice was highpitched with incredulity even as he said it he could not completely believe it was a question rather than a statement hello jago her voice was rough with emotion did you not know they suspected finlay yes yes i did know but i cant believe hes guilty its too he did not finish whatever he had been going to say he changed his mind his face hardened the pity or the tenderness forced out of it there really isnt anything you can do here you had better go home before it gets dark im going round to coke street to serve out soup but ill walk with you up to a place where you can get a hansom first come on well help you with the soup tallulah offered he dismissed the idea contemptuously dont be ridiculous you dont belong here youll get dirty your feet will hurt standing and the people will smell and it will offend you youll be tired and bored anger hardened in his eyes and his mouth those peoples hunger is not entertaining they are real with feelings and dignity not something for you to come to look at so you can tell your friends emily felt as if she had been slapped tallulah had not exaggerated his scorn of her why do you imagine you are the only person who can wish to help from a genuine desire mr jones emily said tartly is compassion solely your preserve tallulahs mouth dropped jago drew in his breath sharply and the skin tightened across his cheeks it was too dark to see if he blushed no miss radley emily supplied mrs radley no mrs radley of course not i have known miss fitzjames for several years but i had no right to judge you by her past nature i apologize i accept your apology emily said with considerable condescension but you should extend it to tallulah as well it was she who offered to help now if you would lead the way we shall come with you i am sure more hands would make the task easier jago smiled in spite of himself and obeyed moving to the outside of the narrow footpath and walking beside them towards coke street he was right the work was hard emilys feet hurt her arms ached and her shoulders and back felt as if they would never adjust to their natural position again the people were noisy and the smell of hot unwashed bodies and stale clothes was at times almost sickening but far more than that she was oppressed by the hunger the hollow eyes in the lamplight the spindly limbs and skin pitted and dark with ingrained dirt she saw tired women with sickly children and no hope she looked across at tallulah and saw the shock in her eyes in the space of a couple of hours poverty had become a word with a whole realm of meaning it was reality pain people of flesh and blood who loved and had dreams who got frightened and tired just as she did only it was most of the time not merely once or twice a year and jago jones had become different also not an idealization but a man of flesh and spirit who also felt who was occasionally clumsy and dropped things whose knuckles bled when he scraped them against the wall while maneuvering the cart that carried the soup who laughed at a childs silly joke and who turned away to hide his grief when he was told of a womans miscarrying her baby emily watched him and saw his contempt for tallulah slowly soften as she worked to help stifling her disgust at the smell of dirt and stale sweat and smiling back at people with blackened or missing teeth at first with an effort at the end almost naturally forgetting the gulf between them when the last person was fed they tidied away the empty churns and began slowly to push the cart back to the house where it was kept and the food was cooked it all came from donations sometimes from wealthy people sometimes people with little more themselves at quarter past nine in the dark they walked side by side to the church then jago insisted on accompanying them until they should find a hansom why did you really come to whitechapel he asked tallulah they were passing under a gas lamp and in the pool of light his expression was innocent there was no guile in him or expectation of a particular answer emily was interested that he had no thought that she might have come to see him she liked him even better for his modesty i wanted to help finlay tallulah answered after only a moment emily longed to tell her to be quiet jago jones would not approve of their going to see rose burke about her testimony she pretended to trip and caught hold of tallulahs sleeve jerking her hard are you all right jago said quickly putting out his hand to steady her yes thank you she stood upright again smiling although they were past the lamp now it wasnt a very clever idea really there isnt anything we can do but we thought if we saw the place we might think of something jago shook his head but forbore from comment he could be tactful when he chose tallulah glanced at emily as they moved under the next light she seemed to have understood the hint jago found them a hansom on commercial road and after helping them in bade them goodbye and thanked them with a wry smile then turned and walked away without looking back tallulah swiveled to face emily although they could barely see each other in the darkness inside the cab i know even less than i did before she said her voice tight with confusion and weariness i know i love jago but i dont think i could live here it smells so awful everything is so dirty who could i even talk to how can he bear it emily did not answer because there really was nothing to say nothing to argue about or rationalize there was only the decision to be made and no one could help with that emily collected the new hellfire club badge and met tallulah by arrangement at a dog show held by the members of the ladies kennel club it was somewhere they could both go quite comfortably without comment and meet and compare notes as if on the scores of dogs of every breed and color and size tallulah was in a gorgeous gown of daisypatterned muslin with white satin ribbon trim no one would have recognized her as the woman who had helped ladle soup in coke street the previous evening she looked carefree full of laughter and grace until she saw emily then she excused herself from her friends and came over her hand held out her face tense and shadows of unhappiness in her eyes without comment emily put her hand into tallulahs and passed over the badge then as quickly withdrew whats the matter she asked has something new happened no i tallulah shook her head i just love this dog show look at them all arent they beautiful and intelligent the people or the dogs the dogs of course she brushed her fingers against the soft fabric of her skirt and i love this dress you look wonderful in it emily said honestly can you see me wearing it in whitechapel it probably cost more than jago makes in a year maybe two years nobody can decide for you emily replied under her breath smiling and nodding to the wife of another member of parliament who walked by leading a great dane and trying to look as if it were not leading her the one thing you must never do is blame someone else because you have chosen the wrong way be honest with yourself if you want your life as it is with money fashion a husband you may not love then take it she smiled and lifted her hand in a gesture of acknowledgment to the wife of a cabinet minister she loathed but if you want jago with all that that means dont attempt to change him or blame him for being what he is dont you expect to change a husband a little tallulah said reasonably why should i be the one to make all the accommodations because that way doesnt work emily said with eminent practicality it is no good dealing with what you think is fair only with what is real anyhow would you want jago to accommodate you by changing his beliefs what would that make of him i thought marriage was supposed to improve men at least a little tallulah protested are we not meant to be a gentler and civilizing influence isnt that what we are for to have children and to provide an island of peace and purity and high ideals away from the clamor and conflict of the world emily bit her tongue so she did not reply too savagely did you ever know a man who wished to be civilized and improved no tallulah said with some surprise all the men i know wish to be supported admired and obeyed that is certainly what papa wants and insists on in return he provides for us advises us and on occasion protects us of course emily countered with a smile sometimes we may behave in such a way as to cause a man to wish to civilize and improve himself but that is a different proposal altogether it is one thing to ask for something it is quite different to accept when offered it tallulah was prevented from continuing the discussion by the intervention of a group of ladies who came across to them leading two spaniels and a setter the conversation was turned over to dogs emily remained only another ten minutes or so then excused herself and went to her carriage it was agreed that tallulah would place the badge immediately on her return home now it was necessary for someone to provoke pitt into searching again in order for it to be found she gave her coachman charlottes address in bloomsbury and sat back to compose some sensible way of introducing such a suggestion into a conversation naturally she would not tell charlotte why that would place too great a strain on her loyalties and emily had no wish for pitt to be told at this point it could defeat everything it was a beautiful afternoon warm and still with that mellow tone of sunshine one gets only in the late summer a sort of gold in the air a heavy perfume of flowers and the knowledge that in a months time the first leaves would yellow but would ripen and the nights begin to chill and to darken earlier charlotte was in the garden inspecting the young chrysanthemum plants and admiring the asters in bloom great shaggy heads of purple and magenta its perfectly beautiful emily said sincerely charlotte looked at her skeptically is that what you came to say no of course not she wondered for an instant if picking a quarrel might divert charlottes attention from what she had come to say and decided it would not it was extremely difficult to think of a way of having charlotte persuade pitt to search again for the badge without charlottes realizing exactly what emily was doing and why ive just come from the dog show she said tentatively i saw tallulah fitzjames there she looks terribly worried i feel so helpless to know what to say to her does thomas really think her brother is guilty did you mention she stopped that we went to beaufort street charlotte said with wide eyes no of course i didnt what could i say that finlays sister says she saw him at a party but she cant remember who else was there because nobody remembers anything about the whole event except where it was held and when i suppose it wouldnt help emily agreed unhappily they walked side by side very gently down the lawn towards the apple tree and past the honeysuckle which was still in bloom the late afternoon began to send a heavy sweetness into the air all it would really do charlotte said gently is show that tallulah is a loyal sister its the badge isnt it emily seized her opportunity thats what makes it look so bad for him how could it be there if he wasnt they had reached the end of the lawn and stood together in the sheltered sun if hes not guilty emily continued as though thinking aloud then either this is a most hideous mischance or he has a terrible enemy and from what tallulah says that is not impossible at least she hurried on to prevent charlotte from interrupting they are augustuss enemies you think they stole his badge murdered someone and left it at the scene charlotte asked with incredulity isnt that a terrible risk to take with your own life simply to injure someone else what if they were caught and hanged themselves emily drew in her breath and let it out slowly someone so very arrogant is probably quite sure in their own minds that they will not be caught and i hadnt thought of their stealing finlays badge why not simply have another one made it wouldnt be very difficult then leave that one there but what if the police found the original or finlay did himself charlotte reasoned the club disbanded years ago he probably hasnt any idea even when he last had it let alone where but they looked for it thomas did did he look for it himself emily pressed or did he simply have a constable do it thinking that if finlay knew where it was he would produce it quickly enough perhaps a constable i dont know late swallows dipped and darted after tiny flies the light was lengthening and turning gold casting heavy shadows from the apple tree well ask him emily said trying not to sound desperate after all if he found another badge it would make things much easier wouldnt it for thomas i mean then he wouldnt have any real evidence against finlay and he wouldnt be in the wretched position of having to charge him he wouldnt be caught between the pressure from the establishment and the home office and it would stop the newspapers suggesting that he is letting finlay off because of who he is i know the sort of thing they will say i suppose you might be right charlotte said thoughtfully ill mention it to him emily linked her arm in charlottes and they began to walk back up the lawn towards the house she did not trust herself to say anything further while emily was involved with helping tallulah pitt had been searching further into the character and associations of the fitzjames family he had sent tellman to learn what he could to add to their knowledge of the history of the other members of the hellfire club as being those most likely to have had the badge either intentionally or by accident in spite of their appearance of a life far removed from frequenting the brothels of whitechapel it was quite possible that they did so married men of helliwells status had been known to thirlstone was certainly not beyond suspicion and much as pitt would like to have believed that jago jones was all he proclaimed he might have all too human weaknesses and if he gave in to them where better to turn than to a prostitute whose company would be so natural in his pastoral labors no one would question it he could explain it even to himself he would be far from the first man of the cloth to find his relationship with a beautiful and intelligent parishioner slipping helplessly beyond the bounds of propriety into a physical hunger which he had not denied he lived an abstemious life lonely and full of hardship and selfdiscipline it was not difficult to understand he had been a man of both appetite and indulgence in his hellfire days what had changed him and so completely and what had gone so hideously wrong that he had killed ada had she said or done something unforgivable had she laughed at him mocked him with his own frailty was she the instrument by which he had betrayed himself the serpent and eve in one or had she simply threatened to expose him had she asked for money continuous blackmail money rose burke and nan sullivan had both said she was greedy with an eye to opportunity it was possible and the more pitt thought about it the more the idea hurt him he had liked jago jones admired him but the possibility could not be ignored he had liked other men before and found them guilty he could not like augustus fitzjames and the further he delved into the probability of his having enemies who might hate him enough to have gone to these lengths to ruin him the less did he find to like the further back pitt went in the search into augustuss past the less easy it became to trace with any clarity he had apparently inherited no money from his father a somewhat feckless landowner in lincolnshire who had mortgaged his holdings to the hilt augustus had served a short time in the merchant navy largely on the far eastern routes he had returned home shortly after the second opium war in with sufficient money to begin investing an art which he exercised with skill amounting at times to genius now he possessed a financial empire of enormous size and complexity with tentacles stretching across the breadth of the empire he had investments in india egypt the african expeditions of cecil rhodes and the new expansions in australia frequently his interests cut across those of others to their disadvantage pitt heard several stories both of augustuss generosity and of his ruthlessness he seemed never to forget a friend or an enemy and there were anecdotes of his cherishing a grudge over decades and repaying it when the perfect opportunity presented itself he lacked polish he had no social grace but even so he had been attractive to women aloysia had married him for love and he had been far from her only suitor other men with more humor with more charm had sought her hand she certainly had not needed the money at that time her own fortune was greater than his perhaps there was something in his energy his driving ambition and the inner power that drove him which attracted her finlay had not only his mothers broader face and easier more graceful manner it seemed he also had her more malleable nature and slower intellect he appeared altogether a more likable man a little selfindulgent but that was not unnatural at his age or with the pressure of expectation placed upon him ewart grew more insistent that finlay was innocent and that it was some enemy of augustus who had deliberately implicated him and where he had dismissed it before pitt now began to entertain the idea with some seriousness the valet said hes never seen the cuff links ewart argued as they were sitting in pitts office in bow street they could have gone missing years ago as finlay says how did one get down the back of the chair in adas room pitt asked although he knew what ewart would answer ewart screwed up his face he still looked tired and harassed his suit was rumpled and his tie a little crooked there were shadows around his dark eyes as though he habitually slept poorly i know he said hed never been to whitechapel he replied shaking his head but it was an understandable lie in the circumstances he could well have been there years ago he could have been drunk at the time and completely forgotten it that was truepitt did not argue he could also understand ewarts reluctance to think finlay guilty the evidence was not conclusive and if they charged him it would be a hard fight and a very ugly case to lose it would be an embarrassment from which neither of their careers would recover easily and the badge pitt was almost thinking aloud charlottes words to him the previous evening turning over in his mind he said hed lost it years ago ewart reminded him i daresay thats true certainly we cant prove the club has ever met in say five six years all the members say it hasnt and im inclined to believe them they dont seem to have any connection anymore helliwell is married and doing well in the city thirlstone has taken up with the aesthete group and jones has taken the cloth and gone to the east end frankly if it isnt one of augustus fitzjamess enemies im inclined to think it could be jones perhaps he and finlay had some old quarrel pitt leaned farther back in his large chair the desk was between them meticulously polished and inlaid with green leather and he waited six years to murder a prostitute and blame finlay for it he raised his eyebrows all right thats ridiculous put like that the cuff links an accident finlay was there once the badge was put there deliberately by someone for whatever reason well discover in time pitt put forward charlottes idea if someone really hated augustus fitzjames enough perhaps the badge we found was not the original one but a copy someone had made in order to implicate him ewarts face lit up his clenched fist thumped very gently on the desktop yes yes thats the most likely solution so far it could well be what happened then his eyes shadowed but how could we prove that ill start my men searching for a jeweler straightaway but hell probably have been well paid to keep silent well start by searching finlays rooms again for the original pitt replied although he had scant hope of succeeding ive no idea whether its the truth or not but any good defense counsel would put it forward as a suggestion to indicate reasonable doubt that may be its main relevance to us far from being disheartened ewart was elated but it is reasonable doubt he said fervently unless we have more theres no point in arresting him whatever we believe no pitt conceded and it was a concession he could not help wondering how much ewarts unwillingness was belief in the possibility of finlays innocence and how much merely cowardice a dread of the battle that lay ahead even the threat to his own career the myriad small struggles and unpleasantnesses which would lie ahead if they pursued finlay fitzjames for the murder augustus would be fighting for his social and political life there would be no mercy and no rules except those forced upon him by circumstance he went personally to supervise the further search of the fitzjames house for the original badge he took two constables with him and was admitted at first with reluctance then with appreciable surprise when he explained his purpose it took them a little under three quarters of an hour then the badge was discovered in the inside pocket of a jacket the valet said he could not remember mr finlays having worn which was extremely thin at the elbows and a little frayed at the collar it was apparently kept only for sentimental reasons and then at the back of the wardrobe it was comfortable something for him to use on summer walks when it did not matter if it were to get torn or grass stained he had not had opportunity for such indulgence in some time it could have been there all the time there was fluff caught on the pin and a tiny scratch across the face of the enamel the explanation was given by miss tallulah fitzjames who happened to be there that morning writing letters to certain of her friends and answering invitations pitt stood in the morning room turning it over in his hand it was exactly like the one in police custody certainly as he looked he could see no difference except a slight variation in the careful copperplate writing of the name finlay fitzjames under the pin at the back it was written by a different hand but then it would be what he really needed was one of the other club badges to compare it with to see which was the original and which the copy there was no other way of telling but the other members denied still having theirs whats the matter superintendent tallulah asked looking at him with a faint flicker of concern in her face i now have two badges for your brother miss fitzjames one of them is a duplicate i need to know which one and why it was made and by whom she stared at him without blinking this one is the original the one you found in pentecost alley is a duplicate made by one of my fathers enemies in order to ruin us he looked at her she was dressed in white with ribbons and an underskirt of pale blue she was a trifle thin and it made her look fragile and very feminine until one saw the strength of her features and the burning will in her eyes do you really believe your father has enemies who would murder a woman in order to revenge themselves on him he asked apparently she had already considered the question her answer was quiet her voice grating with pentup emotion but nonetheless unhesitating yes superintendent i do i think perhaps you do not realize quite how powerful he is or how much money he has made in the last thirty years envy can be very cruel it can take you over and swallow up any decent judgment and feeling you have and and some people do not she bit her lip do not consider the death of a prostitute to be a great sin im sorry that is a horrible thing to say she winced and he had a sudden conviction that she meant it but it is true she finished he knew it was true had it not been in whitechapel so soon after those other most fearful of all murders the newspapers would hardly have bothered with it perhaps you had better make a list of these people miss fitzjames and what you know or believe of their reasons i shall ask your father also for a similar list of course pitt thanked the two constables who had helped in the search then left the fitzjames house and walked along devonshire street towards the park he bought two ham sandwiches from a seller on the corner and ate them as he crossed the marylebone road and turned up york gate across the outer circle and through the trees it was a balmy day the park was full of people strolling and fashionable ladies parading and courting couples children were playing with hoops and riding sticks with horses heads and several tried to fly kites in the lazy air but there was too little wind to lift them nursemaids in prim uniforms wheeled perambulators or took their small charges by the hand some of them sat on seats together swapping gossip while children ran around old gentlemen sat in the sun and relived past glories young girls giggled and talked about each other in the distance a band was playing songs from the music halls pitt could not have argued with ewart as to why he found it hard to believe that any enemy of augustus fitzjames should murder a prostitute and lay the blame on finlay in order to exact a revenge on his father there was no single argument against it he simply did not believe in such deliberate machination in his experience robberies were sometimes carried out this way but not murder with violence the convolutions the attempts to lay blame elsewhere came afterwards however callous this supposed enemy pitt found it hard to conceive of him deliberately committing a crime for which he himself could be hanged could it be traced to him and yet he also had to admit that there was something deliberate about it the badge and the cuff link were extraordinary how could a man be careless enough to leave two such pieces of evidence behind him he must try harder with helliwell and thirlstone and much against his will with jago jones finding another badge to compare with the two he had now might be crucial to finlays guilt or innocence good heavens superintendent helliwell said irritably when pitt approached him as he was walking down birdcage walk after a long and excellent luncheon in great george street i really cannot help you i have no idea about finlay fitzjames and his current behavior his expression darkened i thought i had already explained to you that we were friends in the past but the present is an entirely different matter i wish i could tell you some definitive fact that would clear his name but i am not in a position to now i have business for which i am a trifle late you must excuse me he quickened his pace pitt quickened his also i have found a second hellfire club badge he said at helliwells elbow indeed helliwell kept on walking and did not turn he did not ask where it had been found i cannot see how that concerns me if it is mine it was lost years ago and it could be anywhere pitt studied his face but in the afternoon sun it looked a little red with exertion and perhaps selfindulgence over the port but there was not the discomfort of lying on it he was annoyed but if he was afraid he hid it with consummate skill a subtlety quite different from the rest of his character no pitt replied it was not yours it was apparently also mr fitzjamess this time helliwell did stop swinging around what that makes no sense we had only one each what what are you saying that someone has made a second badge mr helliwell i would very much like to see yours so i can tell which is the original oh helliwell let out his breath in a gusty sigh yes i see well i still cant help you and frankly i am beginning to find this constant questioning a trifle irritating he turned to look at pitt to allow him to understand that he was not apprehensive but his anger was very real and increasing fitzjames was a friend of my rather immature days which i have now left behind me and what he may or may not be doing now is none of my concern although i find it almost impossible to believe he had anything to do with the death of a prostitute in the east end it can only be a catalog of mischance that has led you even to imagine such a thing you would be far more profitably employed looking into the unfortunate womans own acquaintances her enemies or debtors now as i said i have an appointment and i must hurry or i shall keep sir philip waiting good day superintendent and with that he swiveled smartly on his heel and strode away without looking back or to either side of him mortimer thirlstone was harder to find he was not involved in political or public life and his comings and goings were dependent only upon his whim of the moment pitt discovered him at an artists studio in camberwell and it was midafternoon before he was able to speak with him it was a bright airy room and several young men and women sat around in earnest discussion there were paintings on every stretch of wall and windows in most unexpected places never as intended by the original architect nevertheless the impression was surprisingly pleasant one of startling color and space splashes of yellows and blues shimmering scenery and it was more an impression as if seen through halfclosed eyes than a photographic image oh dear thirlstone said wearily leaning against a windowsill and staring at pitt he was dressed in a loosesleeved white shirt with a floppy collar and an enormous bow at the neck it was all very affected but he seemed quite unconscious of it good afternoon mr thirlstone pitt was about to continue when thirlstone straightened up not you again he said his eyes darting around the room as if to seek a way of escape this is getting frightfully tedious my dear fellow he faced pitt suddenly what am i possibly to tell you i knew finlay years ago he was a decent young man but a bit of a rake i suppose we all were then but i see nothing of him now not a thing pleasant enough you know but a complete philistine doesnt know old gold from plate sometimes i think hes colorblind i wanted to know if you could find your old hellfire club badge sir pitt asked looking at his agitated face and wondering why he was so uncomfortable this should not be embarrassing pitt was not recognizable as police i told you i havent got it anymore thirlstone replied with a frown his voice sharpening with exasperation what can it matter now pitt told him about the two badges with finlays name on them oh thirlstone looked disconcerted he swallowed seemed about to speak again then changed his mind he moved uncomfortably as if something in his loosely fitting shirt still scratched his skin well if i if i have it ill bring it to you but its not likely he shook his head abruptly i really cant imagine finlay would do such a thing but people change a statuesque young woman walked by running her fingers through her mane of hair a man by the farther window was sketching her and she knew it i think youll find us oh thirlstone shrugged i dont know really i have no idea he glanced at the woman and back to pitt not pleasant to be disloyal but i cant tell you anything pitt wished he could think of some question which would crack the facade and let him see beneath to what these men really knew of each other what relationships there had been the rivalries the bonds which held and the jealousies which divided the secret feelings underlying the outward behavior did finlay have one particular friend among you he asked casually as if he had thought of it only as he was about to leave no thirlstone said instantly we were all together well er possibly he was a little closer to helliwell more in common maybe then he blushed as if it had been a hand of betrayal but it was too late to take it back did he have more money than the rest of you pitt enquired his father is extremely wealthy thirlstone looked relieved ah yes yes he did certainly more than jago or i and i suppose more than helliwell too was he generous a curious expression crossed thirlstones face a mixture of bitterness and wry almost careful regret he obviously disliked talking about it at all and that might have been some kind of guilt or simply that thirlstone regarded that as an aesthetically wasted time and preferred to live in the present was he generous pitt repeated thirlstone shrugged yes quite often he gambled it did not matter except as a blight on his character but pitt wanted to keep the conversation going a burst of laughter interrupted his thought and they all turned to look at the little group who had occasioned it yes we all did thirlstone replied i suppose he gambled rather more it was in his nature and he could afford it look superintendent none of that is relevant now i really have no idea who killed this woman in whitechapel i find it difficult to believe it could have been finlay but if you have proof that it was then i shall have to accept it otherwise i think you are wasting your timewhich is your privilegebut you are also wasting mine and that is precious i have not seen my old club badge in years but if i should come across it i shall bring it to bow street and pass it in i would appreciate it if you could look for it mr thirlstone it may prove mr fitzjamess innocence or guilt thirlstone said staring at pitt with an intense gaze charlotte had visited her mother during the day and was full of news to tell pitt when he returned home most of it cheerful and interesting variations of the colorful gossip about the theater relayed by caroline but when charlotte saw pitts face as he came in at a quarter past seven tired hot and struggling with a confusion of thoughts she realized this was not the time did you look again for the badge she asked as they sat over dinner the children had already eaten and were upstairs getting ready for bed gracie with her newly learned reading skill was preparing to share with them the next chapter of alice through the looking glass it was their favorite time of the day both kittens were asleep in the laundry basket in the corner of the kitchen by the cooker and everything was tidy and cleared away except the dishes they were actually using and they could wait until gracie came down again yes pitt answered looking up and meeting her eyes across the table the sunlight was low coming straight in through the large windows onto the table and the scrubbed floor it made bright patterns on the far wall and gleamed where it caught the china on the welsh dresser it shone red on one of the copperbottomed saucepans hanging up and we found it charlotte swallowed does that mean he is innocent he smiled no it just means there are two badges so one of them is presumably a fake well mustnt it be the one that was found in pentecost alley the other one must have been where you found it mustnt it where did you find it in the pocket of an old jacket he apparently hasnt worn for years well then he ate another mouthful of the cold chicken pie it was very good indeed so were the fresh tomatoes with it and the cucumber thomas she prompted her face puckered somebody had a copy made and put it either in ada mckinleys bed in pentecost alley or else in finlay fitzjamess pocket in devonshire street he replied with his mouth half full and dont you know which she was beginning to remember emilys words yesterday and her eagerness that pitt should search again most unpleasant thoughts crossed her mind she forced them away surely you can tell cant you she said more urgently her own pie now forgotten no i cant he frowned at her not unless i can compare them with one of the original ones belonging to the other members the writing is just a little different on the two i have presumably the first ones were all made by the same jeweler the writing which does not match will be the copy doesnt it have she began then realized the answer to her own question and stopped what he asked it doesnt matter it doesnt make any sense she denied either someone had a copy made to prove him guilty when he was innocent he explained or to prove him innocent when he is guilty or they fear he is that could be any member of his family or finlay himself yes she said cautiously then looked down at her plate yes of course it could she did not add what was in her thoughts it was screaming in her mind but she did not dare put words to it even to herself would you like another tomato she half moved from the table i have several more theyre really very good as soon as pitt had left the following morning and she had given gracie instructions for the day charlotte took a hansom cab to emilys house by quarter past nine she was being shown into the morning room by a startled parlor maid who said she would go and see if mrs radley was at home that meant she was had she been out riding she would have said so immediately although charlotte was prepared to wait even if emily were out for the entire day emily appeared within ten minutes still in a loose satin peignoir and with her fair hair loose in curls charlotte had envied all their lives she came towards charlotte smiling as if to kiss her on the cheek emily charlotte said quickly emily blinked yes you look very fierce whats happened is it something to do with grandmama no it is not why did you ask me to have thomas search the fitzjames house again for that hellfire club badge she faced emily with a stare which should have turned her to stone emily hesitated only a moment then sat down casually in one of the green chairs because if he found it it would prove that finlay fitzjames is innocent which will be much better for thomas she answered blandly looking up at charlotte standing above her wouldnt it augustus fitzjames is a very powerful man and not fearfully pleasant of course if finlay is guilty then he should be arrested and tried and all that but if he isnt then it would be much better for everyone and for thomas in particular if it could be proved so before any charges are made isnt that all fairly plain very plain indeed charlotte did not back away an inch do you know him emilys eyes widened very clear and blue in the morning sun coming through the long windows who augustus fitzjames only by repute but im sure im right jack has mentioned him several times he is very powerful because he has a great deal of money finlay fitzjames charlotte kept her voice under control with an effort no emily answered still with an air of innocence ive met him once but only very briefly just to say how do you do not much more i doubt that he would recognize me again charlotte was looking for the connection it had to be somewhere she knew emily well enough to tell when she was being evasive there was guilt in every line of her body the wide gaze of her eyes she sat down on the seat opposite and faced her is he betrothed to anyone i dont think so i havent heard that he is emily did not ask why charlotte wanted to know in charlottes mind that was the final piece of evidence she was lying about something her fears were confirmed tallulah she said between her teeth do you care really about her so much you would coerce me into asking thomas to search again on her account emily blushed i told you charlotte if finlay is innocent it will be rats you knew that badge was there because you or tallulah put it there have you any idea of what youve done emily hesitated on the verge of admitting or denying she still had not given herself away not completely augustus fitzjames does have some very ruthless enemies you know and some very ruthless friends as well it seems charlotte said furiously did you have the badge made yourself or did you just suggest it to tallulah emily squared her shoulders i really think that as a policemans wife charlotte i should not discuss that with you you would feel obliged to tell thomas anything i told you and then i might place myself or my friends in an embarrassing situation i am quite certain finlay is innocent and i did what i believed to be rightfor him and for thomas you know that the identification is nonsense what identification suddenly charlotte was less confident emily was certainly irresponsible probably even criminal and totally stupid but it seemed she also knew something which charlotte did not and perhaps pitt did not either what identification she repeated emily relaxed the sun through the morning room windows made an aureole of gold around her hair the pleasant clatter of domestic chores sounded from beyond the door somewhere a girl was giggling probably a betweenmaid the identification of the other prostitute who said she saw finlay there in pentecost alley the night of the murder emily answered what charlotte felt her stomach tighten and for a moment she could hardly breathe what did you say it wasnt a proper identification emily explained she doesnt really know if it was finlay or not she would be perfectly willing to say it was the butler if it came to trial what butler charlotte was stunned and now confused as well whose butler why would she say it was a butler the butler who got ada pregnant emily explained which was how she lost her position and finished up on the streets emily explained and just how do you know that charlottes voice dropped and became icy it was too late for any possible retreat because i spoke to her emily replied in a small voice charlotte sat down abruptly she felt a little dizzy you shouldnt be so disturbed emily said reasonably you and i have both involved ourselves in cases before and it has always ended more or less right remember the hyde park headsman dont charlotte winced have you forgotten what jack said to you after that emily paled no but he doesnt know about this and i didnt do anything dangerous well not really there wasnt anybody violent around i was only looking for information to clear finlay i wasnt pressing anyone who could be guilty dont be idiotic charlotte said if you clear finlay then someone else is guilty it may be someone around there in fact it probably is except of course she added scathingly since you put the club badge there finlay could be as guilty as jack the ripper the real badge was the original one found with the poor womans body or didnt you think of that yes of course i did but that didnt mean that finlay put it there emily said we both know that he was nowhere near whitechapel that night he was at a party in chelsea we dont both know it charlotte said all we really know is that tallulah says she was there and she says she saw him well i believe her and without an identification its the only piece of evidence that connects him with whitechapel at all anyone could have stolen it or found it years ago and used it to revenge themselves on augustus after all why on earth would finlay kill a woman like ada mckinley or anybody else for that matter somebody did charlotte said pointedly far more probably someone who knew her emily argued leaning forward a trifle a rival or someone she stole from or someone she hurt she may have quarreled with someone one of the other women or some man she made fun of maybe someone who was once in love with her and she betrayed him by doing what she did she took a deep breath charlotte charlotte stared at her waiting charlotte please dont tell thomas about the badge hed never forgive me and he might not understand why i did it i really do believe that finlay is innocent i know you do charlotte said gravely you wouldnt do anything so absolutely idiotic otherwise are you going to tell thomas emily asked in a very small voice no charlotte answered more out of pity than good sense at least not unless i have to he he may discover whatever he needs to know before theres any need thank you indeed pitt did discover at least part of it when he and ewart went back to pentecost alley late in the afternoon nan sullivan was as indecisive as on the previous time pitt had seen her but he still had every confidence in rose burke the change in her stunned him i dunno she said looking first at pitt then away they were sitting in the kitchen a large chipped enamel pot of tea on the table odd pottery cups around the cooking range made the place hot and airless no one wanted to open the window onto the stinking yard below with the fumes from the midden and the pigsty next door what dont you know pitt demanded you were quite sure when you saw him from the hansom in devonshire street you were certain enough then you were ready to hang him yourself i were ready to ang whoever done er rose corrected stubbornly that int ter say it were im i only saw im fer a minute an the light werent good are you afraid rose pitt tried to keep the anger out of his voice or the stinging contempt he wanted to put into it no she glared at him ignoring ewart completely no i int afraid wots ter be afraid of threats from someone he replied the man you identified belongs to a very powerful family e may do but e int spoken ter me she said with a curl of her lip if thats wot yer think yer wrong dead wrong i jus want yer ter get the right man the man wot really done er poor little cow she fiddled with her spoon slicking it against the cup an i think as it could be the butler wot got er into trouble in the first place e done it again an this time is mistress might not be so quick ter believe im e got reason ter wanner get rid o ada geezers like the one wot yer showed me in devonshire street don come down ter whitechapel they get their bits o pleasure up the aymarket way an windmill street thats true ewart conceded you said ada sometimes went up there pitt pointed out sure but i never said as she brought em ome ere she said with derision she int that daft if she ad a like as not that costigand a took moren alf er money an why would one o them gents foller er ere wot for she werent that good there are plenty more were she come from an ter them one tarts as good as another are you now saying it was this butler you saw ewart interrupted quickly leaning forward over the table describe him no i int sayin it were im she said cautiously im sayin as it might a bin geez dont yer care oo yer top long as its someone i care very much pitt replied between his teeth holding on to his temper i find your certainty then and your change of mind now suspicious it makes me wonder if someone has been changing it for you either with threat or with promise you sayin as i bin paid ter lie she asked angrily no ewart was placating nobodys saying youre lying rose we simply have to be sure nothing can bring back ada and its a mans life we are talking about a wrongful accusation would be in its way a second murder well mebbe i could lie baht somethin as dont matter she said carefully this time looking at ewart but not ter get some poor sod cropped ooever e is ter tell the truth i were upset that ada were killed she lifted her shoulders very slightly a gesture of apology and resignation i were sort o angry an scared an too quick ter make up me mind i wanted someone caught an topped cos it made it feel better fer the rest o us safer like she took a breath and turned to pitt again i waned ter think as i knew oo it were now ive ad time ter think better i can see as thats stupid its gotta be the right sod not just any poor bastard as looks a bit like im asnt it yes pitt conceded grimly yes it has to be the right one of course ewart moved his arm as if to pat her shoulder then changed his mind of course it has he added gently they left pentecost alley and pitt rode back in the hansom with ewart wed better find this butler he said wearily even if it is only to eliminate him i think hes our man ewart replied his voice loud with conviction his face set hard staring straight ahead as they moved west along the whitechapel high street stands to reason he got ada with child that time he got away with it lied to his employers now hes done it again and she was going to come back and tell the whole story finish him she told the whole story the first time pitt pointed out what had she to gain from telling it again revenge ewart replied as if the answer were obvious he was responsible for her ruin oldest motive in the world pitt looked sideways at him ewart was a good policeman his record was excellent he was in line for more promotion this was an extraordinary lapse in his thinking he had been laboring under some emotion right from the start was it pity or disgust or was it some fear that augustus fitzjames would set out to ruin whoever accused his son of such a crime guilty or innocent and even ewarts longstanding reputation would not be enough to save him of course it would be unpleasant but bringing a charge against anyone had its tragedy there were always innocent people hurt people who simply loved a husband or a son they would be overwhelmed by events and then when all the tumult and the public pain was over they would be left with its grief what good would that do pitt asked him watching ewarts face with its black eyes and the lines of anxiety around his mouth ada had already told her story dead she simply reinforces it if he killed anyone it would be the present girl before she tells her employer the judgment had already been made between ada and this man and she had lost she might have killed him but he had no cause to kill her ewarts expression hardened and a flicker of something like fear shadowed across his features or perhaps it was anger he was very tired his hands shook a little he must hate having a superior like pitt put in to take over his case because he was deemed incapable of handling a politically sensitive case any man would and pitt would have himself and ewart was doing a better job of being politically appropriate than pitt was he was searching for any answer but the explosive one in his position pitt would have resented both the man who was brought in and the superior who made the decision i agree with you he said quietly the evidence against fitzjames is poor the identification is useless the cuff links were lost years ago and the club badge is suspect it wont stand alone now weve found a second one in his possession weve got to go back to the beginning we should look more closely at adas life and also at fitzjamess to see who could be implicated ewart turned to face him implicated he asked slowly he seemed almost too tired too stunned by blow after blow to think if fitzjames has enemies so virulent they would put evidence at the scene of the murder to incriminate him pitt started to explain then ewart straightened up a little realization in his face oh yes of course do you want me to do that ill start tomorrow good pitt agreed ill continue with ada it was all ugly and confusing he must as he had said go right back to the beginning pitt arrived home late and was startled to find emilys greataunt by her first marriage lady vespasia cumminggould sitting in his parlor sipping a tisane and talking to charlotte he had flung the door open about to speak until he saw her and he stopped good evening thomas aunt vespasia said coolly her silver eyebrows raised as always she looked exquisite her face with its marvelous bones and hooded eyes had been refined by time and her character marked into it it was no longer the mere loveliness of youth but a beauty which was the whole structure of a life fascinating and unique she had given him permission to call her by name as a relative he used it with pleasure good evening aunt vespasia how very pleasant to see you and surprising also to judge by the expression upon your face she retorted no doubt you are hungry and would like to dine i believe gracie has your meal prepared he closed the door and came into the room he was hungry and extremely tired but he was not willing to forgo the pleasure of her company nor the interest of her conversation she would not simply have called because she was passing by vespasia never did anything casually and she did not pass by bloomsbury on the way to anywhere he sat down glanced at charlotte then faced vespasia are you acquainted with augustus fitzjames he said candidly she smiled no thomas i am not i should be offended if you imagined i had called upon you because i was a friend of his and aware that you were investigating that sordid affair in whitechapel which seems to implicate his son no one who knew you would suppose you would try to exert influence aunt vespasia he said honestly her silvergray eyes widened my dear thomas no one who knew me would suppose me a friend of a nouveau riche bully like augustus fitzjames please do sit down i find it most uncomfortable staring up at you he found himself smiling in spite of his weariness and the confusion in his mind the sense of having achieved nothing in all the time and effort he had spent he sat down opposite her but i do have some compassion for his wife she went on although that is not why i called my principal interest is in you and after that in john cornwallis she frowned very slightly thomas if you charge finlay fitzjames be extremely careful that you can prove your case his father is a man of great power and no clemency at all pitt had judged as much but it was chilling to hear it from vespasia she was not a woman too arrogant or too foolish to be afraid but it was a very rare occurrence indeed and when he had seen it in the past it had been of the power of secret societies rather than of individuals it increased his sense of misery and the darkness of thought which surrounded the murder in pentecost alley charlotte was looking at him anxiously it begins to appear he began carefully as if finlay fitzjames may not be guilty certainly the evidence against him has largely been withdrawn or explained away that is very unclear i think you had better say what you mean vespasia commanded he told her about the badge and then finding the second one in finlays possession and his inability to obtain any of the other original ones with which to compare them to identify the copy he did not notice charlottes pink cheeks or averted eyes he was too absorbed with laying out the evidence for vespasia hmm she said as he concluded not very satisfactory but i suppose rather obvious except for one thing what thing charlotte said quickly one wonders why augustus did not have the copy made immediately vespasia answered and then require a more thorough search it could have been done within the first couple of days if he were going to do it at all why wait until the discomfort increased unless of course it was to teach finlay a lesson make him thoroughly frightened for a while and so perhaps more obedient why couldnt finlay have done it himself charlotte asked then looked down as if she regretted having spoken because he panicked and hasnt the brains vespasia replied simply pitt recalled his first meeting with finlay but he didnt seem panicked he said honestly he was startled upset even shocked but he didnt seem in a sweat of fear at all if anything i would say his fear grew as time went by and we continued to suspect him curious vespasia admitted what other evidence had you pitt noted that she spoke of it in the past and smiled ruefully identification by witness he replied then told her the story of nan sullivan and rose burke and their subsequent retraction vespasia considered for several moments before she commented not very satisfactory she agreed that could mean any of several things possibly she spoke the truth in the beginning and has been persuaded to withdraw it by pressure from someone else threat of injury or promise of reward or that her own sense of selfpreservation has overcome her hatred or her anger or conceivably she has decided the information is worth more if kept to herself and used at some future date for profit she frowned or it is possible she is telling the truth and it was a mixture of fear and desire to see someone caught and punished for adas death which made her act impulsively in the first place and on reflection she realized she was not prepared to perjure herself with an identification she was genuinely not sure of the story of the butler is tragic and no doubt true but obviously irrelevant to her death do you still think finlay did it charlotte asked very quietly anxiety puckering her brows i mean is the evidence really wrong or has his father very carefully removed it or invalidated it pitt considered for several moments i dont know he said at last i think if i have to make a decision i would say he did not but im not certain that is most unfortunate vespasia was simply stating a fact but not without sympathy if he is innocent then either he has an exceedingly vicious enemy or an extraordinary series of events has combined to make him appear guilty which my dear thomas seems unlikely yes it does pitt confessed i suppose i return to the very unpleasant task of trying to find the fitzjames familys enemies he sighed i wish i even knew whether it was finlays own enemy or his fathers he seems a fairly harmless young man a great deal more ordinary than he would probably wish to be a great deal vespasia agreed with a rueful smile i think his sister has more chance of doing something genuinely interesting but she may well be married out of that before she has the chance at the moment she is singularly flighty and doesnt appear to have a thought in her head except to enjoy herself preferably without thinking of anything with the least meaning beyond the following day but she does it with such fervor i have hope she may stumble upon something she will care about and that will make all the difference charlotte opened her mouth and then closed it again pitt wondered what she had been going to say usually when it was tactless it was also pertinent he could ask her after vespasia had left but he has the arrogance of those who sense their limitations vespasia went on regarding pitt seriously and who fear they may be smaller than their ambitions or the expectations of others for them who were the other members of this rather juvenile club one of them would seem to be in the ideal position to provide the model for the badge and also to be familiar with finlays habits to the degree where he could implicate him successfully pitt repeated their names vespasia looked blank thirlstone means nothing to me i have heard of a james helliwell he might have a son by the name of herbert norbert pitt corrected indeed or norbert either she conceded but he is a very pedestrian sort of man sufficient means to be comfortable and too little imagination to be uncomfortable unless he sat upon a tack and heaven knows there are as many joneses as there are browns or robinsons jago jones could be anyone at all or no one pitt found himself smiling helliwell sounds like the man i met very concerned with how he was perceived by others particularly his parentsinlaw and as you say beginning to be very comfortable and unwilling to let anything disturb that he is no longer so keen to defend finlay in case some of the notoriety sticks to him as well although he certainly did not wish me to continue investigating finlay an enemy charlotte said dubiously insufficient nerve vespasia dismissed him looking at pitt her eyes wide i think so pitt agreed remembering helliwells red face and his fidgeting manner his keenness to disclaim any association certainly he hasnt the honor to be loyal once it becomes costly thirlstone charlotte asked possibly as he said it he was seeing jago joness passionate face he was a man who had the courage the fire and the conviction but had he the cause i think he said slowly that i should look more closely into why ada was the victim why was it someone in whitechapel rather than the west end it seems irrational perhaps there is a reason there which may lead us to who it was vespasia rose to her feet and pitt stood instantly also offering her his hand she accepted it but leaned no weight on it at all thank you my dear i wish i could say i felt easier in my mind but i do not she regarded him very gravely searching his eyes i fear this is a most ugly case be careful thomas you may trust john cornwalliss honor and his courage absolutely but i suspect that his understanding of the deviousness of the political mind has a long way to go do not allow him to let you down by expecting of him a skill he does not possess and a loyalty which he does good night my dear good night aunt vespasia he replied as he stood watching while she kissed charlotte lightly on the cheek then head high she swept through the parlor door towards the front entrance and her waiting carriage he began early the next morning not exactly with enthusiasm but with a renewed determination ewart was already directed to pursue further details of both augustus and finlay fitzjames tellman was investigating the other members of the hellfire club pitt himself went back to pentecost alley to speak again with the women who had known ada last it was an inappropriate hour of the morning to find them but he could not afford the time or the patience to wait until the afternoon when they would naturally get up to begin the day of course the sweatshop over the road was thrumming with industry doors open because they had been at work for several hours by nine oclock and it was already hot pitt went up the steps to the wooden door of the tenement and knocked he had to repeat it several times before the door was finally opened by a badtemperedlooking madge her large face creased with irritation and weariness her eyes almost disappeared in the folds of fat in her cheeks what the ell time o day jer think this is she demanded aint yer got no she squinted at him oh its you wotjer want this time i dunno nuffink more ter tell yer an neither do rose ner nan ner agnes you might do pitt pushed against the door but her vast weight was rocklike yer int goin ter crop that bastard so wots it matter she said contemptuously yer show o duty dont impress me none somebody killed ada he insisted and hes still out there do you want me to find him or not i wanna be young an pretty an ave a nice ouse an enough ter eat she said sarcastically wen the ell did wot i want matter a sod ter anyone im not going away madge until i know everything about ada that i can he said levelly if you want a little peace to conduct your business and turn a profit youll humor me whether you think its worth it or not she did not need to weigh the issue wearily she stepped back and opened the door she heard him close it with a heavy thud and led him back into the small room she used as a kitchen sewing room and somewhere from which she could listen for calls of distress or sounds of violence pitt asked her every question he could think of about adas life what time she got up how she dressed when she came and went if madge knew where to or where from who with whom she had met he wanted any mention of friends or enemies however vague any names of clients or of possible allies he asked her to estimate adas income from her wardrobe her behavior her gifts to anyone else well madge said thoughtfully sitting on a stool and staring down at the stained table she were generous wen she ad it ill give er that anyoned give er that an she done well in the last couple o months got them new boots the day she were killed pleased as punch she were wi them marched up an down in em showin em orff lifted er skirts ter let me see em motheropearl buttons they ad her face tightened but i spose yer know that seein as ow yer came ere that night an found er pitt thought back to the boots which had been so laboriously buttoned together they were beautifully made he had not given a thought then to their cost yes i remember them did she usually have boots of such quality she laughed sharply course not make do and mend like the rest o us no she done well recent like i told yer her eyes narrowed till the fat in her cheeks almost obscured them ere are yer sayin as she done summink wrong ter get that money no he assured her he leaned forward elbows on the table but id like to know where it came from did it start when she changed from her old pimp to her new one yeah she conceded abaht then why bert costigan int that much better if thats wot yer thinkin es a fancylookin sod but e int that clever never liked im meself she shrugged but then i never liked any o them theyre all swine wen it comes ter it bleed yer dry an were was e wen she needed im eh she sniffed and the slow tears trickled down her enormous cheeks gawd knows not ere he woke rose and nan also and asked them all the same questions and received the same answers by that time agnes was up anyway and he asked her too but she contributed nothing to his knowledge except when he demanded a physical description of ada whose face he had never seen except disfigured by death her hesitant words were of limited use but he discovered in agnes a ready pencil which produced a sketch which was more of a caricature than a portrait but highly evocative he could see the character of a woman of humor even spirit it was extraordinarily alive even on the lined notebook page he could imagine her walk the angle of her head even her voice it made her death immeasurably worse and her torture something he could not bear to think of he went back to bow street and ate a cold mutton sandwich and a mug of tea at about six oclock he wrote down carefully in order the notes he had taken and he began to see a pattern in adas behavior she had obviously worked her own patch in old montague street and then the whitechapel road in the early evenings and sometimes late as well but there were regular times when she was absent excellent times for her trade when one would have expected her to take full advantage of the opportunities one answer leaped to mind she had gone to a more profitable area was this the influence of albert costigan a more ambitious man and she had been only too willing to try to improve her situation was it possible that in this new guise she had met either one of finlays enemies or one of his fathers was it even remotely worth searching so far neither tellman nor ewart had discovered anything of relevance he spent the evening and the later part of the following day and the one after that walking the prostitutes beats around the west end windmill street the haymarket leicester square and the streets and alleys close by he saw thousands of women much like ada some gorgeously dressed parading like peacocks others less so some in little more than gaudy rags many even in the gaslight after dark still looked long past their prime raddlecheeked slackbodied some were country fresh come to the city to seek their fortune and finding it in the accommodation rooms in hasty fornication with strangers often their fathers or even grandfathers ages and there were also children eight or ten years old running after men pulling at their sleeves and whispering dirty words in hope of exciting their interest or thrusting into their hands lurid pornographic pictures side by side with them were the theater crowds respectable women even wealthy ladies on their husbands arms arriving at or leaving the performance of some play or concert pitt tried every contact he had in the rooming houses the pimps and madams he knew but no one owned to recognizing his picture of ada or knowing her name other than from the news that she was dead since finlay fitzjamess connection had not been mentioned the newspapers had made little of it no one knew of the broken fingers and toes except lennox ewart cornwallis and himself he was close to defeat when it occurred to him to try away from the west end and into the hyde park area he had one more personal acquaintance to try a huge complacent and unctuous figure known as fat george he ruled his prostitutes with a rod of iron and the threat of his righthand man wee georgie a vicious dwarf with a filthy temper and quick to use the long thinbladed knife he always carried he found fat george in his own house an extremely wellappointed classically proportioned building off inverness terrace fat george did not rise his enormous body was almost wedged into his chair it was a warm day and he wore a loose shirt newly laundered his greasy gray curls sitting on the collar well now mr pitt he said in his whispering wheezy voice what brings you to call on me so urgently must be something terrible important to you sit down sit down havent seen you since that ugly business in the park long time solving that you were not very clever mr pitt not very efficient fat george shook his head and his curls caught on his collar not what we pay our police force for youre supposed to keep us safe mr pitt we should sleep easy in our beds knowin as youre out there protectin us if there was humor in fat georges black eyes it barely showed we can only solve crimes after theyve happened george not before pitt replied accepting a seat there are a good many around here you could have prevented do you know anything about this woman he passed over agness sketch fat george took it in his paleskinned freckled hand his fingers swollen so the bones were invisible yeah ive seen her he said after several seconds smart girl ambitious like to have her meself but shes greedy wants all her money for erself dangerous that mr pitt very dangerous she the one that got killed up whitechapel shouldve seen that coming dont have far to look likely dont i not clever mr pitt george wagged his head pushing out his lower lip losin your touch are you try er pimp fellow called costigan so i hear very publicspirited of you george and very quick to blame one of your own pitt said dryly gives me a bad name george wheezed sententiously bit o discipline is all very well necessary or youd be walked all over cant ave that girlsd be cheatin you left and right but stranglin is overdoin it brings people like you around an thats all very nasty he coughed and his vast chest rumbled with congestion the room was hot the high windows all closed giving it a musty air in spite of its cool colors gracious lines and at least half a dozen potted palms placed here and there so why didnt costigan discipline her pitt asked eyebrows raised killing her would seem to defeat his own purpose only a fool destroys his own livestock george made a gesture of distaste oh very crudely put mr pitt very crude indeed its a crude trade george what makes you think this costigan even knew ada was sneaking up west occasionally and then keeping her earnings fat george shrugged and his ripples of fat shook all down his body maybe he followed her natural thing to do if he was following her pitt reasoned hed have known the first time she left whitechapel which was several weeks ago fat george rolled his eyes how do i know maybe someone told him pitt suggested watching georges face there was a very slight flicker a tightening of the sallow skin enough for pitt you told him didnt you george it was not a question but a statement she was on your patch but refusing to pay you either so rather than let wee georgie at her and risk unpleasantness for yourself you told her own pimp and let him deal with it only he went too far not your fault of course he finished scathingly when did you tell him the room was becoming suffocating like a jungle george raised colorless eyebrows the day she were killed but im hardly to blame mr pitt your tone int polite in fact most unjust youre an unjust man mr pitt and that isnt right expect the police to be just if justice itself dont pitt stood up and shot him a look of such contempt fat george left the rest of his complaint unfinished costigan a trouble to you was he pitt said bitterly a threat hardly fat george tried to laugh broke into a wheeze and ended coughing again his massive chest heaving as he fought for breath pitt had no sympathy for him at all he turned on his heel and walked out leaving george purple in the face gasping for air and furious pitt took constable binns with him when he went to see albert costigan later that afternoon he knew the area and found him without difficulty in the rooms he rented in plumbers row just the other side of the whitechapel road from pentecost alley it was narrow and gray on the outside like all the other tenements but inside was well furnished even comfortable costigan liked to do nicely for himself and his expensive tastes showed in the small extras engraved glass gas mantels a new carpet a very nice oak gatelegged table costigan himself was of average height with large pale blue eyes good nose and white teeth his brown hair was brushed back in waves from his brow at a glance before one noticed the defensive aggrieved expression in his face the aggressive angle of his body he was not unlike finlay fitzjames had chance given him the same wealth and selfconfidence the education of manner they could have passed for cousins pitt had no evidence against costigan except fat georges words which were worth nothing as testimony what was the oath of one pimp against the oath of another and even a search of costigans rooms would be unlikely to reveal anything of use it would be natural enough for him to have adas possessions and very easily explained yer still lookin fer oo killed poor ada costigan said accusingly yer got nothing ave yer his contempt was quite open well ive got some ideas pitt answered sitting down on the largest and most comfortable armchair and leaving binns standing by the door costigan remained standing also looking resentfully down at pitt oh yeah whats that then we think its something to do with her going up towards hyde park pitt replied costigan stopped fidgeting from one foot to the other and stared at pitt oo said she went up there i never did are you going to tell me you didnt know pitt asked innocently not very efficient of you mr costigan one of your girls going up to the expensive end of town getting custom up there and you didnt know about it dont suppose you saw much of the money then he smiled that would be good for a few laughs around here course i knew costigan said quickly lifting his chin a little take me for a fool id beat the ell out o any girl wot cheated me like that but i wouldnt kill er thatd be stupid cant sell a girl wots dead now can yer his large bright eyes did not leave pitts they were aggressive and triumphant as if he had won some contest between them pitt glanced around the room and back at costigan again it was not difficult to believe he had made a good deal of money out of someone he could be telling the truth except for what fat george had said and that could be a lie simply to damage a business rival did you send any other girls up there pitt asked his hope beginning to fade costigan hesitated trying to decide whether to lie or not no just ada she ad class she ad he looked sorry for himself he glanced at binns in the doorway scribbling down what he said class pitt said dubiously yeah costigans head jutted forward dressed nice ad er air nice could make men laugh they like that some girls is pretty but stupid ada ad brains an a quick tongue he squared his shoulders staring at pitt bragging an like i said she dressed nice good enough fer up west not like some o them tarts around ere wot look like they int got no idea wot a lady looks like at the doorway binns let out a grunt costigan took it for disbelief she did an all he said angrily red an black dress she ad good as any o them tarts up the aymarket way an new boots wi pearly buttons on em cost a fortune boots like that tarts around ere dont ave nothin like them boots pitt said very slowly a sudden lift of excitement in his chest at the very same moment as the weight of tragedy struck him yeah boots costigan snapped quite unaware of what he had said when did you see them mr costigan pitt asked glancing at binns to make sure he was writing everything down wot i dunno why think pitt ordered when did you see the boots oo cares i seen em costigan was flushed now his eyes overbright his hands were clenched at his sides and there was a thin line of perspiration on his upper lip i believe you saw them pitt accepted i think you went up to the hyde park area perhaps with a view to breaking into trade there or perhaps you already suspected ada was doing a little independent work and you saw fat george and fat george told you that ada was indeed working up there and doing quite well you realized she was cheating you and you came back here and faced her with it she told you she didnt need you and to whistle for your share you tried hurting her a little bit only she defied you you lost your temper and in the quarrel you killed her possibly you didnt intend to when you started but your vanity was wounded maybe she laughed at you you held her too hard and before you thought about it she was dead costigan stared at him too appalled to speak his face contorted with fear and when you realized she was dead pitt went on you put a garter round her arm and buttoned the new boots to each other to make it look like some customer with a fetish a taste for sadism or ritual and you left costigan swallowed convulsively his mouth and lips were dry his skin ashen you were seen pitt went on wanting now to finish it as quickly as possible i think if we ask rose burke shell identify you and perhaps nan sullivan will remember your coat she used to be a seamstress and she has a very good eye for a cotton albert costigan im arresting you for the murder of ada mckinley costigan let out his breath in a gasp of despair and collapsed into the chair still too horrified to speak thank heaven cornwallis leaned back in his seat in the box at the theater and glanced across at pitt charlotte and her mother caroline were sitting on the farther side both leaning forward over the balcony watching the people coming and going in the stalls below them the performance was halfway through carolines new husband joshua fielding was the star pitt had been uncertain how cornwallis would react to the news that pitts motherinlaw had remarried and to an actor so much her junior but if cornwallis found it extraordinary he was too courteous to show it it was also impossible to tell what he thought of the play itself a deeply emotional and rather daring drama which raised several controversial issues if pitt had been aware of that in advance he would not have invited his superior with micah drummond it had been different he knew him well enough both his passions and his vulnerabilities to be quite aware what would offend him and what would not cornwallis was still a stranger they had shared far too little only this one case which as it now turned out seemed to be very ordinary and to have delivered none of the dangers it had threatened at first pitt really need not have been called in but of course they could not have known that initially cornwallis ran his hand over his head and smiled ruefully i confess i thought this case was going to be most unpleasant he said with a sigh of relief we were extremely fortunate it turned out to be the poor womans own pimpin a sense almost a domestic matter there was a very fine wrinkle across his brow he did not look as at ease as his words suggested he was immaculately dressed in evening suit and snowwhite shirt but through his elegant clothes there was a tension visible in his body as though he were not entirely comfortable charlotte and caroline were still peering over the balcony rail shoulder to shoulder staring down was it just mischance that we were led to suspect fitzjames cornwallis asked quietly so his words would not be overheard it was as if he did not want to discuss the subject but felt compelled to im not sure i believe in mischance of that sort pitt replied thoughtfully he too was relieved it had in the end so easily proved to be costigan but there were facets of the case which were troubling too many questions costigans arrest and charge did not answer which was the real badge cornwallis asked as if reading his thoughts the first or the second or were they both in the sense that fitzjames had them both made there was laughter from the next box and an exclamation of surprise from everywhere came the buzz of conversation i dont know pitt replied helliwell had the first badges made and he says he has forgotten who the jeweler was and cannot find his own and the other two members cornwallis pressed they also claim never to have known the name of the original jeweler and to have lost their own badges pitt shrugged i rather suspect fitzjames had the second one made to try to prove his innocence or at least to throw question on his guilt then the badge you found in pentecost alley was his cornwallis said quickly swiveling around to face pitt all attempt at casualness abandoned what has that to do with costigan i dont understand neither do i pitt admitted he was about to continue when there was a knock on the door of the box and a moment later micah drummond came in he greeted charlotte and caroline then as soon as formalities were over turned to pitt and cornwallis he was a tall lean man with a gentle aquiline face grace of manner and long habit of command masked a natural shyness congratulations he said warmly to both men a potentially very unpleasant case handled smoothly and you managed to keep most of it out of the papers which was just as well ive heard murmurs that fitzjames is very pleased he laughed abruptly i suppose grateful would be too strong a word for such a man but hell remember it he may prove an ally in the future only if our enemies happen also to be his cornwallis said dryly hes a man to remember an offense and forget a service not that our conduct of the case was in any sense intended to be a service to him he added quickly if pitt had proved his son guilty id have had him arrested as soon as costigan or anyone else micah drummond smiled im sure you would im still delighted it didnt prove necessary he glanced at pitt and then back again at cornwallis there is nothing we can do if tragedy strikes one of the prominent families but its a most wretched thing to have to deal with pitts mind flew back to the tragedy which had affected eleanor byam who was now drummonds second wife the tension and the pain of that experience the ultimate terrible outcome and pitts understanding of drummonds own emotions had forged a bond between them which was still absent from his respect for cornwallis drummond swung around to exchange a few words with charlotte and compliment caroline on joshuas performance then he excused himself and left pitt turned to cornwallis and was about to resume their conversation when there was another brief tap on the door and vespasia sailed in with her head high she looked marvelous she had chosen to make a great occasion of the event and was dressed in lavender and steelgray silk on anyone else it might have been cold but with her silver hair and the diamonds at her ears and throat it was magnificent pitt and cornwallis automatically rose to their feet quite fascinating my dear vespasia said to caroline what an entrancing man such a presence caroline blushed realized she was doing it and blushed the more thank you she said almost hesitantly i think he is doing it rather well he is doing it superbly vespasia admonished the part could have been written for him i daresay it was good evening charlotte good evening thomas no doubt you are pleased with yourself good evening john good evening lady vespasia he bowed very slightly to her he looked at once pleased and uncomfortable pitt glanced at him and saw from his expression that he was already aware that vespasia was in some distant way related at least to charlotte he was not surprised to see her as he must otherwise have been quite extraordinary vespasia went on with a very slight lift of one shoulder and without offering any explanation of what she was referring to she turned back to caroline with a charming smile im so glad i came please dont consider it in the slightest way a reflection on the fact that the alternative was the opera which was something wagnerian and fearfully portentous to do with gods and destiny i prefer my doomed love affairs in italian and to do with human frailty which i understand rather than fate which i do not and predestination which i do not believe in i refuse to it negates all that humanity is if it is to be worth anything whatever caroline opened her mouth to say something polite and changed her mind it was not necessary and no one least of all vespasia expected it and i could not abide to sit and watch augustus fitzjames preen himself vespasia continued i dont know whether he is really fond of wagner or only considers it the correct mark of good taste but he attends every one and always on the first night with his wife wearing half a south african diamond mine round her neck the sight of his face would be worse than sitting in a box listening to brunnhilde screaming for four hours or sieglinde or isolde or whoever it is but it would be interesting to look around the audience and see if anyone is in a particularly filthy mood would it pitt said confusedly she looked at him with shadowed silver eyes well my dear thomas someone has tried very hard to ruin mr fitzjamess family and has apparently failed that wretched little man costigan may have killed the girl but do you really suppose it was his own idea to implicate young fitzjames where on earth would such a man acquire a club badge and a cuff link with which to do it do you imagine they could be acquainted she did not ask it sarcastically she was considering the possibility i dont know pitt replied it doesnt seem likely but there is a lot yet unanswered im going back to question him again tomorrow from what we have at the moment it doesnt seem to make sense that finlay fitzjames had anything to do with it at all either directly or indirectly then how did his badge and cuff link get there charlotte asked curiously do you suppose ada stole them i dont know pitt repeated perhaps finlay left them behind some other time or someone else did jago joness face flitted into his mind with a sharp unhappy thought i wish i felt it was purely a mischance vespasia said with a little shake of her head at least i think i do i really find augustus fitzjames one of the most displeasing men i have ever known there is much in him i can understand but he has the soul of a bully there was a faint tinkling of a warning bell here and there a box door opened a dozen women moved in a drift of colored silks a score of men rose to their feet and slowly the audience began to make their way back to their seats the noise of chatter dropped to an intermittent hum vespasia smiled it has been delightful to see you but for once i have come to the theater principally to see the performance i intend to be seated when the curtain rises again and she bade them all farewell and left in a rustle of shadowdark silk and the scent of jasmine cornwallis sat down again and turned to pitt we need to know where those possessions of fitzjames came from and how they got to adas room he said just above a whisper now that costigan is charged fitzjames is going to want to know who tried to implicate him and whether they used costigan or not your job isnt over im afraid he frowned and leaned a little closer as the lights went down it was a pretty wild chance implying fitzjames was in a place like pentecost alley how did he even know he couldnt account for his time most young men of his age and station spend their evenings in company the chance that he was alone and couldnt remember where he was was god knows one in a hundred he dropped his voice even lower as the curtain rose on the stage i have a very unpleasant feeling pitt that it was someone close to him and you had better find out if you can which of the two badges was the original he sighed and if finlay had the second one made or his father did continue to overlook it theres nothing we can do about it anyway his tone was sharp with anger and regret he did not need to say how deeply he hated the compromise of his principles it required further conversation was prevented by the necessity of courtesy that he watch the second act not to have done so would have hurt caroline they settled down to enjoy it charlotte glancing at pitt her eyes anxious caroline absorbed in the stage and cornwallis sitting back his brow smoothed out the pentecost alley case temporarily set aside i dunno costigan said desperately i dunno anyfink abaht it he was sitting in his cell in newgate and pitt was standing by the door staring at him trying to fathom whether he was speaking the truth or still lyingeither by habit or with some hope of evading punishment it was pointless he would hang for having killed ada anything else would simply be for the record to solve the remaining mystery his dejected figure was hunched up and seemed far smaller without his wellcut clothes and crisp shirt he wore an old gray jacket now and it was rumpled as if he had not bothered to hang it up while he slept looking at him pitt found it hard to be brutal and tell him the truth which was foolish he must know it there could never have been any other outcome once he had admitted seeing the boots he was caught and he had understood that with all it meant when he had seen pitts face and realized his own admission even so there was something of a different level of reality once it was put into words all hope was killed even the faint whisper thread of denial of not having faced it yet i dunno costigan repeated staring at the ground between his feet i never saw the bleedin badge or the cuff link i swear ter gawd the cuff link was down the back of the chair pitt agreed but the badge was underneath her body on the bed come on costigan how long could it have lain there without anyone noticing it the thing had a pin on it half an inch long and it was unfastened costigans head came up so it were er last customer stands ter reason ow do i know ow it got there mebbe e showed it to er or she were braggin as ow she nicked it and were showin it ter im pitt thought about it for a moment the first suggestion was not likely simply because it required the extraordinary coincidence of someones placing finlays belongings in adas room the very night she was murdered and by costigan without premeditation costigans discovery of her cheating and his loss of temper could not have been foreseen or could they could someone possibly have paid fat george to tell costigan that day specifically and then watched costigan to see what he would do followed him back to whitechapel and wot costigan demanded watching pitts face wot is it wot dyer know no no one of power and intelligence no matter how they hated fitzjames would place themselves into the hands of fat george by using him in such a way it was far too convoluted depending on too many people fat george costigan himself and some other person to place the evidence no one would take that risk nothing he said aloud did ada steal you suggested maybe she was showing the badge to someone didnt you teach her not to steal its dangerous bad for business costigan stared up at him his skin white eyes frightened yeah course i did but that dont mean she always listened do it i taught her not to cheat neither but she still did stupid cow his face filled with regret which was more than selfpity there was a genuine sadness in it perhaps old madge was right and he had been attracted to ada himself perhaps even fond of her that would have made her betrayal hurt the more a personal issue not just a financial one it would explain why his temper had been so violent the sense of having the emotions he gave so rarely twisted and turned against him it was truly a domestic affair did you ever know her to steal before pitt asked the edge of anger gone from his voice costigan was staring at the floor again no no she were smart ada were too smart to steal from a customer treated em well she did lot of em came reglar she were fun made em laugh she ad class tears spilled over his eyes and ran down his cheeks she were good the stupid bitch i liked er she should never a cheated me i were good ter er whyd she make me do it now shes finished both o us pitt was sorry it was a stupid futile tragedy of greed and wounded feelings the ungoverned temper of a foolish man whose ambitions outstripped his ability and both of them had been used by a cleverer and crueler man in fat george and perhaps an even subtler and more callous man beyond him do you know fitzjames he asked no costigan was too sunk in his misery to be angry he did not even look up he was no longer interested did anyone ever mention him to you think no one cept you costigan said wearily wot is it with you an fitzjames i dunno ow is things got inter adas place somebody stole em an left em there i spose ow do i know go ask is friends or is enemies i only know it int me and pitt could get no more from him there was no punishment he could possibly receive worse than that for which he was already destined and there was no reward that would be of the slightest use to him now apart from that pitt believed him that he had no further knowledge he left newgate and walked out of the humid stone building into the heat of the august afternoon but it was a long time before the sense of chill left him the deep coldness inside from the presence of despair and unreachable misery by half past five he was back in devonshire street and requesting the cheerful butler for the opportunity to speak to mr finlay fitzjames he was granted it immediately and was conducted over yards of finely polished parquet floor into the library where both finlay and augustus were sitting near the open window which looked onto the garden past the tangle of honeysuckle flowers and stems it was easy to see a glimpse of pale muslin as tallulah pushed herself gently back and forth in a swing seat her eyes closed her face up towards the sun in a most unfashionable manner no wonder her complexion had far more color than was deemed fit something further superintendent augustus said curiously he closed his book a heavy tome whose lettering was too small for pitt to read upside down and left it on his lap as though to resume any moment very little pitt replied glancing at finlay who was watching him with interest now that costigan had been arrested and charged he was completely relaxed almost arrogant again he was very casually dressed his thick hair brushed back from his face in heavy waves his expression polite and confident then why have you come mr pitt he asked looking up without moving or offering pitt a seat we know nothing whatsoever about the whole miserable business which if you remember is what we told you in the first instance im sure neither my father nor i wish to be informed detail by detail of your progress or lack of it it is all very pedestrian and rather shabby it is shabby pitt agreed resenting finlays arrogance bitterly almost as if he himself had not despised costigan just as much he sat down uninvited but it is not pedestrian he added it is most unusual is it finlays eyebrows rose i would have thought prostitutes were quite often beaten or killed especially in the east end pitt had difficulty in controlling his voice so it did not show the indifference to death infuriated him anyones death adas costigans anyones at all that sort of motive is quite common mr fitzjames he tried to speak unemotionally but he could not keep the shadow of sarcasm out of his voice but it is extraordinary to find at the scene of such a murder the personal possessions of a man like yourself when you have no connection whatever with the victim or with the crime well as you now know superintendent i do have no connection with it finlay was smiling his eyes bright it was her own pimp i thought we had agreed that was beyond question if youve come here to ask me how a badge which looks like mine came to be there i had no idea in the beginning and i still have no idea pitt clenched his teeth and does that not bother you sir he asked staring levelly at finlays handsome face and wide complacent gaze the badge was in the bed with the pin open it could not have been there more than a very short time half an hour at the very most if you are suggesting that finlay was there half an hour before the murder augustus interrupted icily then you are not only mistaken superintendent but you are impertinent and beginning to exceed your authority and trespass upon our goodwill not at all pitt answered finlay might not know why pitt had come but surely augustus must now guess why was he pretending to be angry and obtuse pitt had not expected thanks but neither had he expected this prickly pretense i am quite satisfied his account of his day was exactly true the mistaken identification of him as having been in pentecost alley is easy enough to understand augustus was not interested and certainly not about to be placed in obligation to an inferior who had done no more than his duty if you have a point superintendent please arrive at it if you wish my thanks i am obliged you handled the matter with discretion i trust you do not expect further of me than that it was grossly offensive i did not expect even that pitt snapped i perform my duty for myself for no one else there was no personal favor involved to consider similarly i find it my duty to discover who could have placed your sons belongings at the scene of a crime presumably with the intention of having him at the very best involved in a scandal and his reputation damagedat the worst hanged he said the word distinctly and with pleasure i would have expected you to wish the answer known even more fervently than i do augustuss eyes narrowed he had obviously not anticipated such a retort and his reaction was unprepared and if the hellfire club badge which was discovered in your pocket sir pitt went on turning to finlay was your original one then someone has gone to a great deal of trouble to see you blamed it also raises the question not only why they had a second badge made with your name on it but how they knew to make it so exactly similar to the first the only way even a jeweler can tell them apart is by the very slight variation in the script behind the pin finlays composure disappeared he looked pale and the confidence went from his eyes leaving them glittering and nervous he turned slowly and looked at his father for a moment augustus was also caught off balance he had no answer ready his resentment that pitt should have caused him discomfort was hard in his mouth the tightening of his lips finlay drew breath to speak looked back at pitt then at his father again and changed his mind did you have the badge made yourself sir pitt asked it would be understandable in the circumstances and not require any explanation before the law nno finlay stuttered then swallowed no i didnt he looked profoundly unhappy now a long clock by the far wall chimed the quarter hour through the window tallulah was still visible in the swing seat i did superintendent augustus said at last as to the first badge i can only presume it was lost or stolen years ago as my son has already said similarly the cuff link no one has seen that in five years either one can only presume the same person had both of them and chanced to use ada mckinleys services and leave them both there either on the same occasion or on two separate occasions pitt finished unable to keep the disbelief from his voice augustuss features were expressionless except for a swift flicker of rage there and then gone again it would seem so he said coldly pitt turned to finlay then that narrows down the possibilities a great deal he reasoned there cannot be many of your acquaintances who had the opportunity to find by chance or to steal from you two such intimate articles and then accidentally to lose them in pentecost alley the night of adas murder the cuff link could have been there for any amount of time augustus pointed out his face tight with anger you said it was hidden from view down the back of a chair it might have been there for years exactly pitt agreed and the badge could only have been there since the previous customer any new person in the bed must have felt it all very puzzling augustus granted but it is not a problem with which anyone in my family can assist you and frankly since you know beyond question who killed the wretched woman i would have thought you had better pursuits with which to occupy your time are you not rather a senior officer to be concerned with the possible theft of a cuff link and a badge neither of them intrinsically worth more than a guinea or two and perfectly easily replaced my son is not pressing charges against anyone nor have we at any time even reported the loss much less requested that you investigate the matter he picked up his book again although he kept it closed thank you for your concern but we would all rather you bent your efforts towards preventing some of the violence that mars our streets or protecting our more valuable property from thieves i am obliged to you for calling superintendent he reached with the other hand towards the bell to summon a servant to show pitt out i am not concerned with the property pitt answered still sitting where he was only with the use made of it to try to incriminate you he looked at finlay you appear to have a very powerful and very bitter enemy sir the police would like to give you all possible assistance in discovering who that is and if necessary prosecuting them finlay was white a fine beading of sweat on his skin he swallowed as if he had something caught in his throat i have many enemies superintendent augustus cut across him but his tone was guarded it is the price of success it is unpleasant but i am not afraid of it the attempt to ruin my son has failed should they try anything further i will deal with it myself with whatever defense is appropriate to its nature i always have i appreciate your concern for our wellbeing and your interest in justice this time he reached the bell the footman will show you out good day to you pitt remained unsatisfied about the issue but he could not afford the time to pursue it any further nor could he think of any useful line of enquiry if augustus had had the second badge made that was explained but not how the first one had been put in the bed in pentecost alley or how it had come into the possession of whoever had left it there pitt could not believe both that and the cuff link had ended in the same room accidentally possibly it was an enemy of augustus fitzjames who sought this brutal and devious way to have his revenge but it seemed more likely the opportunity had arisen for an enemy of finlay the other members of the hellfire club seemed the obvious choice why had they disbanded tedium a sudden maturity some opportunity for one of them to advance himself for which sobriety and a better reputation were necessary and that had brought all of them to a realization that it was time to abandon such selfindulgence or had there been a quarrel pitt could not get rid of the idea that it was a quarrel and that jago jones was the one with the obvious opportunity to leave anything in adas rooms yet jagos face when he had first questioned him about the murder still sprang to his eye and the horror in it when he had told him that finlays badge had been found in the bed did finlay actually know who had tried to incriminate him and did he also know why was it possible that he planned his own revenge perhaps with his fathers help why would he not simply tell pitt and allow him to deal with it a prosecution for theft or even for simply leaving another mans belongings in a prostitutes room would ruin jago jones it would ruin helliwell his very proper parentsinlaw would be scandalized by such a thing polite society would cease to know him it would be long drawn out and acutely painful the victim would suffer every moment of it both in anticipation and in retrospect what punishment could be crueler or more effective than that if augustus did not choose to effect it then there must be some reason to stay his hand and hold the threat forever over someone to ask for some favor in return something so big it would be worth forgoing the present pleasure could taking his vengeance rebound upon himself or his family was the glamorous and flighty tallulah in some way vulnerable it did not occur to pitt as a possibility that augustus would forgive the offense august ended in suffocating heat and passed into early september the trial of albert costigan was due to begin two evenings before it opened pitt went back to whitechapel to see ewart and the police surgeon lennox they met not in the police station but in a public house off swan street and ate a supper of cold pigeon pie washed down with cider and followed by plum cake they talked of agreeable things lennox told a funny story about one of his patients a little farther west who had recently acquired a bathtub and invited all the neighbors to behold it ewart was elated because his eldest son had won a place at university and passed his firstyear exams pitt was surprised that the boy had had sufficient education in whitechapel for such a thing to be possible but he forbore from saying so then ewart explained that he had been able to send him to boarding school where he had received excellent tuition makes all the difference to a man education he said with a sad little smile both bitter and sweet and pitt wondered what wealth of sacrifice had made it possible for a man on ewarts pay his wife too must have forfeited a great deal it gave him a view of ewart he had not even considered before and he admired him for it he must have saved all his life but he did not comment on it it would have been intrusive he smiled at ewart and ewart looked away and avoided his eyes as though embarrassed the murder in pentecost alley was not even touched upon until they left the public house and walked gently towards the river and the shadows cast by the huge edifice of the tower of london the evenings were drawing in the air was still balmy but night came far sooner and there was a sense of autumn approaching a fading of flowers a dustiness of the ground too long without hard soaking rain they stopped on the grass mound under the tower and stood looking towards the river the pall of soot and smoke was behind them the light was soft and apricot gold over the shining sheet of water hazy in the distance softening the line of the farther shore tower bridge was just above them downstream there was nothing more barring the way to the open sea are you going to mention the badge and the cuff link pitt asked ewart the subject had to be discussed they were to testify the day after tomorrow dont see any point ewart replied guardedly looking sideways at pitt doesnt seem to have any relevance to what happened i went back to fitzjames pitt said squinting into the sun the reflection off the water was becoming brighter a vivid daub of color almost silver where it touched the slight ripples of a passing pleasure boat darker at the widening edges where it spilled across the shore i asked him if he had made the second badge himself always thought he had lennox pursed his lips his face still looked melancholy even in the calm golden air of evening the light picked out the fine lines around his mouth and eyes worn into his flesh by the strain of pity or distress pitt wondered what private life he had where his home was if he had anyone there to care for anyone with whom he could laugh and share the beautiful and good things or to whom he could tell at least some of the things that hurt him ewart was talking to him and he had not heard what did you say im sorry i wasnt listening fitzjames admitted it ewart pressed then that solves it doesnt it stupid perhaps but understandable theres no point in making any mention of it it only raises questions we cant answer and which dont matter now i daresay he did go there sometime and lost them then point is it wasnt that night and thats all that matters it wasnt finlay who had it made pitt argued it was his father comes to the same thing ewart dismissed it but a look of loathing crossed his face for an instant and was suppressed costigan swears he doesnt know anything about them pitt said quietly into the balmy stillness it still bothered him it did not make any sense he could understand ewarts feeling he shared it maybe he doesnt lennox said quietly i still think fitzjames had something to do with adaif not her death then at least as a customer i dont believe anyone stole those things from him who would except ada herself one of his friends or supposed friends ewart responded after a moment maybe one of the original club members we dont know what they really felt about each other could have been a lot of envy there finlay had more money than any of them more opportunities in life hes going on to hold high office someday they are not there was an anger almost a viciousness in his voice that was startling in the golden summer evening pitt thought of how easily finlays opportunities had been bought and at what cost ewarts sons had been the countless small things that had been given up to pay for it it was not surprising ewart felt resentful at finlays waste of it well never know ewart caught himself and the emotion died out of his voice it became bland again professional we never do know all of a case there are motives small actions unexplained in even the best of them we have the right man thats all that really matters he pushed his hands into his pockets and stared over the water one or two barges had already lit riding lights and they drifted almost without undulation its part of the crime pitt said unsatisfied someone put those things there which means if it wasnt costigan then someone else was present a good defense counsel is going to ask who it was and raise reasonable doubt lennox stared at him his face half shadowed half gold in the dying sunlight there was surprise in him and a mixture of alarm ewart frowned his mouth tight eyes black theyd never get him off he said slowly hes guilty as the devil its all perfectly plain she cheated him and he found out he went to her to have it out she wasnt giving in maybe told him to take himself off they quarreled and he lost his temper sadistic little swine but then what kind of man lives off the prostitution of women anyway lennox let out a little grunt sad and savage his shoulders were hunched hard as if all his body muscles were locked there was utter loathing in every part of his face in the half the sun caught the other half was almost invisible pitt guessed what he felt he was the one who had examined adas body touched her seen precisely what had been done to her he must have imagined her alive perhaps he even knew what pain she had experienced with the wrenched and dislocated joints the broken bones the terror as she struggled for breath his own pity for costigan drained away as he watched the younger mans emotions raw in his face pitt sighed what im really thinking of is that fitzjames knows who it was who tried to incriminate him or believes he does and will take his own revenge he said quietly ewart shrugged if we cant work it out why should they he laughed with surprising bitterness and if he succeeds and gets caught i for one shall not mind the western sky was burning with the last embers spilling fire across the water and casting them into black shadows from the tower and the span of the bridge the tide was running faster but the air was still warm and there were just as many people out strolling some alone some arm in arm with others the sound of laughter came from somewhere just beyond sight ewart shrugged we cant stop them sir the sir distanced him from pitt in a sense closing the subject if they know that much theyll almost certainly have the right person and id say they deserve it its a filthy thing to do trying to get a man hanged for a crime he didnt commit his face was hard and weary the light accentuating the lines anyway if you think you can stop augustus fitzjames from executing his own form of justice on his enemies pardon me for saying it sir but you just arent living in the world as it is if theres a crime committed and we know about it it is our job to try to sort it out but a private hatred between gentlemen is not our business pitt said nothing we cant take the whole world on our backs ewart went on hunching himself as if he had become cold and it would be overstepping ourselves if we imagined we can do anything about it or that we even should he refused our help pitt said i offered and he refused very firmly doesnt want you looking into the family too closely lennox said with an abrupt laugh costigan might have killed the girl but finlays conduct wont bear too close an investigation if he wants an ambassadorship he spat the word out as if his teeth were clenched although it was now too dark to see and he had turned away from the light well if thats so ewart said tartly youd be best to leave it alone he wont thank you for ferreting around in finlays life to find out who has cause to hate him and why youd no doubt turn up some pretty shabby behavior and augustusll direct his vengeance at you and perhaps the law too youve no cause to investigate finlay now weve got our man leave it alone sir for everybodys sake lennox let out a little gasp as if he had stubbed his toe on a stone but he was not moving ewart was right there was no legal ground for pursuing the subject and augustus fitzjames had made it unmistakably clear that he did not wish police assistance unless pitt could deduce the answer from the information he already possessed he was not going to resolve it then ill see you in court the day after tomorrow he said resignedly are you going back that way he gestured towards the queens stairs no no ill go home ewart answered thank you sir good night yes ill come lennox moved with pitt and they walked in companionable silence over the grass and down towards the steps and the water then back up again to great tower hill it was almost dark they gave the evidence as precisely and exactly as they could trying to rob it of emotion and failing lennox in particular was whitefaced his voice highpitched with the tension in his throat his lips dry ewart was more practical but a sense of triumph and relief came through his composure and a hatred for the viciousness and the greed and the stupidity of it all there was not a large crowd it was not a particularly interesting case albert costigan was a name unknown outside the immediate area of the whitechapel road ada mckinley was merely an unfortunate woman who ran the risks of her trade and had met with a fate no one would have wished on her but at the same time no one was surprised and only a few grieved pitt saw rose burke there the first day and nan sullivan surprisingly handsome in black he did not see agnes if she came he missed her in the crowd nor was old madge there perhaps as she had said she never left the house none of the fitzjameses attended but then he had not thought that they might as far as they were concerned as soon as finlay was exonerated that was the end of the matter thirlstone and helliwell had never wanted anything to do with it from the first but jago jones was there his startling face with its intensity making him extraordinary in spite of his faded clothes and no mark to distinguish him as a priest no high white collar no cross or sign of office his cheeks were gaunt hollowed under the high bones and his eyes were shadowed as if he had slept badly for weeks he listened intently to every witness one might have thought from the attention he gave it that judgment was his not the jurors and he in the end must answer for it it crossed pitts mind to wonder if jago was the priest chosen to try to save costigans soul before his last short walk would he be the one to seek a confession from him in the hours before execution then to go those terrifying final steps to the gallows at eight oclock in the morning it was a task he would not have wished on anyone at all what were they to say something about the love of god the sacrifice of christ for all men what would the words mean to costigan had he ever in his life known what love waspassionate unconditional wide as the heavens love which never faded or withdrew and yet was still just did he even understand the concept of sacrificing in order that someone else might benefit would jago be speaking in a language that costigan had never heard of an idea as remote to him as the fires that burned in the stars perhaps there was nothing more to do than speak quietly look at him and meet his eyes without contempt and without judgment simply as another human being aware of his terror and caring about it as pitt stared across the courtroom at the inexorable process of the law there was a ruthlessness about it which frightened him also the wigs and gowns seemed as much masks for the men behind them as symbols of the majesty of justice it was supposed to be anonymous but it seemed merely inhuman there was very little defense costigans lawyer could offer he was young but he made a considerable effort at suggesting mitigating circumstances a woman who was greedy and who cheated even by the standards of behavior accepted by her own trade he suggested it was a quarrel which had gone beyond control costigan had not meant to kill her only to frighten her and dissuade her from her behavior bring her back to their bargain when he saw that she was insensible he had panicked and thrown water over her to try vainly to bring her back to consciousness not realizing at first that he had killed her the broken bones the dislocations the cruelty and perversion of a previous customer no one believed it the verdict was never truly in doubt pitt knew that looking at the jurors faces costigan must have known it too the judge listened picked up his black cap and pronounced the sentence of death pitt left the courtroom without any sense of achievement simply a relief that it was finished he would never know all that had happened never know who had placed finlay fitzjamess belongings in the room in pentecost alley or why so many lies were told about them he would never know what thoughts were so harrowing in the mind of jago jones after the statutory three weeks albert costigan was hanged the newspapers reported it but made no further comment the sunday after that pitt was in the park with charlotte and the children jemima was dressed in her very best frock daniel in a smart new navyandwhite suit it was midoctober and the leaves were beginning to turn the chestnuts the first to break into bud in spring were already limpid gold the softer sunlight of early autumn flickered through them the beeches showed fans of bronze amid the green it would not be long till the first frosts the raking up of leaves and the smell of wood smoke as bonfires consumed the waste in the country rose hips would be scarlet in the hedges and hawthorn berries crimson the grass would not need cutting anymore pitt and charlotte walked slowly side by side indistinguishable from a hundred other couples enjoying one of the last really warm days of the year the children ran around laughing and chasing each other largely pointlessly simply because they had energy and it was fun daniel found a stick and threw it for a puppy that was dancing around them apparently lost by its owner at least for the time being the dog ran for it and brought it back triumphantly jemima seized the stick and took a turn hurling it as far as she could over in the distance near the road a barrel organ was playing a popular tune a running patterer abandoned the news and sat on the grass eating a sandwich he had just bought from a peddler a hundred yards farther along an old man sucked on a pipe his eyes closed two housemaids on their day off told each other tall stories and giggled a lawyers clerk lay under a tree and read a penny dreadful magazine charlotte took pitts arm and walked a little closer he shortened his step so she could keep pace with him it was several minutes before pitt recognized in the distance striding across the grass the upright military figure of john cornwallis making his way purposefully between the strollers when he was within twenty yards the expression on his face made charlotte stop and turn anxiously to pitt pitt felt a chill run through him but knew of no reason why he should be afraid cornwallis reached them im sorry mrs pitt he apologized to charlotte then looked at pitt his face pale and tight im afraid i must interrupt your sunday afternoon he obviously intended it to be the cue for charlotte to excuse herself and leave them alone withdraw to a discreet distance out of earshot she did not do so but instead held more tightly to pitts arm her fingers curling around and gripping is it a matter of confidence of state pitt enquired dear god i wish it were cornwallis said with passion i am afraid by tomorrow everyone else in london will know know what charlotte whispered cornwallis hesitated looking at pitt with concern he wanted to protect charlotte he was unused to women pitt guessed he was acquainted with them only at a distance he did not know other than convention taught him to expect know what pitt repeated another prostitute has been murdered cornwallis said huskily exactly like the first in every particular pitt was stunned it was as if suddenly he had lost his balance and the grass and trees and sky dissolved and shifted around him in a tenement on myrdle street cornwallis finished in whitechapel i think you had better go there immediately ewart is on the scene i shall find mrs pitt a hansom to take her home his face was ashen im so sorry pitt stood in the doorway of the room where the body had been found ewart grayfaced was already there from down the corridor came the sound of hysterical weeping shock and terror still in the rising desperate tones long drawn out as a woman lost control pitt met ewarts eyes and saw in them reflection of the horror he felt himself and the sudden knowledge of guilt he looked away on the bed lay a young woman small almost like a child her hair spilled out around her one arm flung over her head her wrist tied with a stocking to the left corner bedpost there was a garter with a blue ribbon around her arm her yellowandorange dress was drawn up exposing her thighs her legs were naked like ada mckinley there was a stocking knotted tightly around her throat her face was purple mottled and swollen and like ada the top half of her body and the bed around it was soaked with water with knowledge sick in his stomach pitt looked down at the floor her boots black and polished were buttoned to each other he lifted his eyes and met ewarts the weeping along the corridor was calmer the fear subsiding into the long broken sobs of grief ewart looked like a man who awoke from a nightmare only to find the same events playing themselves out in reality from which there is no more awakening there was a muscle twitching in his temple and he clenched his hands to keep them from shaking are her fingers and toes broken pitt found his voice creaking his throat was tight his mouth dry ewart swallowed he nodded imperceptibly not trusting himself to speak any other evidence pitt asked ewart took a deep breath his eyes on pitts wide filled with knowledge of what they both dreaded i i havent looked his voice shook i sent for you straightaway as soon as lennox told me it was the same i i just left it i he took another breath i went outside i felt sick if theres anything here i want you to be the one to find it not me at least not me alone i again his eyes searched pitts there was a sheen of sweat on his upper lip and on his brow i did look around a bit i didnt see anything but i havent searched not properly not combed it down the backs of chairs under the bed the unasked questions hung in the air between them the consuming fear and guilt that they had made an appalling irretrievable mistake and costigan had not killed ada and whoever had had struck again here in this room was it finlay fitzjames or jago jones or someone else they had not even thought of out there in the darkness of the october streets waiting to strike again and again like the madman who had called himself jack the ripper two years ago pitt turned and looked at the girl on the bed she had thick dark hair naturally curly she was smallboned almost delicate her skin was very white unblemished over her shoulders where the top of her dress was low cut creamy white on the flesh of her thighs she must have been young seventeen or eighteen who was she pitt asked surprised at the catch in his voice nora gough ewart replied from just behind him dont know much about her yet cant get any sense out of the other women here all hysterical lennox is trying to calm them down now poor devil but i suppose thats what doctors are for he was just along the street half a mile away been there all evening with a patient he sniffed at least hes not too late to help them for what its worth they could both still hear the sobbing from the room along the passage but it was muted now the high note of hysteria gone from it better to let lennox go on doing what he could than to go now and try to gain evidence from women too terrified to make any sense then wed better look through this room pitt said wearily it was a job he hated and it was unlikely to provide anything he wanted to know in fact he dreaded what he might find the one man who could not possibly be guilty was costigan ill start with the bed he said to ewart you start over there with the cupboard and the box chest anything unusual anything at all any letters papers anything that might not have belonged to her borrowed or stolen anything expensive ewart did not move pitt wondered for a moment if he was so drowned by his horror he was incapable of functioning his skin was bleached of color as if he were already dead a sort of waxen look ewart he said more gently start with the box chest at least that way he could keep his back to the body no ill ill do the bed ewart replied not quite meeting his eyes its my job im all right his voice was thick fighting so many emotions he seemed torn apart by them sharp and high among them a whitehot anger begin with the box chest pitt repeated ill do the bed and the chairs ewart still remained motionless he seemed to want to speak and yet he was unable to find the words or perhaps to make the decision to say whatever it was he looked like a man facing despair they stood a few feet away from each other in the quiet room the girls body almost within arms length the air was stale closed in dusty light coming in through the window showed the bare places on the rug out in the street an oldclothes seller was shouting do you know something about the death of ada mckinley that you havent told me pitt asked hating doing it ewarts eyes widened a little no pitt believed him whatever he had been fearing it was not that question his surprise was too genuine are you afraid costigan was the wrong man arent you ewart asked yes of course i am who was it finlay fitzjames ewart winced no he said quickly too quickly for thought pitt turned away and began to search the bed lennox had already examined the body it did not matter if he disturbed her now it was irrational to be gentle but it came automatically as if somehow the shell that was left was still a human being capable of knowing pity or dignity he found a handkerchief under the pillow on the farther side white like the sheet and to begin with he thought it was merely the corner of a slip a little crookedly on then he pulled and it came away it was of fine lawn the handstitched hem rolled to a tiny edge embroidered with letters in one corner the writing was gothic hard to decipher at first glance pitt made it out ffj he had almost known it would be but it still gave him a lurching sensation high in his stomach and a tightening in his throat he looked across at ewart but he had his back turned going through the contents of the chest linen and clothes piled on the floor beside him he was apparently unaware that pitt had stopped ive found a handkerchief pitt said in the silence ewart turned slowly his face expectant he met pitts eyes and saw in them what he dreaded initials pitt said answering the question that had not been asked ffj thats thats ridiculous ewart said stumbling over his tongue why on earth would he leave a handkerchief behind who leaves a handkerchief in a prostitutes bed he didnt live here i suppose someone who had occasion to blow his nose while he was with her pitt replied a man with a cold or whom something caused to sneeze dust perhaps or her perfume and he put it under the pillow ewart said still fighting against it well he wouldnt have a pocket conveniently pitt rejoined anyway it is not ours to reason why at the moment keep on looking there may be something else what are you saying he left something else here too ewarts voice rose almost in panic hed have nothing left if he went on leaving things around whitechapel at this rate not something belonging to finlay fitzjames pitt said as calmly as he could anything else at all perhaps something to indicate another man weve got to search the whole room oh yes of course we have er ewart turned back to the box chest without saying anything more and resumed taking the things out and opening them up shaking them running his fingers through them then folding them and placing them on the pile beside him pitt finished searching the bed and moved on to the floor around it he lit the candle on the table then placed it in the shadows on the floor and knelt down to peer beneath there was very little dust a few threads of cotton mostly white and a boot button which he only found by running his fingers carefully over the surface of the floor searching the cracks of the boards there were also two hairpins and a straight pin such as dressmakers use towards the foot of the bed he found a piece of bootlace a button such as might come off any mans white cotton shirt and another button leather handmade unlikely to belong to anyone in whitechapel unless he had been given a mans casual coat from some charity collection he straightened up with them in his hand ewart had finished the box chest and was looking through the small dresser his hands searching quickly expertly pitt began on the chairs lifting up the cushions exploring down the back and sides and finally turning them upside down and examining the bottoms he found nothing more to which he could connect any meaning anything ewart asked him pitt held out the buttons shirt ewart said to the first could belong to anyone at all and it could have been there for months he took the second rolled it between his fingers and thumb then looked up and met pitts eyes quality he said dubiously but again could be anybodys could be a tramp in a charity coat there was a challenge in his voice daring pitt to say it was fitzjamess are you going to see the women here they seem to be in control of themselves now indeed it was considerably quieter the light had almost gone and there was no sound from the bottle factory over the road a horse and trap went by someone shouted yes pitt replied well see what they know he led the way along the passage to the kitchen at the back of the house it was surprisingly large with a black stove in the center of the far wall and a grimy window facing straight onto the backs of houses in the next street there was a table with odd legs in the center patched together from two previous pieces of furniture and half a dozen assorted chairs four of them were now occupied by women ranging in age from approximately twenty to over fifty although with age drink and paint it was impossible to be sure they all looked tragic and absurd with powder and rouge streaked by tears hair falling out of pins eyes swollen with weeping and at the same time they looked younger and more human and individual with the shell of business cracked away lennox was standing half behind one of the women one hand on her shoulder a cup of tea in the other holding it out for her he looked pale and tired his nose accentuated by the deep lines scored down the sides of his mouth he stared at pitt warningly his voice was hoarse when he spoke good evening superintendent if you want to question these women they are ready to answer you just dont tell them details you dont have to and be a little patient it isnt easy to remember or to find words when you are terrified pitt nodded and turned to ewart you could try the neighborhood see if anyone else has noticed anything unusual if they can remember a face someone coming or going at about he looked at lennox enquiringly between four and five lennox answered then smiled in bitter mockery of himself not medical brilliance superintendent observation of witnesses pearl heard nora calling out in the corridor at about four oclock shed just got up and was asking edie if she could borrow a petticoat pitt looked at the women lennox indicated pearl was palefaced with flaxen hair of extraordinary beauty sheer as spun glass and reflecting the light of the candles like wheatsilk a patch of luminosity in the room edie was heavy and dark with olive skin and handsome liquid brown eyes and you lent her a petticoat pitt asked edie nodded she ad ter pin it as she int alf my size but she took it anyow she sniffed and controlled herself with an effort and the other time pitt asked lennox lennox turned to another woman dark narroweyed with a pretty mouth she looked ashen the rouge standing out on her cheeks her hair lopsided where she had run her fingers through it pins sliding out mabel can answer that me first customerd just gorn mabel replied her voice hardly more than a whisper i were goin past noras door an i looked in dunno ow i knew she were by erself quiet i spose she frowned as though the puzzle mattered i saw er lyin on the bed wif er and up ter the post i reckoned as er customerd bin keen on that kind o thing an left er like that i even said summink to er she sniffed and swallowed with a painful constriction of her throat her body was shaking so uncontrollably her fingers skittered on the table lennox moved across behind her and put his hands on her shoulders holding her against him as if to give her of his own strength it was a gesture of extraordinary gentleness she might have been a friend of long standing not a street woman he had only just met it steadied her like a ray of sanity in the chaos then i saw er face she said quietly an i know as it ad appened to er too the same one as got ada mckinleyd got er too i spose i must a yelled next thing everyone were there an all yellin an callin out i see thank you pitt turned to ewart youd better find out what men were seen coming or going from this building between four and five get descriptions of all of them and compare them with each woman and her customers get times as near as you can any man at all i dont care if theyre residents pimps or the lamplighter everyone yes sir ewart departed and pitt concentrated on the four women present the last one kate was still sobbing pushing a wet handkerchief into her mouth and gasping for breath lennox went back to the stove and made another cup of tea passing it to her closing her stiff fingers around it awkwardly as pitt began questioning pearl sitting on a rickety chair at right angles over the table from her tell me all you can remember from just before you saw nora at almost four oclock he prompted she stared at him then began hesitantly i eard nora come inter er room an call ter edie abaht a petticoat but i din ear wot edie said i were busy doin me air ready fer the evenin i finished and went aht i got a customer real quick one o me reglars who was that wot who was he what does he look like she hesitated only a moment glancing at edie then at mabel jimmy kale she answered e come ere most sundays not always ter

me like e do er id stick a shiv in is guts when did she go pitt ignored the reference to knives when mabel started ter yell rest o the noise dont matter but she knew that were different we all did she swallowed and her throat tightened she started to cough and lennox moved to her side taking her hand and patting her firmly on the back the human contact seemed to comfort her the warmth of touch which demanded nothing of her she took a shuddery breath for a moment she hovered on the edge of abandoning herself to the comfort of weeping and clinging to someone lennox removed his hand and passed over the cup of tea she straightened up again we knew as summink were terrible wrong she said levelly nora ad syd allerdyce wif er e come ter the door wif is pants rahnd is ankles proper fool e looked too fat as a pig and red in the face int alf so ladida caught like that e werent the dislike was heavy in her face she did not forget a condescension or forgive it angie from upstairs were at the end

keep the mice down or dont you ave them neither yes we have them i have two cats actually he thought with a sudden surge of pleasure of angus and archie curled up asleep in their basket by the kitchen range but they didnt have to battle anyone for their food and milk what else eard shirl upstairs screamin at someone out the front pearl replied yellin like a stuck pig she were worsen the cats reckon someone bilked er an someone dropped a tray down the stairs ell of a row then there was mabel an er customer laughin like fools they was reckon as e were drunk out o is wits ope yer got paid well mabel course mabel said with conviction it flicked through pitts mind that she had probably taken all the man had but that was his affair if he chose to take chances he imagined the cacophony of sound that must have gone on during the hour nora gough was murdered she could probably have screamed herself hoarse and been lucky to have been heard above the general clamor and yet mabels screams of horror had been distinguished quickly enough he looked at lennox lennox pursed his lips and shook his head very slightly no way to tell he said quietly she may have known him and by the time she realized what was happening it was too late pitt said nothing he turned to the other girls the names of your customers he asked kate bert moss come just before five early but sundays is different as ter get orne fer is tea then joe edges e were still ere like wen mabel started to yell with you at that moment yeah look e dint do it i brung im in e werent never by isself ere pitt nodded and turned

left abaht ten minutes afore five i were jus takin im aht an goin back ter the street wen i saw noras customer goin her face blanched gawd almighty dyer think that were she slumped forward suddenly and pitt thought she was going to be sick she started to gasp for breath and her chest heaved stop it lennox said smartly there he grabbed the tea from pearl and thrust it into mabels hands drink it slowly dont gulp it she tried to take it but she was shaking so badly her fingers stiff that she could not hold it lennox steadied it his hands over hers keeping it from spilling drink it he told her firmly concentrate or youll get it all over you hold it still she obeyed sipping slowly focusing her attention on it gradually her breathing began to subside and become normal again after several minutes she sat up and put the now empty mug on the table in front of her what did he look like pitt asked her more gently look like she stared across the table at him e were i dunno ornry e ad fair air all sort o wavy what kind of clothes pitt could feel himself cold inside what was he wearing mabel dint really look much she stared at him in horror and he knew the other pictures that were in her mind herself on the bed in noras place expensive lennox said his voice cutting the silence pitt glanced at him but it was the same question he would have asked it was in all their minds it had to be yeah men around ere int got nuffink like that would you know him if you saw him again pitt asked thinking back to rose burke and her face as she had stared at finlay fitzjames coming out of the front door in devonshire street i dunno mabel was terrified it was there in her white clammy skin and shivering body i sees undreds o men int their faces wot i look at its money wot matters at the end in it its only money as gets yer food an yer rent thank you pitt acknowledged rising to his feet and pacing three steps across the kitchen floor and back again do you know anything else about your regular customers where do they live what do they do how can i find them wo for kate looked at him narrowly in case they seen oo done nora yer stupid cow edie said wot yer think she swung around to pitt its yer job to get this bastard wots doin girls round ere please mister first e done poor ada over on pentecost alley now e done nora oos next an next arter that pearl began to cry again softly like a

stuck six feet under int e she jabbed her fingers towards the wall and the darkness outside its some bastard wots still aht there in it some bastard wot could come in ere an be yer next customer eh poor noras werent it oos gonner elp us if the rozzers dont eh i dunno oo e is dyou did anybody see anyone else here this afternoon pitt asked one more time anyone at all pitt took down everything else they had to say but it added nothing more at midnight he left ewart and a whitefaced constable binns to continue searching for the customers the women had named and question them as to who they had seen and what they had heard that was work for the local station lennox had taken the body of nora gough in the mortuary wagon and tomorrow he would perform an autopsy on her not that pitt expected it to tell him anything different from the brief sad story he already knew he arrived home at five minutes to one to find charlotte standing in the hall the parlor door open behind her her face pale eyes wide he closed the door he had forgotten until this moment that he was still dressed in his sunday best and had no coat with him he had expected to be home long before this neither had he eaten was it the same she asked huskily he nodded exactly the same he walked past her into the parlor and sat down in his easy chair but forward leaning on his knees not relaxing she came in and closed the door with a click then sat opposite him you never told me what the first was like she said quietly perhaps you should he knew she did not mean that she could see any answer he did not simply that the process of explaining would clarify his own mind as it had so often before there was no better way to learn what one meant than by trying to explain it to someone else who was not afraid to say they did not understand carefully hating every detail he told her about finding the body of ada mckinley what it was like what had been done to her he watched her face and saw the pain in it but she did not look away and this time she asked what was her name nora gough and it was exactly the same yes broken fingers and toes water garter with the ribbon round her arm the boots buttoned together that couldnt be chance she said who knew about all those things apart from whoever did it ewart lennox hes the police surgeon cornwallis and the constable who was first called and tellman he answered no one else newspapers no the women in the same house could have talked she pointed out people do especially about something that frightens them to share it diminishes it sometimes even they didnt have all the details he said remembering what rose burke had actually seen they didnt know about the fingers and toes in fact binns and tellman didnt either she was sitting forward also her knees close to his her hands only inches away then it was the same person wasnt it she said softly there was no criticism in her voice nor did he see fear in her eyes only sorrow yes he answered biting his lip it must have been neither of them added that it could not then have been costigan but it hung in the air between them with all its dark pain and guilt charlotte put her hands over his and held them was it finlay fitzjames she asked searching his eyes i dont know he said frankly i found a handkerchief under nora goughs pillow with his initials on it they arent common but it doesnt prove he was there tonight he took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh but her one customer tonight was seen he was fairhaired and welldressed in other words a gentleman does finlay fitzjames have fair hair yes very handsome hair thick and waving and they mentioned that particularly tonight thomas her voice had changed he was aware she was about to tell him something he would not like something which she found extremely difficult what emily was absolutely sure finlay fitzjames was innocent she knows his sister he waited she saw him the night ada was killed you know she looked up her brow furrowed her eyes dark and wide emily saw finlay he was incredulous why on earth didnt she say so no no tallulah saw him she corrected him she couldnt say so because she had already lied to her father about where she was saying she was somewhere else she was speaking more and more rapidly it was a pretty debauched affair people were drinking too much and smoking opium or taking cocaine and things like that it was in chelsea on beaufort street she wasnt supposed to be there her father would have taken an apoplexy if hed known that i can believe pitt said fervently but tallulah saw finlay there are you sure well emily is sure but tallulah didnt think anyone would believe her anyway when she is his sister and had already told everyone she was at lady swaffhams party but someone else must have seen him pitt said with a strange almost frightening sense of exhilaration perhaps at least he had not been wrong about finlay who else was there thats it tallulah didnt know anyone except the person she went with and she hardly knew him he was drunk half out of his senses and doesnt even remember going well people must have seen tallulah he insisted gripping her hands without realizing it she doesnt know who to ask parties like that are well they are held in private houses apparently people drift from one room to another there are screens for privacy potted palms people half drunk you could come and go and no one would know who you were or care even the host himself didnt know who was there how on earth do you know that he demanded trying to envision such an affair did emily tell you and i suppose tallulah fitzjames told her her face fell you dont believe it do you he shook his head no i dont think so i believe tallulah could have been to such an affair and so could finlay but i dont believe she saw him at one the night ada mckinley was killed as proof of his innocence its worth nothing thats what tallulah thought but it proved it to emily suspicion in his mind was sharpening why are you telling me this now charlotte are you saying finlay has to be innocent you said it proved it to emilynot to you i dont know she said candidly looking down and then up at him again she was very pale very unhappy thomas it was emily who had the second hellfire club badge made and tallulah put it in finlays belongings so you would find it she did what his voice rose to a shout what did you say she was very pale but her eyes did not waver she spoke very quietly indeed almost a whisper emily had a second badge made so tallulah could put it in finlays wardrobe god almighty he exploded and you helped her and then had me go and look for it how could you be so deceitful that was what hurt not the laying of false evidence the muddying of a case but the way she had deliberately deceived him she had never done such a thing before it was a betrayal from the one place he had never expected it her eyes widened in horror almost as if he had slapped her i didnt know shed done that she protested he was too tired to be angry and too aware of his own guilt over costigan and his need for charlotte and the loyalty the comfort she could give him even the sheer warmth of her physical presence she was waiting watching his face she was not afraid but there was hurt and anxiety in her eyes she understood the pain in him her fingers crept over his soft and strong he leaned forward and kissed her and then again and again and she answered him with the confidence and the generosity she had always had he sighed even if id known it wouldnt have altered the evidence against costigan he said at last actually augustus fitzjames said hed had the damn thing made i wish i knew why he said that to stop you investigating any further she answered sitting back again but why he was puzzled to him it made no sense scandal she shook her head its scandalous having the police in the house whatever they are doing there i suppose you have to go back and see him tomorrow yes he did not want to think of it she rose to her feet then wed better go to bed while theres still some of tonight left come he rose also and turned off the gas then put his arm around her and together they went up the stairs at least for a few hours he did not have to think of it in the morning pitt got up early and went to the kitchen while charlotte woke the children and began the chores of her own day gracie cooked him breakfast glancing at him every now and then her eyes narrowed her little face pinched with anxiety she had already seen the morning newspapers and heard there had been a second murder in whitechapel charlotte had quite recently taught her to read so she also knew most of what was being written and she was ready to defend pitt against anyone and everyone the afternoon editions would probably be worse when there was more news to relate more details more accuracy from which to draw blame she clattered around banging the crockery and leaving the kettle to whistle because she was furious with the people who blamed pitt and frightened in case they made things even harder for him and frustrated because she did not know what she could do to help she did not even know whether she should mention it or not gracie youll break it pitt said gently sorry sir she dropped the kettle with a crash it just makes me so mad sir it int fair whatve they done about it nuffink they wouldnt know ow ter begin they wouldnt stupid little article e is ooever wrote them things it int responsible she was using longer words these days reading had changed quite a lot of her vocabulary pitt smiled in spite of the way he felt gracies loyalty was peculiarly warming he hoped he could live up to the high image she had of him but the more he thought of it the more afraid he was that he had made an irreparable mistake with costigan that it was something he had overlooked that he should have seen and understood which had sent him to an unjust execution he ate his breakfast without even being aware of what it was and rose to leave just as charlotte and the children came in gracie had hidden the newspapers even so jemima at least was aware that something was wrong she looked from charlotte to pitt then sat down i dont want any breakfast she said immediately daniel hitched himself onto his chair reached for the glass of milk provided for him and drank half of it wiped the white ring off his mouth with his hand then announced that he did not want any either yes you do charlotte said quickly theres a man out in the street jemima said looking at pitt he knocked on the door and mama told him to go away she was very rude you told me i should never speak to anyone like that she didnt say please or thank you pitt looked up at charlotte a man from one of the newspapers she forced a smile he was impertinent i told him to go away and not to knock on the door again or id bring the dog and she told a fib jemima added we havent got a dog daniel looked frightened you wouldnt give him archie would you or angus he said anxiously no of course i wouldnt charlotte assured him then as his face did not clear she went on i wasnt going to give him a dog darling i was going to tell it to bite him daniel smiled and reached for his milk oh thats all right archie could scratch him he said hopefully charlotte took his glass from him dont drink all that now or you wont eat your porridge he forgot about not wanting breakfast and when gracie passed him his porridge bowl he was happy enough to take it jemima was more concerned she sensed the unhappiness in the air she fiddled with her food and no one chastised her suddenly there was a ring on the doorbell and the instant after a loud knocking gracie slammed down the kettle and marched towards the hall charlotte looked at pitt ready to go after her pitt rose to his feet ive got to face them sometime he said wishing he could put it off until he had something to say that would explain it some answer or reason there were no excuses charlotte started to speak then stopped what is it jemima asked looking at her mother then at her father whats happened whats wrong charlotte put her hand on jemimas shoulder nothing you need to worry about she said quickly finish your breakfast the front door opened and they heard a mans voice then gracies answer highpitched and furious a moment later the door banged shut and then gracies feet marched back down the corridor for a small creature she could make a lot of noise when she was angry cheek of them she said coming into the kitchen her face white eyes blazing who do they think they are write a few words and think they have all the brains in london nothing but a tuppenny upstart she turned the tap full on and the jet hit the spoon in the sink and rebounded back soaking the top half of her dress she drew in her breath to swear then remembered pitt was in the room and choked it back charlotte stifled a laugh that was too close to hysteria i assume that was a reporter from the newspaper gracie yes gracie conceded dabbing at herself with a tea towel and not making the situation appreciably better worthless little item youd better go and put on a dry dress charlotte suggested dont matter gracie responded putting the tea towel down its warm enough in ere wont come to no arm and she began rummaging furiously in the flour bin and then the dried fruit bin looking for ingredients for a cake which would not be baked until midmorning but the physical activity was a release for the pentup tension in her she would probably pound the dough for bread to within an inch of flattening it altogether pitt smiled a trifle weakly kissed charlotte goodbye touched jemima on the top of the head and daniel on the shoulder as he passed and went out to begin the days investigation jemima turned wide eyes to charlotte what is it mama whos gracie angry with people who write things in the newspapers when they dont know the whole story charlotte replied people who try to make everyone upset and frightened because it sells more papers regardless of the fact that it may make a lot of other things worse what things what things daniel echoed is papa frightened and upset is he people no charlotte lied wondering frantically how to protect them which was worse trying to pretend everything was all right when it obviously was not and only making them feel more frightened because they were lied to or telling them something of the truth so at least it made sense and they were part of the family they would be worried and frightened but not by the formless horrors of imagination and the feeling that they were alone and not trusted without having made a conscious decision she found herself answering there has been another lady died in whitechapel just the same as the one a little while ago it looks as if perhaps the wrong man was punished people are very upset about it and sometimes when you are angry or frightened you want to blame someone it makes it feel less difficult jemima was puzzled why does it i dont know but you remember when you walked into the chair and stubbed your toe yes it went all blue and yellow and green do you remember how you felt it hurt you said it was my fault daniels eyes narrowed and he looked at his sister accusingly it wasnt my fault i never put the chair there you werent looking where you were going i was jemima said indignantly you see charlotte interrupted its easier to be angry than to admit you were clumsy daniel beamed with triumph for once his mother had actually taken sides and he had won the argument jemima looked cross a flash of temper lit her eyes and she glared at him the point is charlotte went on realizing her example had not been a fortunate one that when people are upset they get angry they are upset now because another lady has died and they are frightened that they may have punished the wrong man so they feel guilty as well they are looking for someone to be angry with and papa seems like a very good person because he was the one who thought the man they punished was the one who did it now it looks as if he wasnt he made a mistake jemima asked the furrow deep between her fine soft brows we dont know yet its too difficult to understand but it is possible we all make mistakes sometimes papa too jemima asked gravely of course will they get very angry with him she hesitated was it better to be forewarned would a comforting lie rebound on her later and make the hurt even worse or was she adding an unnecessary fear expecting far too much of them she wanted above everything to protect them but what was protection was it lies or truth mama there was the beginning of fear in jemimas voice daniel was watching her carefully they may do she said meeting the solemn eyes but they will be wrong because he has done the best anyone can do and if there has been a mistake then it was everybodys not just his oh jemima replied i see she turned back to her breakfast and continued eating very thoughtfully daniel looked at her then back at charlotte took a deep breath and resumed his meal also ill walk to school with you today charlotte said decisively its a lovely day and id like to if there were other newspapermen waiting outside or remarks of any sort in the street she would not have gracie involved in a fullscale battle with daniel and jemima in the middle she would have to keep a very firm bridle on her own temper and as it happened the real unpleasantness did not occur until the afternoon editions were out and then it was extremely ugly someone had given the press a very lurid account of nora goughs murder with a detailed description of the signs and symptoms of asphyxiation by strangling this time the broken bones the boots and the water were not omitted nothing was spared and all was naturally likened to the murder of ada mckinley as well there were large pictures of costigan looking frightened and sulky only now instead of interpreting his scowl as viciousness they called it terror of the judgment of the law as used to crush the common man before the wheels of perjured justice pitts name was sprinkled liberally in every article and he carried the blame for costigans hanging far more prominently than he had ever won the praise for his original arrest charlotte walked out of the front door and along the road bitterly aware of curtains twitching and whispered words behind them the tea parties she would not be invited to the people who would not see her in spite of her being directly in front of them the sudden urgent engagements declared when she approached did not worry her all her fury was for pitt and the children she would have defended them to the last blow if only there were someone to strike at as it was she strode along the road with her head high ignoring anything to the right or left of her and swung around the corner almost knocking over old major kidderman who was taking his dog for a stroll im sorry she said hastily i beg your pardon she was about to continue when he spoke tribulations of command my dear he said quietly touching his hat hard but there we are and he smiled at her shyly thank you major thats very she did not know what she meant wise kind both sounded wrong thank you she said lamely but she smiled back at him with a sudden and very real warmth she collected daniel and jemima from the school and made the return journey a pinchfaced young woman crossed the road away from them her expression one of acute distaste a woman with three children hurried past avoiding charlottes eyes the little girl in a frilly dress stopped to speak to jemima and was told sharply to come along and not waste time on the corner a newsboy was shouting the latest headlines police ang the wrong man new murder in whitechapel costigan innocent read all abaht it another orrible murder in whitechapel charlotte hurried past him averting her eyes not that he would have offered her a newspaper or expected her to buy one she was walking so rapidly both children had to run to keep up with her and she raced up the steps and pushed the door open with such force it swung back and banged against the stopper on the floor gracie stood at the kitchen door a rolling pin in her hand she was so angry she could hardly speak her face filled with relief when she saw charlotte charlotte burst out laughing and the instant after it turned to tears it was several frightening moments for the children before she could control herself and wipe the tears away she sniffed and searched for a handkerchief go and wash your hands ready for tea she ordered then you can read a story ill find the wind in the willows for you pitts day was far less pleasant he went first to the whitechapel police station to see if any more news had come in before he went to see finlay fitzjames there was nothing everyone he saw looked palefaced and unhappy they had all been equally sure costigan was guilty few of them actually liked the rope but they accepted it it had always been the price of crime now they felt a peculiar kind of guilt by association it was their force which was being blamed not only in newspapers but by ordinary people in the street a constable had been spat on another shouted at and followed by a crowd of angry youths someone had thrown a beer bottle and it had shattered on the wall beyond constable binnss head this morning in the sharp chilly daylight they were very sober and very confused ewart came in badly shaven a cut on his cheek and dark circles under his eyes the skin paperthin and looking bruised anything new pitt asked him no ewart did not even turn his head to meet pitts eyes any report from lennox not yet hes working on it now what about the other witnesses found two of them very unhappy ewart smiled bitterly not easy to explain to your wifeor your sister in kales casethat the police want to talk to you because you might have been witness to a murder in a brothel dont imagine sydney allerdyce will have a decent supper on the table for years there was no regret in his voice in fact there was a kind of satisfaction did they see anyone pitt pressed the only point which mattered ewart hesitated who did they see pitt demanded wondering what ewart was hiding and fearing he knew fitzjames ewart let his breath out in a sigh a young man with thick fair hair well dressed average height he replied he looked quickly at pitt trying to read his face doesnt have to be him he added then a look of anger flickered for a moment anger with himself for having voiced the thought well it wasnt albert costigan pitt said before anyone else could did they see any other people coming or going no anyway not that they could remember just the women who live there what about other nearby residents people out in the street coming or going any peddlers other prostitutes did anyone see anything pitt pressed nothing that helps ewart said irritably questioned a drayman who was loading a few yards along most of the time he only saw people in the street no one go in or out spoke to a couple of prostitutes janie martins and ella baker who were out looking for custom they saw no one except the men they picked up and they werent close to the housein fact ellas wasnt in myrdle street at all well someone both came and went nora gough didnt do that to herself go back and try again im going to see the fitzjameses i imagine theyll be expecting me ewart laughed sharply and there was anger and fear in it he turned his back as if conscious of having left his emotions naked and continued writing the report he had been working on when pitt came in the door in devonshire street was opened by the same highly agreeable butler as before but this time he looked very grave although it did not mar the pleasantness of his features good morning mr pitt sir he said opening the door wide to allow pitt in the weather is delightful is it not i think october is my favorite month i imagine it is mr fitzjames you wish to see he is in the library sir if you will come this way and without waiting for a reply he led the way across the parquet floor and past a magnificent painting of a dutch harbor scene of the city of delft and then into a smaller hallway off which was the library he knocked at the door and entered immediately mr pitt sir he announced then stood aside for pitt to enter augustus was standing in front of the fireplace although there was no fire lit pitt had never seen him on his feet before he had always conducted their conversations without rising he looked roundshouldered and was beginning to run a little to paunch his suit was extremely well cut his collar high and stiff and his long face with its dominant nose wore a belligerent expression come in he ordered i assumed youd be round here so i waited for you now you are going to tell me you hanged the wrong man or are you going to protest that last nights crime was committed by someone else a second lunatic in our midst i am not going to claim anything mr fitzjames pitt held his temper with great difficulty seldom had he wanted to lash back at anyone so much it was only the absolute knowledge that it would rebound on him which held him from it im surprised you gave so much to the newspapers augustus said tartly his eyes wide a curious mocking in them i would have thought that for your own protection you would have told them as little as possible youre more of a fool than i took you for pitt heard the fear threaded through his voice it was the first time it had been audible and he wondered if augustus knew it himself perhaps that was why he was so angry i have not spoken to the press at all pitt replied i dont know who has and if it was one of the women who live in the house in myrdle street there is nothing anyone can do about it we would be better employed in discovering the truth and proving it than in regretting the public knowledge of this second crime and its likeness to the first augustus stared at him startled as much by his abruptness as by the bitter truth of what he said it jarred him from the present confrontation back to facing his own jeopardy and the reality of it there was no time to waste in recrimination especially against the one person who could most hurt or help him the effort it cost him to cover his feelings was obvious in his stubborn features i assume it was like the first he said slowly his eyes searching pitts i did not hear all those details in the reports of the mckinley womans death they were not published pitt replied i see he straightened his shoulders who else would know of them apart from whoever killed herpitt allowed a shadow of irony to pass over his facemyself inspector ewart the constable who was first on the scene and the police surgeon who examined her other women in the house not so far as we know they would have no occasion to go into her room are you sure augustus demanded a lift in his voice as if it could have been hope they were there perhaps they saw her and told i dont know he twitched his shoulder irritably whatever men they associate with perhaps this was deliberately copied why costigan couldnt be blamed for it pitt pointed out out of all the people involved in the entire story he is the only one who is unquestionably innocent of nora goughs death sit down man augustus waved his hand in a sharp gesture like hitting something however he remained standing his back to the empty fireplace his hands behind him i dont know the reason maybe its no more than to discredit the police and make fools of them people dont murder women in order to make fools of the police pitt answered remaining on his feet theres a personal reason for killing her very personal indeed her fingers and toes were dislocated or broken mr fitzjames that is acutely painful it is a form of torture he ignored augustuss wince of distaste it was done while she was tied up with her own stocking then she was doused with water and her boots were buttoned together and her garter slid up onto her arm you dont do that to someone without a very violent passion burning inside you not some secondhand reason of wanting to make someone else look foolish augustuss face was very pale almost gray and his heavy nose and narrow mouth were pinched as though in a matter of hours he had aged a decade i agree superintendent it is obscene not the behavior of a civilized man you are looking for some animal who is less than human i wish i were able to help you more than i can but it is not my area of knowledge i assume this time you did not find anything belonging to my son there was certainty in his voice the question was rhetorical i am sorry mr fitzjames but we found this pitt pulled the monogrammed handkerchief out of his pocket and held it out so augustus could see the lettering for a moment he thought augustus was going to faint he swayed a little on his feet and let go his clasped hands to grasp the handkerchief in one hand then had to extend the other hand also to maintain his balance he did not touch it i i see the letters superintendent he said in a hard tight voice i acknowledge they are unusual that does not mean the article belongs to my son it most certainly does not mean that he was the person who placed it there i hope you perceive that as clearly as i do for once there was no threat in his tone instead a mixture of pleading and defiance a will to do all he could to avert the disaster which now hung so closely over his family pitt had it in his heart to be sorry for him despite his own personal dislike he wished he could be surer of what he felt about finlays guilt i know that mr fitzjames he acknowledged quietly the difficulty is to discover who could have put your sons possessions so deliberately first at the scene of ada mckinleys murder and now at the scene of nora goughs and why i am afraid it may be necessary to look far more closely at those people who consider themselves your enemies it is beyond reason to suppose your son was selected by chance augustus drew in his breath then let it out again in a sigh if you say so superintendent then his eyes narrowed may i ask you how it has happened that you were able to obtain a conviction against albert costigan when it now appears he cannot have been guilty i i do not mean to imply criticism i believe it is something we require to know i require to know this tragedy now threatens my family imminently i am afraid it does pitt took the button out of his pocket and proffered that also augustus picked it up and examined it very ordinary he pronounced looking up at pitt i dont think i have any like that myself but i know a dozen men who do it proves nothing except possibly that someone of good taste was there his face tightened sartorial good taste anyway there were also witnesses pitt said adding the final blow the dead womans last customer was a young man of average height with thick fair hair and he was well dressed augustus did not bother to argue or point out how many young men might answer that description i see naturally i have already asked my son where he was yesterday late afternoon i assume you will wish to hear it from him in person if you please augustus rang the bell and when the butler appeared sent him to fetch finlay they waited in silence finlay arrived within moments he came in and closed the door behind him he was casually dressed obviously he had changed since returning from the foreign office if indeed he had been there at all he looked frightened his face blotchy as if he had drunk too much the previous evening and still suffered the aftereffects he glanced first at his father then at pitt good afternoon mr fitzjames pitt said quietly im sorry to disturb you but i am afraid it is necessary i ask you to tell me where you were yesterday afternoon from approximately three oclock until six well i wasnt in myrdle street there was a catch in finlays voice as if he were undecided whether to be angry indignant selfpitying or to try to play it lightly as if he were basically unconcerned only fear came through where were you pitt repeated well at three oclock i was still in the foreign office finlay answered i left at about half past or a trifle after i went for a walk in the park his chin came up and he met pitts eyes so directly pitt was almost sure it was a lie i intended to meet someone on business but he didnt turn up i waited around for a while then i walked to a restaurant where i had an early supper before going to the theater i was nowhere near whitechapel can you substantiate any of that sir pitt asked almost certain before he spoke that he could not if he could augustus would have said so at the outset and he would have done so triumphantly he could have dismissed pitt not sought for help the fear in his voice was his answer no i dont think so the the matter was a favor for a friend a rather stupid matter he had got himself into finlay overexplained money and a woman all very sordid i was trying to help him settle the matter once and for all without ruining anyones reputation i didnt particularly want to be seen by anyone i knew didnt stop and speak to anyone i see all pitt saw was the futility of it is this your handkerchief mr fitzjames he offered him the handkerchief found under nora goughs pillow finlay did not touch it it might be i have at least half a dozen like that but so has almost everyone i know with ffj in the corner no of of course not but one can he swallowed one can have any initials sewn into a handkerchief one wishes it doesnt mean it was mine i suppose you found it somewhere near this new corpse i thought so i can see it in your face his voice was rising well i didnt kill her superintendent ive never heard of her and ive never been to myrdle street some madman is trying to ruin me and before you ask i havent the faintest idea who or why i he did not finish what he had been going to say perhaps you should look at albert costigans friends someone is trying to incriminate both of us superintendent make us look like murderers and you as an incompetent indirecuy a murderer too there was challenge in his eyes and a small bright victory i think it is as much in your interest as in mine to find out who it is and bring him to justice if i could help you i would but i have no idea where to begin im sorry well begin with a reconsideration of anyone who might believe they have cause to dislike you mr fitzjames pitt answered and proceed with those in whose professional or personal way you might stand and perhaps a reexamination of the original members of the hellfire club i cant do that finlay said intensely all the momentary elation vanished we were good friends they simply are not that kind of person not remotely friends of ones youth are well it is not one of them i assure you ill consider all the other possibilities and then make a list for you so shall i augustus added you will have our fullest cooperation superintendent the ghost of a smile touched his humorless mouth our interests are common at least in this instance pitt could only agree and somewhat urgent he added wryly thank you sir he turned to finlay mr fitzjames good day the following day the outcry in the newspapers was far worse it was not only the less reputable publications that were printing sensational headlines but even the times itself questioned the justice of costigans trial and through that not only the efficiency of the police but their probity as well farther into the paper there was another article reexamining the evidence put forward it suggested very plainly that some of it was morally suspect and had been a matter of desire rather than fact the whole case might have been conducted with more intention of finding a culprit quickly and without embarrassment to the force for its ineptitude including those who had rested their political reputations in backing it than a genuine concern for justice costigan had been the victim of these two less than admirable forces several less reputable newspapers actually suggested that the officers in charge had been either threatened or bribed in order to close the case quickly pitt was likened to the unfortunate inspector abilene who had been unable to solve the previous outbreak of murders in whitechapel and commissioner warren whose retirement the failure had forced upon him several letters were printed raising a plea that costigan should be pardoned posthumously and his family if they could be found paid a handsome reparation for his wrongful death pitt folded them up after reading them gracie snatched them from him and would have put them on the fire except that she knew that so much paper ash would block it from drawing air and she would only have to clean the whole thing out and relight it charlotte said nothing she knew pitt already understood everything there was to say about it which was little enough she knew he had acted honestly to say so now would only suggest that there could be a question about it her greatest concern was to protect daniel and jemima there was nothing she could do to save pitt any of the hurt ahead except share it with him and at the same time try not to show it too much she debated whether to allow the children to go to school or if perhaps it would be better to keep them at home at least for today then they would not overhear the remarks or have to endure the torments and the questions of other children or of people in the street she could not be there all day to argue back or to explain to them what people meant why they were angry and why they were wrong she could even take them to her mothers house for a while they would be safe there anonymous a week or two away from school would not do any harm they could catch up when this horrible business was over and the truth was known but what if it was never known what if it was like the ripper all over again and never solved it could happen pitt was clever he never gave up but he did not solve all his cases he had never failed with a murder yet but there had been robberies frauds arson where nothing was recovered and no one caught if she took them to carolines she would have taught them that when things are unpleasant and when you are afraid then run away and hide it may disappear and you wont have to face it but if you do have to it is twice as hard you have not only told other people you are a coward you have believed it yourself its time for school she heard her own voice saying it before she knew she had made up her mind she looked across and saw pitts eyes on her she could not read his face she did not know whether he approved her decision or not ill walk with you again come on pitt spent the day in whitechapel and it was one of the worst days of his life he questioned all the women in the tenement in myrdle street again trying to learn anything further about nora gough could she possibly have known ada had she quarreled with anyone had she known costigan had she lent or borrowed money was there anything at all which could provide a motive for her death her pimp was a huge avuncular man with curly black hair and a filthy temper but he could also account for his whereabouts all the relevant day with unimpeachable witnesses and he seemed genuinely distressed by noras death she was his best girl earned him the most money and gave him no trouble in the early afternoon as pitt was walking along commercial road east there was an ugly gathering of men and women outside one of the larger public houses someone started to shout lets ear it for bert costigan three cheers for costigan ooray for costigan another yelled and the chorus was taken up all around e were a martyr ter the rich wot comes dahn ere ter use our women a thin man said loudly an murder em someone else added to a loud cheering e were innocent a woman with pale hair chimed in they anged im fer nuffin they anged im fer bein poor a fat man said furiously his face twisted with rage its them as oughta be anged nah then nah then the landlord came to the door a cloth in his hand his apron askew don want no trouble ere go orff ome with yer don talk daft a young woman with a missing front tooth pushed her way forward aggressively oo a you callin daft eh bert costigan were anged fer summink e dint do thats nuffink wif you is it pay yer money an drink up an never mind if yer gets anged fer some rich bastard oo comes dahn ere from is fancy ouse up west an murders our women thas all right is it i dint say that the landlord protested but by now there was more shouting and pushing and a youth was knocked over instantly a scuffle began and within moments half a dozen men were throwing punches pitt moved in trying to force them apart and see that no injury was done especially to some of the women who were now screaming he took it to be fear only to discovertoo late when he was in the thick of itthat it was rage and encouragement someone was yelling costigans name like a sort of war chant pitt was being battered from all sides the landlord was in the middle of it somewhere a police whistle shrilled and someone screamed the fight grew worse pitt was knocked off his feet and would have fallen over except that the landlord cannoned into him from the left and both of them landed on top of a sprawling youth with red hair and a bloody nose more police arrived and the melee was broken up three men and two women were arrested eight people were hurt more or less seriously one had a broken collarbone two had to be sent to the surgeon for stitching pitt left feeling severely bruisedand with his collar torn one elbow ripped out of his jacket and thoroughly covered in dirt and several bloodstains naturally it all made the evening newspapers along with much comment and criticism and renewed calls for a pardon for costigan and questions about the whole structure and justification of the police force in general and pitt in particular comparisons were drawn between this case and the previous whitechapel murders two years ago flattering to no one more riots and the breakdown of public order were predicted pitt returned home at about seven oclock worn out bruised in mind and in body uncertain even which way to turn next he had no idea who had murdered either of the women or where costigan or finlay fitzjames fitted in or if they did at all he recognized vespasias carriage outside in the street and was not sure whether he was pleased or sorry he did not want her to see him at his worst he was ragged dirty and exhausted her good opinion of him mattered very much he would far rather she thought of him as able to rise above such crisis and failure as this on the other hand it would be good to hear her advicein fact just to see her and know her strength and resolve courage was just as contagious as despair perhaps more so what took him by surprise when he went into the parlor was to find cornwallis there as well looking grim and extremely shaken charlotte stood up immediately even before pitt had time to greet anyone you must be tired and hungry she said going directly to him theres fresh hot water upstairs and dinner will be ready in half an hour aunt vespasia and mr cornwallis are staying there will be time to talk to them it was almost a dismissal but he was glad enough to accept it he knew his clothes carried the stench of the middens the spilled beer the dust of the street where he had fought and the stale sweat of frightened jostling people even the fear and the anger seemed to cling to him he came down again thirty minutes later still exhausted and stiffening bruises darkening on his face but he was clean and ready to face the inevitable discussion it began as soon as the first course was served none of them wished to pretend there are two ways we must approach this cornwallis said earnestly leaning a little forward we must do all we can to discover and prove who killed this second woman and we must show that the arrest of costigan was based on solid evidence fairly obtained and his trial was conducted honorably his lips tightened i dont know how we can prove that we did not conceal evidence that would implicate anyone else his voice dropped and his eyes fixed on the flowers in the blue bowl in the center of the table i fear perhaps we did i have no love for augustus fitzjames vespasia interrupted firmly looking at pitt then at cornwallis but making public the evidence against his son is likely to provoke a hysterical reaction which will not only be unjust but will almost certainly make it a great deal harder to discover the truth and whatever my personal feelings towards him and indeed whatever his own morality i do not wish to see him punished for something he did not do even if no one will punish him for what he did she added ruefully cornwallis regarded her gravely weighing what she had said then he turned to pitt just how much is finlay fitzjames implicated in this second crime first tell me what you know then give me your opinion he began to eat his small portion of fish slowly from his expression of intense concentration on pitt it was impossible to tell if he was even aware of what was on his plate pitt told him exactly what he had found in nora goughs room and what finlay had said about his whereabouts the dishes were removed and steakandkidney pie and vegetables served gracie came and went in efficient silence but she knew who cornwallis was and she watched him with the utmost suspicion as if she feared that at any moment he might pose some threat to her beloved family cornwallis seemed unaware of her keen little face so often turned towards him his attention never left pitt and your opinion cornwallis prompted the moment pitt concluded pitt thought hard he was acutely aware that cornwallis would value what he said possibly base his actions and his own judgments upon it i really believed costigan was guilty he answered after a moment it wasnt proved beyond any doubt whatever but he admitted it i never did understand why he was so brutal with her he denied that to the end he remembered costigans face with a sick churning in his stomach he was a nasty little man pathetic and vicious but i didnt sense in him the streak of sadism which would have driven him to break or dislocate her fingers and toes she cheated him out of part of her earnings cornwallis said dubiously he considered she belonged to him so it was a kind of betrayal weak men can be very cruel his face tightened ive seen it in the navy give the wrong man a little power and hell abuse those below him oh costigan was abusive all right pitt agreed but the garter the boots it all seems more than just ordinarily vicious it doesnt seem like hot temper more like something calculated charlotte supplied for him yes then you had doubts that costigan was guilty cornwallis said with anxiety pinching his face but no sense of accusation he had spent his life in naval command and he gave without question the same loyalty to his crew that he expected from them in return on such trust he had faced and would face again whatever the forces of nature and the guns of battle could offer no pitt met his eyes candidly no i didnt then i just thought i hadnt read him very well he tried desperately to clear his mind and remember exactly what he had felt as he had talked to costigan seen his face felt his terror and selfpity how honest had he been how much was he influenced by relief and an inner determination to prove the case so they could all escape the shadow of having to pursue augustus fitzjamess son he never denied killing her he went on staring across the dining room table at cornwallis the food was almost ignored gracie was standing by the kitchen door a clean cloth in her hand for holding hot dishes but she was listening as intently as any of them but he always denied torturing her pitt continued painfully and no matter how hard i pressed he always denied knowing anything about fitzjames or the badge or the cuff link did you believe him vespasia asked quietly pitt thought for a long time before replying there was silence in the room no one moved i suppose i did pitt said at last as it wouldnt have gone on worrying me at least i didnt believe he could have done it alone or that he had any reason to then were back to where we started cornwallis said looking from one to the other of them it doesnt make sense if it was not costigan and there can be no doubt it is not him this time then who can it be is it someone we have not thought of or can it be what i think we are all dreading and fitzjames is guilty of both crimes no he isnt guilty charlotte said looking at the table in front of her why not vespasia asked curiously setting down her fork on her plate what do you know charlotte which makes you speak with such certainty charlotte was thoroughly uncomfortable and pitt knew why but he did not intervene tallulah fitzjames saw him the night ada mckinley was killed charlotte replied lifting her eyes to meet vespasias indeed vespasia said with caution and why did she not say so at the time it would have saved a great deal of trouble she couldnt say so because she was somewhere she should not have been charlotte replied unhappily and she had already lied about it so no one would have believed her anyway that does not surprise me overmuch vespasia nodded but it would seem that you believe her why well actually emily does charlotte bit her lip it was emily she told finlay really is a pretty good wastrel and not a particularly worthy person but he didnt kill ada was no one else at this place who would testify cornwallis asked looking at charlotte then at pitt why did they not come forward surely finlay would have asked them to or if he really did not remember where he was why did his sister not ask them to speak the whole issue could have been cleared up immediately he was puzzled and there was an edge of anger in his voice vespasia turned to charlotte food now entirely forgotten just what sort of a place was this that no one is prepared to admit having been there i confess my curiosity is aroused do we live in such a very squeamish age i cannot think of anywhere whatever that a robust young man would be too delicate to admit having attended was it a dogfight or a bareknuckle boxing match a gambling den a brothel a party where they drank too much and took opium charlotte replied in a very small voice cornwalliss expression darkened vespasia bit her lip her eyebrows arched stupid but not so very extraordinary i would not deny having been in such a place if i could save a mans life by admitting to it charlotte said nothing but pitt knew that it was not doubt so much as indecision as to how she could phrase what she meant cornwallis who did not know her was watching vespasia then if we could find these people he said decisively we could at least clear fitzjames of the first crime and by inference of the second also he turned to pitt did you know this why didnt you mention it before i only learned it when it seemed already irrelevant pitt replied and saw charlotte blush cornwallis observed the exchange as did vespasia but neither of them made comment at least it solves one question cornwallis resumed sitting back and taking up his fork again now it remains to discover why someone placed his belongings at the scene and of course who but those two are basically the same question the answer to one will provide the answer to the other surely that must be one man he looked at vespasia then pitt i find it hard to imagine it could be someone living in whitechapel and an associate of either woman it must be someone who hates fitzjames profoundly a personal enemy of an extraordinary nature which brings us back to investigating fitzjames but that is unavoidable could it be some form of conspiracy vespasia asked also now eating her steakandkidney pie charlotte was very good at a suet crust both men looked at her you mean one person to kill the woman the other to provide the evidence and perhaps even to place it pitt did not believe it it was too complicated and far too dangerous if there had been anyone else involved that costigan knew of he would have said so he would not have gone to the rope alone but cornwalliss eyes were on vespasia charlotte cleared her throat yes pitt asked she was acutely uncomfortable but there was no escape now they were all looking at her it isnt really proof that finlay was at the party she said very slowly her face pink she avoided pitts eyes you see i think almost everyone there was so preoccupied with their own enjoyment and so so affected by whatever they were drinking or otherwise taking that the evidence would not really be a great deal of use one could have taken a troop of dancing horses through there and no one would have been sure afterwards whether it happened or they had imagined it i see cornwallis accepted it with good grace but could not mask his disappointment but you believe the sister she was sober enough to be sure she saw him there this time she met his eyes oh yes she was only there for a very short while when she realized what was going on she left and did emily tell you all this vespasia enquired innocently charlotte hesitated i see vespasia said nothing more charlotte kept her gaze on her plate and began to eat again very slowly gracie had retreated into the kitchen i must answer this question of having costigan pardoned cornwallis said grimly although i am not sure how much of it rests upon me other than to take the blame for the prosecution a pardon will be up to the judge and the home secretary possibly the queen i wish to god wed waited another week then the poor devil would still be alive and we could pardon him to some effect pitt did not approach the subject of hanging it was one about which he felt profoundly but this was not the time and no doubt others would do so in the alltoonear future could costigan be guilty and this be a second murderer copying the method of the first cornwallis asked looking at pitt but without any hope or belief no pitt answered unhesitatingly unless it is one of us and that is as close to impossible as matters only constable binns inspector ewart and lennox the police surgeon knew the details of the first they all waited expectantly cornwallis leaning forward back stiff vespasia with her hands resting on the table edge binns was patrolling his usual beat and was attracted by the panic of a witness leaving pentecost alley pitt said in answer to the unspoken question ewart was at home with his wife and family and lennox was called from another case hed been attending it was close by but hed been with the patient all evening hadnt left them at all until he was sent for that seems to make it plain cornwallis said bleakly charlotte stood up and cleared away the plates some unfinished then with gracie she brought in the rice pudding which was golden on top sprinkled with nutmeg there were stewed plums to go with it thank you cornwallis accepted then winced as his mind returned to the problem it seems all we can do is present a brave face make no excuses no accusations until we have absolute proof blame no one else and keep on investigating both fitzjames and the material evidence around nora goughs death exactly as we would if we had no suspects at all pitt i would prefer it if you handled the fitzjames end of the case it is extremely sensitive and will no doubt get worse i would like to think the newspapers would leave us alone but it would be quite unrealistic to expect it i am afraid we have enemies and they will not lose such an opportunity to strike at us im sorry he looked distressed i wish i were able to offer you more protection pitt forced himself to smile thank you sir but i am quite aware of the restrictions upon you or anyone in your position there is no defense and so it proved pitt interviewed everyone he felt might be of the slightest assistance regarding the fitzjames family and anyone so injured by them intentionally or not that they might wish revenge he enquired both personally and professionally and learned a great deal about augustus fitzjames and the nature of his financial empireand the means whereby he had forged it and now maintained it it was ruthless there was no deference paid to loyalties or friendships but it was never outside the law he settled his debts to the letter never above he seldom lent but when he did he expected repayment to the farthing he was a cold man yet apparently not unattractive to women and had been known to carry on affairs with several acquaintances but in his circle he was far from the only one and it had never provoked scandal and most certainly never a divorce no ones reputation had been marred as cornwallis had foreseen the press became more strident costigan was rapidly becoming elevated to the status of a folk hero a martyr to the inefficiency and corruption of the police whose creation some were now beginning to say had been a mistake pitts name was mentioned several times one agitator even suggested that he was personally responsible for having placed the evidence which incriminated costigan and for having removed evidence which would have implicated someone else a man of breeding and money able to purchase his immunity it was slanderous of course but the only defense of any value was to prove him wrong and that pitt was so far unable to do he was sitting in his office in bow street late in the afternoon of the third day after nora goughs death when jack radley came to see him he was formally dressed as if he had just left the house of commons and in spite of the smooth handsome lines of his face he looked tired and harassed he closed the door behind him and walked over to one of the chairs its not very good thomas he said thoughtfully they raised it in the house this afternoon a great deal was said i can imagine pitt pulled a rueful face the police have enemies you have personal enemies too jack replied although they are not all where you might have expected inner circle pitt said unhesitatingly he had been invited to join the ranks of that secret society and had declined quite apart from the members he had exposed at one time and another that was a sin for which he would not be forgiven not necessarily jacks dark blue eyes widened his usual carefree halfamused expression was absent there were unaccustomed lines of anxiety between his brows and from nose to mouth he leaned back in his chair but his attention was still absolute and there was no ease in his body if it were not so damned serious it would be quite funny watching them decide which side to be on he went on those who are either friends of fitzjames or afraid of him find themselves on the same side as you no matter how much they may dislike it and those who for whatever reason dont want to see the chaos which a police or judicial error of this sort made public can cause are also very uncertain where to lay the blame and so the majority of them are keeping silent so who is speaking out pitt asked tasting the irony of it fitzjamess enemies who are powerful enough not to need to be afraid of him perhaps well find the killer among them or at least the man who put young fitzjamess belongings there for us to find no jack did not hesitate there was complete certainty in his voice im afraid your most vociferous enemies are those who believe costigan was wrongly convicted and that it was largely a matter of a new appointee placed to deal with politically sensitive cases listening to the voice of his masters and making a scapegoat of a wretched little east ender in order to protect some idle and lecherous young blueblood although fitzjamess name didnt appear in the newspapers no one has mentioned him and i daresay only a very few know who it is who is actually suspected how do they know anyone is suspected at all pitt asked they know who you are thomas why would you have been called into the case at all if it were not either politically or socially sensitive if it were simply another squalid little domestic murderin other words had there been no suspicion of anyone except costigan or his likethen why were you brought in the very night it was discovered pitt should have seen that it was obvious enough actuallyjack stretched his legs and crossed his anklesvery few people have any idea who is involved but word gets around i imagine fitzjames has called in a few old debts so some very surprising people are defending the police he gave a little grunt of disgust its entertaining in a fashion knowing how much they loathe having to defend you but their only alternative is to come out in the liberal view and question hanging pitt stared at him it was indeed an irony that the people pitt most disliked and disagreed with were forced into defending him while those with whom his natural sympathies lay were in the vanguard of the attack except somerset carlisle jack said with a sudden smile hes a dyedinthewool liberal and hes defending you without qualm or question and at some cost to his own political reputation i suppose you know why it was one very oddly sweet memory in the present bitterness yes i know why pitt replied i did him a favor several years ago a rather absurd affair in resurrection row he was acting in a matter of conscience although i dont think anyone else would have seen it that way hes a trifle unorthodox but a man who is committed to his beliefs ive always liked somerset carlisle im im very glad hes on my side whether hes able to do any good or not he found himself smiling even though he was not quite sure why perhaps simply at the thought of the strange unmentioned and rockfirm loyalty which stretched from one bizarre tragedy to another it flickered through pitts mind to tell jack that emily at least was certain that fitzjames was innocent then he thought of all the questions jack might ask as a result of that remark and he preferred not to answer them at least at present so he said nothing i am afraid the palaee is displeased jack added his eyes on pitts face i suppose some busybody had to tell her pitt was surprised does that make any difference i didnt know you were so politically innocent thomas she isnt likely to intervene but the mere mention of her name will alter things it will send a goodly number of people scurrying around interfering and making themselves important it just makes it all more prominent more difficult gives more people an excuse to make comments and it will certainly be fuel to the columnists in the newspapers as if there werent enough already i havent sensed the terror there was two years ago pitt said cautiously it seems to be more anger it is jack agreed anger and a lot of talk of political and police corruption he uncrossed his legs and leaned forward im sorry i would very much rather not have had to tell you this but my silence wont alter it only rob you of the modicum of defense forewarning might give you he looked straight at pitt suddenly a trifle selfconscious and for what it is worth i dont believe you made an error of judgment of this proportion and i know damn well that you are as honest as it is possible to be we all delude ourselves a little see what we want to see or expect to see but you less than most of us and ive never known you to take advantage of another mans misfortune and before pitt could stumble towards an answer jack rose to his feet gave an awkward little mock salute and went out that morning charlotte made the decision to pack some clothes and take daniel and jemima to their grandmother not because she was running away but because she intended to do something about the situation if emily knew tallulah fitzjames socially and was privy to her secrets indeed had established a considerable trust then this was the obvious way to help pitt to do that effectively would take time and she must be free to do whatever was called for she could not afford to be worrying about her childrens welfare caroline welcomed her in but looked extremely anxious the whole house seemed at once familiar and oddly different since her marriage to joshua fielding like an old friend who has suddenly adopted quite alien dress and mannerisms she too had changed all the conventions she had followed since childhood were abandoned with pleasure but new ones had taken their places the decorations charlotte had grown up with had gone the sense of solidity of dignified servants running an establishment to a precise regime had vanished altogether charlotte regretted it at the same moment that she smiled to see her mother so happy the old order had had a kind of safety in it it was familiar full of memories most often happy ones the antimacassars were gone from the backs of the chairs she had laughed at them as a child but they were part of the continuity the sameness which made the house comfortable instinctively she looked at the wall for the dark rather drab stilllife pictures her father had been given by his favorite aunt he had hated themthey all hadbut they had kept them there for aunt maudes sake they were gone so was her fathers walking stick from the umbrella stand of course it was there was no real reason why it should not have been given away when he died it simply had been overlooked it was oddly painful like a tearing up of roots something broken there were new things here as well a chinese vase on the hall stand caroline always used to hate chinoiserie she had thought it affected there was a red lacquer box as well and half a dozen playbills a silk shawl of brilliant colors hung carelessly from the newel post there was nothing wrong with any of it it was simply strange how are you caroline asked looking at her with concern she hugged the children then sent them through to the kitchen for cake and milk so she could speak to charlotte alone i saw the newspapers its frightful and so terribly unjust a wry amusement filled her face although since i have been married to a jew i am a great deal more aware of instant judgments than i was in the past and how incredibly stupid they can be i used to be so careful of what people would think now most of the time i simply do what i want to and be the person i want to be one moment its marvelous and the next it terrifies me and i am afraid i shall lose everything charlotte looked at her mother with amazement she had never thought of her as so aware of her own vulnerability or so calculated in her risks she had imagined her love for joshua had overwhelmed all knowledge of what the cost to her might be and she was wrong caroline was perfectly aware she had chosen intentionally and without denying the risk maybe she would understand charlottes own fear for pitt now far more intensely than she had believed she had never considered they were alike perhaps in that she was wrong they were different generations with all the values and experiences that that meant but their natures held more in common than ever separated them the excuses she had prepared vanished will you look after daniel and jemima for me for a few days please charlotte asked following as caroline led the way into the old familiar withdrawing room i dare not leave them at home gracie would do anything necessary for them but she is so furious with everyone who criticizes thomas she might start a fight in the street before i could stop her especially if the children are frightened or upset and anyway it is not fair to expect her to comfort them if appalling things are said about their father where will you be caroline asked her expression conveying that her willingness need not even be questioned she sat down and indicated one of the other chairs for charlotte emily knows the sister of the man thomas suspects may be behind it all charlotte started to explain sitting a little sideways ignoring her skirts at least his family and his enemies are i must do something to help i cant just sit at home and commiserate mama they are attacking him at every side liberal writers and politicians the very people who should be most on his side because he agrees with them are accusing him of corruption her voice was rising and she could hear it herself and yet her emotion was too strong to govern they are saying he had costigan charged and convicted to satisfy peoples fears after the other whitechapel murders two years ago and didnt care whether it was the right man or not he should have investigated the wellborn young men who use prostitutes instead of their own class of women and that the establishment dont care what happens to the poor as long as it doesnt cause a scandal in their own circles if i know caroline interrupted i know my dear i read the newspapers now of course it is facile and stupid and bitterly unjust but did you not expect them to say something of the sort i charlotte leaned forward and rested her chin on the heels of her hands here in these halffamiliar surroundings the old shapes within the new colors she could so easily remember her first meeting with pitt how he had infuriated her made her think even at her angriest she had never been able to dislike him he had shown her new worlds a different kind of pain of joy and of reality from the safety of the dreams she had known before she could not bear to see him so vilified all he had built so carefully destroyed and by people who thought they were fighting for justice and compassion wellmeaning and so desperately wrong it is beside the point at the moment she answered swallowing down the ache in her throat which threatened to choke her i cant prevent that i can go to the fitzjames house with emily and learn a great deal more about them in a way thomas never could im going to visit emily right now of course caroline agreed i shall see that daniel and jemima are perfectly all right i i suppose there is no point in saying to you be careful none at all charlotte replied would you no charlotte smiled briefly then rose hugged caroline and went out to the front door in the street she turned sharply towards the thoroughfare where she would find a hansom she had no intention of taking care of herself but she was going to be meticulously careful of every piece of information she acquired and every step she took to obtain it of course emily agreed immediately when charlotte asked her she had gone straight from carolines house to emilys but if we are to achieve anything of value we must see finlay as well as tallulah we had better go later this afternoon when he is likely to be home from the foreign office although frankly im not sure how much work he really does and it had better be before he dresses and goes out for the evening yes that makes sense charlotte acquiesced although it would be hard to master her impatience until then we must get some sure evidence of finlays having been at this wretched party she went on if we can at least prove his innocence of the first crime then we can prove the reason thomas didnt prosecute him was that he knew he was innocent and that who he was had nothing to do with it they were in emilys favorite room the small sitting room which opened into the garden with mossgreen carpet and yellow floral curtains it always seemed to feel warm whether the sun was shining or not there was a vase of chrysanthemums on the low rosewood table the next thing she continued will be to find out who could have killed both women they lived near enough to each other they might have known some of the same people she bit her lip caught between suppressing the fearnot giving it wordsand the slight comfort of sharing it do you suppose its another lunatic emily not unless i have to emily said with a bleak smile lets try to clear finlay first and have some luncheon we can plan what we are going to say better to be prepared and hunger wont help they arrived in devonshire street at a quarter past four and were received by tallulah in her own boudoir the sitting room specifically for ladies she was delighted to see emily but taken aback when she saw that she was accompanied by someone else and a stranger my sister charlotte emily introduced them i was sure you would not mind my bringing her she is most resourceful and i thought she might help us with the dilemma we face she is already familiar with something of the circumstances tallulah looked a little startled she had obviously not considered that emily might have confided their situation to anyone else emily ignored her expression and plunged on looking innocent it has come to the stage when we must prove the matter once and for all she shook her head a little and her face was full of sympathy you are going to have to admit that you were at that wretched party and that you saw finlay no one will believe me tallulah said with exasperation glancing at charlotte nervously then back to emily again they were all seated in small floralcovered easy chairs but tallulah hunched herself uncomfortably on the edge of hers weve been over all that she protested if it would have been the slightest use i would have said so in the beginning do you think i would have allowed finlay to be suspected at all if i could have helped it what kind of a person do you think i am her eyes were very bright as if filled with tears and her hands were clenched in her lap charlotte wondered whether it was emilys opinion which hurt her or some other perhaps that of jago jones there was so much they did not know about tallulah about finlay about all the emotions which seethed below the surface of polite exchanges between those who lived beneath one roof who seemed to share so much of daily life of heritage of status in the world and in society who had known each other all their lives and yet had so little idea of what mattered or what hurt emily was thinking how to phrase her reply so it did not make a fragile situation worse i think you are frightened for a brother you love she answered at length as i would be i love my sister and would do anything i could to save her from an unjust punishment she smiled apologetically i might even go to some lengths to mitigate a just one were it necessary as she would for me as she has done she looked at tallulah gently but because i care so much i would also be unable to think as clearly as i might were it someone less close to me she waited watching tallulah slowly tallulah relaxed of course im sorry this is such a nightmare and i have not been myself lately she looked at emily as if her last remark were not merely a figure of speech but something she meant more literally emily perceived the difference who have you been she said not quite jokingly someone much more virtuous tallulah replied also as if she were not quite certain if she were serious or not someone who doesnt go to exciting parties or waste time or wear very expensive and fashionable clothes she sighed in fact someone really pretty tedious im trying to be good and all im being is a bore why is being good such a list of things you mustnt do and its almost everything thats any fun being virtuous seems to be so so bland so gray doing good works can be gray charlotte replied remembering something aunt vespasia had said being good isnt because that involves feeling caring about what you do it isnt a bloodless sort of thing at all selfishness is gray in the end it may not look it to begin with but when you realize someone is essentially interested only in themselves and if they even have to choose between what they like and what you need you will lose thats gray cowardice is gray the people who run away and leave you to fight alone when it looks as if the danger is real and you might not win liars are gray people who tell you what you want to believe whether its true or not its generosity courage laughter and honesty which are really the bright colors tallulah smiled you say that as if you really mean it mama thinks im trying to mend my reputation papa thinks im being obedient fin hasnt even noticed does any of that matter emily asked tallulah shrugged no not really and jago tallulah tried to laugh and failed he thinks its a pose and very silly if anything he despises me even more for being artificial her face was full of pain and confusion i dont know how to be better except by behaving as if i were what does he expect me to do she took a deep shuddering breath i think he wouldnt really like me no matter what i did suddenly she was angry the pain of rejection flaring up inside her and anyway i dont want to be liked who on earth wants to be liked its a pale tepid sort of thing i like rice pudding why charlotte said suddenly tallulah turned to look at her i beg your pardon why do you like rice pudding charlotte repeated tallulah could not hide her impatience because it tastes pleasant what on earth difference does that make it hardly matters does it i know that you meant you like rice pudding because you were contrasting a bland and unimportant feeling with one of passion and intensity charlotte explained trying for a few moments to put her own desperate need to help pitt from the front of her mind and think wholly of tallulah but the point i am trying to make is that the liking you are thinking of is purely subjective what you mean is not that you like rice pudding but that you enjoy it you like the way it makes you feel tallulah stared at her without comprehension only inbred good manners kept her from saying something dismissive when we speak of affections for a person charlotte continued as she would have to jemima we might be speaking only of the way they make us feel but if it is really a love or even liking we should also be speaking of some concern for what they feel isnt love supposed to be an unselfish thing a placing of someone elses wellbeing before your own there was complete silence in the room it was a typical boudoir of a young woman of fashion and a good deal of money where she could receive her visitors in privacy it was richly decorated in florals all pinks and blues with dashes of white actually for someone of tallulahs originality it was surprisingly conventional perhaps she had not been allowed to decorate it herself from what emily had said of her charlotte would have expected something more inventive perhaps oriental or turkish or even a touch reflecting the current fascination with ancient egypt not these conventional flowers i i suppose so tallulah said at last i hadnt thought of it like that charlotte smiled yes you had your concern for your brother is unselfish you are prepared to get into a considerable amount of unpleasantness yourself in order to clear him of suspicion it will not enhance your reputationwith society in general or jago in particularif you admit to having been at that party nor will your father be inclined to view it favorably you may well find your freedom curtailed or your dress allowance cut short or even suspended altogether tallulah was very pale yes she said softly i know but thats different her hands clenched in her lap fin is my brother ive known him all my life if i dont stand by him who will probably no one charlotte said honestly but please dont think so lightly of liking someone its terribly important it is a kind of loving you know and one that frequently lasts a lot longer than romance you can fall out of love as well as in most of us do especially if you dont actually like the person as well it doesnt always grow into love by any means but sometimes it does tallulah blinked and frowned would you care to spend the rest of your life with someone you didnt actually like charlotte added no of course not tallulah looked at her closely as if trying to judge what kind of woman she was would you marry someone you merely liked and who no more than liked you charlotte had to smile broadly no i wouldnt even entertain the idea i married highly unsuitably because i loved my husband wildly and still do well jago doesnt love me tallulah said with flat desperation and the whole discussion is pointless because he doesnt even like me either dont give up yet emily cut in merely not going to parties and being extravagant is not enough it is negative a case of not doing things your heart isnt in it and he knows that you must find something to do that you care about a cause to fight for well think about it after we have won this battle we have a pretty big cause in these terrible murders if no one is going to believe you then we must find someone else who was there and sober enough to recall seeing finlay or if not finlay then at least seeing you that would prove you were there it might push someones memory are you willing to do that of course i am tallulah was very white but she did not hesitate as soon as he comes home we shall speak with him she reached for the bell and rang it when the parlor maid answered expecting a request for tea tallulah asked her to inform them as soon as mr finlay should come in yes miss is there any message only that there is something most urgent i have to see him about tallulah replied it concerns him and it may be of service to him please be sure to let him know immediately and then tell me the maid had no sooner gone than there was a knock on the door and before tallulah had time to respond it opened and aloysia fitzjames came in she was a handsome woman with a quiet wellbred manner there was a serenity in her face as if she deliberately closed out that which was ugly and by strength of will created her own world good afternoon she said as they rose to greet her how pleasant of you to call it was now considerably after the appropriate hour for formal calls or even informal ones their presence needed some explanation mama tallulah began these are my good friends mrs radley and her sister mrs she was obliged to hesitate not having been told charlottes name pitt charlotte supplied it was a moment before tallulah realized what she had said she glanced at emily saw the consternation in her face turned to charlotte and saw it there also anger flamed up inside her a sense of betrayal which she held in check only with extreme difficulty aloysia noticed nothing how do you do mrs radley mrs pitt she said with a smile tallulah my dear are your guests remaining for dinner i think now would be an appropriate time to inform cook no tallulah forced out the word between clenched teeth they have previous matters to attend to which would make that impossible what a shame aloysia said with a slight shrug it would have been pleasant to have an interesting conversation over the dinner table men tend to talk about politics so much of the time dont you think yes indeed emily agreed my husband is in the house i hear a great deal too much of it and your husband mrs pitt aloysia enquired we already know mrs pitts husband tallulah said viciously he is a policeman she turned to charlotte i imagine you hear about all manner of things over the dinner table thieves arsonists prostitutes and murderers and politicians charlotte finished with a bright brittle smile usually they are separate but not invariably aloysia was totally bemused but she did not falter she had kept up a calm agreeable conversation in worse circumstances than this i feel very sorry for these women that have been killed she said regarding emily and then charlotte perhaps if we could make prostitution illegal then such things wouldnt happen tallulah stared at her i dont think it would help mrs fitzjames charlotte said quite gently there isnt much point in making a law you cant enforce aloysias eyes widened surely the law must be a matter of ideals mrs pitt we cannot call ourselves a civilized or a christian people if we make laws only on those issues where we feel we have control all crime must be against the law or the law is worthless my husband has said that many times if you pass a law against something that defines it as a crime charlotte argued but still with perfectly conceded patience there are a multitude of things which are sins such as lying adultery malice envy ill temper but it would be completely impractical to make them against the law because we cannot police them or prove them or punish people for them but prostitution is quite different my dear mrs pitt aloysia said with conviction it is utterly immoral it is the ruination of good men the betrayal of women of families it is unbelievably sordid i cannot believe you really know what you are talking about she took a deep breath neither do i of course i hold no advocacy for it mrs fitzjames charlotte replied suffocating an intense desire to giggle tallulah was so furious she could scarcely contain herself i simply believe it is impossible to prevent if we really wished to do so we would have to address the issues which cause prostitution both the women who practice it and the men who use them aloysia stared at her i have no idea what you mean charlotte gave up perhaps i am not very good at explaining myself i apologize aloysia smiled charmingly im sure it doesnt matter perhaps you will come again one day it was charming to have met you mrs radley mrs pitt and with that she made some comment about the weather and excused herself tallulah glared at emily pointedly ignoring charlotte how could you she said furiously i suppose you contrived my acquaintance right from the beginning you must have found my confidences very entertaining if not particularly instructive she swung around on charlotte it still hasnt cleared your husband of the blame for hanging the wrong man has it are you here now trying to help him hang the person you believe to be the right one this time emily opened her mouth to explain but charlotte cut in before her if what you say is trueand i believe youthen it is certainly not your brother is it not as much in your interest as mine that he should be cleared and that beyond question proving he was somewhere else the first time would be an excellent start but proving that someone else is definitely guilty would be even better that would remove the slightest speculation she took a deep breath i would have thought you would also be very keen to know who it is that is so determined to incriminate him i would if he were my brother or indeed anyone i cared about tallulah regarded her with intense dislike which only gradually softened as she realized the truth of what charlotte had said we all have the same interests even if it is for slightly different reasons emily pointed out practically and i assume we all believe that finlay is innocent yes charlotte answered i know he is tallulah agreed emily smiled charmingly then shall we pretend that we are still friends at least for the time being tallulah accepted with surprising grace considering her rage only a few moments earlier when finlay arrived home he came almost immediately to the boudoir and was startled to see two other women there he did not know charlotte and he did not remember emily tallulah introduced them omitting charlottes surname but being surprisingly gracious about her speaking of her desire to help as if she had been aware of it from the beginning finlay looked doubtful although there was a flicker of humor in his eyes charlotte returned his gaze trying not to peer at him with the curiosity she felt he must already be sensitive to the speculative thoughts of others intrusive on occasion prurient considering the crime of which he was suspected he was a handsome man but he had not the kind of looks she found appealing she could not see in him the strength she admired or the width of imagination which excited her she thought she saw something vulnerable in him something which should be guarded from injury because it would not recover would not heal he turned away from charlotte the name meant nothing to him and she herself did not spark his interest thank you for your confidence he said dryly touching tallulah lightly on the shoulder it was a familiar gesture but one of affection and perhaps gratitude are you really prepared to face what papa will say if you tell him you were there it may not be very easy to find anyone else willing to admit it i cant remember anything except i know perfectly well i wasnt anywhere near pentecost alley the first thing i can remember clearly was having a cracking headache the next morning it could be that most other people will feel the same way his face looked bleak i couldnt swear before a jury as to who was there some of the others might have been soberer than you fin tallulah pointed out he gave a halfhearted laugh glancing at emily with a smile well i can give you a list of the sort of people who were likely to have been there i can ask them if they were and if they remember seeing me i daresay one of them might own up to it its me they need to have seen tallulah pointed but then people will believe me when i say i saw you it wont have to be public at least she looked at charlotte will it i mean it is not as if the whole of society will have to know or the foreign office finlay added although im not sure how much difference that will make now he pushed his hands into his pockets and paced across the floor and back again none at all if they charge me with killing nora gough or even if they suspect me of it and no one else is charged he looked hopeless there was a kind of blank fear in his eyes as if he knew disaster was inevitable but he still did not understand where it had come from or how it had happened to him someone is very determined to incriminate you mr fitzjames charlotte said gravely they took your belongings and put them at the scenes of two murders it must be someone who hates you with almost insane passion or hates my father finlay interrupted i cant imagine anyone hating me so much a few people dislike me naturally and quite a few might be envious of the family wealth or opportunity i daresay there are several who dont think i deserve my position let alone an ambassadorship in the future he looked at charlotte then at emily but i havent ravished anybodys wife welched on any debts stolen anything or well anything he stood at the far side of the room staring at them defiant and helpless as if an ugly reality had come to him drying up what he had been going to say well perhaps it is your father charlotte agreed but there is another point mr fitzjames whoever it is has considerable knowledge of you he had your original club badge and your cuff link and not only that but he knew you were unable to account for where you were that night there would have been little point in trying to blame you if you had been at dinner with your family or with friends or at the opera for example all of which were pretty likely how did he know that you werent finlay stared at her a terrible comprehension dawning in his face charlotte waited emily stared at him too no one spoke what tallulah demanded her voice high and sharp who is it fin finlay looked straight ahead of him his face pasty his eyes full of fear who tallulah said even more sharply jago finlay replied in a whisper then coughed avoiding turning his head towards her i saw jago jones that afternoon and i mentioned to him that i was going to a party in chelsea i said where it was joked about it not being the sort of thing he would go to being so selfrighteous these days he thats impossible tallulah said abruptly thats a wicked thing to say and stupid you know perfectly well jago would never hurt anyone let alone she stopped her voice filled with tears and her face was so white she looked about to collapse of course not emily said quickly and without conviction but he may have mentioned it unwittingly to someone else who tallulah demanded swinging around in panic her eyes glittering with tears why would he tell anyone about finlay going to some drunken party who would jago know that had ever even heard of fin she turned back to her brother again who else did you tell someone must have invited you think her voice was rising angry and raw with pain dont stand there like a a fool anyone could have seen you there and left early for the love of heaven fin use your brains i dont know he shouted back at her if i knew dont you think id tell you for gods sake tallulah im the one theyll hang not bloody jago stop it charlotte said sharply they arent going to hang you if we can prove you couldnt be guilty but weve got to use our wits turning on one another wont accomplish anything control yourself and think finlay stared at her his mouth open shes right tallulah said grudgingly anyone who was there could have seen you and the state you were in or simply known you well enough to be sure you couldnt remember the night and neither would most other people and theres also the fact that most people would be unwilling to admit they were there either emily added try your friends charlotte instructed surely one of them at least will have the honor to own up to you having been there and having seen you if not at the relevant time at least earlier he may know who else was there at the beginning what are you going to do tallulah asked mainly of charlotte but including emily charlottes mind was racing ahead i assume you are going to do something tallulah continued after all the question is as urgent for you as it is for us at least almost hardly finlay said bitterly oh yes it is tallulah argued with a flash of temper if we never find who did it you will be ruined because of the mystery and the whispers nothing bad will happen to you but neither will anything good i know that finlay said selfpity sharp in his voice and his face and mrs pitts husband will be ruined as well tallulah finished because he hanged the wrong man and never caught the right one finlay looked up at charlotte his eyes wide then a tide of scarlet rushed up his cheeks pitt pittof course his voice was thick i never connected it i never even thought of policemen as having wives let alone ones who could pass for ladies and he began to laugh a thin sharp note of hysteria creeping into it and rising up the scale louder and more shrill tallulah looked as if she would like to have hit him im sorry she said to charlotte her face pink i shall send a message as soon as i learn anything which could be of value so will we emily promised a trifle mendaciously then she and charlotte took their leave hes frightened emily said as soon as they were seated in her carriage and moving along devonshire street so would i be charlotte replied vehemently if i knew i had an enemy prepared to go to these lengths to have me hanged she shivered for a moment uncontrollably cold deep inside her he has tortured and killed two women just to destroy finlay to hate anyone that much is insane emily hugged her arms around herself what are we going to do next she asked very quietly i dont know try to see if there is any connection between ada mckinley and nora gough i suppose why did he choose them why not somebody else maybe it didnt matter who it was emily said miserably maybe there isnt a reason it could just as easily have been anyone she looked even more wretched what if it is jago jones if it is it will be terrible charlotte replied but we shall have to live with it emily returned home determined to do all she could against the injustice she felt hung over the head of finlay fitzjames perhaps it was more for tallulahs sake than for his but she had sensed the fear in him and the complete bewilderment she would have sworn before any authority in the land that he had no idea how his belongings had come to be in ada mckinleys room nor who had put them there that it had been done in order to see him blamed for her death was the only certainty in the grim chaotic picture there was an enemy somewhere just out of sight an implacable enemy verging on insanity with hatred over what it did not seem as if finlay had any idea and the more she considered that the more did it seem certain that it must be his fathers enemy rather than his own the following morning she approached jack over breakfast beginning as soon as he sat down i have been thinking a great deal about thomass present case she said before he had even reached for the dish with the bacon i feel we must do anything whatever that we can to help she took a small serving of scrambled eggs and a slice of toast finlay fitzjames is not guilty we know that no we dont he said sharply he may very well be guilty the only person we know is innocent is albert costigan poor devil with a sudden sinking inside emily realized she had led herself into a trap naturally she had told jack nothing whatever about her trip to beaufort street he would disapprove fiercely he would have to in the past he might very well have attended such a party himself but things were very different now he was a member of parliament and a respectable family man with a reputation which was of great value oh she tried hastily to think of some way to retreat no argument to justify her statement came to her mind there was nothing but to deny it perhaps i spoke more in hope than reality i she had better not mention tallulah that could lead to complications i cannot believe thomas would make such a mistake he lifted two poached eggs out of the dish onto his plate you mean costigan was guilty he asked raising his eyes and looking very directly at her she was still taken aback by how very beautiful his eyes were no no what i meant was that thomas wouldnt let finlay fitzjames go just because of who he is he wouldnt think he had to be innocent and not follow it up because she stopped he was looking at her with patient disbelief do you know finlay fitzjames he asked ive met him she never lied outright there was all the world of difference between deceit and discretion but only twice and both times by chance i dont know him but there is no doubt in your mind that he is innocent he made it a statement not a question i she held a quick debate with herself justice and help for tallulah were extremely important it was a question of right and wrong her honesty with jack the trust between them was also important more important than she had thought even five minutes ago i know his sister she added and she has told you something which makes you believe his innocence he observed she had not expected him to be so perceptive yes she agreed with considerably less confidence what pardon what did she tell you emily oh just that she saw him somewhere else at the time thomas knows about it it isnt exactly proof obviously he said with a tight smile he took a mouthful of egg and bacon she relaxed a little and ate some of her own scrambled eggs and buttered her toast there was no sound but the faint crisp sound of the knife where did she see him he asked her heart sank at a party thats hardly an explanation dont make me pull teeth emily what sort of a party a drunken one i presume and no one else remembers whether they were there themselves let alone who else was yes she kept the answer simple everything new she added only got her into further trouble she was realizing with surprise how much it would hurt if jack were to lose his trust for her or his respect perhaps she should confess to going to beaufort street before he found out did she tell thomas this he asked she didnt think anyone would believe her shed already lied about being somewhere else but you believe her yes would there be any point in asking why not really he returned to the bacon and eggs she was not sure whether he believed her or not do you know augustus fitzjames she asked hopefully he did not look up but his lips curved in amusement almost as if he were about to laugh fishing he enquired yes fishing she admitted do you slightly and no i dont know who it is who hates him so passionately he is prepared to sink to this level to revenge himself on him but i shant stop looking for thomass sake thank you she took a deep breath is he really so awful augustus yes i think so from everything i can learn hes not gratuitously cruel he simply doesnt care he has a great sense of familyof dynasty if you like which is odd for one who comes from such a relatively ordinary background perhaps thats why money has bought him all he has and he thinks it can buy everything hes right more often than i would wish but you are finding out who his greatest enemies are of course do you think i dont care about thomas as much as you do but there is also a pretty grave job of defense to be made in the house the attacks are mounting his eyes were troubled dark shadows behind the honesty hes going to be all right isnt he now she was really afraid not for tallulah or finlay fitzjames but for charlotte perhaps even for jack too if he made his connection obvious she could not ask him how far he was prepared to go anyway looking at his face she knew the answer there would be no limit if necessary jack would jeopardize his own career even lose it before he would deny pitt before he replied she smiled at him radiantly absolutely the tears spilling over and running down her cheeks he reached across and took her hand turning it over and kissing the palm very gently i dont know he confessed then held her fingers very tightly cornwallis looked harassed he invited pitt to sit down but was too tense to do so himself he paced back and forth across the carpet in his office stopping every now and then forcing himself to stand still he did not mention that the campaign to pardon costigan was gaining momentum but they both knew it nor did he say that several questions had been asked in the house of commons and not only was pitt held to blame for an exceedingly ugly stain on british justice but he himself was also have you learned anything he asked quietly there was no anger in his voice and certainly no accusation he was a man in whom crisis brought out the strength his loyalties were plainest when tested to the bitter end nothing useful pitt said honestly i have spoken again to thirlstone and helliwell but no one will admit to any serious quarrel although a pattern of dislike is becoming plain they didnt part friends but i have no idea yet why in fact he added ruefully im not honestly sure if it even matters what about jones cornwallis asked you didnt mention him his face tightened and it obviously pained him to say what he was about to i know he is a man of the cloth and very obviously doing fine work in whitechapel but that doesnt mean he is not capable of personal hatred of a man like fitzjames you dont know what old wrongs may be in the past pitt he jammed his hands into his pockets pulling them out of shape nor is any man invulnerable to hungers and loneliness that can overwhelm one at times he has chosen a path of service and selfdenial but he is a young man it can happen that we ask too much of ourselves and find our weaknesses sharper than we can bear pitt heard the emotion in his voice and the urgency was he speaking entirely of jago jones he had spent long lonely years at sea himself with all the isolation of command the responsibility for the lives of every man on his ship with no one else to turn to for six months at a time i know pitt answered quietly please god it is not he and i believe it isnt but i know it is not impossible ill see him then im going back to the most straightforward way start again at the beginning with the evidence in the death of nora gough i want to know more about her does anything connect the two victims cornwallis asked starting to pace again then stopping in a square of sunlight apart from the same occupation and neighborhood i dont know im going to see ewart again he must have found something by now hes a good man cornwallis said seriously ive been looking into his record everyone speaks well of him not just because of the success hes had professionally but personally as well his reputation is excellent quiet conscientious good family man works extremely hard and saves his money cornwalliss voice lifted with surprise he has three sons and a daughter daughter married well to a farmer somewhere in kent doing very well his oldest son has a place in university and the other two look set the same way thats a remarkable achievement he did not add for an ordinary policeman tact held his tongue but he meant it we couldnt have a better man with us yes pitt agreed hes a good man you know he never thought fitzjames was involved with ada mckinley he always believed it was someone local perhaps he was right it might have been exactly the domestic tragedy he had said i should have listened to him more closely paid more attention to his judgment he never thought the connection with fitzjames mattered and perhaps it doesnt ill see him tomorrow then the core to this doesnt lie with fitzjames at all cornwallis said with a frown more as if he were testing an idea than voicing a conviction he was standing over by the telescope and the sextant on the wall and the sunlight caught his face and gleamed on the polished brass surfaces what about this handkerchief it could be his but is it does it have to be no anyone could have had it made and the button expensive but quite easily obtained if one went to any good tailor so it doesnt really mean anything it doesnt mean fitzjames was there pitt corrected it means someone would like us to think he was and that someone wasnt costigan cornwallis shook his head a little and his eyes were bright with sadness it comes back to jones again he said quietly he seems to be the common factor pitt i know we must face it find out exactly where he was when both women were killed stay with the evidence forget the reason why he was a member of this wretched club he lives and works in whitechapel he knew ada mckinley perhaps he knew nora gough as well he shook his head fractionally i know you think its out of character with what you have seen of the man but what do you really know not enough pitt confessed the words dragged out of him but then i dont think i ever do he rose to his feet ill see him tomorrow after ive seen ewart he had not the heart to do it that evening he knew where jago would be handing out soup in coke street he did not want to go and question him while he was doing that he had never wanted to question a man less or been less willing to find some other face behind the mask tomorrow would be too soon tonight was unbearable he found charlotte solicitous but uncommunicative she had apparently been out all afternoon and had at last succumbed to taking the children to her mothers to protect them from the unpleasantness of hearing peoples comments in the streets or the gibes and questions of their schoolfellows they did not mention the case he wanted to forget it for an evening he had no more thoughts no more clues to explore nothing more to wrestle with or try to understand he was happy to sit quietly think of something calm and sensible like the garden or whether daniels bedroom should be repainted in a more adult fashion now he was growing up he was no longer really the age for a nursery and perhaps it was time to give gracie another raise in the morning he went to whitechapel early and found ewart still at his desk he looked tired and unhappy pitt did not need to ask if he had discovered anything of value the denial of it was in every line of his face and body he had cut himself shaving and his features looked pinched i havent found anything he said before pitt asked the evidence means nothing he slid back in his chair his body crumpled too tired to straighten he looked strangely beaten considering it was pitt who would take the blame he might be glad now that the case had been removed from his responsibility i know the button and the handkerchief dont mean anything pitt said then sat down in the only other available chair what else do we have nothing ewart spread his hands weve spoken to all the women again they say they saw only one man youngish with fair wavy hair although they are beginning to be less certain even about that some are not sure it was fair as if that mattered a damn his mouth turned down at the corners light plays tricks anyway we are still looking for him ive got several men on it but it could be anyone could have been some toff from up west and wed never find him pitt stared at him it was extraordinary to hear a man of ewarts rank and experience speaking with such defeat if that was the man who had tortured and murdered two women then they must find him whatever it took did ewart really still fear that it was finlay fitzjames with all the ugliness that would mean the blame the accusations of dereliction of duty of bigotry even of corruption he could understand his reluctance even his shrinking from itbut he could not condone it he leaned forward with a jerk well if he is the man who killed nora gough and ada mckinley we are bloody well going to find him he said more loudly than he had intended someone must have seen him he came he went have you repeated the descriptions of him from the women in myrdle street to the other women in pentecost alley yes i have ewart was too miserable to respond with an answering anger they just say it sounds like costigan which it does well has costigan any brothers cousins any relatives at all pitt demanded ewart smiled bitterly i thought of that no he doesnt rose burke and nan sullivan are still convinced costigan did it and who do they think killed nora gough pitt said sarcastically dont know some lunatic who copied costigan why for heavens sake he could hardly hope costigan would be blamed i dont know ewart said because they saw costigan and they want to think hes been topped finished out of the way whatever they think it doesnt matter a toss somebody was there a youngish man with thick hair that waves and no one else came or went so it has to be him god knows who he is i dont no one else came or went pitt repeated thats right ewart sounded utterly wretched as if it were his own personal tragedy he spoke of not just one more of the regular occurrences he must have seen throughout his career cant get them to move on that anything else about the man pitt persisted build way he walked ears peoples ears vary very much did anyone notice anything at all make them think remember back dont tell me how to do my job ewart said angrily i have asked them all those things nobody took any notice of him he was just another client doesnt anybody keep a watch pitt could not afford to let it go he had nothing else dont these girls have any protection even someone to count the customers and make sure they get their fair share of the earnings yes and they can only say he was well dressed and had thick hair look pitt he forgot pitts new rank and addressed him as he used to be an equal ive been over the ground again and again ive got men out searching for this man with descriptions theyve tried every other brothel and bawdy house from mile end to the north limehouse to the east and the tower to the west everybodys seen half a dozen men who answer the description at least he started to add something then changed his mind and bit it off theres nothing pitt leaned back worn out himself was it finlay fitzjames after all or was it jago jones in some insane bitter mixture of hatred of prostitutes of finlay of all his past life and whatever he used to be and of finlays knowledge of him or perhaps it was even that finlay had introduced him to it was that the core of his madnessthe conviction that somehow finlay was the one who had led him to discover the sinner within himself the uncontrollable appetite what is it ewart asked sitting upright suddenly knocking a pile of papers with his elbow what do you know nothing pitt answered but i shall have to go and speak to the reverend jago jones again jones ewart said in surprise leaving the papers where they were you think he knows something i doubt it good man but not worldlywise if he knew anything hed have told us already his voice fell flat again the moments hope gone out of it anyway its a waste of time your going to see him he wont betray a parishioner even if he knows for certain who it is priests vows and all that better to compare between ada and nora see who might have known both of them ive already started he fished among the fallen papers and pulled out a few he pushed them across at pitt these are the people who know both the women and dealt with them one way or another clothes hosiery cosmetics medicines food shoes even bed linen he grunted never realized a prostitute went through so much bed linen see just a few of them are the same naturally pitt took the paper although he did not expect it to reveal anything interesting i dont suppose there are all that many dealers in such things in a small area like this any of them answer the description not so far most of them are middleaged and were at home with their families at the time ewart relapsed into his hopeless air leaning back in his chair slumped over anything from lennox pitt asked no she was killed in exactly the same way ewart answered his face pinched pain written all through him and a driving consuming anger tortured the same all the details match even those no one else knows but us it had to be the same person anything different at all pitt said quietly the shabby room was claustrophobic too small to contain the huge emotions within it no not a thing ewart answered anything at all found apart from the button and the handkerchief pitt went on no odd isnt it what that all the evidence at both scenes implicates finlay fitzjames circumstantial ewart said too quickly then slipped down in his chair again whitefaced i was going to say pitt continued puzzled and unhappy that it doesnt seem natural the more i look at it the more it seems as if the evidence in both cases was put there by someone specifically so we should find it has anyone in either building ever seen finlay fitzjames before ewart sat upright with a jolt no a spark of hope lit in his face ill ask them all again but im sure they havent youre right its too much of a coincidence to suppose that he came here for the very first time and killed a woman hed never even met before why would he unless hes mad he might do it once if he swallowed hard as though his throat were almost closed with the strain if he were drunk or or crazed with with lust or anger or whatever grips people but that once would scare him out of his senses hed never come back less than two months later and do it again especially when he knows we already suspect him he was leaning over the desk now his face sharp with eagerness youve met him pitt did he seem to you like a man possessed by insanity or like a young man whod occasionally behaved like a fool lost his selfcontrol in the past drank a bit too much and couldnt remember the night before and was terrified hed be blamed for something he didnt do terrified of letting down his family of having his father despise him and make life exceedingly unpleasant for him for several months if not years it was exactly how finlay had impressed pitt he could not have worded it more perfectly himself it was an acutely perceptive characterization of the man he had seen he had underrated ewarts judgment youre right he said aloud it comes back every time to someone else trying to blame him he looked at ewart steadily were we wrong with costigan i was so absolutely sure i was right i couldnt explain the boots or the garter but i was sure he killed her so was i ewart said quickly seriously i still think so the boots and the garter must have been the customer before and the second time with nora pitt asked not the same customer no thatd be done by whoever put the handkerchief and the button there to add to it looking like the same person his mouth tightened im sorry sir but it looks like your reverend bit of a fanatic anyway i mean why would a highliving gentleman suddenly give up everything and study to be a minister then choose to come to work here in whitechapel he shook his head people like him dont have to work at all take the rest of the old hellfire club members helliwell works in the city but only when he feels like it doesnt really have to just likes to live high got a wife to keep and i daresay children now runs a carriage big house servants gives parties his wifes dress allowance is probably more than jago jones makes in a decade pitt could not argue other thoughts raced into his mind and thirlstone ewart went on an edge to his voice plays at being an artist doesnt make any money at it doesnt need to just enjoys himself drifts from one stupid conversation to the next walks in the park goes to studios and exhibitions fitzjames wants to be an ambassador or a member of parliament but he doesnt actually work every day like you or me goes to the foreign office when he feels like it a lot of what he does is cultivate the right people be seen at the right places pitt said nothing he heard the contempt in ewarts voice and he understood it perhaps even shared it but jones works from morning till night ewart concluded sundays as well i dont know what they pay him but they dont say poor as a church mouse for nothing wears old clothes eats the same as the rest of em round there probably as cold in winter as they are worse than i am why i dont know pitt stood up but youre right it requires an answer you had better keep on looking for this man who last saw nora i dont know who else to question ewart protested weve spoken to all the women in the building the people in the bottle factory local residents shopkeepers even the beggars and workers in the street pitt said from the doorway keep on trying them someone must have seen him he didnt walk out of there and disappear he turned the handle unless youve got any better ideas he left ewart in the dark untidy office and went back to myrdle street the question of the customer who had disappeared nagged at his mind he had to be the one who killed her but the fact that no one admitted seeing him leave was significant in fact no one even admitted seeing him arrive the house was a brothel there were always people about it was not only a fact of business it was part of their safety every woman who worked the streets was aware of the dangers of a client who was violent abusive refused to pay or had tastes and demands beyond those she was willing to satisfy he walked briskly from the police station along the gray streets filled with traffic men and women bustling along the pavements tradesmen petty clerks errand boys deliverymen peddlers and news sellers noras death was still on every front page along with protests of costigans innocence and the call for reform some even asked for abolition of the police because of their failure to catch the first whitechapel mass murderer and now a second pitt hurried by wanting to look the other way and yet drawn to them against his will his imagination painted lurid headlines what he saw was even worse he was spared nothing police getting nowhere screamed one whitechapel lives in terror again and another sandwich board read has jack the ripper returned police helpless senior policeman pitt going round in circles or is he does he know something he dare not tell who is the whitechapel murderer he arrived at the house in myrdle street tense miserable and out of breath no one was up yet business had resumed as usual the demands of debt do not wait upon a decent mourning period and the fact that a murder had been committed on the premises had not apparently deterred the clientele he roused edie with some difficulty and she came into the kitchen at the back her long black hair tangled her face puffed with sleep a loose robe wrapped around herself her trade had robbed her of any pretension to modesty yer wastin yer time she said sourly sitting down on one of the hardbacked chairs we dont none of us know nuffink as we avent already told yer we saw no one else come nor go that night cept our own customers we dunno oo the geezer was wif the fair air wot went inter noras room an we didnt ear nuffink i know pitt tried to be patient nobody outside saw him either doesnt that strike you as peculiar yeah so wot yer sayin as we got a ghost wot comes in ere strangles nora an goes aht agin she shivered her heavy flesh dragging at her robe yer mad int no such fing someones lyin thats all somebody seen im they just int sayin several people pitt said thoughtfully why i dunno it dont make no sense i want the bastard caught and topped she put her slenderfingered hands up to her face nora were a cheeky bitch but nobody deserved wot appened to er couldve slapped er meself a few times but then reckon as we all get across each other some days why did nora get across you edie pulled a face of selfmockery touched with a kind of humor cos she were pretty i suppose an she could really get the men ad a way wif er she looked at pitt with contempt i don mean nicked yer customers i mean yer own men took a few as i fancied not customers pitt asked not paying men geez yer can do it for fun too yer know she said indignantly well not often mebbe but its good ter ave someone oo likes yer no money treats yer like yerself not like they bought yer nice ter ave jus a cuddle an a laugh yes of course it is and nora would take your man and other peoples ere not reglar just mine once only a geezer wot i fancied nuffink defnite made an abit of it and wed a ad er thrown aht she werent bad nora an if i knew ow ter elp yer get oo it was as done er id bust meself ter do it bloody useless lot yare too she ran her fingers through her black hair geez anyway that little sod costigan sure as ell dint do it and yer int caught the real bastard wot did even though es done it twice now gonna wait till e does it again are yer catch im the third time or will it be like in eightyeight and ell thumb is nose at the lot o yer she stood up pulling her robe around her i dunno nuffink more an im goin back ter me bed i dunno wot they pay yer for if i werent no better at me job than you are id starve pitt roused pearl and mabel and learned nothing else of use they only repeated what they had already said it was lunchtime and he was hungry he walked towards the river and the nearest public house the same one in swan street where he and ewart and lennox had met two evenings before costigans trial was he wrong about costigan could he possibly have been so eager to believe him guilty he had misinterpreted what he said he had to think back but he could not remember the words only his own certainty that it was an admission he went to the bar and asked for a pint of cider and a sandwich with cheese and pickle he took it to a table and sat down eating without tasting the room was noisy packed with porters draymen and laborers the smells of sawdust and ale were everywhere the sounds of voices and occasional laughter he had been there several minutes and was more than halfway through when a large man with an open jacket stared at him pointedly rozzer he said slowly yer that rozzer wot anged costigan aint yer pitt looked up at him i didnt hang him he corrected i arrested him the court tried him the jury found him guilty and the judge sentenced him he took another mouthful of his sandwich and turned away several people close by stopped talking thats right the man raised his voice stuff yer face look the other way from us wot der we matter jus poor folks from whitechapel ang some poor bastard an go ome ter yer bed the jeering in his voice grew sharper uglier sleep easy do yer rozzer only costigan int gonna wake up agin is e cos you anged im but it dont stop some bloody toff comin ere from up west usin our women and then torturin em an stranglin em do it another man joined in his face tight with hatred ow much they pay yer eh judas judas came the cry from half a dozen other throats no one was eating anymore all other conversations stopped someone stood up the landlord yelled for order and was told to keep his mouth shut they moved closer to pitts table faces ugly wot yer come back ere fer eh opin ter be paid agin are yer pay yer every time e kills some poor bitch does e ow much eh ow much is one o our women worth to yer rozzer pitt opened his mouth to speak and someone hit him it was a glancing blow but it shocked him and sent him off balance there was a cheer then someone laughed pitt straightened up onto his feet he was taller than the man had expected and bigger the man stepped back another man squared up beside him ready to join him it was becoming extremely unpleasant pitt felt a sharp tug of fear and sweat broke out on his body he would not go down without a fight but he would have no chance whatever of beating this many men they would injure him badly perhaps even kill him the man nearest him rocked gently on the balls of his feet ready to begin his eyes moving from one side to the other his face glistening with the sweat of excitement pitt could smell it sharp in the air go on a high voice yelled wot yer waitin fer the first man glanced sideways to make certain he would not be starting alone he saw confirmation in the others eyes and stepped forward fists high clenched pitt altered his weight ready for the first blow stop it everyone froze there was command in the voice it was not a shout but it carried across the full extent of the room pitts breath caught in his throat and almost choked him the crowd was elbowed aside and jago jones forced his way through his face was set like iron his eyes blazing what the devils going on here he demanded staring at one man then another no need for you reverend one man said sharply you go on about elpin the sick and them as wants yer we dont want yer ere there was a murmur of agreement someone stretched out a hand towards him to push he ignored it int your business ere reverend another man said roughly go on wi yer own business an aht o ours what are you trying to do jago stared at him without wavering commit another murder and prove we are the ignorant and stupid people the rich would like to believe murder a police superintendent whos only doing his job and theyll have the army in here before you can turn round there was a low grumble of complaint but one by one they stepped back or were pulled leaving jago facing pitt are you finished with your lunch jago asked but his face made it plain it was an order rather than a question pitt swallowed there was still a good deal of his sandwich left and half his cider he picked up the glass and drained it then took the sandwich in his hand yes jago turned to face the way out for several seconds no one moved they stood together belligerently daring jago to brave them are you going to attack me too he said with only the faintest catch in his throat is this your idea of courage and intelligence this how you want the people up west to think of you beasts who set upon priests and policemen there was a growl of anger but several moved back a step jago led the way through the silent crowd their eyes were sullen and many fists were still clenched tight no one moved any farther to let them pass and pitt actually brushed two of them as he went outside the air was colder and smelled of horse manure and drains but pitt gulped it as if it had been as sweet as the bright clean wind off the sea thank you he said shakily i i didnt realize the feeling was so deep or so bad theres always someone to take advantage of trouble jago replied striding out along the street back towards st marys church political opportunists or simply people full of hate and failure who need to blame someone for it you were a natural target you were a little naive not to have seen it pitt said nothing jago was right they walked side by side rapidly pitt had come because he could not rid himself of the painful suspicion that jago was the link between finlay fitzjames and whitechapel between the past and the present he was the only person who unarguably knew both ada and finlay he probably knew nora gough as well pitt hated the thought he hated even more having to broach the subject to jago who had just rescued him possibly at some risk to himself pitt drew breath and was about to ask when jago stopped abruptly they had gone up mansell street and were at the corner of the whitechapel road the traffic was heavy mostly commercial ive got to go and call on a woman whose husband was drowned last week jago said as clearly as he could above the rattle of wheels and clatter of hooves id be careful around here superintendent dont wait in any place too long if you have to question a crowd take some constables with you i presume you are no further the rest of what he said was drowned out by a passing dray no pitt replied when it had gone not much jago gave him a quick brilliant smile of sympathy then set out across the street dodging between the traffic and disappeared pitt went to find lennox it was just possible there was some fact he might have noticed that he had omitted to mention some strand of difference even something he might know about the nature of a man who would do such a thing to another human being he found him in a makeshift shelter of halfrotted timber crates by the river stairs he was treating an old man whose bent body shook with delirium although whether from fever or the effects of raw alcohol pitt did not know apparently lennox did not care he spoke to the man gently easing him up in his makeshift bed straightening out the rumpled blankets he fetched him water and produced from his own pocket half a loaf of bread which the man took bit into then chewed very slowly barely able to swallow pitt waited until he had finished and then as he left walked with him across the alley to the broader street every now and then the afternoon sun was overcast by clouds driving up from the east over the river how can i help you superintendent lennox asked curiously he still looked strained but there was less tension in his body than the last time pitt had seen him and less tiredness in his face im achieving nothing with this case pitt answered frankly you examined both bodies were there any differences at all in the way in which they were treated lennox kept on walking his eyes straight ahead no nothing at all pitt persisted i know the stockings used to strangle both women were their own and tied in the same way but then there are only a number of ways you tie a noose to strangle someone what about the fingers and toes were they the same ones broken or dislocated yes lennoxs face was hard and tight as if he were still feeling in his own mind the pain it must have inflicted the corners of his mouth were white there was a tiny muscle ticking in his temple exactly the same pitt pressed yes exactly if you are trying to say it was two different men committed the murders then i am afraid i cant help you i know costigan is hanged and im sorry i wish i could comfort you but i cant he was dogged head forward eyes almost blind so absorbed was he by his emotions he nearly stepped off the footpath into the road only pitts hand jerking his arm prevented him a hansom swept by the rush of air causing his hair to blow back off his brow what about fingernails pitt said after lennox had composed himself but not spoken the roadway was clear and they set off together matching step for step until they reached the far side fingernails lennox asked yes one of adas was torn where she tried to get the stocking off her neck she fought but only for a few moments nora had small bruises and blood in one nail she was a much smaller woman very light yet she seems to have fought for longer is that a question lennox asked skirting around a pile of refuse on the pavement yes pitt went around the other side of it why was nora able to fight longer thats a difference i dont know lennox looked puzzled a furrow across his brow maybe he took ada by surprise some people do fight harder than others no idea why same with illness some people succumb die of things you think they should have recovered from quite easily others cling onto life and survive illnesses or injuries which should have killed them would have killed anyone else its to do with will not physical size or strength pitt was waiting for him to go on but he did not but the medical evidence suggests to you that it is the same person who killed them both pitt said after a minute or two lennox stopped and turned to face him his eyes were shadowed confusion and pain in them his mouth pinched with memory i dont know superintendent all i know is what i see it is your job to deduce guilt or innocence i cant help you any more if i could and i could point to someone and say that is the man i would surely to god you know that i have seen two young women tortured subjected to humiliation and terror and pain and then killed his voice caught in his throat and for a moment he lost control of himself the emotion within him was so violent he gasped for breath swallowing trying to regain at least mastery of his face pitt put out his hand and took the younger mans arm he felt the muscles in spasm beneath the cloth of his jacket its all right he said quietly im sorry i shouldnt have pushed you for more of course its the same person i i cant bring costigan back and i dont seem able to find who it is that really did it im getting desperate lennox drew in his breath as if to speak then stared at pitt in utter misery im sorry dr lennox pitt apologized ive waited too long to face something i dread but its time i did thank you for your time im sorry to have taken you away from your patients he let go of him and turned on his heel walking back towards the whitechapel road and st marys church it was time to confront jago jones actually he found jago in coke street as he had before handing out mugs of hot soup to the hungry and the homeless only this time he was helped by a tired and smutsmeared woman pitt barely recognizedtallulah fitzjames he stopped close to them and watched without attempting to draw their attention tallulah looked utterly different from the blithe and brittle woman he had seen in devonshire street were it not for the individuality of her face he would never have known her she was absorbed in what she was doing although every now and again he saw a fleeting look of revulsion come over her face and her effort to wipe it away as she reapplied herself to the work of helping lifting spooning out there was a bay of used clothes in which every now and then she searched found something and took it out passing it to eager hands for one grimy child with a runny nose she took a little extra trouble searching through the drab clothes until she discovered something bright cheerful with a pattern of red on it there you are she said with a smile she was too tactful to mention its warmth as well youll look really pretty in that the child swallowed and sniffed she had never even thought of being pretty before it was a dream something only for other people take it tallulah urged its yours the mother looked up speechless the child had no words her eyes widened she looked up at tallulah then took a step towards her and another then she threw her arms around her for an instant tallulah froze her whole body stiff with an instinctive revulsion then she made an effort of will which was there in her face only an instant then gone again she smiled and bent down putting her own arms around the child in response then the moment was gone and she moved on to the next person in line but a softness remained in her face as if her wide eyes still saw something precious the people in the line moved by slowly one by one men were resentful hating to take charity women gauntfaced holding grubby children had no such pride to them the cold and hunger of a child was sharper than any diminution of status or confession of need when the last mug had been filled and jago and tallulah were left alone with the cart pitt went over to them tallulah was picking up the nowempty sack from which the clothes had been taken he wondered if perhaps she had brought it herself a material contribution as well as her labor jago walked over and greeted him civilly enough but his eyes were wary and tired tallulah was some yards away still tidying up what can we do for you superintendent i dont know anything more than i did last time we spoke did you know nora gough pitt asked quietly i didnt have the chance to ask you then jago smiled in spite of himself no you didnt did you yes i knew her slightly a pretty girl very young very confident i think she might well have been one of those who go on to marry and become quite respectable it happens you know he looked at pitt to see if he believed it yes i know it does pitt agreed ive seen it a few times jago sighed of course you have im sorry i didnt mean to patronize you any reason you say that about nora not directly just an impression she may have said something why do you think it has any relation to her being killed im looking for anything at all a handkerchief with finlays initials on it was found under her pillow jago cleared his throat sharply his face suddenly very pale you cant think he let out a long sigh what do you want of me superintendent i know nothing about who killed either woman i i find it hard to believe it was finlay and i would regret it more profoundly than you could know if it were he did not look at tallulah it did not seem at that instant as if her pain was what was uppermost in his mind a man resembling finlay was the last customer to be seen leaving noras room pitt went on watching jagos face and you think it was finlay jago asked cant you trace this man someone else must have seen him after he left myrdle street where did he go there are all sorts of people around at that time of the afternoon why on earth would finlay come to whitechapel at that hour it doesnt make sense i assume he cant prove where he was or you wouldnt be here asking me this he kept his voice low so tallulah who was almost finished would not hear him no he cant pitt agreed and no one saw this man after he left the house in myrdle street who have you asked jago screwed up his face in concentration pitt listed off all the names he could remember of the neighbors he and ewart had spoken to where were you reverend he said at the end jago laughed abruptly playing shove halfpenny with half a dozen urchins in chicksand street then i went back to the vicarage for tea to meet with some charitably minded ladies i didnt go anywhere near myrdle street and i certainly didnt see finlay or whoever it was no one saw him leave pitt shrugged which doesnt seem possible is everyone lying no jago seemed certain if no one saw him then either youve described him so inaccurately they dont recognize him from what you say or he didnt leave pitt stared at him perhaps that was true perhaps whoever it was had not left at all but gone up or down the stairs and remained on one of the other floors of the tenement or else he had changed his appearance so much he no longer seemed a young man with fair wavy hair and good clothes thank you he said slowly at least i know where to try again be careful jago warned remember to take a constable with you the mood is still ugly no one liked costigan when he was alive but hes a convenient hero now anger and despair run deep and there are always men who are willing to use it make some poor stupid beggar stick the police for them take the blame and leave them to reap the political reward i know pitt was eager to start dont worry i shall be careful i dont want to be responsible for a riot as well as a hanging and without waiting any longer he started out towards the whitechapel police station and a constable to accompany him back to myrdle street the day after pitt had his unfortunate experience in the public house in swan street charlotte also went to the east end but not before she had first visited emily and then together they had gone to see tallulah we know it was not finlay emily said decisively sitting in tallulahs bay window overlooking the autumn garden and unfortunately we also know it was not albert costigan for all our various reasons we need to know who it was we must set about it systematically i dont see what we can possibly do that the police havent tallulah said hopelessly they have questioned everyone i know that from jago they have even questioned him it was obvious from her face that the idea of jagos guilt had not entered her mind her conviction of his goodness was so total that anything but the smallest fallibility was impossible charlotte carefully avoided emilys eyes the same ugly thought had occurred to both of them and they had both pushed it aside but it would not disappear we must apply logic emily continued looking at tallulah why would you kill anyone tallulah was startled what why would you kill anyone emily repeated if you were on the streets living from day to day make that leap in imagination what would drive you to do something so extreme so messy and so dangerous as to kill someone if i killed anyone it would be on the spur of temper tallulah said thoughtfully i couldnt imagine planning it unless it were someone i was afraid of and i wasnt strong enough to do it otherwise but that doesnt apply here does it so you might if you were afraid of someone emily clarified why else what would make you lose your temper enough to kill anyone maybe if they mocked me tallulah said slowly i might hit them and perhaps it would be too hard no one likes being made fun of not if it is something they are very sensitive about enough to kill emily pressed tallulah bit her lip not really perhaps if i had a very short temper indeed ive seen some men get very angry if their honor is questioned or perhaps their wife or mother insulted enough to lash out yes charlotte agreed but enough to break someones fingers and toes first and then strangle her tallulah stared at her the blood draining out of her face leaving it chalkwhite she moved her mouth as if to speak but made no sound with a violent jolt of guilt and anger with herself she realized that of course tallulah would not read newspapers no one would have told her how the women died she might have assumed it was just strangling something quick a few moments struggle for breath and then oblivion and now she was in a sentence hurled into the reality im sorry charlotte said quietly i forgot you didnt know that i shouldnt have said it tallulah swallowed hard why not her voice cracked why should you shelter me from the truth that is the truth is it they were tortured yes why why on earth would anyone do such a thing was it both of them her eyes implored charlotte to say it was not yes i am afraid it was thats horrible tallulah shivered and seemed to shrink into herself as if the bright warm room with its charming florals and dainty chairs were cold in spite of the sunlight through the windows and the low fire in the grate there were other things as wellemily glanced at charlotte warninglywhich seem to suggest it was the sort of crime that has to do with she hesitated seeking a way to describe what she meant without further distressing tallulah who was not a married woman and was assumed to be still ignorant of many aspects of life relations between men and women she finished what things tallulah asked her voice husky emily looked unhappy silly things people sometimes have odd fancies some people she stopped and looked at charlotte charlotte took a deep breath all sorts of relationships are odd she said quietly sometimes people like to say hurtful things to each other or establish a dominance you must have seen it well between a man and woman these things are sometimes sharper and take a physical form of course most people are not like that but it looks as if whoever did this was i see tallulah made a brave effort to look unshaken so that means it was someone with a very strong cruel streak and a man who had a a physical relationship with her she laughed a little jerkily although since that was her trade it is hardly surprising but why should he actually kill her i dont know emily replied could she have threatened him in any way how tallulah was confused she was far weaker than he she must have been blackmail emily suggested two of them charlotte was highly skeptical blackmail over what because he visited a prostitute we dont speak of it openly but we know that men do if they didnt then there wouldnt be any prostitutes we know it happens emily corrected her to someone else what about if it is your husband what if he has some of these unusual appetites if he were important enough it could ruin him lets say he had a very fortunate marriage in view or already achieved and was dependent upon the goodwill of his fatherinlaw for more preferment or he needs a son and heir and his wife is unlikely to give him one if she knows of his behavior good charlotte agreed that makes sense why both ada and nora and why torture them why not simply kill them and get out as soon as possible the longer hes there the more risk he runs of being discovered is the torture part of what he does anyway no it cant be no prostitute is going to have her fingers and toes broken whatever you pay her tied up doused in cold water perhaps but not injured tallulah was still very pale and she sat hunched in her pretty chair proof she said thoughtfully she had proof of his behavior and he tortured her to try to make her give it to him but she didnt because she had given it to nora for safekeeping charlotte finished what sort of proof emily pressed but her voice was rising in eagerness at last there was something which made at least a little sense pictures letters a statement from a witness what else statement from a witness charlotte answered paintings wouldnt mean anything theyre not evidence no one would take photographs of such a thing i mean how could you you have to sit still for ages for photographs and who writes letters to prostitutes it would have to be something to do with a witness maybe it happened before perhaps there are lots of women who know and she had statements from all of them then where are they now tallulah looked from one to the other does he have them or did nora hide them too well from him what we have to do charlotte said decisively sitting more uprightly is to learn all we can about nora and ada thats where the answer is first we need to have proof they even knew each other we need to find everything in common in their lives and then see if we can find any other women who knew this man they would give us a proper description of him they might even know his name marvelous tallulah stood up well begin straightaway jago will help us he knew ada mckinley hell know where we can start and he might even help us to gain peoples trust so they will talk to us i emily looked at charlotte uncertain how to say what she needed to without hurting irreparably what tallulah demanded charlottes mind raced dont you think that would be rather an unfair way to do it she said making it up as she went along unfair tallulah was confused to whom the women were looking for a man who murdered two of them what has fairness to do with it not to the women to jago charlottes brain cleared he is their priest he shouldnt compromise his work with the people by being seen to help us after all he has to stay there as their friend long after weve gone she could only think of the hideous possibility that it was jago himself who had killed the women who was more vulnerable to blackmail than a priest with a taste for prostitutes he could be the one sort of man whose image would not survive the accusation that he had slept with a street woman or even more than one his work would be finished not only in whitechapel but in the church anywhere oh tallulah relaxed yes i suppose so we had better go alone we can find it easily enough id rather we went in the daytime she flushed uncomfortably in the evening of course emily agreed quickly it will all be sufficiently unpleasant and difficult without our being considered as rivals tallulah giggled nervously but it was agreed they would meet in the early afternoon proceed by hansom to old montague street and begin their enquiriessuitably attired of course it was not easy to obtain entrance to the house in pentecost alley madge answered the door and remembered them clearly from their earlier visit they were similarly dressed wot jer want this time she said eyeing them narrowly through the space between the door and its frame she looked at charlotte an oo are you the parlor maid she regarded her handsome figure you look more like a parlor maid ter me all got thrown out did jer well it int no good comin ere i cant take yer in ony got room for one and thatll be expensive works on yer earnins though we gotta ave rent even if yer dont earn nuffink which one of yer wants it well come in and have a look charlotte said immediately thank you madge looked at her suspiciously why does a girl wot speaks proper like you wanna work the streets round ere for wy dont yer work up west were you could make some real money i might charlotte agreed lets look at this room first please madge opened the door and let them in they followed her along the corridor which was faintly musty smelling as if lived in too much with windows that were never opened she pushed the second door along and it swung wide charlotte was in front she peered in and instantly wished she had not it was so ordinary about the same size as her own bedroom in the house where she had grown up it was far less pretty but it had a livedin air it was too easy to imagine the woman who had slept here and conducted her business here and died here in fearful pain she heard tallulah behind her draw in her breath sharply and beside her emilys body stiffened though she made no sound djer wan it madge asked bluntly her voice harsh charlotte swung around and saw the huge womans face tight red and chapped her eyes brimming with tears lets sit down and talk about it emily suggested have a cup of tea i brought a little something to add to it youve got to let the room sometime without speaking madge led them to the back of the house and the kitchen the room was messy designed for laundry as well as cooking a black stove gave off a very slight warmth its front dull and a fine ash coating the floor around it the kettle was already on steaming gently perhaps it always was there were dirty mugs on the board next to the basin and two pails of water standing with lids on charlotte guessed the water had to be fetched from the nearest well or standpipe she hoped they boiled it thoroughly before it was offered for tea she wished emily had not suggested it but then perhaps they would have no other chance to talk and what was a possible upset stomach compared with the disaster that faced pitt if the crime was never solved he would always be thought of as the man who hanged costigan when he was innocent perhaps worse than that he would think of himself that way he would doubt his judgment be awake at night and tear his conscience and there would be those who would believe he had done it knowingly in order to protect someone else someone with the money or the influence to reward him appropriately he would be suspected of far more than a mere error errors could be forgiven they were a human failing corruption was something far deeper it was the ultimate betrayal that of self the tea was strong and bitter and there was no milk they all sat around the table on uneven chairs emily produced a small flask of whiskey out of her voluminous pocket and put a generous dash in each mug to tallulahs amazement although she concealed it almost instantly heres to your health emily said optimistically and lifted her mug heres to all our health charlotte echoed more as a prayer than a toast whats the area like emily asked with interest sall right madge replied taking a good swig of her scalding tea and sucking her teeth appreciatively thats very civil of you she added nodding her head towards the whiskey bottle can make a fair livin if yer prepared ter work for it ada did well didnt she emily continued she was bright an good at it madge agreed taking another slurp hope they catch that bastard who killed her emily said fiercely madge breathed out a long sigh and poor nora charlotte put in with a shiver did you know nora did you madge asked looking at her narrowly no what was she like pretty little sort o skinny for some tastes considering madges twenty stone that remark was open to personal interpretation charlotte felt a momentary desire to giggle and controlled it only with an effort but good at it she asked hiccuping oh yes madge agreed though some says as she were gonner quit and get married do you think thats true tallulah spoke for the first time her voice hesitant high in the back of her throat mebbe madge stopped saw er around wi johnny voss e werent bad orff could a married er i spose although e were said ter be keen on ella baker over in myrdle street mebbe e switched ter nora edie said she seen nora kiss im goodnight abaht a couple a weeks ago ive kissed people goodnight tallulah said in response that didnt mean they were going to marry me did you now madge looked at her more closely ow long yer bin in the trade duck yer wanna watch yerself this int no place for beginners im im not a beginner tallulah said defensively then stopped with a little squeak of pain as emily kicked her under the table if yer kissin people yare madge stated it as an unarguable fact kissin is fer family people as yer care abaht customers get wot they paid fer nothin more yer gotta keep summink as is real summink as is yer own an cant be bought tallulah stared at her two bright specks of color in her cheeks yer need someone ter look aht fer yer teach yer ow ter beave madge said gently take the room an ill teach yer tallulah was speechless the thoughts racing through her mind could only be guessed at thank you charlotte said quickly thats very kind of you that might be a very good idea we could always look elsewhere there must be other places in the neighborhood i suppose poor noras room is to let now i int eard madge replied but yer could ask if its gorn yer could go an ask ma baines over on chicksand street shes usually got summink free int the best but yer could take it and then wen summink better comes up yerd be placed ter move on like she int bin ere all that long but i eard say she int bad gotta get all yer own clothes got yer own ave yer mmy own clothes tallulah stammered yeah lor you are the beginner int yer madge shook her head still yer int got a bad face nice air well make summink of yer yet she patted her on the hand comfortingly then she looked at charlotte and emily in turn you two can look arter yerselves she regarded charlotte you got a bit o flesh on yer yerll do an lots o air yer face int bad thank you charlotte said a trifle dryly madge was impervious to sarcasm she looked emily up and down yer not so good bit thin but yer got a nice enough face nice skin an men always like yeller air specially wot curls like yours do look like yer got a bit o spark too youll do can you tell us where to find this ma baines emily ignored the personal assessment and returned to the point yeah course i can madge responded twentyone chicksand street next one up towards mile end anyone will tell yer it looked as if they were about to be dismissed any moment and they had learned too little to give up ada and nora knew each other charlotte plunged on were they at all alike did they have friends in common madge blinked wy the ell der you care because i dont want to get my fingers and toes broken and end up strangled with my own stockings charlotte answered tersely if theres some lunatic around here i want to know what sort of women he picks on so i can be a different sort e picks on one sort o woman duck madge said wearily the sort o woman wot sells theirselves to any man wot as the money cos she needs ter eat an feed er kids or cos she don wanna work in the watch factories an end up wi phossie jaw an er face alf rotted off or in a sweatshop stitchin shirts all day an alf the night for too little money ter feed a rat layin on yer back is easy money while it lasts she poured more tea from the pot into the mug and refilled the others looking hopefully at emily emily topped them up again with whiskey ta madge acknowledged it course there is danger she went on if yer wanted life wiout danger yer should a bin born rich yerll mebbe end up wi a disease or mebbe not yerll get beaten now an agin slashed if yer luck runs aht yerll get so yer never wants ter see another man in all yer born days she sniffed but yerll not be ungry and yerll not be cold once yer orff the streets an inside an yerll ave a few good laughs she sighed and sipped her tea ad some good times we did nora an rosie and ada and me tol each other stories an pretended we was all fine ladies she sniffed i member one summer evenin we took orff an went up the river in one o them pleasure boats just like anyone all dressed up we was ate ot eel pies and sugared fruit an drank peppermint that must have been good charlotte said quietly imagining them even though she did not know their faces yeah it were madge said dreamily the tears brimming her eyes an we tol each other ghost stories sometimes scared ourselves silly we did course there was the bad times too but then i spose its them ard times as tells yer oo yer friends is she sniffed again and wiped her hand over her cheeks thats true emily agreed im sorry about ada i hope they catch whoever did it geez why should they madge said miserably they never caught the ripper why should they catch this one tallulah shivered two years afterwards his name still chilled the body and sent the mind stiff with fear charlotte found herself cold as well even with the tea and whiskey inside her and the heat of the small closed kitchen there was no other sound in the house all the women were sleeping after their nights work bodies exhausted used by strangers to relieve their needs without love without kisses as one might use a public convenience she looked at tallulah and saw a whole new comprehension dawning in her face she had seen one new world with jago feeding the poor the respectable women downtrodden by hunger cold and anxiety this was another world altogether darker with different pains different fears do you get many gentlemen down here she asked suddenly the words coming out jerkily as if speaking them hurt her men wi money madge laughed look duck any mans money is as good as any other but do you tallulah insisted her face tense her eyes on madges not often why yer like gentlemen yer should go up west aymarket piccadilly that way cost yer ter rent rooms by the hour though an competitions igh yerd be better ere beginners like you are ill look after yer tallulah was aware of the gentleness in the older woman and it touched her unexpectedly charlotte could see it in her face i i just wondered she said unhappily looking down at the table sometimes madge replied watching her was it a gentleman who killed ada tallulah would not give up her slender fingers were clenched around the cup with its dark tea and odor of whiskey i dunno madge shrugged her huge shoulders i thought as it were bert costigan but i spose it couldnt a bin now nora got done the same so it could have been a gentleman emily looked from one to the other of them but would it be likely wouldnt it maybe be someone who knew them both maybe it was a gentleman who knew them both charlotte took it a step further one who was a bit bent in his ways madge finished the last of her tea and set the mug down with a bang on the hard tabletop dont you go startin talk like that round ere she said sharply pointing her finger yerll only get everyone all scared witless an it dont do no good we all gotta work whether theres a lunatic out there er not yer go see ma baines she knows er job shell find yer a place an dont yer go makin a noise as you leave my girls is still sleepin like yerd be if youd worked all night she looked at emily ta fer the drink that were nice manners of you her face softened as she looked lastly at tallulah ill old the room for yer till termorrer duck cant old it arter that if i gets an offer thank you tallulah answered but as soon as they were outside beyond the alley she shivered violently and walked so close to emily she almost pushed her off the narrow footpath into the street they followed directions up to chicksand street and found the huge shambling tenement where ma baines kept her establishment they had expected someone else like madgeobese redfaced suspicious instead they found a cheerful woman with a large bosom but narrow hips and long legs she had rather a plain face and a mass of fading yellow hair tied up loosely in pins which were in imminent danger of falling out yeah she said when she saw the three young women we understand you might have rooms charlotte began without hesitation it was getting towards the time in the afternoon when women began to work this is a workin ouse ma baines said warningly rent is igh i got no place fer sweatshop girls int even enough fer a night let alone a week we know that charlotte replied making herself smile do we look like seamstresses ma baines laughed a sound of generous amusement without bitterness you look like west end tarts ter me cept fer yer dress they look like maids on their day orff terrible respectable an abaht as darin as a vicars wife were off duty emily explained arent never orff duty luv ma baines responded are if you havent a room charlotte pointed out i dont do my business in the street ma baines stepped back then yerd better come in they followed her the place was narrow and stalesmelling but quite clean and there was an old carpet on the floor making their footsteps quiet as they were led to a small sitting room at the back of the house again reminding charlotte ridiculously of the housekeepers room in the house where she had grown up ma baines invited them to sit and she herself took the largest and most comfortable chair it was as if she were interviewing prospective servants charlotte felt the desire to giggle coming back a sort of wild hysteria at the insanity of it a few years ago her mother would have fainted at the very thought of her daughters even knowing about such a place let alone being there now she might conceivably understand her father would simply have refused to believe it heaven only knew what aloysia fitzjames would think if she knew tallulah was here ma baines was talking about rent and rules and charlotte had not been listening she tried to look as if she were paying attention fixing her eyes on mas face that sounds all right emily said dubiously although were not absolutely sure about the area cost yer more up west ma pointed out yer can always go up west from ere long as yer bring back yer share o yer take an don cheat her face was still pleasant but there was a relentless icegray in her eyes cold as a winter sea it wasnt that charlotte explained it was the murders youve had here wed want a place where if we got a bad customer there we could be sure there were other people about to hear us yell she did not add that she knew there were other people close enough to have helped ada and nora but no scream was heard and no one came dont make no difference were yer are ma said with a bitter laugh theres lunatics everywhere all depends on luck but thereve been two pretty horrible murders here in whitechapel tallulah said staring at ma baines her voice low and shivery that hasnt happened anywhere else course it as ma said abruptly were one just like these wen i were in mile end six year ago mebbe seven what do you mean just like these charlottes voice came out huskily as if she had something in her throat jus the same ma repeated ands tied fingers and toes broke or pulled out o joint garter round er arm an soaked in cold water all over the place ead shoulders air tallulah gasped as if she had been struck emily turned and stared at charlotte for seconds there was icy pricking silence the floorboards creaked overhead as someone walked across them on the story above who did it charlotte forced the words out at last between frozen lips ma shrugged gawd knows e werent never found rozzers stopped lookin arter a while jus like they will this time wen they don find no one what what kind of a girl was she emily asked her voice also hoarse ma shook her head dunno er name forget it jus young though a beginner probably er first week or so poor little thing pretty bout sixteen or seventeen so they said her face pinched with momentary pity funny but they never made that much fuss about it papers dint write it up too much o course that were before the ripper an all still theyre sure as ell burns takin it out on the rozzers this time wouldnt wanna be one o them now she lifted one broad shoulder but then oo wants ter be a rozzer anyway she looked at emily dyer want the rooms or not luv i int got time ter sit an talk wif yer no thank you charlotte answered for them not at the moment well think a bit harder maybe its not what were looking for right now and she rose to her feet steadying herself on the arm of the chair a moment her knees were wobbling she made her way back along the corridor and out into chicksand street with emily at her elbow and tallulah moving as if in a dream a pace behind the cold air hit her face like a slap and she barely noticed it pitt had slept badly the previous night it seemed as if half the night he lay motionless in bed afraid to move in case he woke charlotte when she was troubled she slept lightly when one of the children was ill the slightest noise reached her and she sat up almost immediately since the second murder she had been aware of his nightmares and of the fact that he could not rest even if he turned over too frequently she would be disturbed and waken he lay in the dark eyes wide open watching the faint pattern on the ceiling from the distant gas lamps in the street through the bedroom curtains if he slept he dreamed of costigans despairing face his selfloathing and his fear why had he all but admitted killing ada if he did not were his wordsi done erintended only to mean that in some way he felt responsible for her behavior and thus for her death but only indirectly he had confessed to a quarrel to striking out at her was it possible he had knocked her insensible but not actually been the one to kill her he had always denied the cruelty the fingers and toes he had even denied the garter which was hardly an offense and the water why if it was true it could hardly make any difference he would be hanged exactly the same either way and since the wardens believed it of him it would not mitigate their treatment of him either certainly he could not have been guilty of killing nora gough who was the fairhaired man who had been seen going into noras room shortly before she was killed how could he possibly have left without any one of the dozen or so people around having seen him jago joness words swirled around in his head surely they had to be the answer either when he left he had looked so different no one had recognized him as the same man or else simpler still he had not left was the fair wavy hair a wig had he actually left with a different coat on and different hair then what had happened to the coat did he carry it and the wig his own hair could be any color or texture at all pitt needed to go back and question all the people again to see if they remembered anyone at all leaving who could have been disguised with a wig how could they know that you can carry a wig in a pocket then they would have to have a pocket a trouser pocket would be too small it would make a bulge perhaps they might remember the coat not many people in myrdle street had fulllength overcoats let alone wellcut ones what about the other possibility that he had not left at all but had gone to another floor in the same building he had not thought of looking upwards to the women on the floor above they may have continued doing business with whoever was already in the building the police presence on the floor below would deter new custom but those already there might well fill in their time pleasantly they could not leave until the police had gone from the very natural desire not to be identified that would need no further explanation when he went back to myrdle street tomorrow he must also question all the women on the floor above to get descriptions of all their clients of the night he should have done it at the time that was a bad oversight he lay staring up at the darkness charlotte was breathing evenly beside him he listened and there was no variation in the soft sound she was deeply asleep or else lying there also pretending to be and not wanting to disturb him let him know that she too was sleepless and worried and frightened cornwallis would back him but he might not be able to save his job if costigan were pardoned or even if he were not and perhaps he should not be able to if pitt had caused an innocent man to be hanged perhaps he should lose his job maybe he was not man enough to fill micah drummonds position anyway he was promoted beyond his ability farnsworth would have smiled at that he never thought pitt was ready for command not the right background or breeding vespasia would be hurt she had always had confidence in him she would be let down she would never say so but she would not be able to help feeling it most of all he would have let charlotte down she would not say anything either and in a way that would almost make it worse he drifted into uneasy sleep and woke again with a start what if it was jago jones after all with a fair wig on he was laughing at pitt making the suggestion himself because he was so sure pitt could never piece it together or even if he did he could not prove it it was nearly morning he was stiff longing to stretch and turn even to get up and pace the floor to help him to think but if he woke charlotte now she would not get back to sleep again this would be selfish unnecessary he lay still until six oclock and unintentionally went back to sleep he woke with a start at half past seven with charlotte touching him gently shaking him a little it was half past nine before he was back in myrdle street and highly unwelcome as usual the women were in bed after a long night and no one wanted to talk to a policeman and answer questions they had already answered several times he started on the floor above disturbing the residents one by one and having to wait while they roused themselves threw a little water on their faces to startle themselves awake and then put on a robe or a shawl and stumbled through to the kitchen where pitt sat with the kettle on topping up the teapot regularly and asking endless patient questions no i dont ave no customer wif fair wavy air no e were bald like a bleedin egg no even is muvver wouldnt a said he were young geez she must a bin dead since noah landed is ark es fifty if es a day no e were gray could he have looked fair in the gaslight mebbe but not wavy straight as stair rods and so it went on he questioned every woman meticulously but no one had seen any man who could have answered the description edie had given of noras last customer he went back down again and found edie herself by now almost ready to consider getting up in the normal course of her day it was three oclock in the afternoon describe him again he said wearily look mister i dint even see is face just is back as e went in she said in exasperation i dint take no notice e were jus anuvver customer i dint know e were gonna kill er let alone she stopped and shuddered her fat body tight under her robe i know just close your eyes and bring back what you saw however briefly take a moment or two you saw the man who killed her edie he spoke gently trying not to frighten her he needed her to clear her mind so she could concentrate describe exactly what you saw you may be the only way we shall catch him he tried to keep the desperation out of his voice she caught it in spite of his effort i know she whispered i know im the only one wot saw im ceptin them wot e killed she stopped leaning over the kitchen table her fat elbows resting on it pulling her robe tight her black hair over her shoulders her eyes closed pitt waited e were quite tall like she said at last not eavyin fact e looked sort o well not thickset i reckon as i thought e were young jus the way e stood she opened her eyes and looked at pitt but i could be wrong thas just wot i felt good go on he encouraged describe his coat the back of his head whatever else you saw tell me exactly what was his hair like how was it cut was it long or short did he have sidewhiskers did you see she closed her eyes obediently is coat were sort o graygreen the collar were were turned up igh over the bottom of is air so i reckon is air must a bin quite longish i couldnt see the ends of it couldve bin cut anyow come ter that couldve gorn all down is back she gave an abrupt jerking laugh an i dint see no sidewhiskers reckon e dint turn is ead enough beautiful air e ad though wouldnt mind air like that meself makes me think o ella baker wot lives up the street she got gorgeous air just like that she opened her eyes and looked at pitt again mebbe she as a bruvver she said jokingly an mebbe es a lunatic an all pitt stared at her she int got a bruvver she said in amazement yer cant think as i don mean then she stopped her eyes widening with a slow terrible horror what pitt demanded what is it what do you know edie she an nora did fall out summink awful over johnny voss why whos johnny voss is that the man nora was going to marry yeah ony e were goin ter marry ella first at least she thought e were actuali thought e were too then nora come along an e fancied er instead an she made the most of it well yer would wouldnt yer oo wouldnt sooner be married ter a decent sort o bloke than make yer way like this she barely looked around her but her gestures drew in the whole shabby shared room the tenement its occupants and their lives yes pitt agreed there was no need for more words than that thank you edie he left the kitchen and went back to the room in which nora had died it was still as she had left it bed unmade sheets rumpled only the pillows were in the center where he had tossed them after finding the handkerchief he stood in the center of the floor for several moments wondering what he was looking for where even to begin the bed the floor around it he bent down and began with the floor peering for anything at all that would bear out his theory there would be nothing here to prove it only small things that might help there was nothing he stood up and threw the bedcovers aside running his hands gently very slowly over the sheets he found it on the top sheet first one then another then severalgolden fair hairs very long sixteen or eighteen inches and wavy hair that would never come from a mans head and far too fair for nora gough ella baker with her hair tucked under her high coat collar a coat borrowed from a client or a friend and a pair of mens trousers perhaps over her own skirts tucked up just under the coats length she would let the skirts down as she left undo her hair and she would be invisible it would explain why this had been more of a fight she was taller and stronger than nora much heavier but still far short of the strength of a man but why on earth would she have killed ada mckinley and what was her grudge against fitzjames that could be anything a slight an abuse in the past an injury not necessarily to her but to someone she loved even a child lost perhaps she had been employed by the fitzjames family at some point in the past that was an aspect he had never considered he should have a servant abused and dismissed would have a bitter grudge when he heard about the butler who had got ada pregnant he should have looked at all the servants the fitzjameses had ever had young fitzjames would not be above seducing a handsome parlor maid and then having his father put her out in the street it all looked obvious now he left the house rapidly and walked down old montague street and along osborn street where he found binns on his beat then they went the few hundred yards distance to the tenement where he knew ella baker lived he remembered ewart had questioned her before about the possibility of her having seen the man leave or of even having seen finlay fitzjames ewart had said she was distressed then obviously under pressure of extreme emotion he had supposed it to be the natural terror and pity they all felt knowing there had been another murder and the shock and dismay that costigan should have been hanged for a crime it now looked impossible for him to have committed and yet she had allowed him to be hanged that was a double guilt that must have torn at her he banged on the door until the pimp who also lived on the premises came and opened it he was unshaved and smelled of stale beer what yer want he said abruptly looking at pitt and not seeing binns behind him yer too early geez cant yer wait till evenin yer bastard binns moved forward police pitt said curtly i wish to talk to ella baker now the man looked at pitts face and binnss bulky form and decided against arguing he allowed them in sullenly and led them to ellas door he knocked on it and shouted her name after a moment or two she came she was a handsome woman in a big cleancut way her features were strong a trifle coarse her glory was her hair thick waving the color of ripe wheat dark dull gold it hung around her shoulders and down her back thank you pitt dismissed the pimp who went off sullenly grumbling to himself pitt went inside the room and closed the door leaving binns standing outside it the windows were small and two stories up what you want this time ella asked staring at him her brow furrowed i can understand your killing nora he said levelly she took johnny voss from you and your one chance of marrying and getting out of here but why ada mckinley what did she do to you all the blood drained from her face she swayed and for several moments he thought she was going to faint but he did not move to help her he had been caught that way before and had someone turn in an instant to a clawing scratching fury he remained where he was his back to the door i she gasped choking on the sudden dryness of her own throat i i never touched ada swear ter gawd but you killed nora she said nothing if i were to pull away that high neck of your dress id see where she scratched you trying to fight you off fighting for her life no i never she denied glaring at him you cant prove i did yes i can ella he said calmly you were seen oo seen me she demanded theyre a liar you stole a mans coat a good one wellcut and hitched your dress up so your skirts wouldnt be seen you had your hair under the coat you looked like a man but your hair was recognized not many people have hair like yours ella beautiful long gold hair he watched her white face i found strands of it in noras bed where you struggled and she pulled some of it out fighting for her life stop it she shouted yeah i killed the greedy little cow she took my man did it deliberate she knew ow i felt abaht im an she still did it proud of erself she were gloated tol me as she would move up ter mile end an ave a nice ouse all to erself an ave kids an never ave ter be touched by another drunken layabaht or sleazy sod cheatin on is wife again so you tied her up broke her fingers and toes and then strangled her pitt said with loathing her face was pasty white but her eyes blazed no i bleedin didnt i ad a row wif er an i it er we fought an i eld er by the throat yeah i strangled er but i never touched er fingers an toes i dunno oo did that an i dunno why pitt did not believe her he could not yet his instincts were hard and bright that she was not lying why did you kill ada he repeated i dint she shouted back at him i dint kill ada i never even knowd er i thought it were bert costigan jus like you did if it werent im i dunno oo it were he remembered with a sickening jolt costigans denials that he had broken adas fingers and toes his indignation and confusion that he should even be accused his eyes looked just like hers frightened indignant utterly bewildered but you killed nora he repeated he meant to sound certain of it it was not a question it was a charge yeah i spose there int no use denyin it now but i never broke er fingers an i never touched ada i never even bin there pitt had no idea whether he believed her or not looking at her hearing her voice he felt sure she spoke the truth but his brain said it was ridiculous she was admitting killing nora why deny killing ada the punishment would be no worse and no one would believe her anyway i never killed ada she said loudly i never did them things to nora neither why did you try to implicate finlay fitzjames he asked she looked nonplussed oo finlay fitzjames he repeated why did you put his handkerchief and button in noras room i dunno wotjer talkin abaht she looked totally bewildered i never eard of im oo is e didnt you once work in the fitzjames house i never worked in any ouse i were never a bleedin ousemaid ter nobody he still did not know whether to believe her or not perhaps but it doesnt make a lot of difference now come on im arresting you for the killing of nora dont make it more unpleasant for yourself than it has to be let the other women see you leave with some dignity she jerked her head up and ran her hands through her glorious hair staring at him defiantly then the spirit went out of her and she drooped again and allowed him to lead her out well thank god for that ewart said with a sigh leaning back in his chair in the whitechapel police station i admit i didnt think wed do it he looked up at pitt with a smile all the tension seemed to drain out of him as if an intolerable burden had been lifted and suddenly he could breathe without restriction free from inner pain even the fear which had haunted him from the beginning was gone he did not grudge pitt the respect due him i should say you did it he corrected i didnt do much as it turned out he folded his hands over his stomach so it was ella baker all along i never thought of a woman never crossed my mind should have she swears she didnt kill ada pitt said sitting down opposite him or break noras fingers and toes ewart was unperturbed well she would but that doesnt mean anything dont know why she bothers wont make any difference now and she swears she didnt implicate finlay fitzjames pitt added she says shes never heard of him and never been in domestic service ewart shrugged i suppose shes lying although ive no idea why she should bother anyway it hardly matters he smiled the case is solved and without any really unpleasant effects thats a damned sight more than i dared hope for i always thought fitzjames was innocent he added quickly for a moment uncomfortable again i just thought it would be very difficult to prove it pitt stood up are you going to tell fitzjames ewart asked put the familys mind at rest yes yes i am good he smiled a curious halfbitter expression im very pleased you deserve that good augustus fitzjames said tersely when pitt informed him that ella baker had been arrested and charged with the murder of nora gough i assume you will charge her with the death of the other woman as well no theres no evidence of that and she doesnt admit to it pitt replied once again they were in the library and this time the fire was lit casting a warmth in the chilly evening well i suppose it doesnt matter augustus was not particularly interested shell hang for the second one everyone will know she committed the first as well since they were apparently identical thank you for coming to inform me superintendent you have done an excellent job this time pity about the man er costigan but theres nothing to be done about it his tone was dismissive he rocked very gently back and forth on the balls of his feet sort of man were all better without anyway filthy trade living on the immoral earnings of women belonged in jail if not on the end of a rope might have finished up there sooner or later anyway if pitt had not been responsible for costigans death he would have retaliated with his opinion of such thoughts the deep horror they inspired in him but his own part was too profound did ella baker ever work for you mr fitzjames he asked tangled threads questions unanswered still tugging at the back of his mind dont think so augustus frowned in fact im sure she didnt why i wondered how she obtained your sons belongings in order to leave them at the scene of her crimes and above all why she should want to no idea stole them i expect augustus said tersely hardly matters now thank you for coming yourself superintendent it is good to know the police are not as incompetent as some of our most lurid and illinformed newspapers would have us believe he pursed his lips now if you will excuse me i have an appointment this evening good day to you pitt opened his mouth to protest further but augustus had already reached for the bell rope to summon the butler to show pitt out and there was nothing more he could say augustus was obviously unprepared to discuss the matter any further good evening mr fitzjames pitt replied and had to leave as the butler opened the door and smiled at him pitt returned home late and tired but it was the weariness of victory even if there were still aspects of the case which puzzled him profoundly and which he feared he would now never resolve it was already dark and the gas lamps were haloed with mist there was a damp in the air and a smell of rotting leaves turned earth and the suggestion of the first frost he opened his front door and as soon as he came in the hallway he saw charlotte at the top of the stairs she was dressed in a very plain skirt and blouse looking almost dowdy and her hair was coming out of its pins she came down so quickly he was afraid she was going to slip and fall what is it he asked seeing the eagerness in her face whats happened thomas she took a deep breath she was too full of her own news to notice that he also had something urgent to say thomas i did a little investigating myself it was all quite safe the very fact that she mentioned safety told him immediately that it was not what he demanded facing her when she was on the bottom step what did you do i assume emily was with you yes she sounded relieved as if that were a good thing something in mitigation and tallulah fitzjames listen to me first then be furious afterwards if you must but i found out something really important and terrible so did i he retorted i discovered who killed nora gough and why and obtained a confession now what did you discover she was startled who she demanded who thomas another prostitute a woman named ella baker he outlined how they had assumed it was a man because of the coat and how she had been able to disappear without anyones seeing her they were still standing in the hall at the bottom of the stairs why she asked her face reflecting none of the sense of victory he expected because nora took the man she was going to marry her escape from the life she had and maybe she even loved him as well he put his hands up and touched her shoulders holding her gently im sorry if i spoiled your news i know you want to investigate for my sake and i am not ungrateful he bent to kiss her but she pulled away frowning why did she kill ada mckinley she denies it he replied aware as he said it of the weight of dissatisfaction heavy inside him it was a thin victory and the substance of it seemed weaker every hour he thought of it why she asked that doesnt make any sense thomas they cant hang her twice her face was very pale even in the glow of the gaslight from the hall chandelier or three times no of course they cant he agreed what do you mean three times there were only two murders no there werent her voice was barely audible thats what i was going to tell you that we found out there was a third about six years ago a young girl just a beginner she had only been on the streets for a week or two she was killed in mile end exactly the same way as the others the garter the fingers and toes the crossbuttoned boots even the water everything they never found who did it he was stunned for long seconds he stood motionless as if he had not truly understood what she had said and yet it filled his mind another crime six years ago in mile end it had to be the same person hadnt it there could not possibly be two three people who would commit exactly the same gruesome senseless murder three people unconnected and who was the first victim why had he not heard of her why had ewart not known and told him im sorry charlotte said very quietly it doesnt help does it he focused his eyes again looking at her who was she do you know anything about her no only that she was new on the streets i didnt learn her name his mind was still whirling couldnt ella baker have killed her too charlotte asked maybe she tried to take something from her did she say why she wanted to implicate finlay no he turned and walked towards the parlor he was suddenly cold standing in the hall and very tired he wanted to sit down as close to the fire as he could she followed him and sat opposite in her usual chair the fire was burning a little low he put more coal on it banking it high and prodding it with the poker to make it burn up more rapidly no he went on she denied it claimed she had never heard of the fitzjameses and augustus said he had never heard of her he sat back in his chair again the flames were mounting in the fireplace as the new coal caught the heat growing tingling the skin and ewart doesnt care he added hes so damned glad its over without having to arrest fitzjames he doesnt want to know anything more about it and mr cornwallis i havent seen him yet it was late by the time id been to the fitzjameses ill tell him in the morning and speak to ella baker again perhaps id better find out about the other crime first six years ago yes about that he sighed would you like a cup of tea she asked or cocoa yes yes please he left her to decide which to bring and sat hunched in his chair in the slowly increasing warmth while the fire strengthened and flames leaped up the chimney in the morning he was in the bitter chill of newgate asking to see ella baker memories of costigans face white and frightened filling his mind of all the duties he ever had to perform this was perhaps the worst it was a different kind of pain from that of going to tell the relatives of a victim that was appalling but it was a cleaner thing it would eventually heal this wrenched him in a way that was always sickeningly real and new time did not dull it or inure him in any measure at all ella was sitting in her cell still dressed in her own clothes although they were not particularly different from prison garb he had arrested her before she was dressed for work what you want she said dully when she saw him come ter gloat ave you no he closed the cell door behind him he looked at her pale face hollow hopeless eyes and the glory of hair over her shoulders curiously although he had seen both ada and nora and seen their broken hands their dead faces disfigured in the last struggle all he could see now was ella and her despair i have no pleasure in it he told her a certain relief because its over but thats all so wot yer come for she said still half disbelievingly although something in his eyes or his voice touched her tell me about the first one ella he replied what did she do to you she was only young a beginner why did you kill her she stared at him with total incomprehension yer mad you are i dunno wot yer talkin abaht i it nora then we fought an i throttled er i never broke er fingers ner toes ner chucked water over er ner did up er boots i never touched ada mckinley i never eard of er till she were killed an as fer another i dunno wot yer on abaht there werent no other far as i knowed about six years ago in mile end he elaborated six year ago she was incredulous then she started to laugh a high harsh sound full of pain dark with fear beyond control six year ago i were in manchester married an went up there me usband died i come ome an took ter the streets ony way ter keep a roof over me ead ceptin the match factory ad a cousin oo died o phossie jaw ter ell wi that sooner be anged suddenly tears filled her eyes jus as well eh pitt ached to be able to say something to comfort her he felt the terrors closing around her the darkness from which there was no escape but there was nothing pity was no use now and to talk of hope was a mockery he smiled in answer to her bitter humor there was some courage in it he could admire that what was your husbands name he asked joe baker joseph you gonna check on me she sniffed a good man joe were drunk too much but e werent bad never it me jus fell over isself stupid sod what did he do e worked the canals till e ad an accident an drowned drunk again i spose im sorry pitt said quietly he meant it she shrugged don matter now pitt went from newgate to the mile end police station and asked to see the most senior officer present who had been there over six years he was shown by a somewhat puzzled young sergeant up to the cramped office of inspector forrest a lean man with receding black hair and sad dark eyes superintendent pitt he said with surprise rising to his feet good morning sir what can we do for you good morning inspector pitt closed the door behind him and took the proffered seat i understand you were here in mile end six years ago yes i see in the newspapers you got our murderer forrest sat down behind his desk well done damn sight more than we ever managed mind i was only a sergeant then so you did have one exactly the same pitt found it difficult to keep the anger out of his voice yes far as i can tell forrest agreed sitting forward in his chair right down to the last detail werent much in the papers about ours but ill remember it for the rest of my life poor little thing cant ave been more than fifteen or sixteen pretty they say before he did that to her she pitt corrected oh forrest shook his head yes she sorry i just had it fixed in my mind all these years that it was a man looked like a crime rooted in sex to me the kind of perverted sex of a man that has to hurt and humiliate before he can get any pleasure sort of person who has to have power over someone see them totally helpless evil still cant believe it was a woman though spose it must be if she confessed no she didnt confess except to the last one nora gough in fact she said she was in manchester six years ago forrests eyes widened well it has to have been the same person even in london sink that it is we cant have two lunatics going around doing that to women why didnt you tell me about your case pitt asked trying not to sound accusatory and failing me forrest looked at him with surprise why didnt i tell you yes for heavens sake it might have helped us we should at least have known we could have found out what they had in common and who might have known all three i didnt tell you because didnt inspector ewart tell you he was on the case pitt froze i took it for granted that hed have told you forrest said reasonably you saying he didnt there was disbelief in his face and in his voice he was watching pitt as if he could scarcely believe him pitt could scarcely believe it himself images of ewart filled his mind memories of his anger his misery the fear in him but there was no point in lying the truth was obvious anyway no he never mentioned it now it was forrests turn to sit in silence do you know ella baker pitt asked him or know of her have you ever heard her name forrest looked blank no and i know most of the women on the streets around here but ill ask dawkins hes been here for years and he knows em all he rose to his feet and went out excusing himself and returned a few minutes later with a large elderly sergeant with gray hair dawkins have you ever heard of a woman a tart around here called ella baker he turned to pitt what did she look like sir tall ordinary sort of face pitt answered but very beautiful fair hair thick and wavy dawkins thought carefully for a moment then shook his head no sir nearest to that description is lottie bridger an she died o the pox sometime early this year youre absolutely sure dawkins forrest urged yes sir never eard the name ella baker an never ad a girl on the streets round ere like you said thank you dawkins forrest dismissed him thats all yes sir thank you sir dawkins left looking puzzled closing the door behind him with a sharp click what does that mean forrest regarded pitt with open confusion are we saying as this woman didnt do our killing then i dont know what were saying pitt confessed have you got records of this case i can look at course ill have them sent for forrest excused himself again and it was a long frustrating quarter of an hour before he returned with a slim folder of papers this is it sir isnt a lot thank you pitt took it opened it and read forrest was right there was very little indeed but the details were the same as in the deaths of ada mckinley and nora gough it was all set out clinically unemotionally in fine copperplate handwriting the name of the victim had an air of unreality mary smith was that really her name or did they simply not know what to call her she was new in the area new to prostitution there was nothing else said about her no place of origin no family mentioned no possessions listed pitt read carefully from the description of objects found on the premises no mention was made of anything which could be called a clue certainly there was nothing belonging to finlay fitzjames or any other gentleman he read the statements of witnesses but they conveyed little they had seen men come and go but what else were they to expect in the room of a prostitute there were no personal details only that they were fairly young it was all insubstantial no wonder the officer in charge had failed to find the killer and the officers were constable trask and constable porter with ewart the inspector in charge the surgeon who had examined the body both at the scene of the crime and later was lennox why had neither of them mentioned it to pitt he could think of no justifiable answer i dont remember this in the papers he said to forrest who had sat silent throughout his face furrowed with anxiety it wasnt in he replied only er death thats all none o the details you know how it is keep it back might help to trap someone they knew something let something slip yes i know pitt agreed but the answer troubled him deeply it made inescapable the darkest fears in his mind when he faced ewart with it in his office in whitechapel two hours later ewart stared at him blankly his face stunned eyes as if mesmerized well pitt demanded for gods sake man why didnt you tell me about the first case we didnt solve it ewart said desperately there wasnt anything in it that could have helped dont be ridiculous pitt turned on his heel and walked over to the window then swung around and stared back at ewart you cant know whether it would have helped or not why would you conceal it because it only obscures the present ewarts voice was rising too theres nothing to say it was the same person it was mile end and six years ago people copy crimes especially mad people wicked stupid people who read about something and it sits in their brains and they what newspapers pitt asked curtly most of those details were never released to the papers which you know as well as i do i never heard of the case neither had any of the other people here working on this one nobody in whitechapel connected it with the first onebut you must have and lennox well they werent related were they ewart said with triumph of logic are you saying now that you arent sure it was ella baker who killed the gough woman no im not pitt swung around and gazed out of the window again at the gray buildings and the darkening october sky she confessed to it and i found her hair in noras bed long fair hair nora must have pulled it out when they struggled so whats the matter ewart demanded with growing confidence i was right the two cases are unconnected how do you know that ella baker didnt kill the first girl mary smith or whatever her name really was i dont know maybe she did it hardly matters we cant prove the first one was her and shell hang for this one anyhow and she says shes never heard of finlay fitzjames pitt added ewart hesitated shes lying he said after a moment and augustus fitzjames says hes never heard of her either pitt went on ewart said nothing he drew in his breath and then let it out again silently was there anything at the scene of the first murder to incriminate finlay pitt asked curtly ewart looked straight back at him no of course not if there had been id have mentioned it that would have been relevant we never had any idea who did it there was nothing to go on nothing at all i see but pitt did not see he traveled from whitechapel back to the center of the city and went straight to cornwalliss office cornwallis welcomed him striding forwards with his hand out his face alight well done pitt this is brilliant i admit i had lost hope we should have such a satisfactory outcomeand a confession to boot he dropped his hand suddenly realizing something was wrong the smile faded from his lips his eyes clouded what is it man what now sit sit down he gestured to one of the large leathercovered easy chairs and sat in the other himself he leaned forwards his face grave his attention total pitt told him about the crime in mile end cornwallis was stunned and ewart has only just told you thats beyond belief pitt could think of no easy way to recount what had actually happened without implicating charlotte and this was not a time for lies or evasions of any sort ewart didnt tell me at all he said grimly my wife discovered it and she told me he noticed the look on cornwalliss face but perhaps vespasia had made some reference or other because he did not question what pitt said but you have spoken to ewart he affirmed his eyes dark with foreboding yes pitt replied he said he didnt mention it because he thought it irrelevant that is inconceivable cornwallis was very earnest his whole face filled with distress and lennox was involved as well yes although that is easier to understand he may well have assumed ewart had told me it was ewarts job not his but why cornwallis said with exasperation i cant begin to understand it why would ewart hide that first murder his hands were clenched fidgeting all right he failed to solve it but thats no shame to him from what you say there were no clues to follow the witnesses saw nothing of value there was nothing further he could have done pitt he looked wretched hardly able to bring himself to say what he meant i dont know pitt replied to the question that had not been asked i cant believe ewart was involved in a murder let alone three but i have to know im going back to the original witnesses to the mile end case i know their names and the address where it happened but its not my station and its not my crime i need your permission to question inspector forrest about ewarts duties that night cornwalliss face was tight with pain he had been in command too many years not to know the weaknesses and the fallibilities of man that courage and temptation can work side by side and loyalty and selfdeceit you have it he said quietly we must know go back to the first murder pitt i cant believe ewart is guilty himself he certainly wasnt of the second or third we know that but if ella baker didnt do it then for gods sake who did he frowned do you believe it is really credible that we have three extraordinary murders all with the same features of torture and fetishism the crossbuttoned boots the water committed by three different people it looks like it pitt replied but no i dont believe it its preposterous there is something fundamental that we dont yet know and i have no idea what it is he stood up cornwallis rose also and went to his desk writing pitt a brief note of permission he gave it to pitt wordlessly gripping his hard hand his own body stiff he held pitts eyes wanting to speak to communicate some of the emotion he felt but there was nothing to say he took a deep breath hesitated then let it out again pitt nodded then turned and left going out into the sharp october air to hail a hansom and return once again to mile end it was four oclock in the afternoon by quarter past five he had seen the duty rosters for the day of mary smiths death there was no way in which ewart could have been involved in her murder just as he could not have been involved in the murders of ada mckinley and nora gough next he left and went to the house in globe road where mary smith had died he asked the grayly unshaven landlord for the first witness named in the statements is mr oliver stubbs here never eard of im the landlord said abruptly try somewere else he was about to close the door on pitt when pitt put his foot in it and glared at him with such ferocity he hesitated ere wos matter wiv you then get yer foot outer me door or ill set the dog on yer do that and ill close you down pitt said without hesitation this is a murder enquiry and if you want to avoid the rope as an accomplice youll do all you can to help me now if oliver stubbs isnt

yelled into the dim passageway behind him ere marge come ere there was no reply come ere yer lazy sow he raised his voice even more there was another moments silence then a fat woman with ginger hair emerged from one of the back rooms and came forward yeah wot yer want she looked at pitt with minimum curiosity werent yer ere six years ago the man asked her yeah she answered so this rozzer wants

wrote it all down on their little bits o paper always scribblin they was the man stood beside her looking from her to pitt and back again they cant have kept it pitt said realizing with surprise how much must have been thrown away once it was regarded as of no use and the case marked unsolved and forgotten tell me what you can remember of the man you saw and with as much detail as possible wot in ell do it matter now she screwed up her face eyeing him with suspicion and curiosity yer never sayin yer got someone ave yer after all them years she hesitated another moment deep in thought ere you sayin as it were the same one wot done mary smith as done the other women in whitechapel for a moment it seemed such a glaringly obvious conclusion pitt wondered at the womans stupidity then he remembered with a jolt that the details of this first death had not been published in the newspapers if she had not seen the body herself and the police specifically ewart had not told her then maybe she was unaware of the exact sameness of the method even to the most bizarre detail yes he said simply it is possible i eard as it was a woman wot done em int that true then she swung around to the unshaven man that davey watsons a liar e said as it were another tart wot done em wait till i catch im the bleedin little sod it was a woman who killed nora gough pitt said soothingly now please

kind o fancy artylookin nothin special abaht is face as i can remember jus ordinary cept e fancied isself or summink painter mebbe there was a clatter somewhere inside the building a woman swore the second man pitt prompted pompous as a prater e were all airs like e thought e were summink what did he look like urgency was mounting inside him nuffin much ornry as muck wen it comes ter it she

world she answered andsome though andsome face lovly air all thick an waves would o done a woman good that air fair or dark pitt felt a curious sensation of anticipation as he said it a clenching in his stomach ewart had known all this he had heard this six years ago what terror or stupidity had kept him silent fair she said without hesitation a gentleman yeah if talk an clothes makes a gent then e was a gent i wouldnt a give yer tuppence fer im nasty little swine summit mean abaht im sort o excited like e were i dunno she gave up and the last one pitt did not want to know but he had to there was no evading it can you remember him yeah e really were diffrent she shook her head a little the ginger hair waggling from side to side on the thin side but wi one o them faces as yer never forgets eyes like e were on fire inside is ead you mean a little mad or drunk what no she waved a fat hand impatiently like e knew sommat inside isself wot were so important e ad to tell everyone like e were a poet or one o them musicians or summink e dint belong wi them lot i see and what happened are you saying they came together or one by one or how he asked even though he knew the answer all come

necessary wot in a court yes she thought about it for a moment she did not consult the man who stood by sullenly unimportant yeah she said at last yeah if yer wants poor mary she din deserve that none o my girls ever did nor anybody elses neither ill see the bastard ang if yer can get im that is she gave a harsh derisive laugh that all mister yes for now thank you pitt walked away slowly it was now nearly six in the evening and growing dark with the heavy clouds moving in from the east a sharper wind behind them smelling of the river salt and dead fish and human effort there was no evasion possible margery williams had described the four young men too precisely for there to be any but the faintest doubt driven by hope not reason it had been the hellfire club thirlstone helliwell finlay and jago jones pitt was crushed by an inner misery he walked slowly away from mile end and towards whitechapel it would take him half an hour to reach coke street he wished it could be longer he was passed by all sorts of people on their way home from offices clerks with inkstained fingers and stiff shoulders some with squinting eyes after staring all day at the black letters on the white page shop clerks passed in twos and threes laborers would be finishing soon going home to the piled tenements each having their own narrow little place where their own people were their own few belongings he crossed the street and only just avoided being struck by a hansom it was getting dark and considerably colder he turned his coat collar up and increased his pace without being aware of it he did not intend to get there any faster he was drawn by emotion an anger and urgency within he was going straight down the mile end road which would become the whitechapel road as it crossed brady street from reluctance he had changed to wanting to get it over with as quickly as possible he was striding along barely seeing people on either side the streetlamps were lit orange lights were brilliant through the gathering darkness carriages mere looming shapes with riding lamps on either side horses hooves clattering on the wet stones wheels hissing he turned left down plumbers row which led into coke street it was the one time and place he was almost sure of finding jago jones and he had a deep perhaps irrational belief that jago would not lie to him if he was faced with the truth he swung around the last corner and saw the cart under the gas lamp the light shining on its handles polished smooth where hands had gripped it day after day perhaps for generations jago joness lean figure in his shabby clothes was still serving hot soup to the last ragged figures beside him working in silent unison was tallulah fitzjames pitt watched leaning against the wall in the shadows until they were finished and turned to start putting it all away there was nothing left there never was reverend jones pitt moved forward and spoke softly jago looked up he was no longer surprised to see pitt he had been here too often over the last weeks and months yes superintendent he said patiently im sorry pitt meant it seldom had he regretted any necessity so much i cannot let the matter rest he glanced at tallulah still tidying and packing away what is it now jago asked his brow furrowed with puzzlement i dont know anything else i have spoken to ella baker once or twice but she was a very selfsufficient woman she had no need of my counsel he smiled ruefully at least shall i say she had no desire for it i did not know her well enough to be aware of her agony perhaps that is my shortcoming but at least for her it is too late now his face in the lamplight showed nothing but sorrow and a sense of defeat he moved farther away so tallulah could not overhear them please dont ask me to question her superintendent even if she could speak to me whatever she said would be between her and god all i could offer would be some shred of human comfort and the promise that god is sometimes a kinder judge than we expect if we are honest and i think too perhaps harsher if we are not honest reverend pitt heard the catch in his own voice jago stared at him perhaps he heard more of the irony some deeper understanding and pain than before he half turned towards tallulah then changed his mind or perhaps his belief in what he could accomplish what is it superintendent you say the word as if it had some greater meaning for you pitt had not expected tallulah to be there his first instinct had been to have her leave to face jago with his knowledge alone it was a matter of decency not to confront the man before someone who obviously had the utmost respect for him now he realized tallulah would have to know it concerned her too closely finlay was her brother whatever was said here in the dark and the damp of coke street would eventually be just as devastating in the withdrawing room of devonshire street the delay would not save her from misery it does when spoken between the two of us regarding the deaths of ada mckinley and nora gough pitt answered his question jagos eyes were unwaveringly steady i know nothing about them superintendent tallulah had finished the packing away and moved closer what about mary smith pitt asked and neither did he flinch off globe road in mile end about six years ago are you going he stopped jagos face was ashen even in the yellowwhite glare of the gas lamp he looked like a deathshead there was no point in finishing the sentence jago was not going to lie a lie would have been grotesque now an indignity beyond redeeming you were there pitt said quietly trying to ignore tallulahs eyes staring at him with dawning horror you thirlstone helliwell and finlay fitzjames he did not make it a question and his voice left no room for doubt jago closed his eyes very slowly he was controlling himself with a supreme effort he looked as if he might fall if for an instant he let go i will answer for myself superintendent but for no one else he swallowed hard his clenched hands shook yes i was there in my younger days i did many things of which i am ashamed but none as much as that i drank too much i wasted my time and valued things which were of no worth i cared what people thought of me not for love not respect or honor he said the words bitterly not whether i hurt people not whether my example was good or bad only to posture and parade wanting to be smarter and wittier than the next man tallulah was still staring at him but he seemed oblivious of her drenched in loathing of the man he had been she moved a step closer but still he was unaware globe road pitt said bringing him back to the issue not only because it was what mattered to him but because jagos other sins whatever they had been were not his to judge nor did he wish to know them i was there jago admitted again i did not kill mary smith his voice sank to a whisper hoarse as if the memory of it were still before his eyes but i know what was done to her god forgive me i have spent the rest of my life since then trying to repay who killed her pitt said gently he believed it was not jago not only because he wanted to but there was a passion in his face a torture of guilt and memory a selfdisgust but also a courage that he had at last spoken the truth and at the same time kept his own kind of honor i will not tell you superintendent im sorry pitt hesitated only a moment there was no real decision to make reverend he used the title intentionally mary smith was not only killed she was tortured first and humiliated she was tied to her own bed with her stocking intimate garments he saw the naked pain in jagos face but he did not stop she was terrified and hurt her fingers and toes were either wrenched out of their joints or the bones were broken she wasnt a practiced whore he heard his own voice grating hard she was a young girl just started superintendent the cry was wrung from tallulah she stepped forward and was standing beside jago staring at pitt you dont need to go on we know what happened to the girls in whitechapel we accept that mary smith was the same and that it was very terrible nobody no living creature should be treated that way and you must find out who did it and they must be punished tallulah jago gasped trying to push her away his face was streaked in the damp of the evening or in the sweat of inner pain you dont he stopped unable to go on you he drew in a long shuddering breath then turned to pitt superintendent i understand what you are saying and i know even better than you do just how how fearful it was i admit my part in it i was there and i helped conceal what was done for that i am guilty but i will not say more than that i have done all i can in the years since then to become a man worthy of forgiveness i began from my own sense of remorse now i do it for the love of the task itself someone has to care for these people and my reward in it has been greater than any bound or measure but i understand that i was an accessory after the fact in a murder and an accomplice in concealing the truth there is always a price may i please take the cart back to the kitchen before i come with you they will need it tomorrow someone will take over what i cannot i will tallulah said immediately billy shaw will help me if i ask him and mrs moss thank you jago acknowledged this without looking at her i am not taking you reverend pitt said slowly i dont believe you murdered mary smith and i know you didnt murder either of the two women here at whitechapel jago stood without moving confused still he could not bring himself to look at tallulah he kept his head turned away from her unable to bear what he might see in her eyes pitt hesitated jago tallulah said softly taking him by the arm you cannot protect him anymore it was finlay wasnt it somehow papa managed to have it hidden covered over he must have bought the policeman a rush of memory flooded over pitt a score of small impressions ewarts pride in his son the carefully bought education the daughter who had married well such an achievement but at what price he recalled ewarts eagerness to blame someone else the look on his face when augustuss name was mentioned the strange mixture of fear and hatred it was hideously obvious now why he had destroyed the statements of the witnesses to the globe street murder and marked the case unsolved and why he had not mentioned it to pitt what nightmares he must have endured when he thought finlay had committed the same crime again and ewart again had to conceal it for him but this time with a superior officer called in and handed the investigation over his head no wonder he couldnt sleep couldnt eat came into the station looking like a man who had opened a door on hell and then pitt had arrested albert costigan and it had seemed indubitable that he was guilty he had not even denied it himself ewart must have thought himself free then there was another crime in myrdle street a second nightmare for ewart a second torture of trying to prove finlay had not done it of guiding pitt step by step away from finlay and towards some other explanation any other at all and pitt had found ella baker and she too had not denied her guilt tallulah was standing very close to jago her arm around him almost as if she were supporting him her face was wet with the settling mist shadows around her eyes shock and misery were stamped deep into the lines of her features but there was also a strength in her which had never shown itself before almost a luminosity as if she had found within herself something which she knew was precious and indestructible and in time of greater beauty than anything devonshire street could give her or take from her you cannot protect him she repeated searching jagos face neither can i betray him jago whispered but he leaned a little towards her half unwillingly as if he did it against his will but could barely help himself i gave my word i was also to blame i went i knew what was in him the anger the need for power and i still went in finlay fitzjames pitt said jago did not answer him pitt knew there was no more purpose in pressing him he had not yet sufficient evidence to arrest finlay for the murder of mary smith not if jago would not speak margery williams might recognize the four men but six years had passed and what was such a womans testimony against that of finlay fitzjames and the weight of his fathers power would tallulah go home to devonshire street and warn finlay might pitt even get there and find finlay gone possibly to europe or even farther perhaps to america the three of them stood under the gaslight in coke street motionless jago and tallulah close her arm around him pitt opposite they were all cold the damp had settled with a clinging biting chill down on the river a foghorn sounded thin and miserable echoing across the water who put finlays cuff link and club badge in ada mckinleys room pitt asked curiously was that you or one of the other two it wasnt me jago said with surprise id stake all i possess which admittedly isnt much that it wasnt either of them helliwell is terrified hell be tarred with the brush of disrepute never mind murder thirlstone simply wants to forget the whole thing the hellfire club broke up and we swore never to see each other again tallulah looked from jago to pitt her brow furrowed it doesnt make sense superintendent the people whom you say killed the women live in whitechapel they cant ever have heard of finlay much less have his possessions and why would it be mortimer or norbert either her face was very white her eyes hollow the one person it couldnt be is finlay himself her voice sank to a whisper he was guilty the first time but not the second i know that superintendent i swear i really know it i did see him at the party i believe you miss fitzjames nor was it ewart he was desperate that finlay should not even be seriously suspected let alone charged he may hate your father he may hate finlay but he has everything to losehis livelihood his family even his freedomif finlay is proved guilty and i have a feeling that if that were to happen your father far from protecting him would be the first to destroy him for having failed tallulah said nothing she could not deny it but it was too painful to agree it was one step beyond what she could endure jagos arm tightened around her there is something fundamental that you dont know jago said almost as much to himself as to pitt something upon which this all turns what is it pitt and tallulah spoke at once i dont know jago confessed i just know it exists it matters terribly but as he spoke pitt realized the thing that had been unresolved at the back of his own mind mary smith he said aloud such an ordinary name too ordinary who was she who was she really jago closed his eyes again i dont know she was young she was very pretty and very unhappy god forgive us but it still doesnt make any sense tallulah protested turning to pitt you found finlays things in the womens rooms who could have put them there except whoever killed them had mary smith something to do with both costigan and ella baker her face wrinkled up with confusion but they wouldnt kill two women just to blame finlay thats insane as he stood in the deepening chill the mist now a halo of light around the gas lamp another answer came to pitts mind absurdly simple and tragic if it was the truth it would explain everything i must go back to the police station he said his voice sounded exactly as it had done moments before yet he felt utterly different it was an answer he did not want and yet it intruded more and more fiercely into his mind even the few seconds he stood there i will take tallulah miss fitzjames back with me to saint marys jago said his face composed his shoulders straight pitt smiled very slightly it was a warm gesture but a glimmer where he would have wished a beacon thats a good idea reverend it may be the very best place for her may i suggest you keep her there if decency permits but jago started i know where to find you if i should need you pitt cut him short but i dont think i shall i know you wont testify against finlay and there is no one to testify against you keep on with your work here it does much good good night and he swiveled around and walked away towards the corner he turned once and looked back he saw two figures under the lamp but so closely entwined they could have been one a man and a woman locked in an embrace for which each had imagined and dreamed and waited until the reality was sweet beyond hope ewart was startled to see pitt he looked up from his desk his face calm no suspicion in it no dread of what was to come is dr lennox in pitt asked if not please send for him are you ill even as he asked it the light died out of ewarts face he could see pitt was not ill only hurt and darkened in spirit get me dr lennox pitt repeated how well do you know him er moderately ewarts face was pale the blood slipping out of his cheeks why what did his father do what what did his father do for a living pitt said again i i dont think ive no idea why he looked genuinely puzzled has he done something he shouldnt whats the matter pitt you look dreadful sit down man ill get you a glass of brandy dr lennox i dont want brandy pitt hated this ewart was being considerate in spite of the fear which was beginning to take hold of him pitt despised a bought man ewart had concealed a brutal murder one of the vilest pitt had heard of god knows how many other things he had done at augustus fitzjamess behest one coercion one blackmail led to another one fall and there was no road back except by admissionand payment in full and the police would not forgive one of its own for such an act of corruption mary smith or whoever she was deserved better than that get me lennox pitt repeated between his teeth whitefaced ewart went to the door and disappeared along the passage he came back a moment later hell be here in fifteen minutes he said uncertain whether to sit or to stand watching pitt with apprehension ive just been speaking with the reverend jago jones pitt said slowly oh ewart did not know whether to be interested or not about the murder of mary smith pitt went on in globe road six years ago ewart went sheetwhite he struggled for breath and gagged very slowly he collapsed back into the chair behind him feeling for it with fumbling hands why did you destroy the witnesses records pitt asked i know the answer but ill give you the chance to say it yourself if you have that shred of honor left ewart sat in silence the torment was plain in his face as naked as hate and grief and failure and the inner terror that one can never escape the knowledge of self he offered me money he said so quietly pitt could barely hear him money to make a better life for my family my sons for his he said it was an accident finlay never meant to kill the girl when he realized what he had done he tried to revive her that was why they threw the water over her but of course hed gone too far the game had got out of hand and he had choked the life out of her he must have gagged her before she screamed the marks of it were on her cheeks he leaned down and hid his face in his hands but he didnt kill the others his voice was thick half muffled you had the right man costigan was guilty id swear to that and ella baker too god knows how finlays things got there that was one of the worst days of my life when i saw them it was like hell opening up in front of me pitt said nothing he could imagine it the sudden sick horror the fear the desperate writhing of the mind to find escape the relentless terror as fact piled upon fact and the sheer incomprehensible mystery of it there was no sound from the passageway outside nothing but a blur of sounds from the street it was a full fifteen minutes of agonized silence in the room before the door opened and lennox came in he looked tired he saw ewart first slumped over the desk then pitt in the chair opposite it what is it he asked is inspector ewart ill probably pitt answered come in and close the door lennox obeyed still puzzled pitt remained where he was you were the first at the scene of ada mckinleys death after constable binns werent you doctor yes why he did not look troubled only surprised and of nora goughs death also yes you know i was you examined the bodies before anyone else lennox stared at him curiously the dawn of understanding in his weary hazel eyes you know that too then you went through to comfort the witnesses before we spoke to them pitt continued yes they were upset naturally were you first on the scene of mary smiths death also lennox paled but he kept his composure mary smith he frowned in globe street six years ago pitt said softly a young girl only just taken to the streets about fifteen or sixteen years old she was killed in exactly the same way but was she dr lennox for seconds no one moved there was not even the sound of breathing then ewart looked up at lennox his face haggard but the pain in his eyes was a shadow a ghost compared with that in lennoxs face in his whole thin body my sister he whispered mary lennox she was sixteen when that animal did that to her he looked down at ewart and you had the evidence and you let him go what did he pay you that was worth that ewart what in gods name was worth that ewart said nothing he was too numb with despair and selfloathing to feel another blow so when you found a prostitute murdered without the use of a knife pitt went on speaking to lennox and you were the first on the scene you put finlay fitzjamess belongings under the body and broke her fingers and toes to look like marys and tied the garter crossbuttoned the boots threw water over her and waited for us to do the rest hoping finlay fitzjames would be blamed pitt said carefully yes where did you get the badge and the cuff link i stole them from ewart he kept them so they wouldnt be in the evidence lennox replied and when finlay wasnt blamed and we hanged costigan you were first on the scene of nora goughs death so you did it again pitt went on did you coach the witnesses too persuade them they had seen a man like finlay at the house yes ewart rose to his feet swayed and almost overbalanced neither of the others moved to help him i must get out he said hoarsely im going to be sick lennox stepped back to let him pass ewart fumbled for the doorknob threw the door open and went out leaving it swinging behind him lennox faced pitt he deserved to be hanged for what he did to mary he said in a low husky voice are you going to charge finlay now or is he still going to get away with it the words were torn out of him i havent enough evidence to charge him pitt said bitterly unless ewart confesses which he may or he may recover his composure and realize i have very little proof but lennox was desperate i can see if margery williams will identify finlay pitt went on she might so might the other two witnesses who saw him or there is the possibility helliwell and thirlstone may be sufficiently frightened they will speak especially if they are identified as well you must lennox leaned forward and grasped pitt his grip so hard it pinched the flesh you must he got no further because the door opened and a very worried constable binns put his head in sir mr ewart just went out of ere lookin like e ad the devil beind im sir an e took them sticks o dynamite as we took from the pitt shot to his feet almost knocking lennox over and charged past binns and out into the corridor then he spun around facetoface with the two men who were hard on his heels binns go and get a hansom commandeer one if you have to gonow binns obeyed ran down the stairs and they heard his feet clattering on the boards below pitt looked at lennox give your resignation to the sergeant immediately be gone by the time i get back just dont tell me where and i shant look for you lennox stood motionless gratitude flooding his face softening the harsh lines filling his eyes with tears pitt had no time to say anything further he plunged down the stairs after binns and ran through the entrance hall and down the steps into the street binns was waiting with a very angry cabdriver standing by the open door of a hansom number thirtyeight devonshire street pitt shouted and swung himself up and into it with binns a step behind fast as you can man lives depend on it the cabby caught the tension and the urgency he cracked the whip and the cab lurched forward in a few moments it was charging through traffic at considerable risk to everything in its way neither pitt nor binns spoke they were thrown from side to side and clinging onto the handles in peril of being injured and there was too much noise to hear anything clearly above the hooves the wheels the creak of straining woodzx and the yells of outraged coachmen when they slowed to a halt in devonshire street pitt threw the door open and was out onto the pavement binns a yard behind him he raced up the steps and yanked the doorbell almost pulling it out of its socket then beat his fists on the door binns was shouting something but he took no notice the door swung open and the agreeable butler looked alarmed is ewart here pitt demanded policeman inspector ewart dark thinning hair carrying something probably a bag yes sir he arrived a few minutes ago called to see mr fitzjames where the butler paled in the library sir is there a fire there pitts voice cracked with the unbearable tension yes sir what is wrong sir if i can he never completed his sentence the blast from the explosion tore out the fireplace and the outer wall of the library it hurled the door off its hinges into the hallway and the force of heat and air knocked the men to the floor bruised and wounded pitt was driven back and crashed into the hall table binns fell to his knees there were books and loose papers everywhere and a cloud of gray ash there were seconds of silence except for the settling of stones and rubble then the screaming started pitt climbed to his feet unsteadily dizzy and hurt unaware of his bleeding hands or the scratches and smears of blood on his face he stumbled towards the library and peered in the wreckage of books littered everything except a space in the center where live coals were burning on the carpet the body of ewart lay crumpled drenched with blood and less than a yard away what was left of augustus fitzjames sprawled across the pile of splinters which had been the table one jagged end speared through his chest but he would no longer care pitt turned back and saw the butler rise to his knee his face gray with shock binns moved forward slightly to help him somewhere beyond the landing a maid was screaming over and over again aloysia fitzjames stood at the head of the stairs finlay came from the withdrawing room he looked incredulous as if he did not believe what he saw he faced pitt with anger what in gods name have you done he said abruptly where wheres my father hes dead pitt answered quietly the smoke catching in his throat soisinspector ewart but his records remain finlay fitzjames i arrest you for the torture and murder of mary lennox on the twelfth of september finlay looked once in desperation towards the wreckage of the library he cannot help you this time pitt said nor can ewart you can put off the time mr fitzjames but it always comes one day or another have the courage now to face it it is still not too late at least for dignity finlay stared at him then his eyes swung wildly seeking an escape help anything but pitt standing in front of him i cant i wont i his voice rose higher more shrill you cant prove ewart confessed before he died aloysia came slowly down the staircase and stood by her son but without touching him she looked at pitt he will come with dignity superintendent she said very quietly i will come with him in the last few moments i have lost everything that i have lived my whole life believing i possessed but i will not go out of here weeping and whatever i feel no one else will know it finlay stared at her incomprehension turning into rage you cant let him he began do something his voice rose in terror and accusation do something you cant let him take me theyll hang me he started to struggle but binns had hold of him so hard by the arm he would have wrenched it out of the socket had he continued to struggle mother you aloysia was not listening she walked slowly down the steps and binns followed with finlay his features tearstained and twisted with rage behind them then grimed and smeared but still with an agreeable face the butler staggered to the door and pulled it closed
