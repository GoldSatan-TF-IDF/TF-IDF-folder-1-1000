richard gordon a question of guilt the curious case of dr crippen first published in it is sunday afternoon preferably before the war the wife is already asleep in the armchair and the children have been sent out for a nice long walk you put your feet up on the sofa settle your spectacles on your nose and open the news of the world roast beef and yorkshire or roast pork and apple sauce followed up by suet pudding and driven home as it were by a cup of mahoganybrown tea have put you in just the right mood your pipe is drawing sweetly the sofa cushions are soft underneath you the fire is well alight the air is warm and stagnant in these blissful circumstances what is it that you want to read about naturally about a murder george orwell cor blimey you ought to see the landladywhat a facecrippen was innocent musichall joke dr hawley harvey crippen was sentenced to death at the old bailey in london on october for the murder of his wife belle elmore the music hall artiste three days later ethel le neve was accused in the same court of being an accessory after the fact the crippens were americans who had settled in north london at hilldrop crescent part of belle elmores remains were dug from the cellar floor her head and her bones were never found the meal had the illsubdued restlessness of a headquarters mess on the eve of battle men came and went with terse apologies silences scudded across the room like the shadows of clouds flying in the moonlight over the snowdusted norfolk countryside the voracious fireplace roared with plenteous logs from the estate the long shiny tablecloth was brightened by mauve and yellow fresias between two silver stands piled with grapes peaches and tangerines the royal household was at dinner that evening had assembled only a handful of the persons under the lord chamberlains command these included lords in waiting and gentlemen ushers comptrollers almoners and clerks of the closet ladiesand womenof the bedchamber gold stick and black rod the mistress of the robes the master of the horse the poet laureate the bargemaster and the keeper of the swans nineteen doctors and in case of their failure a royal coroner upstairs the king lay dying eliot entered at halfpast eight it was monday january his eye caught a typed place card sir eliot beckett vc kbe md frcp gallantry rightly takes precedence on brains he thought isnt your wife having dinner asked lord dawson of penn as eliot sat beside him nancys with the queen excellent im sure shell steady the queens nerves better than any dose i could prescribe eliot reached for the menu in its silver clip with the royal arms potato soup turbot and roast mutton he supposed one mans death was no reason for another going without his dinner eliot beckett was tall and lean the strong bones of his face a memorial to youthful good looks he brilliantined his thick dark hair and trimmed his moustache like ronald colmans noticing the grandfather clock he glanced automatically at his wristwatch why should the time at sandringham be half an hour faster than the rest of the world for punctuality at king edward viis shooting parties dawson told him king edward the seventh but he hasnt shot for twentyfive years unless over the elysian fields ah from royal whim to unshakable tradition is an easy step in this country eliot was new to sandringham the acre estate on the marshy north norfolk coast against the wash had cost the former king edward a quarter of a million pounds the long low redbrick house could never contain the exuberant generosity of his hospitality as a young doctor with an empty pocket a full heart low prospects and high principles eliot had warmed himself agreeably with indignation at the dozen royal balls there a season the elaborate shooting of ten thousand pheasants the kings special steaming daily from london loaded with guests in their tweeds and furs with their guns and dogs their leather luggage polished like saddles by their packs of servants in york cottage beyond the lake a villa of suburban glumness overwhelmed by shrubbery the kings son george played bluff naval officer turned blunt squire and waited for the throne now king george v a quarter of a century later lay comatose over their heads his quitting the world only another regal formality the king went downhill very rapidly this afternoon eliot refused wine from the tailcoated footman that privy council meeting this morning severely taxed him said dawson yet it was nothing but a tragic pantomime the king sat in his dressinggown leaning on a bedtable across an armchair he could make only a couple of xs for his signature dawson was the only medical man among odd politicians sworn as a privy councillor he seems to collect honours as an actress compliments eliot thought dawson had a taut face straight eyebrows and a bushy moustache he was genial sensitive ambitious and impatient as the kings physician he had penetrated british consciousness like airwoman amy johnson or cricketer jack hobbs his name footed the brief handwritten bulletins policemen hung on buckingham palace railings when the king was near death before in he was the man the newspapers telephoned for a doctors view on the modern girl the motor age or whither europe eliot heard that the king chose dawson as his doctor because he never fussed and was good with dogs and horses why hold the meeting at all asked eliot ramsay macdonald insisted he wanted a council of state to hold power during the kings incapacity as in macdonalds a terribly nervy fellow you know isnt the kings death a favourite moment for revolution lord wigram can tell us on eliots right was a straightbacked smoothfaced man with a clipped moustache a former bengal lancer in his midsixties he wore a starched shirt and dinnerjacket a dying king created difficulties of conventionno gentleman in the s dined in a lounge suit but doctors could hardly attend the sickbed as though dressed for the play eliot and dawson retained their professional uniform of morning coats striped trousers and wing collars yes indeed said wigram the kings private secretary he could talk of constitutional subtleties like the kings butler of the wines in his cellar on the death of king edward a troop of life guards was under orders at albany street barracks ready to be turned out within five minutes of a trumpet call perhaps i deserved their attentions suggested eliot remember i was a bolshevik id probably have stood cheering if wed cut the hedonistic old gentlemans head off in whitehall like charles the firsts you cannot make our flesh creep dawson chaffed him even mr pickwicks fat boy had to grow up wigram we shall need to compose a bulletin yes i looked out the final one on king edward in wigram efficiently produced a folded sheet from his inside pocket i know what it says i signed it dawson reminded him his majestys condition is now critical was stark enough for the morning papers now we have the wireless the bbc will want something to put on the air between nine and ten when people start going to bed we must send a message which will touch their hearts dawson reached for the menu card in its clip and wrote quickly on the back the kings life is moving peacefully towards its close wigram nodded appreciatively eliot wondered how early in his patients illness dawson had composed the phrase ill take it to the queen at once then have it telephoned to portland place dawson rose ill come with you said eliot abandoning his fish im not hungry the remaining men at the table also stood lady beckett had entered the diningroom nancy beckett was better known than eliot in mayfair or monte carlo or manhattan her social star had twinkled before cultivating americans in london society had moved from the freakish to the smart her hair was cut square and loose like greta garbos and had never been a richer shade of auburn she had large green eyes and a pert nose her pale skin as clear as a silk mask was submerged regularly under mudpacks in bond street her figure represented a slimwaisted trophy for selfdiscipline she wore a black silk calflength dress and in deference to the melancholy evening no jewellery except a diamond the size of a humbug she exchanged a smile with her husband her place was next to lady evesham a ladyinwaiting with pale grey hair which nancy suspected she would have loved to peroxide i was so thrilled at sir eliots vc lady evesham began i was a vad nurse during the war you know at the base hospital at wimereuxthe medical men were terrible old dugouts it was such a boost for our moralea doctor at the front winning the supreme decoration that terrible march of ludendorff taking us completely by surprise on the somme poor hubert gough sacked for retreating the germans expected in the channel ports any day and douglas haigs wonderful order about our backs to the wall nancy was aware that the war had been conducted for britain largely by members of lady eveshams own family you must have always known sir eliot a brave man lady evesham added im afraid id no chance to tell you see he was a conscientious objector until the middle of the war lady evesham looked aghast when conscription came in my husband had the choice of going either into the army or into jail and eliot is simply a man who develops wholehearted enthusiasm for anything he happens to find himself doing pacifists are the fiercest of people nancy confided if bertrand russell had provided himself with a machinegun instead of a typewriter there wouldnt be room on his chest for medals eliot and dawson were walking upstairs together the queen was with the prince of wales and the dukes of york and kent princess elizabeth and princess margaret had been packed back to windsor where their mother the duchess of york was recovering from pneumonia complicating flu caught in that winters savage epidemic the duke of gloucester was in buckingham palace with a sore throat the three privy councillorsramsay macdonald lord hailsham and sir john simonhad the unsought adventure of a flight back to london that chilly bright afternoon the prince of wales offer of his private plane from nearby bircham newton aerodrome was unrefusable archbishop of canterbury cosmo lang past seventy gaitered and aproned bald and sharpnosed fonder of christians if they were kings had arrived with vulturish timing eliot wondered if dawson resented nancy as well being invited to sandringham but decided him too seasoned too secure a courtier eliot had been summoned from their home in kent by telephone at three on the sunday morning dawson recognized that eliot knew more about the heart than himself and the kings was starting to fail he almost killed the old boy in eliot reflected missing a pocket of pus hidden behind the lung until almost too late everyone had heard how he failed his exams as a student at the london hospital dawsons skill was stagemanager of the sickbed the impressario of dramatic illness i read your health of nations when it was published after the war dawson said politely id toned it down enormously a young man can do his future severer damage by publishing a book than indulging his irresponsibility with racehorses and women no man is one person but a succession dawson ruminated were like the portraitgallery of wicked ancestors in ruddigore always liable to step from their frames and haunt the latest version id trimmed my own views when i reported to the government on our medical services in but a state health scheme will come one day be sure of it its unthinkable to the medical profession the unthinkable is often inevitable the death of kings is more certain than the birth of princes eliot admitted i suppose it was unthinkable to kill germs with mouldy bread when i tried in now professor fleming at st marys has proved me right hes even purified the penicillin mould you know but unlike me flemings a canny scot he doesnt claim too much for it very sensibly penicillin will never have any use whatever outside the laboratory i offered it as a panacea because i was a zealous revolutionary eliot smiled and revolutionaries generally come to grief through their own egotism thank god for all of us you did in those particular activities eliot was gratified to sense dawsons feeling as genuine they had reached the landing behind the door to their right lay the ruler of an empire on which the sun never set he received the loyalty of million white subjects and of million coloured ones who had no option king george v had a talent for fatherliness whether at a delhi durbar or on the wireless at christmas and had presided with equal composure over the house of lords revolt in the general strike of and the great war did you find much change this evening asked dawson no the cyanosis is worse theres only slight pulmonary congestion but the heart is obviously failing his illness of ran a heavy overdraft on his powers of recuperation dawson paused menucard in hand seventeen years later eliot was to see it again at a dinner on the evening of his patients granddaughters coronation i must not delay this message but i hope for another word alone with you this evening about yourself dawson hesitated if this governmentor a future governmentdecides to take over the medical profession the wisest of us will safeguard ourselves and our fellowdoctors by becoming sufficiently important in the eyes of the country to dictate the terms they exchanged glances very well said eliot that night did not end for eliot until six oclock nancy was asleep smeared with cold cream the bedside lamp burning she stirred as he gently opened the door hes dead at five to midnight i had to stay up the embalmers got lost eliot tore off his wingcollar i could do with a bath but its about half a mile away what a ridiculous country why must snobbishness be equated with unnecessary discomfort the becketts lived in a castle gutted and refurbished with steam heating gushing plumbing hygienic kitchens efficient drains its offwhite reception rooms were designed as a favour by syrie maugham and hung with impressionists chosen by nancys admirer lord duveen nobody gets value for money like an american millionairess whens the funeral today week its been planned by lord wigram and the lord chamberlain down to the last tap of muffled drums parliament must meet and stanley baldwins going on the wireless he sat on the silk coverlet taking her chin in his hand his eyes gleamed with the mingled excitement and exhaustion she seldom saw now why must you lard yourself like a joint for the oven old thing surely you wouldnt have me wrinkled creams and mudbaths are useless let me send you for a facelift to harold gillies if you let me send you for monkeygland treatment to professor voronoff in monte carlo were not going to monte oh eliot you know londons absolutely empty after christmas dont be cross he grinned dropping his hand theres something worth staying to enjoy im to be made a lord she drew in her breath and our eldest son shall become a lord and his eldest son and so on for ever and ever dawson told me while we were waiting for the king to die oh were two real professionals dawson and i hes to be a viscount the only medical man to reach it its the age we live in isnt it ever since macdonalds socialist cabinet appeared in their kneebreeches at buckingham palace or does it prove again that a doctors reputation depends on the distinction of those dying in his care nancy kissed him so im to be a lady twice over well how do i live it down in the states youll be the envy of new york americans are crazy on titles have you seen the rapture of a bishop from the midwest called my lord at a london dinner party she was sitting upright everyone will say you did it through my money ill tell them that first no doctor hides the truth dawson wants me with him and lloyd george in germany next september to meet herr hitler surely hes not for those awful nazis she exclaimed only on the keepfit level he thinks our unemployed should have compulsory physical jerks dawson fancies himself as a politician well i did once we fail because we imagine everyones mind as disinfected of emotion as a doctors hitler will make a dreadful fool of him eliot pulled off the heavy silklined tail coat he had been wearing almost twentyfour hours nancy asked what was the end like imperceptible lang appeared in his cassock to say some prayers does it better a man in heaven being seen off by the archbishop of canterbury or by the chaplain of pentonville jail as i watched the king die i found myself thinking quite ridiculously about our old friend crippen though the prison chaplain doesnt say prayers eliot recalled he reads the burial service which is rather kicking a man when hes down dont you think the chaplains farewell would stand a man better in hell where presumably crippen went thank god the poor little fellow didnt hear the authorities bury him no more than subsequently feeling them hang him if he swallowed your dose im sure of it i heard from campion the prison medical officer eliot drew his white shirt over his head id not be attending his majesty tonightnor entering the house of lords next monthwithout that nasty little murder twentysix years ago in hilldrop crescent if charlotte corday hadnt murdered marat in his bath napoleon would be remembered only as a competent artillery officer i do wish youd forget that crippen episode who could when paul martinetti died in algiers a dozen years ago the times said only crippen case recalled yet he was famous on the halls before you and i knew him its as hard as leigh hunt being only remembered as shelleys friend and i really think crippen didnt murder her you thought so then because we were terribly romantic we were terrible hypocrites i certainly wasnt bogus i honestly wanted to devote my life to the sick there isnt room for more than one florence nightingale in the century my dear anyway she was a dreadful woman she saved the lives of the rabble by driving good men to their graves he unstrapped his wristwatch you neednt look twice at the time tomorrow his new majesty king edward viii has put the clock back at sandringham his first act on accession is that significant nancy slipped under the bedclothes and no one in england knows about wallis simpson no one no one common i mean shell be the next queen pourquoi pas edwards the first british monarch to fly why not the first to wed a twicedivorced american god im dead beat quite suddenly my inner supply of adrenalins given out itll be getting light in half an hour just think of those poor blighters of reporters shivering the night away inspecting the decorative ironwork of the gates at the end of the drive it wasnt crippen who led you here my darling said nancy sleepily it was accidentthe next compartment to mine being empty in the wagonlit from basle to calais accident he exclaimed i knew perfectly well at the time youd engineered it well youve waited long enough to tell me no woman cares to believe that she contributed to her own seduction no more than any child cares to stop believing in father christmas he yawned this place depresses me ive ordered the bugatti at the door by eleven on a may morning in two young women of surpassing beauty were travelling in a greyupholstered firstclass compartment on the express which followed the littoral from geneva to lausanne from the fertile meadows in la cфte cows belled like circus animals looked up with tolerant curiosity the sprouting hayfields were speckled by yellow mauve and white flowers the houses with topheavy roofs clustered at every crossroads all looked brand new the only cloud was the belch of the engine shredded in a breeze which broke the surface of lake geneva into glittering ripples decorated with white paddlesteamers and yachts there is always winter somewhere in switzerland but it had lurked to its lair in the mountains i guess im a total fraud jane grange was twentyone in a weeks time fair freshfaced blueeyed everyone called her baby her sister nancy was almost two years older both wore the neodirectoire fashion which had reached new york from paris the previous fall baby had a grey scarletlined travellingcoat over a narrow anklelength pink merino dress her widebrimmed felt hat with a panache of pinkdyed ostrich feathers nancy wore a green cape a navyblue serge jacket with tight skirt a hat equally large with crimson muslin roses and bigdotted veil the sisters had renounced petticoats and baby even wore the latest fishnet stockings maybe theyll take one look at you and send you right back home to new york nancy agreed then i should feel an even bigger fraud shouldnt i making all that fuss coming all this way for absolutely nothing how should i ever live it down it wouldnt be embarrassing at all everyone would be so glad to see you back yes i guess so said baby animatedly wed have the most wonderful party in the world why i can still hold my ball cant i it wouldnt be too late we can use the same invitations i never threw them away she looked through the window over the coast road across the lake excitement flickered from her face both knew there was no chance of being turned away is that mont blanc its mont salиve they call it the cabdrivers mont blanc tourists get bilked taking an afternoon trip thats so mariathйrиse mademoiselle mariathйrиse lascalle sat in a long black alpaca coat and black straw bonnet clutching a large black handbag as though expecting to be robbed like many middleaged frenchwomen consecutive mourning for remote relations allowed economy in dress she had been engaged in paris through familiarity with english and with switzerland her english had become worse and her taciturnity greater during the journey but ladies travelling without a maid could neither attract respect not keep their own she said she knew nothing about the taxicabs oh all mountains look the same to me baby dismissed the skyline pettishly across the buttonedcloth seats lay their rolled tartan rugs spined with a cluster of parasols and umbrellas a pair of goldclasped alligator dressingcases nancys handbag of goldthreaded tapestry babys of mink trimmed with its tails baby slowly turned the pages of the illustrated london news the only magazine available in english she was perplexed at the ceremonious punctillious heartland of the worlds greatest empire a country which had previously crossed neither of their thoughts nancy looked up from elinor glyns three weeks which she had bought in the boulevard stmichel and which was banned in boston did you take your temperature this morning baby gasped hand to mouth i forgot oh darling its the first thing theyll ask does it matter baby asked frivolously theyll probably want to make a fresh start and ive been so good at taking it well quite good i guess its not the nicest part of your toilet how do you feel now fine i could swim the lake you sweated last night it was hot last night in geneva dont say it like that darling you sound as if you are accusing me of being naughty im sorry i dont want you to do anything foolhardy thats all they changed at lausanne nancy and baby lunched at the station buffet which they heard were the best places to eat in switzerland mariathйrиse arranged transfer of their dozen pieces of baggage and was given a franc for a cassecroыte the next train was short without corridors the firstclass compartments lined with shiny black leather the stubby engine with a conical smokestack like american ones panted out billows of black as they climbed among fields with more cows stopping at every station some no more than a white hut and a signboard the waiting passengers a man or two in blue blouse and beret smoking a long thin crooked cigar a woman in a shawl with a milk churn or a crate of live geese pasture turned to rocky grass the cows were replaced by goats baby complained she was cold and had mariathйrиse unwrap the tartan rug they went through tunnels quickly pulling the windows tight against the acrid smoke they looked down the valleys at bright torrents trickles in summer now fed by the melting snow and fierce enough to shift the boulders the train circled the waist of a mountain its piercing whistle echoing off the rock and they unexpectedly found themselves in the terminus of champette the station was a sturdilyroofed shed across the cobbled square a fourstorey stone building bore in gold letters hotel grand palais de champette nancy decided the grandeur was relative to the villagehalf the size of oyster bay the setting of their long island house nancy sent mariathйrиse with the hotel concierge and luggagecart she must accompany baby to her journeys end a closed carriage with a pair of horses was waiting a man in goldbraided grey uniform supervised stowing the luggage settled the sisters on the leather upholstery and solemnly tucking a rug round them climbed with the driver on the box baby was flushed and tired but grew livelier as they jogged up a narrow paved road that twisted through a steep dark pine forest its like fairyland she exclaimed in fairyland theres always a forest like this with a turretted castle in the middle containing a beautiful princess their castle was on a broad ledge of the mountain a long thin building facing south each of its seven storeys had a dozen tall shutterless windows looking on deep balconies edged with whitepainted iron railings a broad gravel forecourt ran to a wooden fence guarding the drop to the village below from the flagpole in the middle the red cross on a white ground snapped loudly in the mountain breeze they stopped under a glass canopy covering a flight of steps sweeping off his cap the man in uniform opened the plateglass doubledoors which protected from draughts a square white lobby transfixed by four slender pillars electric bulbs hung in clusters of curly brass the floor was covered with coconut matting a tall stooping man in a brown suit broke his conversation with a woman in a yellow pullover both inspecting the newcomers with solemn curiosity the lobby smelt of carbolic with eau de cologne which disguised it no more successfully than it generally succeeded with human sweat from a desk to their left a young man in a frock coat approached with eager servility miss grange nancy noticed a wide deep scar running from the angle of his jaw and disappearing into his wing collar welcome to the clinique laлnnec he left them in a whitepainted room with an expensive tapestry sofa and so many chairs that they indicated its use for waiting it was dark looking north over a small garden at the mountainside a maid in black bombasine with lace apron and starched cap brought a large silver tray with teapot kettle on spiritlamp buttered toast on a dish warmed with hot water cream gateaux and the delicate spicy biscuits which voltaire called pets de nonne nuns farts they must think were english said nancy what do you suppose this is baby had been looking around inquisitively she picked from a ledge in the corner a whiteenamelled metal cup with a lid like a german tankard she opened it with her thumb wrinkling her nose its got carbolic slopping about do you suppose its to fumigate the atmosphere she lost interest in it and stared in silence through the window at the alps europes last savage land barely scratched by the roads and houses of the busily civilizing swiss and which killed with equal contempt intruders seeking amusement excitement health or life the disease had struck baby like a bulletwound she was hurrying from her bedroom in their fathers house on fifth avenue and th street when something warm and salty gushed in her mouth she spat into her washbasin a demitasse of bright blood and instantly she knew that she was seriously ill when the shock and confusion the family alarm the urgent traffic of doctors had subsided baby treated her sickness with the persevering frivolity which she applied to the world it was an affectation which she discovered in childhood won her easy attraction and which she preserved as her defiance against a life which often frightened her highspirited friends at her bedside were divided in thinking her extremely brave or extremely stupid they left new york in april in brass and mahogany comfort aboard the french lines bretagne for le havre their father had impatiently wanted them aboard the brandnew fourfunnelled lusitania with prototype steamturbines which could cross the atlantic in four and a half days even john grange could not bribe cunard to divert the liner from her passage to liverpoolwhich she continued to ply until torpedoed off ireland by the u six years later the sisters had violent quarrels why shouldnt she stay up to dance play tombola join in the ships concert baby demanded when she would spend weeks perhaps months in a gloomy swiss clinic baby gave in but the row sent up her temperature which crushed nancy with guilt they had another quarrel in paris they were staying a night at the crillon but baby spat more blood nancy summoned the hotel doctor who called a professor with a legion dhoneur rosette in his buttonhole baby demanded to return home as you wish mademoiselle the professor shrugged but your family will welcome you as a corpse baby sulked in bed for three weeks propped with pillows gazing through the long windows at the fiacres motor taxis touring cars and limousines the carts drays and bicycles the motorbuses which were ousting the threehorse omnibuses all swirling round the obelisk from luxor in the middle of the place de la concorde a luxury hotel is a better place to be ill than a hospital the service is to be commanded not begged the outside world intrudes instead of being regarded as irrelevant and the days hours remain in the possession of the patient baby declared the food disgusting she wanted quaker oats scrambled eggs tomato ketchup she had nothing to read no life mccalls ladies home journal nancy had before carried no responsibility weightier than arranging her fathers dinnerparties she now never flinched from managing her sister however unsisterly it made her feel the relationship between the sick and those who minister to them is often more complex and infuriating than marriage the door of the clinique laлnnecs waitingroom opened without a knock a tall handsome young man with a thick moustache strode in he wore a pair of khaki drill trousers like a british officer in india a norfolk jacket of grey tweed a soft turneddown collar and a floppy crimson bow tie as favoured by minor poets under his arm was a cardboard boxfile miss janet grange he said to baby and you must be the sister whos accompanying her across the face of the earth he added to nancy im dr eliot beckett im english monsieur le directeur will be along once hes finished in the operating theatre the sisters sat straight on the sofa still in their hats they had enjoyed the tea eliot lazily sat in an armchair opposite long legs crossed file on his knee i had a letter from dr hull in new york you coughed blood miss grange when did the blow fall a tuesday morning in the middle of march baby was practised in her story i was going to a final fitting at my dressmakers you see it was to be my twentyfirst birthday we were having a wonderful ball absolutely everyone in new york was invited she saw the doctor smile i mean not actually everyone in new york that would be four million people wouldnt it but everyone who mattered in new york oh it was to be a heavenly evening babys eyes shone it could have been held tomorrow theyd already started decorating the ballroom there were to be two orchestras viennese and a negro bandhow i had to persuade father the chef from delmonicos was taking charge of our kitchens she stopped the invitations had all gone out she ended quietly you can imagine it was very embarrassing i congratulate you on your sense of social obligation miss grange giving thought to the effect of their illness upon others is an unusual quality among invalids but why trail to switzerland the air is just as pure in the appalachians as in the alps nancy replied my father knew the fame of switzerland in curing the disease no expense spared you fathers very rich i could never ask an english lady that without risking a snubbing like an express hitting the buffers in america youre rightly proud to achieve the worlds hearts desire whats your fathers business he is a banker nancy was irritated the doctor talked as though on their social level eliot uncapped his fountainpen for ten minutes he questioned baby about her healthher weight her sleep the life she led the friends she made did she sweat at night was she afflicted by catarrhs had any of her family suffered from phthisis it was the first time he had named the disease i heard my grandmother died of a cough can you remember what the doctor called it she had no doctor nancy interrupted she died in a slum on the east side shed been in the united states less than a year so all has been amassed by your fathers singleminded efforts thats something deserving of congratulations quite as much as writing huckleberry finn i doubt if your grandmother suffered from consumption she had recently arrived and the vigilance of your immigration officers is feared across europe the door reopened admitting a tall thin man with scanty fair hair brushed from a domed brow above a pale face of hollows and furrows he wore a long white coat buttoned from his wingcollar to the ends of striped trousers above brightly polished black shoes and lavender spats he bowed introducing himself as dr pasquier director of the clinic speaking briskly with a strong french accent he led them through a second door into an identical white room with fearsome furnitureflat leather couch half hidden by a white curtain on a brass rail a white table with large bottles of coloured fluids and heavy china pots an enamelled basin on a tripod a tray with a white cloth bearing small shiny instruments of menacingly probing shape a nurse was waiting ugly and fat in white dress stockings and shoes her flowing white cap with a red cross on the forehead nancy noticed another lidded cup on its shelf eliot wordlessly offered nancy a hard wooden chair removing her hat baby was placed in the centre on a padded leather seat with no arms its straight narrow back reaching above her head the nurse inserted a thermometer under her tongue they waited three minutes dr pasquier pulled a pincenez dangling from his lapel its black ribbon hissing from springloaded drum mademoiselle has a fever of thirtyeight degrees he announced as politely as paying a compliment a hundred point four farenheit eliot translated even figures speak a different language here in the mountains what was it this morning mademoiselle i didnt take it baby looked guiltily at nancy mademoiselle will please remove her upper garments repetition had made baby a deft and stylish undresser nancy suspected that she revelled in performing the forbidden with impunity as though an artists model rather than a doctors specimen the embroidered lacetrimmed white silk camisole slipped from her shoulders she unlaced and discarded the heavy cotton brassiиre crisscrossed with ribbons bought with her divided stays from bloomingdales dr pasquier was saying everyone is liable to be seeded with the bacillus if the soil is fertile a tubercule will sprout many are lucky and it falls upon stony ground has mademoiselle been obliged to mix with many others in a school or college nancy replied our mother died at my sisters birth we were schooled at home and my father thought further education unnecessary has your sister performed charity work among the poor never she glanced at eliot she had taken a dislike to this abrasive english doctor he was writing busily on his boxfile hands loose on her lap thick blonde hair piled high baby sat with selfconscious submissiveness her skin was white to the wrists her breasts smooth as lard were decorated with large nipples the colour of fresh salmon under the fair hairs of her armpits lay a glistening patch the tears of her fever dr pasquier surprised her by taking both hands ungues adunci he murmured clubbed fingers you see mademoiselle the nails are unusually convex from base to tip they curve over the fingers end like a parrots beak no one noticed it baby shook her head well up here we have sharper eyes for such things than doctors who must treat an assembly of diseases will they get better asked baby in alarm or shall i be deformed for life they progress with the state of mademoiselles health he answered vaguely he felt her neck no enlarged glands he announced in his complimentary voice eliot stood close beside him both gazed solemnly at babys chest the bony birdcage of whispering lungs and ticking heart from life to death unnoticed by its possessors as the whirling of the earths globe beneath their feet upon which the attention of the clinique laлnnec was obsessively fixed and from which its income was drawn the right apex said eliot diminished movement baby licked her lips several times head cocked dr pasquier lay a finger flat under her collarbone and percussed nancy suddenly saw the elderly italian in the carefullykept old suit who came every month to tune their pianos dr pasquier produced an ebonite stethoscope like a vase for a single rose listening to babys chest with eyebrows raised and lips pursed as if savouring some excellent wine baby could think only of her nails turning into parrots beaks thank you dr pasquier bowed from the hips as though baby had just afforded him a dance there is diminished breathing he looked rapidly from one sister to the other with rвlesabnormal soundsnot found by your american doctors but as i mentioned we have sharper eyes and ears because we hunt but one animal in the jungle of sickness there isshall i say a suspicion of a moist patch at the very top of the right lung we may be wrong we must examine the sputum she coughs up to see if the tubercule bacillus lurks therein we shall look inside with rцntgen rayswe have every modern convenience here you see meanwhile mademoiselle is advised to enjoy our hospitality for a while how long baby still sat halfnaked ive just got to be back in new york by the middle of summer i assure mademoiselle that we are equally eager to lose her company dr pasquier bowed again that day will be expedited by her not fretting about it you will please excuse me dr beckett will see you comfortably installed what a pretty little room baby clasped her hands eyes shining nancy its like the one we used to share at oyster bay when we were kids it was a nasty little room it was a white cube smaller than nancys bathroom on fifth avenue the wardrobe was narrow the white dressingtable had a plain oval mirror the square washbasin in one corner had stout brass taps and a white sloppail under it the bed was in the middle whitepainted iron with a white coverlet on large wheels with brakes from the ceiling hung an electric bulb in a shade like a saucer the floor was covered with more coconut matting on the bedside commode was a nightlight with a squat candle and another of the lidded cups on the capacious balcony stood a long chair with folded blankets as aboard transatlantic liners it was one of the sanatoriums best rooms on the ground floor looking across the gravel forecourt with the flapping flag it cost swiss francs a week but its freezing complained baby the shadows of the conifers opposite were pointing long fingers towards the creeping dusk nancy laid her hand on the cold radiator bitte die zentralheizung ist zu warm the fat nurse who had accompanied them shook her finger severely dr pasquier want good hygiene whats that smell babys nose wrinkled rдuchern ameisensдure the nurse waved her hand formalin they were interrupted by another whiteclad nurse young sandy freshfaced bustling chattering cheerfully so heres the new arrivals im nurse dove im from london thank you frдulein she dismissed her companion sweeping up babys travellingcoat and hanging it in the wardrobe well soon get you settled in comfy these are my rooms along this bit of the corridor but the frдuleins in charge of everybody youre from america arent you she started busily turning down the bed fancy that mind weve quite a few americans here its a long way to come but its wonderful these days with the steamships isnt it as i always say theres no place like switzerland for getting you back in the pink if youve a touched lung she closed the windows and drew the curtains you dont want to get into bed as though in the middle of piccadilly circus do you whose is this baby picked from the dressing table a silverbacked brush long fair hairs choking the bristles inscribed on the back to louisa from mummy and daddy on her twentyfirst birthday oh dear me that belonged to the young english lady i must have missed clearing it out yesterday with the rest of her things shes gone home to england baby sounded excited i wish i could say as much nurse dove pounded and smoothed the pillows no the poor lady died she was a bad case right from the start dr beckett couldnt do a thing for her she just went steadily downhill still thats exceptional the san does most people the world of good the rooms been thoroughly fumigated with formic acid she added consolingly she died baby gasped here yesterday folk are born and folk die thats the way of the world nurse dove checked the candle in the nightlight theyre the only two things every soul must go through and i dont suppose we realise that either has happened to us whats the point making your whole life miserable by thinking about your departure from it dont leave me here dont leave me baby started crying clutching nancy fiercely youll be all right darling youll be fine youre hardly ill at all are you theres a lot that has a good cry when they first come in said nurse dove sympathetically but believe me in a day or two everything will seem so natural youll look upon it as your home from home after all theres all of us with nothing else to do except make you better put your sister to bed she said to nancy ill see the porter about the luggage and order her supper theres always something nice they sat on the bed baby shaking in nancys arms continually muttering dont leave me dont leave meim so frightened so frightened i know you are darling nancy stroked her hair youve been so brave right from the start putting on a show as though it was all some awful inconvenience like pouring rain when wed planned a tennis party baby tried not to think of the goldenhaired pale english miss eaten by disease to a skinbag of bones you are wonderful being so strict darling saving me from myself now a pack of strangers have suddenly become the most important persons in my life dont you see the doctors the nurses theyre above you even above father screw up your courage darling its flattering to know i have some thats the mood everyone gets married in isnt it she said a trace of usual gaiety they live happily ever after only because they dont care losing their own good opinion of their bravery nurse dove entered with the alligator dressing case not getting undressed yet she spoke as to a wayward child you have brought a lot of luggage but everybody does itll have to go in the storeroom im afraid what pretty things youve got she held up babys nightdress with the air of an experienced shopgirl at the counter go now nancy baby commanded im feeling stronger i might not in a little while the corridor outside was empty electric bulbs in dishlike shades supplemented the fading light nancy felt relieved and guilty as the door of the white room shut the sisters lives were divided she had abandoned to professionals the responsibility and irksomeness of controlling a capricious patient on a tiresome journey now she faced an indefinite stay in a remote swiss hotel with no company except an illtempered ladys maid an existence to which she had afforded neither planning nor even speculation nancy stopped behind another white door somebody barely two yards away started coughing it was a cough she had never heard before repeated but not paroxysmal long and rumbling a wet sticky uncomplaining cough which made her imagine a sack emptied of squashed and rotten potatoes it lasted near a quarter of a minute before ending in a sigh a hissing intake of breath then the sharp noise of a metal closing on metal which puzzled her nancy shivered gripping her skirt she hurried along the corridor a slim woman in a long black serge skirt and white blouse was leaving the examination room her face was a crimson scaly mask the tip of her nose blunted like a boxers her eyelids drawn down to show their gleaming pink lining tightly stretched skin tugging her lips and revealing her gums in a smile as gruesome as a skeletons eliot was seeing the patient out miss grange is your sister comfortable youre leaving for your hotel ill order the carriage he sat nancy on the hard chair took the ebonitehandled telephone from its cradle whirred the handle of the wooden box beneath and spoke briefly in french unhappily all three of the clinics carriages are at the station or the village so you must wait a while eliot leant with his back to the radiator hands clasped over beige shirtfront he seemed slightly more affable that poor woman has the disease in her face nancy asked yes you are right the disease its the only one existing up here the guests all have it the servants have all shaken it off did you notice the scar on the receptionists neck the cunning tubercule bacillus has as many manifestations as the devil it can swell the neck glands like a string of blind boils it can inflame the joints like rheumatism and gout or hoarsen the voice like an everlasting cold she had lupus vulgarus he nodded towards the door though some still dispute it i reckon it a tuberculosis cutis why was my sister given a room where a woman had just died nancy demanded there was no other the sanatorium is always full to get a bed is as great a privilege as in the most fashionable hotel there was no need that she should have known about it eliot shrugged less need to deceive her she would have learned from another patient by breakfast they think nothing of it and soon neither will she shell make a joke of it they develop the humour of the cannons mouth why not they are all soldiers fighting the same enemythe tubercule bacillus the patients give battle not us we are powerless we can only provide the most promising battlefield and lay the most intelligent strategy nancy began to complain indignantly but my sister is here for treatment treatment there is only one treatment for phthisis he threw open the long window fresh air thats what your father is paying for paying thousands of dollars for air if he sat and thought about it hed fancy himself mad or us brazen swindlers dr beckett your attitude is unattractive in a medical man to whose care is committed a young lady with a disease which her family knowquite as well as you doas dangerous to her life eliot looked disconcerted im sorry to give that impression he said with unexpected awkwardness were i not driven by compassion for those who are sick and for those who must bear with them do you imagine i should be here she was sitting straight legs crossed under her long skirt showing her ankles eliot seemed to regard her for the first time as an object worth his interest i could instead be turning guineas from the imaginary illnesses of london society ladies and the very real excesses of london gentlemen though i pity them too but in a different way how long must my sister be up here the rest of the summer the rest of the year we never mention time in the mountains it does not exist the length of our patients sentence means nothing compared to their escaping as cured pining over the calendar puts up the temperature and is streng verboten doing nothing but breathing the air asked nancy tartly they live in it night and day sleeping tuckedup on the balcony covered with rubber sheets against the rain guarded by iron screens from the winds miss grange will be allowed exercise in strict moderation no indulgence in exciting games and recreations which includes the most popular game of all les affaires de coeur our patients are thrown on each others company as though aboard a liner at sea and fever fires the passions like sea breezes are you shocked that patients remain human hardly perhaps the urge to flirt is an expression of spes pthisica eliot reflected the strange hope which our patients never lose if i could but rid myself of this cough they say i should be healthy enough to climb the matterhorn or swim the english channel the consumption is a flattering disease cozening men into hope of long life at the last gasp an english clergyman called thomas fuller noticed that almost three hundred years ago my sister is hopeful hers is not displaced she is a slight case but she must surrender herself to us as utterly as a novice to her faith surely theres some drug to speed her release creosote guaiacol wafers kochs tuberculin the very hair of the deadly dog eliot recited scathingly ive tried tuberculin but it grows the bacilli like a wasps nest in the sunshine she looked at him steadily there is a drug which will cure phthisis dr beckett its name would be a priceless extension of my education do you know of munyons homoeopathic remedies of new york eliot shook his head violently its a company on th avenue it does business all over the world among my fathers interests is the manufacture of medicines after my sister fell ill he heard from professor munyon that their general managera homoeopathic physician trained in michiganhad discovered a cure for phthisis whats his name dr crippen for the past five years hes been representing the firm in london i intend travelling there as soon as my sister is settled to beg a sample off him my father says the formula is secret lest it be stolen by a rival firm before plans are ripe to sell it i know the nametuberculozyne eliot responded to this revelation only by saying the carriage must be back now nancy remembered her coat in the waitingroom she reached for the lidded cup on its ledge asking its use for spit eliot opened it inside now swum in the fluid three round blobs like small oysters nancys stomach turned over the nummular sputum of phthisis he explained round and flat like coins if the spit dries on the floor or a handkerchief the bacilli waft away and look for another little nook of lung to settle into its the first rule up here everyone spits into disinfectant doing otherwise is a social error far worse than eating peas off your knife for patients who go out or whose offerings we value for a lengthy look we provide a neat pocket spitoon in blue glass with a screw cap the gravel was empty the sky was almost dark lights burned behind the balconies come and see the view eliot invited unceremoneously from the white fence an escarpment fell two hundred feet to the village of champette we sell the purest sort of air he told her better than those nests of sanitoria at st moritz or arosa or davos half way to heaven already were under fifteen hundred metres where the atmosphere is more humid and the construction costs less the clinic is owned by a joint stock company you know quoted on the zurich stock exchange phthisis is good business nancy shivered in her overcoat eliot was apparently impervious to the night chill i think sanatoria above the treeline beside the regions of eternal snow are frightening they have to send the corpses down by sledbut youd rather not speak of such things maybe ill acquire your patients hardihood and joke about it troops under fire prefer to scoff than tremble where are you staying miss grange the grand nancy tried distinguishing its lights below whats it like ive never entered it in twelve months i catch the dance music ascending sometimesthe valleys are enormous eartrumpets you can hear the cowbells from the pasturage far down such a swiss sound as dismal as bellbuoys on rocks i would not care for the company the hotel provided then why come to practise here dr beckett your patients are all rich and the company of rich people seems to affect you like that of corsican brigands im learning about tuberculosis on the rich that i might apply my knowledge to the poor he answered simply the labouring classes are the worst sufferers and unfortunately cant cure themselves by seeking a change of climate they lie in bed in their only room spitting their germs over the family which shares it like a cloud of deadly gas every single workman who develops phthisis probably gives it to a dozen more thats not just tragic its uneconomical which should strike forcibly such a man as your father your tenderness towards the poor is admirable dr beckett your envy of the rich is not her remark seemed to jolt him the only people i envy are those cleverer than myself im unlike you i know both rich and poor im sorry for the rich they live an uninteresting artificial life because they are more frightened of the real world even than of losing their money might i suggest that you are too selfopinionated dr beckett an intelligent rich girl suffers equally with a poor one that she cannot go to college and learn about the real world eliot smiled have i misjudged you miss grange i hope during your enforced stay you will afford me opportunity to rectify my mistake they heard the jingle of the coach its lights flickering through the trees before it crunched on the gravel when may i visit my sister whenever you wish well keep her in bed for a bit until we see what tricks her temperatures playing remember the disease is catching dont stand in the way of her cough why dont you catch it we and the nurses seem immune familiarity breeds contempt i suppose he added offhandedly i finish here with the end of summer ive work waiting in london what was the name of that american doctor dr crippen i could look him up for you hes probably a quack your rushing to england would be worse than a fools errand it would raise your sisters hopes cruelly nancy had stepped into the coach eliot shut the door and turned to the sanatorium entrance without glancing back eliot was a shy young man reared among the rich but never of them he had no graces to soften his resentment when thrust among them socially the patients were easy he had the bluff kindly infinitely confident and uncontradictable manner which carried the english doctor into the heart of the english family in a nation which venerated commonsense as much as it distrusted cleverness their relatives he generally found boring and petulant nancy intrigued him she was neither pretentious nor patronizing she answered him back with intelligence instead of arrogance but he distrusted his ability for small talk he knew the likelihood of seeming rude and provoking anger he avoided her rich people anyway frightened him he had viewed too intimately their power when the july sun glared from the gravel forecourt and shortened the shadow of the flagpole baby was allowed up for lunch the diningroom shared the first upstairs floor with the patients lounge which had a grand piano a gramophone with a horn crettonecovered furniture and scattered small tables with magazines in halfadozen languages they ate between white walls on white chairs off linen fresh every meal even the food seemed whiteminced chicken cream sauces potato soup gruyere cheese served by maids in white dresses whose scarred neck or limp displayed their own escape from the disease which would eventually kill many of their patrons babys day repeated itself to the minute the monotony was deliberate energy of body and mind were preserved for the cure at eight nurse dove took her temperature the morning she divided between novels from the sanatorium library and laboriously creating a spray of red roses on an embroidery framethe clinic employed a sharpnosed parisienne to instruct their lady patients the gentlemen enjoyed instead fifteen minutes pounding from a swedish masseur there was an english breakfast and an english tea with hot toast and swiss cherry jam on sundays her dinnertray was decorated with a vase of bright wild flowers which the previous week she was mystified to find replaced by the stars and stripes it was july the fourth and all national days were monitored by la direction as all birthdays were marked by a huge cream cake and a bottle of champagne with the clinics compliments ive still got rвles at my apex but they dont signify much baby told nancy brightly and dullness of my infraclavicular fossa here she tapped below her right collarbone she wore a white silk blouse and a white flannel skirt secured with huge gold safetypins white stockings and white kid boots a broadbrimmed straw hat was secured on her piled fair hair with a wide ribbon of cambridge blue she wore the same outfit the year before for tennis parties at oyster bay she was on the steamer chair with an open parasol which she twirled gently over her shoulder the balcony had a parquet floor and a white ceiling with squares boxing a leaf design which she counted everlastingly it was afternoon rest time for everyone in the sanatorium and ive cogwheel respiration baby continued can you imagine dr becket says it sounds like a cogwheel jerking round right there in my chest but no bronchial breathing she ended proudly and thats awfully good you know you are becoming well educated nancy smiled sitting on a chair beside her oh we all know quite as much as the doctors and my temperature this morning was nearly normal wonderful isnt it everyones crazy about their temperature the thermometers our clock isnt it it measures how much longer weve got to spend up here i had a cable from papa this morning mails were disregarded every morning nancy handed a telegram to the guard of the departing train which the geneva post office transmitted to new york to arrive on her fathers breakfast table she tried hard to vary her messages generally as unexcitingly repetitive as military communiquйs from a longdrawn siege hes making the trip the angel when when he can you know how it is with papa oh business baby wrinkled her nose sometimes i wonder if he thinks were just a part of it look at my nails arent they awful real parrots beaks as dr pasquier said im going to send for the best manicurist in new york the moment i step off the boat loud knocking came on babys left the balconies were divided by screens of folding whitepainted iron panels six feet high with a decorative scroll on the top darling can i visit said a girls eager voice baby whispered lady sarah pledge shes the daughter of an earl and the only thing shes crazy about in the whole world is foxhunting shes moved into the next room were already as close as an indian hug oh sure she called my sisters here lady sarah pushed aside the screen she was babys age unnaturally slender her eyes large and grey her skin waxy like a lily petal she wore a cream silk blouse and a crimsonstriped cotton skirt shes got a pneumothorax baby introduced her they pump air into ones chest through a needle lady sarah explained lightheartedly it collapses down ones lung to a little lump sos it can heal better you need only one lung to breathe you know my room still stinks of that fumigating stuff she added to nancy the russian count snuffed it two days ago absolutely torrential haemorrhage according to nurse dove though she does so exaggerate in her relish about such things nancy felt her stomach tighten it was the russian she heard coughing the day they arrived she could not assume the inmates easygoing mockery of death for that death must intrude into every days action and thought it was the relationship of marriage ive news for you old thing lady sarah continued theyre going to see through us the rцntgen rays baby was excited she was always eager for a new experience and anything breaking the sanatoriums monotony was a gala i heard from nurse dove its quite weird down there one sees the diapositives with ones skeleton looking like something out of a ghost story she broke off coughing her sharp shoulders shaking her skin taking a tinge of blue she covered her mouth with her hands turning her back on the others in obeyance of sanatorium etiquette as the paroxysm subsided she took from her skirt pocket a round blue bottle into which she spat slimy green mucus what a bore she wheezed it was the condemnation of the english for any annoyance from a late train to a mortal illness nurse dove shortly fussed baby back to bed cards recitals amateur concerts in the lounge filled the evenings but baby had to wait like a child impatient to stay up for adult enjoyments that evening was hot the red cross flag dangling lifeless from the masthead the carriage was waiting on the gravel a white linen cover to cool the roof the horse in a straw hat with holes for its ears at the foot of the steps dr beckett in his tweed jacket and poets tie was chatting to the bluebloused driver i gather my sister is to be examined by the rцntgen rays said nancy yes we shall look inside to see whats going on rather than imagining it from tapping and listening why should physicians be blind men are the rays dangerous not in the right hands do you expect to find anything disconcerting if i knew what i should see it would not be worth the trouble of the examination the concierge opened the carriage door eliot added you must find life at champette dreadfully tedious not at all im learning french my maid helps with the pronunciation though i suspect she has a vile parisien accent im also learning watercolouring from the wife of a british major every monday i go into lausanne all excitements in life are relative arent they you cant spend all your time swotting french i am blessed with plenty of books and plenty of friends who must be written to are you making new ones i prefer not making friends under duress ill come and dine with you tomorrow night nancy looked shocked ill pay my own bill naturally you may invite yourself to dine in the hotel restaurant dr beckett but not in my company oh come he disposed of the objection if you saw me sitting on one side of the room with my inevitable potage de legumes youd invite me to join you surely i shall be there at eight he helped her into the carriage shut the door and strode into the building nancy was outraged no man in new york dared break into her company no more than into her fathers banks she was puzzled she had heard that all englishmen were desperately punctillious so terrified of doing the wrong thing even if it was wearing the wrong hat the carriage had not rattled down the winding road before she was smiling at eliots selfinvitation he was as gauche as a raw college boy but she was bored and she was lonely anyway champette was a social desert island where no civilized rules applied she instructed mariathйrиse to press her pink chiffon gown not worn since leaving new york for a woman to dress up without a man to impress was like cooking a splendid dinner to eat herself most of her jewellery was in new york nancy selected the next evening from her crocodile jewelcase a triple string of pearls which had cost twenty thousand dollars and two single black pearl earrings worth twelve hundred and fifty she came downstairs slowly one white gloved hand gathering her skirt the other gently waving her grey ostrichfeather fan in the hall were two english couplesa major and a solicitor with pallid scrawny wives who nancy found indistinguishablejust returned with wild flowers from walking there was the jolly family from lyons on whom she practised her french and the solemn one from frankfurt who practiced their english to her they stared like the urchins on the new york sidewalks watching the gorgeous rich gather for a ball the frockcoated receptionist craned across his counter the concierge amid a pile of luggage involuntarily whipped off his cap she wondered if dr beckett would be wearing his usual shootingjacket eliot appeared in a long black cape like a cavalry officers its deep collar secured by a chain he handed it to the concierge with a widebrimmed velour hat and a small square lantern he wore a dinner jacket of unmatchable london cut diamond studs in his shirt front his tie as symmetrical as a butterfly she was amused at his startled look the dress was cut low across her bosom in the latest american fashion may i congratulate you on your gown miss grange it must quite overawe this nation of petits bourgeois as if the snow had miraculously melted and revealed the magnificent peak of the matterhorn i imagined you looked at a chest with the emotions of a watchmaker at a watch dr beckett even one of that unimaginative profession is moved by a fabergй clock is this the gibson girl silhouette we read is all the rage in america i thought everyone knew that the outdoor girl had replaced the gibson girl she corrected him because of the automobile you know women have taken to driving them we apply freshly cut cucumber to soothe the suntan and smooth the dreaded automobile wrinkles but really dr beckettwould my dress shock a nation which stands idly by while fathers shoot apples off their sons heads perhaps only the expense would which i suppose is necessary to keep up with the four hundred only vulgar people talk about the four hundred dr beckett it was nothing but the capacity of mrs astors ballroom are you retaining your carriage i walked its a splendid evening i always take the path down the cliff to the village theyve marked the stones at every turn with white paint ive brought an acetylene so i shant break my neck in the dark two whitejacketed commis threw open the glass doors of the hotel restaurant i hear that in american society a lady considers a dress allowance of five thousand dollars a year as reducing her to rags eliot resumed all the families in champette could be kept comfortably on that and i hear that two hundred million dollars worth of diamonds are suspended from the necks bosoms and stomachs of the new york females you could run the whole of switzerland on that i assume your father is a millionaire oh theres seven thousand millionaires in america dr beckett there are millionaires then there are multimillionaires and then pittsburg millionaires they sat at a corner table eliot was amused to notice everyone forget their food to stare at them they seemed a rich and smart young couple more likely to be encountered at some fashionable hotel on the quai du montblanc in geneva isnt the definition of a millionaire the ability to live off the income of your income eliot asked in new york it is only spending the income of a million dollars whether you have either do you know the granges dont even possess a twoton bathtub carved from solid marble like the astors how much wiser to watch the smart set outdoing each other with displays of wealth that only ruins the millionaires and makes millionaires of the tradesmen it doesnt prevent my father being villified in the newspapers as a ruthless man that can be a compliment it takes the same resolution to throw a man into a river as to leap in and pull him out of it why did you allow me to intrude on you tonight surely its a social distinction to sit at table with a wellborn englishman in new york noblemen charge to provide that honour for eager hostesses only the russian aristocracy do and im not wellborn youre looking at my dressstuds a comingofage gift from the duke of lincoln have you admired my clothes cut by the dukes tailor in savile row halfprice to provide a young man with impressive studs and a good tailor shows the grasp on essentials which brought the dukes family its fortune my father is the dukes agent his man of business attending to his houses and estates i was brought up staring through the plate glass dividing one station of life from another ive seen balls with ladies wearing dresses far richer than yours one woman made beautiful by fifty miserable starving ugly people ive seen good food transformed into diverting shapes and pretty colours by slaving cooks ive seen cosseted pheasants beaten into the air by halfstarved farmlabourers to be shot ive seen the cigars the champagne the waste my father saved every penny that i might escape and a spy never forgives his enemies the waiter is becoming impatient said eliot taking the menu youre very fluent in french she said admiringly as he ordered i try not to be good linguists are disreputable in england where only amateurism is trustworthy we believe like aristotle that a gentleman should be able to play the flutebut not too well dont englishwomen speak french to their milliners he ordered a bottle of dom perignon without bothering to take the wine list from the somelier why is it called the clinique laлnnec it had puzzled her since leaving new york is there a dr laлnnec dr rene theopile hyacinthe laлnnec he explained he invented the stethoscope he rolled up a quire of paper and listened to the patients chest which saved embarrassment applying his ear to the breastbones of plump young gentlewomen and his hair from lice in hospital he died a hundred years ago from phthisis why cant my sister have a pneumothorax like lady pledge her case is not suitable the waiter served their consommй а la cйlestine clear soup with scraps of savoury pancake is there no operation which might allow her to go home the earlier theres thoracoplasty collapsing the chest by snipping away the cage of ribs its the invention of george fowler an american surgeon i should have needed several months under his tuition before risking performing it as he died three years ago thats impossible yet you despise the remedy invented by dr crippen she accused him if it works i should buy a vat of it in london i intend achieving my two ambitions first to start a free clinic he revealed fashionable doctors learn their medicine on the poor in hospitals and expend the knowledge on the rich im reversing the process secondly im standing for parliament candidate for holloway in london labour of course theres bound to be an election soon our mr asquiths ministry has been creaking far too long wouldnt you be a little young as a member of parliament dr beckett mr pitt was a younger one my father believes that the only value of politicians is the amount necessary to bribe them eliot fell silent he was prouder than of his degrees of his selection by a committee mostly of railwaymen and the slaughtermen from the metropolitan cattle market in north london he had applauded since schooldays a line from the forgotten victorian author anthony trollopeit is the highest and most legitimate pride of an englishman to have the letters m p written after his name he was disappointed the disclosure left nancy undazzled his bristliness was a frightened hedgehogs he wondered if she despised him as common im going to london and im going to find dr crippen nancy resumed i must do all i can for my sister youve already done much so irresponsible a patient wouldnt have survived the journey without your watchfulness i know you take me for a woman who satisfies her conscience by dropping a dime every year into the salvation army christmas kettle but you know who i admire your miss florence nightingale you could pay a call when youre seeking dr crippen eliot suggested lightly shes ninety but still has people to tea hers is a life i would trade for mine how singularly unfortunate for you that the united states is not at the moment engaged in a war you dont take me seriously i hope youre not cross i refuse to be men never take women seriously because men wear vanity as dogs fur which makes life less bothersome because we get exactly what we want by stroking it the fivepiece hotel orchestra struck up wine women and song they could barely hear each other across the table they talked about trivial things both were becoming exhausted trying to impress the other the whole things a frightful bore said lady sarah pledge like sitting for ones photograph in bond street when i was presented at court last year i seemed to spend the entire summer wearing ball gowns in the afternoon and standing in horribly uncomfortable poses while little men kept disappearing under baize cloths like parrots i heard its a witches cavern flashes of lightning everything crackling and sizzling like green wood in the stove baby was zestfulparticularly as everyone told her it did not hurt in the slightest gee i could do with some coffee she complained patients for xray went breakfastless to prevent bubbles in the stomach nurse dove explained the pair sat with nancy in the waitingroom of the xray laboratory next to the patients writing room with its four identical ormoluscrolled imitation louis quatorze desks refurbished daily with spotless blotters and thick white stationery like all rooms unlet to patients it faced the profitless north the last door of the ground floor corridor lay just beyond it opened on a secret flight of steps to the basementwhitetiled like the kitchen with its chef de cuisine who could have earned as much in a luxury hotel in the basement the bodies were stored and sometimes anatomized if dr pasquier assessed them more interesting dead than alive and the relatives could be persuaded to agree the mortuary was reached by a broad corridor running the buildings length equally unknown to the patients bodies were brought down the lifts at night on rubberwheeled trolleys by stealthy porters nobody seemed to die in the clinique laлnnec they simply disappeared there was a death every two or three days the xray waiting room was cramped it had red plush chairs and offered worn copies of punch and gil bias its starkness brightened by a framed toulouselautrec poster of jane avril shaking a calf at the jardin de paris which nancy thought vulgar opposite waited a pale thin young frenchman with an oldfashioned imperial whose loose blue suit insinuated severe loss of weight another spitoon stood on its shelf it was past ten the morning after nancy dined with eliot they had arrived early but appointments were meaningless where time did not exist youre not scared dr becketts going to electrocute me baby looked slyly at her sister what a bitter man he is interrupted lady sarah who knew nothing of the dinner talking to hims like biting an unripe lemon surely englishmen are all scared of showing their emotions suggested nancy charitably i suppose so lady sarah agreed that would reduce them to appearing like ordinary members of the human race a nurse summoned through an inner door the frenchman who returned after fifteen minutes bowing politely next was lady sarah who reappeared smiling just a quick glance not a prolonged scrutiny which means good news she was experienced in the rontgen rays nancy accompanied baby the cramped room was filled with grotesque machinery on stout wooden tables gleaming brass festooned with white dials sprouting black wires in the middle was a tightstretched canvas on stout wooden legs reminding nancy of a circus acrobats trampoline below was an electric bulb the size of a goldfish bowl another was suspended above by wires and pulleys it was a room of perpetual night the windows blacked with paint the light from a cluster of electric bulbs in shades like glass tulips it had the dry pungent smell which nancy had noticed gusting from subway stations making her wonder what it was like down there eliot had shed his norfolk jacket for a long red apron and wore heavy gauntlets this useful little invention we owe to william rцntgen from the rhineland he had the pride of a man showing off a motorcar he was a dreamy sort of fellow but one november afternoon while experimenting with cathode rays he noticed they produced a gleam on a sensitive platinocyanide plate across the roomwith solid objects in between you see a scientist does not need genius he needs luck eliots manner gave no indication to nancy that they had ever met outside the sanatorium this is the latest coil set with mercury interrupter which produces excellent snapshots the nurse was helping baby undo a pinkandwhite striped blouse with blue tie in white starched collar nancys eyes met a metal cabinet bearing two grey glass plates transilluminated by powerful electric bulbs thats a ladys knee eliot indicated with the finger of his gauntlet you see the flat head of the tibia bone the great hinge of the femur rolling on it and the fibula tucked coyly behind like a shy child in a family photo the mist all round is the flesh which excites any gentleman privileged to set eyes on it the other disapositive is a pelvis a female one a mans is shaped like a puddingbasin a womans like a flat washbasin another human perhaps a succession of them must butt its way through that hole in the middle to join us in this world with an eagerness which must often seem misplaced nancy disagreed you may not enjoy every party dr beckett but its less fun not being invited she thought him unnecessarily sardonic that morning perhaps he wanted to prove himself immune to lowcut evening gowns baby was examined by the skiagraph standing against an oblong glass suspended by pullies her breasts flattened like two cakes of dough on a cooks board please excuse my gloves miss grange eliot said waggishly adjusting her position they prevent rцntgen ray dermatitis which would rot my hands away even scientific magic can turn against its sorcerers apprentice now breathe as though diving into fifty feet of water may your sister see your insides the nurse clicked out the electric light save a glowing ruby in the corner sparks and crackles came from the hightension coil nancy found herself looking through babys chest for a second her head swam she feared she might faint but eliot was saying calmly those twin domes at the bottom are the diaphragm the shelf that stops the organs of chest and belly becoming mixed like salami everyone thought it drew air into the lungs by contracting inwards towards that long shadow of the backbone like the iris of your eye in a strong light professor rцntgens rays show it moves up and down like a plunger the most welcome advances in medicine prove that our most stronglyheld preconceptions are utterly wrong deep breath nancy was intrigued by the dark shadows of ribs and spine the trademark of the gravedigger which no human could observe without the passing qualm of one day becoming reduced to it in the middle a dark shape reminded her of a squid puffing and shrinking regularly among the seaweed in the oceanographic institute on long island theres always something mystical about the human heart eliot remarked though its just a lump of muscle no more the seat of tender emotions than the biceps in silence his gloved finger briefly indicated the top of babys right lung but nancy could discern nothing the lights went on the screen faded its no worse than a fitting at the dressmakers baby declared am i nearer to going home we shall call for a little more of your patience eliot told her kindly but patience is not painful either is it im sure im a total fraud she was only halfflippant my temperatures the effect of my highlystrung nervous system everybody tells me im like that dont they nancy eliot sent her for a late breakfast a second one was served in midmorning to match the habits of the germans he led nancy through a second door into another small white room tiled halfway up below windows of frosted glass ran a long wooden laboratory bench stained with red blue and green dyes at the end of a small square sink with a tap like a swans neck on the bench stood a brass microscope with two eyepieces scattered round it threeinch oblongs of glass sheets of closelywritten foolscap and a pencil as though engrossing work had been interrupted in the middle of the room a stout zinctopped table was crammed with glassstoppered bottles of light coloured liquids eliot picked from the bench a wet glass xray plate lady sarah pledge he held it against the light you see on the left the chest is empty the lung deliberately collapsed like a tennisball on the rightyou observe that cavity round and fuzzyedged like a full moon through the cloud she has the disease on both sides a girl can live without one lung but not without two nancy asked why must this devil take only young lives would you like to look upon the devils face he indicated the microscope focus the fineadjustment screw you see those little red rods she drew a sharp breath thick as a snowstorm mycobacterium tuberculosis the germ which preoccupies us all here discovered by robert koch a kreisphysicus in the black forest a country doctor bored with rough journeys and loutish patients who turned to the intellectual delights of the microscope that was seventeen years ago and there are plenty of doctors who wont believe him they put it down to anything from heredity to bad drains its not everybody who cares to shuffle their fixed ideas like a pack of cards even to play a more exciting game taking her elbow he turned her towards a white bookshelf on which squat bottles were arranged like the pickles and preserves at a grocers now see the devils handiwork the bottle contained clear fluid with a cone of grey sponge he turns the lung into cheese a patch dies suffers caseation breaks down to a cavity which fills with pus i could load these shelves a hundred times with specimens like this if i troubled to cut them from every corpse eliot replaced the bottle the art of treating phthisis is unhappily often the art of treating the dying well thats a sound subject for any doctor to learn you know who will die and who will not asked nancy alarmed for baby yes even those who are going to take so long over it they never notice the fact the ends a rushwhen their lungs are as useless as a pair of paper bags when theyre so wasted even the worms will go starving theres no dignity about death no more than a dog run down by a cart you know why your sisters lucky the bacillus ate into an artery the red dangerflag was hoisted early time will heal her she should be grateful for that fact not resent it when ive been to london and seen dr crippen go to london and see the astronomer royal if you like hell be as much use i know you think dr crippens a quack i know youre mad at me but my father keeps cabling hes getting very impatient may i invite myself again to dinner no why because you are taking advantage of me dr beckett i am here friendless and unoccupied you press you company on me i thought you seemed fond of it but i suppose my company would never do among your set in america she looked away youre being unfair im a realist like all doctors he changed the subject by lifting from the laboratory bench a shallow china dish halffilled with green lumps in a yellow fluid this has a better chance against phthisis than any tricks from your dr crippen what is it mouldy bread i often ride round the estate with my father gathering the dukes rents i get to know the humble families with whom of course the duke is as unacquainted personally as those of hottentots i was fascinated with their folkremedies they brew foxglove tea for dropsy just like the shropshire country people dr william withering was sharp enough to notice a century ago now of course that drugs been extracted and prescribed as the heart tonic digitalis he spoke with warmth nancy felt disconcerted that he cared more for his profession than for her and instantly felt irritated at herself theres an old country rhyme about the foxglove leaf he told her the rapid pulse it can abate the hectic flush can moderate you see the cleverest man can always learn from the ignorant eliot took a pinch of the slimy green bread they put this on septic wounds and boils centuries before anyone had ever heard of germs theres something in the mould which kills bacteria im sure of it perhaps i can extract the chemical and invent a wonderful machine to blow it into the cavities meanwhile we must do with fresh air im afraid that im keeping you from your sister he dismissed her and i have a mornings work to do before the mirror in her hotel room that evening nancy vindicated herself mentally while mariathйrиse silently dressed her hair in new york she knew sufficient young men for the companionship of a different one every week all those bobbies ollies charlies clarrieseveryones name that season seemed to end with iewith their automobiles and long fur coats their games and their hunting their private jokes and private language composed of the latest slang from the track the ring even the underworld everyone she knew talked intently about one another and never of anything else some were vastly rich some almost penniless it was impossible to say in new york when a young man would spend a thousand dollars equally carelessly if it was his last most of them were pleasing or tried hard to please any of them would have married her some had asked it never crossed nancys mind to accept them her friends whispered their terror of marriage of placing themselves overnight in ultimate intimacy with a man who was largely unknown nancy was more scared of being bored dr beckett had an overpowering attraction he was the sort of man she had always imagined herself attracted to indulging seriously in this fancy meant forcing herself through social railings which kept common people from a life which nobody doubted as the most delightful and fulfilling a young woman might enjoy or was she caged an animal artificially kept alive in a zoo she concluded she was right to snub eliot her father was already distraught over baby it would be too much coming home engaged to a penniless doctor of no family and few graces a foreigner who wore atrocious clothes then she admitted that eliot differed from the men she knew as red meat from waterice her introspection was broken by cries through the tall open windows she looked across the hotel garden with its neatlyraked gravel and string of red and blue fairylights between the cherry and plum trees two men were running towards the path climbing the cliff waiters in their shirt sleeves an unthinkably irregular sight in the wellordered grand hotel cest un accident mademoiselle exclaimed mariathйrиse nancy immediately thought of eliot which annoyed her again taking her wrap she went down to the garden through the back gate came halfadozen men with the hotel proprietor followed by a blueuniformed gendarme shouting at others to keep their distance they bore one of the hotels green shutters on which lay lady sarah pledge nancy stopped horrified the party hurried past the face was smashed and glistening with blood the skull was crushed pale brain exuding over her ear one arm was twisted like a halfsnapped twig she wore the mornings white dress she had lost her shoes the skirt rose above her right knee to show her pink garter until one of the bearers with sensitive delicacy smoothed it down to her feet of course it wasnt an accident eliot said you couldnt fall from that point without putting your mind seriously to it dr pasquiers influence in champette being even stronger than an english noblemans the swiss authorities must say what theyre told it was all a matter of being buried in consecrated ground though to the raison dкtre of any funeral it doesnt matter if theyre buried in a rubbishheap she must have known more of her condition than she let on said nancy most of them do yet she used to complain only that it stopped her hunting suicides unusual in phthisical cases eliot remarked thoughtfully theyre a tough army who wont surrender remember spes phthisica it was ten days later a hot august morning the red cross flag flapping languidly when a breeze could stir itself the sunlight brilliant on the blue and white striped awnings of the balconies they were alone in the laboratory eliot was dropping into a square enamel dish of carbolic the reddishsmeared glass slides he had been examining under the microscope nancy stood with hands clasped parasol dangling she met him there most days when he had finished the rцntograms have the earl and countess gone back to england he asked they left the hotel early this morning monsieur mittot had embalmed the body with pride the undertaker had studied in paris he was a boon bestowed on champette by the sanatorium like trade for the shops sallow fat dark heavily moustached in crumpled sad black serge he had hung about the grand hotel once the earl and countess arrived by overnight express to basle with their valet ladys maid frockcoated secretary and the british consul acquired at lausanne not even the valet took notice of him monsieur mittot expected the aristocratic corpse to be shipped in a splendid coffin most rich families paying the fare home of their dead but he was ignorant of a tradition in the earls family since wellingtons peninsular war of being buried where they fell the earl thought the shuttling of corpses by railway vulgar lady sarah was buried in the english cemetery at lausanne among indian civil servants and city mens widows the consul murmured to the earl in compensation that the chaplain had been to eton the small bleak church was filled with patients from the clinic laлnnec fit enough to take the special train weeping and coughing into their blueglass bottles such emotion had startled eliot they shrugged at death when it pushed past them in the corridors a suicidenobody believed the accident excusewas different real death dying from phthisis was the penalty of losing the game everyone played when are you leaving switzerland nancy asked eliot as he dropped the last slide into the disinfectant he began washing his hands under the swannecked tap wednesday of next week taking a vacation before starting your politicizing this has been my vacation overpaid and overfed the work demanding the abilities only of an earnest medical student on my heels arrives dr hamish mccorquodale of aberdeen university a bachelor the son of the mansea clerics offspringhe has sent in advance a packingcase weighty with medical books hell entertain you as adequately as me perhaps hell bring his bagpipes cant i do any work in the clinic you know how ive longed to help the patients instead of walking among them like some smug neutral in a war why not come with me to london together well mount the quest for crippen together imagine the gossip oh everyone gossips all day about the pair of us nancy looked alarmed how can i leave baby she was awfully upset over lady sarah her temperatures up a whole degree itll be down in a month shed hardly notice youd gone ive never known a more dutiful relative than you nancy if you dont take a holiday youll develop melancholia why not he was standing close to her perhaps youll return with dr crippens magic to put the clinic out of business and bring upon monsieur mittot richly deserved ruin i cannot leave baby she repeated firmly he clasped her selfsacrifice is so common in women men take it for granted its not often combined with intelligence and determination youre a woman with all the qualities i admire particularly when youve no more need to exercise them than to practice frugality this compliment seeming to come from the brain rather than the heart she was surprised when he kissed her for the first time she felt it seemly to offer a mild struggle ill see what baby says she told him breathlessly baby was enthusiastic go to london and see the king she urged go right now before the fog comes down they say in november you cant see across the street how will i know a months passed darling counting days is like counting the telegraph poles passing the window of your train mariathйrиse decided it when nancy suggested a month at home in paris she shed tears fell on her knees grabbed her mistresss hand and kissed it nancy was startled that her maid should be equally bored at champette it had never crossed her mind to ask nancy bought tickets from thomas cooks beside the handsome lausanne post office a days journey to basle connected with the overnight express which ran up the rhine to strasbourg metz and lille to calais she arranged drafts at the englishamerican bank and bought english books for the journey from theodore sacks shop in the rue central her father replied to her cable by offering a blank cheque for the rights of dr crippens cure eliot said nothing of his own travelling plans he was preoccupied preparing his patients for dr mccorquodale on the wednesday morning nancy crossed the square surrounded by staff from the hotel and the proprietor so anxious to secure her return that he had been hovering outside her room with the assiduousness of monsieur mittot outside those of guests with dying relatives the train was already in the station stubby engine pluming smoke into the clear air there was no sign of eliot nancy looked anxiously up and down the narrow wooden platform a minute before departure he appeared in his usual norfolk jacket and a widebrimmed brown trilby over one shoulder a stonecoloured english raincoat and a canvas rucksack round his neck was a long brown knitted muffler in his hand a cheap suitcase cracked at one corner and secured with a length of rope he greeted nancy casually strolled past her and climbed into the thirdclass coach the train puffed down the mountain nancy grew angry she had imagined socially difficult scenes between eliot and herself on the journey but she had never imagined that he would travel third even mariathйrиse sitting opposite was going firstclass to lausanne havent you any more baggage nancy demanded approaching him at lausanne station i should like to have but this is the limit of my possessions eliots eyes turned to mariathйrиse fussing over the removal of nancys portmanteau from the van i found a pleasant line in my swiss baedekerthe enormous weight of the large trunks used by some travellers not infrequently causes serious injury to the porters who have to handle them people condemn men to a lifetime of invalidism because they insist on moving round the world with sufficient hats and gloves and boots for a change every day if you are going to draw morals from everything you see i shall avoid you all the way candidly i think youre a fool you could easily afford to travel like a gentleman i agree had i not better uses for my earnings than paying a bribe to discomfort if a hair shirt were the price of sable you would still buy yourself one from your haberdashers eliot grinned perhaps youre right youll be staying at the savoy nancy nodded its nineandsixpence a night but theres a bath with the room im surprised at that in england an englishman does not care to pay extra for a bath he regards it as a necessity not a luxury i think the savoys preferable to the cecil next door which may have a thousand rooms but is growing dreadfully shabby my ducal connections are useful in advising on such things where exactly is your camden road she had his address in her diary against the main railway lines north near the cattle market and pentonville jail theres always room for me at no i lodged there since i was a medical student at st bartholomews shant you want to see your parents theyre attending the duke in scotland its barely a month since the glorious twelfth and their gunbarrels are still hot grouse you know he explained she dropped her voice when may i see you the savoy at eleven the morning after our arrival if youre showing me the sights i insist on paying for the excursions im sure youve far far better use for your money than that i shant be in the slightest embarrassed when you feel in your handbag at madame tussauds the changing of the guard is viewed free nancy did not see eliot when they left the crowded lausanne train at basle she dined in the station restaurant which had a star in baedeker she supposed he had satisfied himself with a cassecroыte and a bottle of beer she noticed him on the platform only as she was handing her ticket to the conductor of her wagonlit i shall feel awful you sitting up all night she said with concern ive slept on a hard chair often enough during night duty in the receiving room at bartholomews well meet on the quai at calais i trust not six in the morning is not a social hour theres a customs examination at the french frontier but as i doubt youre travelling with tobacco or cigars the visite will be lenient she boarded the blue sleepingcar its inside subdued hues of mahogany brass and pinkshaded lamps it was always exciting to take possession of an ingeniouslyfitted sleepingcompartment the smooth white linen sheet of her bunk was turned down she found the washbasin slid neatly behind a mahogany panel she admired herself in the giltscrolled glass discovered the water carafe which was protected from rattle by an upholstered bracket the panel of spongerubber for a watch at the bedhead she turned a hinged brass handle expecting to find a wardrobe and was looking into the empty compartment next door she rang the bell mademoiselle desire quelquechose the conductor was a sallow young frenchman in khaki jacket and kepi with a military moustache donnez un tour de clef а la porte sil vous plait she directed severely je regrette mademoiselle he excused himself hastily producing masterkey on chain from his trouser pocket ce compartiment nest pas occupй moment nancy held up her hand parlezvous anglais certainly mademoiselle can you sell me a ticket for that berth to calais of course mademoiselle the receipt book was already from his jacket pocket one hundred and twentyfive francs listenyou recall the english gentleman i spoke to on the steps he nodded he is in the third class can you find him before the train starts he nodded again she handed him the gold and silver coins adding three francs for himself but will you please tell the gentleman this that the compartment is empty and that i have bribed you with a franc to let him occupy it free of charge all the way to calais eliot would prefer to stand all night in the corridor rather than sleep in luxury she had paid for all this will go no further of course she added reassuringly to the conductor he grinned and saluted entendu mademoiselle she noticed he did not bother to lock the communicating door she sat on the bunk still in her coat and hat equally frightened that eliot would fall for the ruse or that he would not there was an unsubtle knock from the corridor eliot was outside with his raincoat rucksack and suitcase i say what a bit of luck he said heartily i really wasnt relishing a night among people eating garlic sausage and young children of amazing energy these railway officials are dreadfully corrupt you know but it was quick of you to take it up the train was sliding from the station nancy smiled we yankees are sharp ill turn in as were up early yes do sleep well he found the unlocked door before the train had shrieked through the station at mulhouse in the morning on the gusty quay at calais he remembered that he owed her for the conductors franc itll be over there number on the corner of oxford circus opposite peter robinsons the drapers but im breathless come on while the bobbys holding up the traffic you treat the fair sex quite horribly all englishmen do we expect our women to ride like express trains and dance like butterflies to organize our domestics with the efficiency of general kitchener to comfort us with the tenderness of hйloise and to laugh at our jokes like a musichall audience it was four in the afternoon of friday september when they had reached england the previous morning the sun gave the cliffs of dover the sheen of an iceberg now the weather had changed to a malignant misty drizzle which soaked its way through garments with the persistence of mites through cheese and steadily cleansed the stagnant chimneysmoke of its soot for deposit on starched collars and elaborate hats eliot seemed to nancy patriotically proud of this perversity in the weather she held an umbrella the other hand gathering her skirt from the slimy roadway as he seized her elbow the london traffic was its most chaotic of the century horsepower competing with horse the nimble twowheeled hansoms the roomier fourwheeled growlers the smart coupй fly hired from the livery stable sevenandsixpence one horse twelveandsixpence two were being jostled from the streets by the taximeter motorcabs far faster despite the miles per hour speed limit the horsedrawn omnibuses were being ignored for the scarlet motor ones of the london general omnibus company to be stopped anywhere the garden seats on the open tops advertised as freely patronized by ladies stagecoaches to hampton court or the races churned amid excursion motors carrying a guide for the trippers motor cars electric or petrol were hireable at five pounds a day everywhere dodged the enthusiastic sporty cyclist with its electric tramways and the underground tube eliot told nancy imposingly london was the most convenient of cities for getting aboutso long as you had no necessity to cross the road still flagrantly grasping her arm eliot hurried nancy along the far pavement number was on the sweep of oxford circus a doorway between a furriers and a trunkmakers the lobby inside had mustardpainted stone walls a wooden staircase going up an iron one spiraling into the black basement it did not seem to nancy likely headquarters for a man with the cure of the disease which terrified the world eliot ran his eyes down a painted list of firms with offices above no munyons and i looked them up in kellys directory this morning he peered at the lowest line thats freshly painted perhaps theyve moved he took her elbow again to a shop he had noticed on the corner marked with gold letters ottoman tobacconists you can find everything about any district from a tobacconist its craving is common to all classes of the world but its so uncomplicated an article to purchase everyone stops to justify their visit with a gossip the shop was tiny and aromatic a wall of drawers like a druggists were labelled raparee navy plug havana perfectos on the counter were glass boxes of round or oval cigarettes a blue jar marked high dry toast snuff a black boy in turban and curlytoed slippers stood in eternal plaster deference the oriental atmosphere stopped with the proprietor a wizened pale cockney with goldrimmed glasses munyons he repeated in a thin voice theyve gorn he drew a finger across his scrawny throat gorn bust eliot and nancy exchanged frowns do you know a dr crippen know im sir ill say the doctor he specified with respectful familiarity such a nice polite gentleman never smoked mind yousaid it upset is heart and digestion never took drink neither except for a glass of beer what you and id ardly notice sir used to come in and buy turkish cigarettes for miss le neve who might she be asked nancy the tobacconist looked startled aint you one of them yankees funny so was the doctor though o course youd ardly think it e spoke quite like an english gentleman you one of is family nancy shook her head hastily miss le neve was is typist pretty young thing always neat luverly dark air mind when the doctors business went through the sieve you could ave knocked me dahn wiv a fewer always seemed flush wiv the bees and oney the doctor money he explained responding to nancys blank look my business with dr crippen is urgent eliot stated where can i find him search me sir e used to talk of an orfice what he ad in shaftesbury avenue opposite the palace theatre praps es gorn ome to roost could you describe him eliot asked the atmosphere chilled you the rozzers of course im not the police eliot told him impatiently im a fellow doctor the shopmans narrowed eyes relaxed well es ardly bigger than little tich when e aint dancing on the tips of is boots everyone in london knew the musichall comic with boots as long as himself about fortyodd id say pink as a shrimp sandy air bit bald moustache dressed neat even smart wears glasses like mine es one of them people you ardly takes notice of even when theyre speaking to you do you know where he lives enquired nancy not the faintest madam i dont even know if es got a trouble and strife she assumed this meant a wife praps es gorn ome to america well what do we do now she asked eliot is disappointment on the pavement outside what everyone does when stymied in england have a cup of tea yes lets my friends are always talking about rumpelmayers rumpelmayers ridiculously extravagant heres a lyons teashop it was crowded with shoppers men in bowlers and top hats women in broadbrimmed flowered or feathered milinary glistening umbrellas at their sides parcels round their feet the customers sat on caneseated chairs at marbletopped tables while whiteaproned lacecapped waitresses served the teapots the plates of buttered toast and the cream pastries from stout wooden trays eliot searched for a place the weathers too miserable for tea he grasped her arm again where are we going she sounded alarmed as he marched her round the corner for a glass of english beer and a whet of german sausage the sign bore a golden crown over a tudor rose eliot pushed open the door with a panel of greentinted glass embossed rose amp crown ales beers stouts wines from the wood its a saloon she objected forcefully perfectly respectable women pub it these days he assured her airily theres nothing to fear if you avoid the awful claret and hock she protested were i seen inside a place like this in new york it would be in all the papers what devilish delights accrue by sinking from the upper classes he teased her the bar was small its dark panelling splashed with brightly polished brass a partition with decorative frosted glass separating it from the noisy public bar next door a redfaced man in a curly bowler hat and canvas gaiters who smelt of oats sat against the wall with a thin one smoking a pipe of pungent shag the appearance of so beautiful and welldressed a female raised their startled eyes from halffinished glasses of beer which they were contemplating with the placid melancholy of the british enjoying themselves eliot sat her at a small round table in a corner of the sawdustcovered floor he brought from the bar a plate with sliced sausage a brandyandsoda and a glass of beer she winced as she sipped it two pennoth of half and half he explained ale mixed with porter at home we wouldnt use this to drench horses it sustains the working classes as faith the church i was educated that drink was an immutable evil in the hands of the masses naturally how can a fellowcountryman of falstaff contemplate a thought so mean oh i suppose it makes a few beat their wives and gives a few more hobnail livers one of your first failures as a doctor is making people do whats good for them everyone knows that cigars pipes and cigarettes stunt the growth and rot the lungs but who renounces a single whiff mankind is hellbent on its own destruction the german minddoctors call it thanatos the death instinct as much part of us as our bones thats nonsense she told him spiritedly everyone at the sanatorium submissively watched the wasted months and years pass by in a desperate quest for life the human mind doesnt know itself no more than the complacent lady of the house knows what happens in the darkened attic bedrooms of her servants baby has not the slightest desire to die eliot looked uncomfortable in the cheerfulness of london he had overlooked the ailing sister well hunt the crippen he said to cover the gaffe though i suspect his miracle cure as valueless as mother seigels syrupadvertised as indiscriminately effective against scurvy syphilis piles gout blackheads and pimples or hanress electric corset at fiveandsixpence for the relief of hysteria and dyspepsia and the healthy development of the female chest people never spend money so recklessly as on their sweethearts their dogs or their health my father believes in dr crippens tuberculozyne she said firmly a man shrewd enough to make a million dollars is generally a bigger fool over his health than a navvy because he cant submit to the notion of doctors knowing more than he does hes prey to a quack like the worm to the goose eliot gulped his brandy well track munyons to shaftesbury avenue its the new street which cuts through sohoa rookery of french and italian cooks waiters tailors and cakemakers but the restaurants are cheap ill take you there tonight for dinner he informed her i may have other plans that would be dreadfully foolish of you eliot you bestow contempt as other men flattery i dont a doctor is incapable of contempt the infinite weaknesses of human nature are his sympathetic study you mistake it for candour thats the quality a doctor must always direct upon himself if kindness sometimes deflects it from the patient afterwards you must come and see my lodgings its not much of a place but ive a pianola youve a nerve she told him sharply asking a lady unchaperoned to a gentlemans apartment no one else would know he assured her casually no one there would care i live among people who share my view that conventional morality is a combination of hypocrisy fright and a sound feminine instinct for keeping the goods untouched in the shopwindow until saleable at the best price if thats the view of your friends ive no wish to meet them he was alarmed she had angry pink spots on her cheeks are you inviting me to play the loose woman or are you telling me i am one ive suffered sufficient indignity for one day he grabbed her hand as she rose nancy forgive me he asked submissively i talk so often for effect but i have the tragic disability of too often believing what i say the life i have set for myself my unconventional ideas my idealsi suffer doubts sometimes that theyre nothing but a passing irritation with the society i was born into an ungrateful one as it reared me so generously she stood staring down at him he still held her hand am i hamlet or young lupin pooter from the diary of a nobody though i suppose they were both ridiculous in their own way i love you nancy i loved you since i walked into the waitingroom at the sanatorium last spring he smiled shyly the rose and crown gives hardly the most fitting echo to my sentiments when we came in id no more expectation of uttering them than my dying words my political ambitions resolved me to stay a bachelor for years though un foyer sans feu une table sans pain une maison sans femme are all equally joyless as the bretons say she sat down slowly the man in the curlybrimmed bowler had just finished a comic story and the other was choking with laughter though perhaps youd be right getting rid of me he said with detachment its the privilege of intelligent men and women to see the consequences of their passions even if they often prefer to go blind god gives us love according to tennyson but love can give us murder suicide and war love demands thinking about quite as much as money or health but people dont even while theyre enjoying it they give it as little thought as their work on a bank holiday she clasped his fingers on the glassringed tabletop i love you eliot she said quietly i was brought up like every girl i know in the same prison of conventions its scary suddenly finding yourself outside eliot reflected she looked like a child the worldliness which frightened him had vanished will you come to me he asked timidly i must go back to the hotel first i must bring the sponge she had used the sponge on the silken thread soaked in quinine on the express from basle she had heard of it in whispers from girls in the corners of drawingrooms and dinnertables in new york her friends assured her that absolutely everyone used the sponge it was as safe as a brick wall it was so much more satisfying than the disgustingly messy manner of men diverting the stream of life at the final moment into the air like a public fountain she had been fitted with the sponge by a respectable doctor in a tail coat who practised downtown in washington square who nancy told her father she was consulting for a sore throat eliot said nothing but gripped her hand tightly then he announced cheerfully weve work to do and stood up they easily found the offices in shaftesbury avenue but munyons had not leased rooms there since a grey woman in black bombazine with a pincenez supervising a cramped room of busy bentbacked young typists remembered dr crippen he had left munyons to become consulting physician to the drouet institute for the deaf at marble arch the drouet institute eliot groaned loudly outside in shaftesbury avenue the devilish invention of a drunken parisian doctor lead plasters impregnated with turpentine camphor spanish flystick them behind your ears and youll hear like a hare he advertised in all the newspapers and on the sides of the buses it was nothing but a cruel swindle on the deaf they spent their shilling on rubbish rather than having a proper aural examination from a doctor whod demand guineas which they hadnt got eliot continued warmly taking her elbow across the road a murderous swindle some poor man died from a brain abscess and the coroners remarks put the institute out of business the patient deserved a statue he saved the world more unnecessary suffering than most physicians not a handsome credential for your dr crippen is it nancy that afternoon had become abruptly less interested in dr crippen the last sunday in september was warm the coals sat on their sticks and paper unlit in the wellblacked grate a small iron kettle boiled on a gasring in the hearth a brown teapot with a broken spout a pair of large white cups and the milkbottle stood on a dented tin tray thrust among papers and books strewn across a crimson chenille cloth on the table a loudticking circular metal alarm clock between a pair of pied staffordshire spaniels on the narrow iron mantelpiece indicated four oclock the room had the easygoing student air of a man with no one to impress a black iron bed with a bright patchwork quilt stood against one wall a worn horsehair sofa faced a chintzcovered wingbacked armchair across a bearskin hearth rug the bookcase was inadequate its contents spilling haphazardly on the floor the concession to decoration was a tawny picture which a close look interpreted as barges in the thames estuary at sunrise the pair of tall firstfloor windows looked on an illcut lawn with rusty croquethoops surrounded by thick laurels berberis and box the house was one of the squat greybrick villas which with turretted and battlemented gothic dwellings lined the camden road outside the everlasting clank of electric trams merged with the nightly bellowing and baaing from the vast metropolitan cattle market across the railway lines nancy sat on the sofa in a plain charcoal dress intently darning eliots sock with a wooden mushroom would you like a slice of dundee cake fresh yesterday from the aerated bread company fine eliot fetched a basin of lump sugar from a tall cupboard containing files more books shoes ties and spare bedding another tune i guess my appetites sated for offenbach strauss andmay i say soyour sir arthur sullivan why not play yourself the piano is to me an instrument as mysterious as the ouija board he apologised i simply enjoy watching the rippling keys as the music unwinds the pianola stood in the corner the rolls which eliot hired from the music roll exchange in oxford street shared the cupboard my conscience disallows keeping a servant but ive no objection to hiring a ghost as my musical valet by the way theres a couple of fellows coming did i mention it nancy looked up sharply from her darning i dont want to be found here they find more shocking things in the world to worry them than a chap alone with a girl she put down the sock do you know the only real disagreeableness of revolutionaries to be entirely insensitive about the feelings of others eliot grinned im sorry my dear but honestly theyll take no more notice of you than of emma she was the maidofallwork with crumpled stockings and lank hair raised in an orphanage eliot thought her barely fit to look on the outside of the asylum door the only other occupant of no camden road was frau ebert the german housekeeper when nancy asked after the householder eliot seemed uneasy and explained that herr lamsdorff was a bachelor of utmost respectability from hamburg who had paid london the compliment of living there but was obliged to be often abroad on his business as furrier dont go he implored theyre nothing to be frightened of and weve so little time nancy was returning to switzerland the following wednesday she was staying only two weeks instead of four babys daily cable to the savoy the previous friday had complained of feeling a bit cheap nancy at once wired dr pasquier he replied that the temperature was a little raised there was no cause for concern miss grange was obviously fretting for her sister but ill be back in london dearest sure i will once babys settled nancy promised as eliot poured kettle into pot he made no reply he knew the fragility of their friendship it was like the solid ice bridges which formed across swiss gullies in winter and in summer might never have been there to nancy it was a freakish unthinkable adventure once started she gave herself to making the most of it they spent all day and much of the night in each others companyshe insisted primly on leaving for the savoy at midnight though he assured her the hotel was worldly enough not to imagine the world full of cinderellas eliot showed her with equal pride buckingham palace st pauls and his own ancient hospital of st bartholomews in smithfield at the tate gallery he had objected angrily to luke fildes the doctor grossly sentimental he exclaimed look at that miserable workingclass couple cowed while the magician meditates over their unconscious childthey couldnt even afford a bed for the poor thing medical care is as much a right of the people as pure drinking water that doctor clearly hasnt the slightest notion of whats wrong with his patient anyway nancy thought the painting lifelike and touching they did not take tea with miss nightingale but stared across the street at her house in mayfair nancy found eliot hardly a pleasuregoing young man he took her to pineros midchannel at the st jamess theatre in the cheap pit when she was accustomed to the front stalls they had dinner from the joint at small busy restaurants for eightpence or tried appendrodts german eatinghouses or slaters tea rooms or splashed a florin on a dozen oysters at sweetings in cheapside that nancy expected anything but a life of unexciting domesticity with him seemed beyond eliots contemplation that she had never been happier she realised then and for the rest of her life who exactly are these people coming she took her cup of tea she did not care for tea but he showed no inclination to buy coffee political friends of mine but dont expect wildeyed men in kulak blouses with whiskers like a burst horsehair sofa and a bomb in their attachй cases mr wince would pass for a prosperous and earnestly churchgoing cheesemonger mr ruston was born uppermiddleclass and will die uppermiddleclass a succession as certain in this country as the crown passing from father to son he sat at the table stirring his tea long legs stretched out fellows like ruston embrace the proletariat like a wild gipsy mistress they become horribly bloodthirsty for their principles theyd cut their mothers throat or dynamite their grandchildrens nursery but theyd die before blowing on their tea or drinking their soup from the tip of the spoon ruston keeps a cook and would be deeply affronted if anyone hesitated in accepting his cheque hed never contemplate taking the fiveshilling seaside excursion or living off breadandjam such people become equally boring to the class they own and the class they ape nancy smiled you draw an unflattering selfportrait eliot was surprised i dont find the middleclass distasteful no more than i find the patient distasteful rather than his disease i operate on society intellectually as i operate on a case i wouldnt rush the barricades no more than cut my throat if my patient failed to recover damn gesturing with political fervour he spilt his tea over his papers mopping with a yellow silk handkerchief he consoled himself the chapter needed rewriting anyway why wont you ever let me read your book she complained wait a woman who would cuddle a newborn baby would be disgusted by the sight of it being formed in the womb youre privileged to learn my views from my conversation he told her blandly the state has the same duty towards the health of its people as parents towards their infants if i call my book the health of nations i hope to startle people out of their prejudices like adam smith though as usual theyll draw them over their heads like cowls the doorbell jangled emma showed up a tall hollowcheeked fairhaired unsmiling man younger than eliot in a brown tweed suit with a yellow waistcoat like a stockbroker off to the races the other was short and fat twenty years older in shiny blue serge with a pink face sparse hair a clipped moustache and steelrimmed glasses askew a snouty nose the young man had a fat manilla envelope and an irish tweed hat both of which he tossed on the table with an unconcern indicating familiarity with the room young ruston glared aggressively at nancy wince seemed amused she continued darning the sock miss grange is from america eliot introduced her the name meant nothing to either visitor she is the soul of discretion both refused tea sitting beside nancy on the sofa ruston talked most in a stockbrokers voice winces was highpitched and he dropped his aitches both men stole glances at her you couldnt have returned at a better moment ruston told eliot earnestly you must have followed from the london papers the rough ride of lloyd georges budget he unveiled it last april while the country shook in its shoes from the outrage of the upper class over the new land tax youd imagine our fiery little welshman about to plunder the land like hengist and horsa in one got ter pay for the navy piped wince mockingly the floating bulwark o the island eh a keel for a keel one in the eye for the kaiser but the house of lords is set to reject the budget eliot stood on the bearskin hands in pockets looking solemn exactly what lloyd george wants ruston told him therell be an election on the issue before the christmas decorations are cleared away mark my words whichll do yer a bit o good added wince the liberalsll win with the chance o some labour members bein swept into parliament by the tide you and i eliot know the elections like a sham battle on the stage at drury lane our object is to burn down the theatre and roast the people in it remarked ruston nancy continued darning following the convolutions of british politics was wearying she had met several lords in new york they seemed kindly perfectly mannered young men who claimed an ignorance of politics as profound as of roadsweeping eliot had explained that the rejection of a liberal budget by the house of lords would be an event in british politics comparable with the inauguration of jefferson davis itll encourage the holloway labour party finding their parliamentary candidate real flesh and blood theyve no more notion where switzerland is than swahililand rushton said contemptuously ive found a shop for your peoples clinic eliots face brightened an abandoned greengrocers a bit rotten inside but i expect a practical fellow like you can fix it theres a quarters rent due five pounds i couldnt advance it you know how difficult things are for earning without spending switzerlands as useful as a polar expedition ruston nodded towards the manilla envelope need i emphasize those papers are for no eyes but your own wot yer doin in london love wince had been rudely staring at nancy from hair to toe eliot replied for her searching vainly for a dr crippen inventor of a remedy to cure her sick sister dr crippen wince equally rudely lit without nancys permission the large curly pipe he had been filling steadily with dark tobacco from a rubber pouch oh i know dr crippen lives up camden road illdrop crescent i blieve leastways i knows mrs crippen better shes a theatrical belle elmores er name on the boards he struck a vesta music all not that ive seen er on the posters praps she tours the provinces short flashy lady bright fair air peroxides it ive no doubt she aint no spring chicken he meditated puffing a cloud of smoke but shes an andsome woman ill give er that a proper tartar in the shops along brecknock road beating dahn the prices till yerd think shed a family ter feed on a fathing funny thing he nodded at nancy shes an american just like you to eliots eager questions he replied crippen a little bloke mild as milk got a practice at the yale tooth specialists albion ouse in oxford street i knows that acause e gave me one of is cards last week in liptons the grocers said if id trouble with me teeth ed fix me in no time wince laughed got an eye for business that doctor the pair shortly left wince shook nancys hand heartily in a fog of tobacco smoke rustons farewell was an intensely suspicious glance eliot decided against ringing doorbells along hilldrop crescent that evening when the householders would be settling to their suppers he met nancy at the savoy hotel the following morning their excitement was rekindled in the chase it was tantalizing fitting a face to the name exchanged the afternoon they met they walked east along the strandthe busiest street in london connecting mercenary city to leisurely west end at the foot of john rennies granite waterloo bridge they turned north towards the crescent of the aldwych and the new avenue of kingsway with the electric trams speeding tunnelled underneath oxford street that morning featured a regular entertainment upon the london pavements they jumped to a crash of glass a thin young woman in black with a swirling feather boa and a fashionable hat as though a church bell had dropped on her was vigorously breaking the window of a gentlemans hatters with a small hammer people shouted in alarm and rage a redfaced workman in cap and spotted choker stood hands in pocket swearing hoarsely two shirtsleeved shopassistants appeared horrified in the doorway a small man in frockcoat and top hat tried to grab her but jumped as she lunged with her hammer everyone shouted for the police an unhurried officer appeared through the traffic now then his voice was father to naughty daughter who had broken the china arrest me hers was ellen terry in the sleepwalking scene of macbeth right you are none of that there the policeman added fearsomely to a middleaged woman in a black bonnet who tried to slap the saboteur come along o me to bow street she thrust out her wrists handcuff me dont be barmy said the policeman a suffragette observed eliot with his usual calmness towards extravagancies in human behaviour the pair disappeared the policeman holding the hammer like some item of regalia the shopassistants hastened to shutter the window and sweep the glass they use a toffeehammer you know the sort that crack the slabs in sweetshops does america breed such vigorous ladies well there was susan b anthony she died about three years back susan b anthony eliot quoted reflectively men their rights and nothing more women their rights and nothing less they only got started here because mr gladstone didnt believe in women neither did mr disraeli but he didnt believe in admitting it queen victoria found them particularly objectionable surely with queen victoria there was no room left in the country for a womans movement exactly it must be most awkward trying to be gooder than god in heaven but even a lost cause is worth believing in not that ive sympathy for martyrs none at all its a form of political activity needing neither intelligence nor experience poor joan of arc she really should have known better eliot smiled heres albion houseno it was an impressive fourstorey creampainted building its tall paired windows above narrow balconies flanked by doric columns and plaster heads opposite was mudies select circulating library which diverted and edified a million housewives they walked up brownpainted stairs covered with patterned red linoleum a door on the third floor announced from its frosted glass panel dr gilbert mervyn rylance dr hawley harvey crippen the yale tooth specialists eliot pressed the bell the door was opened instantly by a peaky man about forty in a worn blue serge suit and celluloid collar dr crippen no his dental mechanic sir are you a patient a professional colleague the door opened with a deferential sweep the room overlooked oxford street it had expensive greenstriped paper green plush curtains and a thick turkey carpet the walls presented a pair of scarletsealed framed diplomas and an etching of sir edward poynters four delicious nudesone with a poorly footconsulting aesculapius at a greenbaize covered table with telephone typewriter and pair of spikes bristling with paper sat a goodlooking woman in her midtwenties short slim pale with big grey eyes a longish straight nose and flat eyebrows her light brown hair was pinned high she wore a navy serge dress eliot recognized her as miss le neve from the tobacconists description he thought her mouth as sensual as a hogarthian sluts with a subdued deliberate air she apologized that dr crippen was at his other practice aural remedies round the corner at craven house he saw dental patients at tenthirty eliot and nancy sat on wooden chairs whose ragged copies of john bull and titbits betokened the uneasy wait for terrors beyond a further glasspanelled door dr crippen appeared in a black frock coat befitting his profession with a bright blue shirt and a bluespotted yellow tie in his high starched collar a tiepin of chiseled glass the size of a schoolboys marble optimistically passed for a diamond his shoes were patent leather frosted with cracks he threw out his feet as he walked putting eliot in mind of some musichall comedian he spoke quietly with the tatters of a midwestern accent generously showing teeth which were a shining credit to the establishment eliot noticed that the bulging eyes behind the goldrimmed glasses were grey like his typists he affably invited them through the inner door another to the right painted dr rylance emitted a steady chilling gurgle of softlyrunning water a door marked no faced them number to their left led into a small ochrewashed room its decorations oilcloth depictions in vivid scarlet blue and yellow of a man with his head sliced across a vast ear with its exposed inner workings of linked little bones and the complete set of human teeth in a shining ring like a grotesque galaxy a wooden cabinet stood in the corner beside a marbletopped washstand on which eliot recognized a conical measuringglass and a medicine dropbottle ear speculas like confectioners icingcones an angled metal tonguedepressor and a ushaped spring for looking up noses he saw no bowl nor bottle of disinfectant nor even soap and water the metal earsyringe struck him as large enough to stop a fire crippen politely invited nancy to sit in his dental chair there was nowhere else so youre from new york miss grange well well i hail from coldwater michigan myself though ive practiced all over the statesdetroit two years santiago salt lake city st louis philadelphia up in toronto he asked eliot you practice in london i practice nowhere at the moment though i live near you by the cattle market you do coramy wifeso often complains of the noise from the bullock lairs at night and the sheep driven through the streets from the country shes from new york as well he informed nancy adding proudly shes on the stage you know belle elmore youll have heard of her dr crippen i have a sister in switzerland sick with the phthisis nancy was impatient looking at him steadily she explained ive come to you because i hear youve a preparation called tuberculozyne how strange you should mention it why i was prescribing it only the other day the patient suffered from scrufulous laryngitis complicated by catarrhal pharyngitis and chronic rhinitis eliot noticed a glibness with impressive if meaningless medical terms she is now well on the way to recovery im glad to say i want some nancy demanded very unfortunately that was my last sample as one medical man to another what is tuberculozyne eliot asked bluntly i cant keep these formulas in my head he lamented it has a basis of morphia i perfected it from the prescription of a homoeopathic doctor i knewhe practises in michigan at kalamazoo i was trained at the homoeopathic medical school in cleveland ohio you know back in though i studied in london a while the royal bethlem hospital for the insane londons the greatest medical centre in the whole world isnt it now my lines ear nose and throat i possess a diploma in the subject from the new york city ophthalmic hospital he ended in selfassertion eliot countered it by mentioning the drouet institute yes i am a little deaf myself crippen replied without concern eliot had noticed he inclined his head to hear now i must ask your pardon i have patients waiting the doorbell had been ringing repeatedly eliots grudging acceptance that this was truth not an excuse to be rid of them was strengthened by crippen continuing genially but say doctorif you and the good lady are free why not step across and take pot luck tonight no hilldrop crescent thats off the main road towards holloway jail my wife would just love to meet a fellowcountrywoman eight oclock yes said eliot shortly you must be crazy said nancy as they descended the stairs i want to find more about tuberculozyne if its got morphia it could be dangerous rather than merely useless he told her sternly she sighed well i guess our dr crippens just a fraud one so transparent it amounts to shining honesty you must be disappointed for baby not really i believed what you said about him all along i had to see with my own eyes theres my father to convince they reached busy oxford street besides his wife sounds worth the trouble of meeting eliot suggested i bet hes henpecked perhaps he enjoys it sometimes the male dominance in marriage is pleasurably reversed he becomes passive like the wellbred englishwoman in sexual intercourse manmasochist mated to womansadist theres a streak of both within all of us like surliness and good humour one or the other coming to the surface oh eliot i do wish you wouldnt speak to me as though i was a lecture room hilldrop crescent made a broad sweep from camden road at the crest of a hill which rose from the midland railway cuttings the houses were mirrorimage pairs three storeys high pale yellow brick with a shallow slate roof sharing the stack of a dozen chimneypots number was a lefthand house in the middle its low brick wall was topped with black iron railings caging a privet hedge an oak gate between square brick pillars led to a front garden five or six paces long shared with the neighbours and containing four london planes which were starting to turn ten stone steps flanked by a pair of cement urns sprouting marigolds led to a portico six feet wide which shaded the brownstained front door eliot was amused by the architects embellishments to his cheap suburban villa the tall window beside the front door had an ornamental balcony those above were edged with elaborate moulding in cement the next pair of houses were only a couple of yards away a narrow passage leading past the tradesmens entrance to the back garden nancy wore an accordionpleated navy skirt with a lace blouse eliot a blue serge suit and white shirt potluck in holloway did not seem to invoke dressing the bell instantly brought footsteps to eliots surprise crippen himself answered the door a professional man practising even as a dubious dentist should afford a servant well how nice belle will be so delighted you could make it crippens affable greeting slid into the hushed remark mr and mrs martinetti have just arrived the famous musichall comic singing act you know retired now and hes not altogether a his voice dropped further in professional confidence he has to be regularly dilated a narrow hallway with a wellvarnished staircase and a hatstand led to the parlour it was all pink pink wallpaper pink plush furniture pink shades to the gas lamps pink frames to the photographs on the piano pink silk bows on the corners of the pictures and round the necks of the china cats on the pinkdraped mantelpiece at one side of the throatily roaring gasfire sat a birdlike brighteyed woman in purple beside her stood a pale grey gloomy man the comedian posed with one hand on a round pinkdraped tablewhich held a fan of theatre programmes folded copies of the theatrical weekly era and a silverframed picture of herself signed by hana the theatrical photographerwas she to whom the room made a fitting compliment so youre american too gee its great to meet you im belle elmore advancing with arms wide apart mrs crippen clasped nancy tightly which part are you from new york nancy told her breathless so am i well ill be darned she had a brooklyn accent which nancy had heard only from her servants new york she gazed wistfully at the pinkwashed ceiling thats where i married peter it seemed that hawley harvey became plain peter at home while everyone flattered mrs crippen with her stage name she was short and fat her face eliot thought as exciting as the top of a steakandkidney pudding her hair was piled high in artificial curls of gold darkening towards the roots her broad mouth was painted her nose flat and her eyelids heavy with mascara she was about ten years younger than her husband she wore a pink satin dress with pink lace at the neck and in tufts from the shoulders so pinched at the waist that her corset whalebones seemed any instant liable to spring like a beartrap her bosom made a pink cushion to display her jewels a semicircular brooch the size of an orange segment represented in gold and diamonds a rising fiery sun pearls dangled like bunches of grapes from her dйcolletage a diamond pendant swung on a gold chain she wore two diamond and two ruby rings on one hand a diamond and wedding ring on the other on her wrist was a gold watch the gold was not false nor the stones paste eliot noticed with curiosity that accounted for economy over a servants wages she introduced paul and clara martinetti it was to be a nice little dinner belle explained expansively which she had cooked herself they were to dine in the breakfast room immediately under the parlour which looked across the front garden beside the steps eliot discovered this less pink though the wallpaper was pinkstriped and the clockface on the mantel a pink china rose the size of the dinnerplates he was finding the evening hugely amusing nancy was baffled was this first english home to receive her typical of the whole country or did all ordinary americans abroad behave so oddly im cold peter complained belle peevishly the breakfast room had the only remaining open fire in the house she had explained sharing the flue with a kitchenrange next door the rest was converted to gas crippen meekly took a black scuttle to the cellar opposite whey they heard him scraping up shovelfuls of coal clara martinetti brought in roast shoulder of mutton glistening potatoes under it crippen carved he fetched a pitcher of beer from the cask they had noticed in the passage asking nancy thoughtfully if she preferred something else she did he produced a jug of lemonade covered with muslin weighted by a fringe of coloured beads belle meanwhile addressed them over the mutton like a star to reporters in her drury lane dressingroom i decided to enter the profession at seventeen cora turner i was in those days then i met peter who fell in love with me like that she snapped her fingers ignoring the man silently slicing the meat at her elbow sure he had to marry me right away but i said to him nancyi may call you nancy miss grange oh please ive got my artistic career to think of yes sir so i had my voice trained she said as if referring to her poodle grand opera that was my ambition carmen mimi in la bohиme the ring cycle yknow and salome especially salome i sure guess i could sing salome a street better than eva tanguay right now in new york they said in era there was almost a riot and its been banned in boston she wears a stunning costume seven veils with pearls emeralds rubies diamonds all as big as pebbles gee id love to wear it she said longingly munching half a roast potato but peter just had to come across here in as manager for munyons crippen sat down to his own dinner and like a good dutiful wife i followed him a month or so later yes sir that was the end of my singing lessons and my career in opera so i went on the vaudeville stage instead peter youve not served the onion sauce crippen hastily rose so did paul martinetti asking might i visit a certain room with a lack of embarrassment indicating the request as familiar belle gave a generous smile peter put down that sauce and take paul upstairs be sure you close the window he doesnt want to take a chill but london disappointed me she continued solemnly why london invented the music hall id my idea for my own sketch i had writers and composers hired i could have played the alhambra the empire the coliseum the hippodrome collinss the oxford all i got was the old marylebone the euston palace the camberwell ive not worked for three whole years she confessed indignantly but i got me a bad agent yeah several bad agents they did me out of money that all oh ill get a break its often as long coming as christmas isnt it clara belle does such wonderful work for us at the music hall ladies guild clara martinetti said admiringly im the honorary treasurer belle told them proudly weve rooms in albion house just below peters surgery which belle arranged at a most reasonable rent i dont know what wed do without belle honestly clara continued fondly shes at every meeting every wednesdayarent you belle she organizes our charity performances our dance at the cria really big do every februaryand lovely teaparties and freshair outings for the kiddies as i always say to mrs ginnett and lil hawthorne and to melinda mayshes our secretary and lives in claphambelles a real ball of fire belle simpered through this shower of adulation clara martinetti explained to the visitors the guild performs charity work among those of the profession who have fallen upon hard times eliot hoped that few would fall upon times much harder than the three in the house the martinettis had faded without the limelight to the fragile paleness of dried flowers belle elmore assumed the affectations and trappings of an actress as a swindler enjoyed the fantasy of riches are you religious dr beckett belle asked with startling gravity as the two men returned im scientific which is the same thing i study reverently the process of life and death and try to explain god in a chemical reaction ive been a devout catholic she explained with the same solemnity not seeming to hear him four years now since we moved into this house im gonna convert my husband she sounded as if still talking of converting the house to gas my wife wants to choose my religion as she does the pattern of my trousers said crippen humorously peter belle seemed more outraged by impertinence to her than to god or his skirts clara martinetti giggled when are you going to dress up for us again peter wearing belles wig and paste on your moustache you make a lovely lady with your figure eliots suppressed laugh at the image of the middleaged doctor cavorting in his wifes clothes almost choked him on his roast potato he wanted to leave the pathetic household as soon as polite but there was the fruit pudding then belle said they must go upstairs for whist adding graciously first i shall sing you some of my numbers opening the parlour door she explained pinks my lucky colour yknow lil hawthorne at the ladies guild has just gone and hung green wallpaper in her drawingroom gee i told her shed got a real hoodoo there shell have bad luck sure as fate i wont have green in the house belle sat on the pinktopped piano stool and sang aubery plantagenet the hero of the penny novelette then hes a naughty naughty boy followed by in sweet ceylon paul martinetti rose and said he wanted to visit a certain room again the poor fellow has a urethral stricture the late result of the clap eliot diagnosed he wondered if his wife knew the exertion of belles performance sent her down to the kitchen for a bottle of brandy she poured eliot a glass drank one herself and had started another when crippen returned with paul martinetti and bending over eliot asked almost inaudibly if he would care to see a certain room too they mounted the front stairs belle setting out cards on a collapsible baizecovered table on the landing carpet regressed to red linoleum two upstairs doors were shut through another eliot glimpsed a capacious bathtub surmounted by a shiny brass geyser he saw a narrow stair ascended to servants rooms above curiously drawing aside a net curtain in the lavatory eliot could see across thirty yards of back garden and the gaslit rear windows of houses in brecknock road crippen waited solicitously outside descending the stairs crippen volunteered i expect youd like to talk about that preparation tuberculozyne dr beckett very much have you the formula crippen apologized in his soft voice its the property of munyons homeopathic remedies with whom i have severed my connection i was obliged to resign because professor munyon considered that my wifes theatrical career diminished the dignity of his firm he confided eliot suspected untruthfully but perhaps youve heard of amorette dr beckett i invented it while manager of the sovereign remedy company a nerve tonic eliot shook his head the name suggested that the nerves it stimulated were erotic ones would you be interested in entering partnership with me eliots head jerked in surprise im greatly experienced in the marketing of medicine crippen asserted i can write an effective letter to a patientwhether satisfied or dissatisfied i have quite a reputation for preparing advertising copy and when the drouet business failed i acquired their mailinglist he added stealthily i have ј in the yale tooth specialistsdr ryland contributes his experience knowledge and skill we split the profits fiftyfiftywhich unfortunately leaves me short of capital for amorette no eliot told him the remedies i have advertised through my professional life have given much benefit dr beckett he persisted i have testimonialsperfectly genuine testimonialsto prove it he raised his bulgy eyes staring plaintively through goldrimmed glasses i guess i practice as honestly as any who prescribe remedies they know in their hearts to be useless eliot struggled to be fair apart from digitalis for the heart mercury for syphilis codeine for a headache no doctor gave any drug with sure effect he wondered if crippen flirted with the fantasy of being a serious physician as belle was wedded to hers of being a real actress perhaps miss grange crippen suggested who from appearance strikes me as a lady of substance your assessment is perfectly correct miss grange has a fortune she has also a sharp yankee eye for a swindler it was impolite of me bringing miss granges name into our talk of business crippen apologized mildly i cant tell you how honoured i am receiving a fellow doctor under my roof to enjoy professional conversation you know belle has many friends she entertains a lot she must keep up appearances of course they had reached the hall i hope you will not refuse my hospitality in the future eliot declined whist crippen was dispatched through the drizzle for a cab belle kissed nancy several times eliot called his address to the driver the pair of padded leather kneedoors slammed the hansom clopped towards camden road they laughed hugging each other with the delight of wellmannered children released from the ludicrous antics of adults the opera shed grace the stage like a german street band in the orchestra pit eliot decided can you imagine them making love lapdog and hippopotamus eliot recalled that it was no distance to his lodgings youre coming in dearest nancy shook her head firmly i must go back to the savoy theres babys telegram it hadnt arrived when i left the temperature will have settled by now im sure nancy hesitated before admitting and im worried about the sponge it may not always work how the world has grown suddenly enlightened of its responsibilities to dr marie stopes as to god said eliot lightly science and passion make strange bedfellows dont they oh ill visit a rubber shop ill spend two shillings on a dozen of their goods constructed with the resilience of tyres on a motorbus you should anyway wear a dutch cap which is safer and more comfortable she touched his cheek dear i still tremble to talk of such things many married couples never mention the entire business all their lives oddthe only bodily function they share creating children is the most serious thing any human being does for fun im your fun she nestled against him how you delight in making fun of anything serious who could bear contemplating marriage with the slightest seriousness a commonplace one hangs together for its first year through passion for the next five through respectability and after that from habit youre lecturing me again youre coming back to london he asked earnestly she kissed him sure i am as soon as babys settled id sail to see you in new york you wouldnt like me there you wouldnt like anything about me the horse slowed down whatever happens we shall meet again she assured him solemnly i shall cherish the idea as sensible people of life after death theres really no point in thinking otherwise is there they stopped the small square trapdoor overhead sprung open with the customary rough and grubby cabmans hand from a frayed and greasy cuff jerking one way and another for which passenger should pay the fare the lady is going on eliot directed upwards the savoy hotel a scatter of chimes from the church clock marked midnight eliot had three hours of his usual working day he lit his gas stoked the fire boiled a kettle for a cup of tea changing coat for cardigan he uncapped his fountainpen and resumed the health of nations he had been writing an hour when the front doorbell jangled violently he took no notice men arrived unexpectedly at any hour of darknesseither commanding desperate or frightened the german housekeeper was trained for these emergencies he heard footsteps on the stair a knock came to his door the maid whitefaced in her shift admitted nancy her face was blotched and contorted she threw a buff flimsy on his writingblock eliot read miss nancy grange savoy hotel london deeply regret miss jane grange passed away at six oclock this evening her death was sudden and peaceful anglican priest among our patients was at her bedside stop cause of miss granges death tubercular meningitis please advise your wishes profound condolences pasquier there nancy shouted at him shes dead i never saw her again you made me come to london you told me that temperature was nothing when i should have been at her side i was letting you make love to me like a woman off the streets nancy fell on the sofa covering her face starting to cry loudly baby darling baby how i loved you i loved you eliot put his arm round her shoulders but she shook it off violently she went on accusing him you took advantage of me in that horrible swiss place advantage of my loneliness my vulnerability my exile i hate you who are you compared with baby a nobody a nothing my god how i wish id kept you at your distance baby died alone among strangers foreigners i cant believe it i cant believe i was such a craven fool to leave her nancy dont touch me ive been wicked youve made me wicked the resilience and resourcefulness of eliots mind failed him he sensed no point in words for his defence or for her own she was shedding guilt upon him before it crushed her theres need for practical arrangements he suggested quietly after some minutes may i help you its often the doctors lot he knew the first boat train left charing cross station near the hotel at eight in the morning the night porters at the savoy would arrange tickets and reservations to basle the trying business of packing could be left to the maids he advised her to get some rest he suggested a sleepingdraught but she objected she had transatlantic telegrams to send her father to babys friends his deliberately diverting her mind to expediences calmed her she had left the hansom at the door he offered to return with her but she angrily refused eliot went back to his room and sat in the chair by the fire he was still sitting there when daylight began to edge the curtains he did not care in the least that baby was dead that nancy had left him meant more than anything in his ambitious world arrival of the fast liners from europe always had impact on the social political and artistic life of new york the olympic feet long gorgeous inside with carved mahogany marble and gold leaf the hotel cecil afloatarrived at pier in the sparkling sunshine of early october she was the pride of the white star line who could boast in their sailing notices largest liners in the world building because of her even bigger sistership on the stocks at harland amp wolff in belfast the unsinkable titanic as the passengerlist had no actors or authors statesmen or sportsmen the newspapers concentrated on the pair of grange sisters one of whom was dead the world relishes tragedies in wealthy families who deserve to pay for being rich the evening sun and evening mail described nancy coming ashore griefstricken though the eyes behind her motorveil were long ago dry in the headwinds of her journey crossing the grey misty face of europe from the poplarspiked fields of northern france she felt like a worm crawling through a dank garden by the perversity of human mind her uppermost concern was her inability to buy mourning she would return to campette shockingly disregardful in attire to the tragedy the red cross flag outside the sanatorium was stiff in a cold wind winter beginning repossession of its rightful land the first person she saw was monsieur mittot the undertaker as the greyuniformed coachman helped nancy from the carriage with customary sweep of hat monsieur mittot came briskly through the double doors in his black overcoat he stopped short on the step their eyes met they had a new relationship joined in grisly intimacy nancy felt shocked this man had laid hands on baby seen her naked she stared at him frightened at what he represented the fat undertaker for once looked abashed he raised his bowler hat an inch nervously wiped his moustache with his fingertips and hurried towards the village path muttering chillingly a vфtre service mademoiselle dr pasquier recounted as solemnly as a priests prayers babys final illness the rise of temperature was not thought alarming patients might take a chill in the clinic as in their own homes a little catarrh need not flash urgent messages across the breadth of europe headache was a common enough symptom in young ladies surely the bacillus had suddenly switched its attack from besieging the lung to overrunning the whole body when dr pasquier himself was summoned baby was already in coma her temperature had soared to degrees her breathing was snatched the tache cйrйbrale red streak on her skin proclaimed involvement of the brain a silentlyformed tubercule in the meningeal envelope of the brain dr pasquier explained had caused internal haemorrhage by eating through an artery they had applied icebags they had performed the operation of lumbar puncture to inspect the bloodtinged spinal fluid within the hour she had succumbed nothing could have been done were dr beckett still here might he have saved her dr mccorquodale is a practitioner of excellent qualifications who enjoys my complete confidence he took her to the basement to view babys body covered by a sheet in a room like a butchers refrigerator nancy was amazed how small she looked dr pasquier withdrew the covering from her face she was a dusky colour her chin held up with a bandage her eyes open the fraction of an inch unevenly her hair murmured nancy it still keeps its colour the man with the scarred neck was hovering in the lobby he made a deep bow and presented a long white envelope it was her sisters bill the olympic first class was full of americans lively flirtatious drunken lustful home from an extravagant summer in europe the word went about that she had a corpse down below and people avoided her as though she was a witch she was met at the pier by mr franklyn a red round man in gleaming top hat and astrakhan collar one of her fathers lawyers she embraced her father in his firstfloor study at fifth avenue he was with mr bryan his middleaged private secretary who wore a pincenez what happened john grange was small and whitehaired with the birdlike quickness which baby had inherited he did deals in everything for a meatpacker with no cash to pay a wagebill in buenos aires john grange could raise a loan on a cargo of whaleoil in amsterdam if a german wanted to build a railway in turkey john grange could funnel him the savings of americas middle west he could sink a gold mine in canada by bankrupting a hundred farmers in south africa if baltimore was sitting out a steel strike he knew how to snap up the markets for sheffield he neither smoked nor drank and lived off mint tea meat broth and raw vegetables he was terrified of open spaces travelled in an automobile with drawn curtains and lived in shuttered rooms with the electric light at noon the funerals on thursday he announced when nancy had repeated everything transmitted in long anguished cables tomorrows for folk to pay their respects therell be a book to sign with velum pages the coffin would be displayed in the blackhung ballroom where baby had last danced what do you intend to do now youre home he asked later when he could direct his thoughts from his dead daughter to his living one when you can decently appear out of mourning that is what i did before i left i guess you dont sound very enthusiastic nancy said nothing a million women in new york would give an arm to lead your life now babys gone you mean twice as much to me baby was a great credit she shone in company she was sought in society the boys were proud to know her the girls fought for invitations to her parties baby went everywhere she should be seen met everyone she had to know shed have made a fine marriage i dont care to play the social game for a woman in your position its a matter of duty for a woman in any position its a matter of taste i dont care to play bridge you will play it even if you dont care for it ive got to have my daughter prominent in society ive got to have her marry with position money family thats as worthwhile achievement for a woman as making a million dollars is in a man but papa do you need me as a decoration a doll created by dressmakers and milliners and dancingteachers when everyone in new york knows and respects john grange thats what i want there was another silence very well papa nancy said obediently did you see that fellow crippen hes nothing but a quack but hes a real doctor i had it from professor munyon himself hes a quack and so is professor munyon pretty free with your accusations arent you how can you tell whos a quack and who isnt that takes a doctor to know it was a doctor who told me doctors have a lot of professional jealousy this was a doctor whose opinion id trust utterly who was he hes english he was at the clinic looking after baby she must have written about dr beckett howd he know crippen we met him together dr beckett had returned to london youd corresponded with him her father asked suspiciously i had become friendly with him dont go wasting yourself on doctors i can hire any doctor in the world i like and fire him the moment i feel like it very well papa nancy said again babys prominence in new york society was increased as the centre of its most fashionable funeral that fall for the rest of october the compass of nancys mind swung too violently to plot a steady course through life the isolated monotony of switzerland seemed a more natural existence than the gay gregariousness of new york because it had been endured for a purpose like monasticism or a prison sentence to have mixed as a social equal with the unmannered and pretentious crippens now disgusted her mr ruston and mr wince made her tremble at a brush with evil but she knew that eliot was rightthe upper classes have a far leaner time of it than a costermonger who can revel in the unstinted enjoyment of his bodily functions now eliot must be as dead as baby in the middle of november eliot wrote to her nancy was alarmed because mr bryan saw every envelope entering the house and would report the unfamiliar handwriting to her father the letter began dear nancy and after a sympathetic halfpage about baby described cheerfully his free surgery in the greengrocers shop the municipal elections have just ended he informed her with only two of the nine women town councillors in england reelected you see how the suffragettes campaign is selfdefeating violence is a useless political weapon unless cloaked in subtlety they say we are in for a wet winter the weather is filthy today the thames rising by the hour i pray it will not drown the entire house of lords before their opportunity to reject the peoples budget then shall be my chance who knows that you must put mp after my name should you choose to write it ended yours sincerely eliot nancy thought it as unromantic as a prescription nancy nearly wrote back she sat over her thick cream wavyedged paper fountain pen uncapped it seemed dereliction of duty towards her father instead she accepted the invitation to a dance with clarrie burgess clarrie was three years older than her heir to a railroad fortune when nancy had begun accepting the shower of invitations after babys funeral clarries eagerness in courting her she suspected indicated societys relish for a fresh face within a week his presents had escalated from flowers and chocolates to a diamond bracelet the same evening john grange called her to his study he did not mention eliots letter but with the air of offering sound advice to an investor declared that clarrie burgess would make her an excellent husband he would not said nancy why he has a scented moustache her father was too puzzled to reply in the new york times two mornings later nancy found halfadozen columns about phthisis it was as common as drunkenness or lice among the crammed tenement dwellers of the lower east side her knowledge of pulmonary tuberculosis its progress its treatment was singular among the untrained women of new york the notion of turning this to some use was exciting it would restore the purpose to her life which had died with baby everyone had heard of lillian d walds visiting nurse service the charity attracted the generosity of nancys friends as more genteel than the salvation army nancy telephoned for an appointment at henry street she drove to the lower east side in a hansom remembering that in the same squalor her mother and her relatives had met hastened deaths was she lucky to have risen from such society or wicked to tolerate it at all as political thought always turned her mind to eliot she left the question open the henry street settlement was housed in a brownstone with shutters and windowboxes a tree outside protected by railings half a dozen children playing on the front steps staring and giggling as she banged the big brass knocker she was taken to a small square linoleumfloored semibasement with faded yellow wallpaper and pair of hanging gasglobes a rolltopped desk was jammed against a stout cupboard library shelves along one side were filled with neat piles of pink lint rolled bandages basins and heavy metal boxes in the corner stood a small washstand with basin and pitcher the middle had a board and a flatiron there was a flower vase standing empty and a mirror in which she felt no one bothered to look the decorations were photographs of nurses in groups a sombre picture of president lincoln and a framed redandwhite card ordaining do it well two mature women sat on rushseated chairs both in blueandwhite check cotton dresses with flared skirts a black tie and a broad white belt the one with the centre parting and the bun was lillian wald the other with the upswept hair her partner mary brewster wife of a general lillian wald told her bluntly youre not the first society lady whos come here filled with good intentions but unfortunately even the best intentions arent good enough once they find the nature of our workand the nature of the folk we work amongthey generally find their disgust hard to swallow maybe it would be better for both of us if you expressed your desire to help by writing a cheque however big a cheque it wouldnt buy me an easy conscience and i have come to you with the selfishness expected of my set i want something useful in my life the reply seemed to excite curiosity but why occupy yourself with the sick here at the nurses settlement the works mostly hard and always unpleasant till youre used to it some ladies never get used to it you could go across to the travellers aid society on west th youd do as much good saving vulnerable young working women arriving in new york from moral corruption but im interested in medical matters particularly phthisis ive just lost a dear sister from the disease i was so close to her in a swiss sanitorium i felt that i had nursed her myself oh i recollect the item in the newspapers said mary brewster miss wald became less forbidding ill accept you as a doer rather than a dogooder she decided after more questioning i only take trained ladies you know its public health nursing for the ultimate good of the whole community of new york i will not bestow nursing care as a charity upon our patients that is a derogation of human dignity to the recipient however inflating for the donor i enrol a few nurses aides which you can try for six months if you last you can take regular instruction as a public health nurse thatll be at teachers college in columbia university im starting a training programme there next year nancy was as delighted with her uniform as with her acceptancethe same check that lillian wald wore herself with dainty buttoned shoes protected by black spats a black straw skimmer hat a wide apron for work the promise in summer of a white muslin cravat she carried a black leather bag with two handles accompanying one of the nurses from tenement to tenement generally over the rooftops the poorer you were on the lower east side the higher up you lived her job was mostly cleaning and cooking the squalor filth and decay neither shocked nor deterred her nor that one in ten of the adults she saw every day perhaps one in six of the infants would before long end in an unembellished pine coffin in potters field the wellfed patients in the clean and comfortable clinique laлnnec were equally surely condemned to die and eliot had taught her that the only real tragedy in life was death the tubercular sufferers sought fresh air as shipwrecked sailors water some lived in tents on the roof through burning summer and winter snow nancy consoled herself that many of the east side immigrantsor their childrenwould pull themselves from the human mire and that many others kept their families clean fed and temperate in such discouraging surroundings and that many more had left strawfloored european cellars and garrets no better and the air tainted with political oppression her father had at first objected with unexpected mildness one evening in late november he called her to his study mr bryan saw this in the herald he picked up a newspaper cutting the column was headed john granges daughter in slums you spoke to this reporter nancy i asked miss walds permission i thought what he wrote would make you proud of me papa i am not why should my only daughter spend her days in filth you could be molested attacked nancy sat in a straightback chair opposite she slowly smoothed her gray satin skirt i should never be in my uniform i am like a queen in her robes i am respected welcomed and loved she reminded him i asked and you gave your permission i did not give you permission to penetrate such places i naturally imagined that you would be a nurse to people of social standing women of my own agethose i work amongdo things far more evil every day without troubling their fathers at all dont you see papa im your best publicity agent youre far too hardheaded not to recognize there are many who do not overlove you i make enemies with every deal i dont give a damn i make as many friends so long as its successful a rich man is disliked by people who know absolutely nothing about him except that hes rich thats unreasonable no more than a man with no coat hating the wind you can no longer play mr vanderbilt and say the public be damned when you talk of the public now you mean its newspapers and theyre incapable of damnation if they tell new york that your daughter tends the sick and the destitute you will be thought of the kindlier john grange sipped the mint tea resting on the arm of his leather chair thats not what your lifes for i could hire a hundred clever dicks to make me look the sweetest man in town baby understood that shed never stray from her proper position cant you understand i would never work with the nurses if it wasnt what i want to do most in the whole world he said nothing oh papa i know you want me to be a success in society to marry the man whom every other girl in new york would long to wed but surely you love me enough to let me find my own happiness i love you with all my heart nancy but in this world we must put our tender feelings behind armourplate if we want to be successful there was a long silence he rose abruptly leant over and kissed her it was the end of an inconclusive interview nancy continued at henry street she knew it distressed her father she knew her response to his distress must shortly end her employment he never mentioned her work but asked searchingly after the invitations she received and accepted nancy refused any but the smallest parties where she was unlikely to meet eager suitors her set said she was never the same since babys death they shook their heads that she was developing the same oddities as her father im going to try something entirely new eliots voice had more enthusiasm than he usually allowed himself the luxury or more correctly something extremely old which nobody has bothered themselves to think about intelligently the patient sitting on the bench was pale wizened brighteyed sharpnosed skinny growing bent he wore a coarse woollen peajacket with two rows of buttons like a sailors a greasy choker the patched corduroy trousers flopping over his boots held by a broad brassbuckled belt stained cap and stubby clay pipe lay on the bare floor though before eight in the morning he reeked of beer his sleeves were pushed to the elbows displaying forearms red weeping pitted with yellow pustules down to the wrists he looked at eliot with the cheerful scepticism of cockneys who throughout londons history have found people trying to sell them secondhand goods or political and religious ideas with comparable passion wot is it mouldy bread luv a duck its been used for centuries by country people for the best of scientific reasonsit worked theres always been lightning in the heavens and steam from volcanoes bill but it needed imagination to turn them into electric light and railway engines the old greengrocers bell clanged as the door opened eliot was startled to see crippen in a drenched bowler and long waterproof coat the streets of london were struggling to become light on the blustery teeming morning of november the peoples surgery had been open a month singlehanded eliot had scrubbed and sawn banged in nails licked with paint the rickety shop in brecknock road which still smelt of rotting cabbage he had wheeled in a handcart bits of furniture from the pawnbrokers in the caledonian road an old lace curtain from his lodgings discouraged the curiosity of passersby through the shop window the secondhand examination couch stood in a small inner room with the bowls and bottles the bandages tow and oiledsilk his own savings and ј from the holloway labour party could provide only essential dressings he perceived that he would be offering advice rather than treatment most common remedies being beyond the pockets of his patients it was his first encounter with crippen since the day baby died eliot congratulated him on being about so early i generally leave home round eight crippen said in his usual quiet absentminded way i get my own breakfast and maybe take belle up a cup of coffee ive a long working day seventhirtys my usual home hour he shook the raindrops from his bowler standing among the wooden forms facing the fire inspected curiously by a dozen waiting patientsporters slaughtermen drovers from the cattle market just off work or just out of the pub i just had to see the surgery that everyone in the neighbourhood is talking about not all of them kindly the local doctors are furious at my robbing them of poor peoples shillings im expecting them any moment to smash my window with toffeehammers they say im insane working for nothing or devilish clever buying votes by free medicine instead of free beer i so enjoyed your company i hoped i might meet you and miss grange once more crippen seemed to have forgotten eliots remark on the stairs i honestly dont recall passing more than a word with other medical men all the twelve years ive been in london i dont join societies and all that you know theyre a bit highfalutin for me miss grange is back in new york eliot told him partly to change the subject partly mischievously he said with the solemnity of addressing a harley street specialist perhaps youd give me a second opinion on this case protesting he was a throat man crippen followed the pair into the inner consultingroom you may think it a case of bockharts impetigo crippen had never heard about the german physician max bockhard eliot knew or the disease he described of pustules bursting from the hair follicles but flattery of assumed knowledge was a courtesy among doctors so widespread it amounted to professional etiquette bill edmonton here works at the slaughterhouse in the cattle market across at copenhagen fields hes picked up a staphylococcal infection from handling the meat which i intend to treat somewhat unorthodoxly i aint a slaughterman doctor bill sat on the spokebacked kitchen chair beside eliots deal table a slaughterman can touch two undred pahnds a year im only a boilerman he grinned pouparts piccadilly potted meat londoners love it eliot remembered the newspaper advertisements of clerics army officers goggled aviators mortarboarded schoolmasters and other persons of authority and energy mouthing forkfuls of its slippery slices like famished children of israel savouring manna what do pouparts pay you it was a question the patients grew to expect from eliot depends bill looked sly i gets paid by the meat wot comes aht of the boiler and the sacks of meal wot i finish wiv from grinding the marrowbones i can make meself a good ten bob a day acause my governor dont use just wot comes from the slaughterahses e buys cheap bits and bones left over by the butchers even from the big ahses in the west end i suppose if its all boiled it kills the germs said eliot resignedly id like to take a look round the market one day bill a doctor should know the working conditions of his patients most know as little as of those in a young ladies seminary come on a monday morning he invited with pride its the best day theres two thasand bullocks an ten thasand sheep sold on mondays so they say perhaps ill come tomorrow from a glass bell on an upturned orangebox eliot took two slimy green squares on a strip of cheesecloth crippen peered curiously through his goldrimmed glasses mould eliot explained which ruins leftover breadandcheese and last sundays cold mutton its a fungus named penicillium it was first mentioned in that famous book by mordecai cooke fungi their nature influence and uses that was published fifty years ago crippen looked vague eliot might have been talking of the vulgate its a tangle of filaments a lacework as familiar through my microscope as the tramway map of london eliot pressed the mould on bills pusriddled forearms covered it with a square of oiled silk and secured it firmly with bandages now pass a specimen of your water in this jamjar bill boils can be associated with diabetes cant they dr crippen undoubtedly said crippen to whom the connection was clearly as novel as between water and ice to a south sea islander bill left cap on head and pipe in mouth wearing the expression of awe shot with distrust of any cockney finding himself the object of learned attention eliot washed his hands with yellow soap in a tin basin on another upturned crate he told crippen im not running this surgery to cure holloways aches and pains but to show what must be done this is the most generous city in the worldyouve only to look at frys guide to london charities theres two thousand hospitals asylums dispensaries homes orphanages not to mention bible tract and missionary societies all with a total income of twelve million pounds a year the british arent mean theyre classridden theyd share their last crust with a beggar but if he demanded half as a human right theyd rather toss it down the sewer eliot wiped his hands on a towel hanging from a nail oh i know therere plenty of medical clubs but they have to compete with the burial clubs and the cockney prefers the prospect of a good funeral to that of postponing it crippen seemed unstirred by social injustice he enquired were you free for dinner tomorrow eliot excused himself promptly tomorrows the lords vote on the budget ill be in parliament square to see any fun please apologize to mrs crippen i shall not be with belle you remember miss le neve my typist we have been acquainted since when i was consulting physician to the drouet institute and she came to us straight from pitmans college only seventeen we often have dinner together at frascatis in oxford street they have a nice winter garden with beautiful music and you can get a good little table dhфte for five shillings eliot felt admiration at such dalliance in the ogreish shadow of belle im sure that ethel would enjoy the company of a medical man so cultivated as yourself quite as much as i do eliot rang the compliment on the counter of cynicism after some persuasion he agreed it might be amusing to observe crippen without belle frascatis made a change from the caledonian road crippen was so pathetically pleased his watery eyes seemed likely to spill over as he turned to leave crippen reached for a thick green book beside the belljar on the orangebox walsham and spencer theory and practice of surgery he murmured reverently crippen turned the pages trephining the skullrhinoplastyfracture of the shaft of the femurstrangulated hernia he read aloud do you know ive still my surgical instruments i keep the case at home behind the books belle doesnt like to look at them she calls them a hoodoo she had an operation once he disclosed quietly an ovariotomy in new yorkoh over ten years ago they left behind the womb and the fallopian tubes so the scars not too ugly he took the other volume from the orangebox grays anatomy fifteenth edition by pickering pick frcs of st georges hospital he read out as though the title page of the bible such a wonderful book i came across it while studying operations here in england back in borrow it if you wish eliot invited handsomely may i i shall find nothing more satisfying than renewing my knowledge of the human body crippen told him gratefully ill keep it from the rain under my waterproof ive only a little walk to catch the underground at camden road station i really called to ask if youd be interested in a little proposition eliot stared unbelieving after crippens last feeler i hold the patent of a remedy called ohrshob called what the german for ear with shob from absorb a good name i think its an ear salve for deafness if you could dispose of a gross among your patients id be most liberal with the commission eliot clapped him on the shoulder he felt no anger nor contempt for this threadbare physician only sorrow and amusement he later reflected this attitude brought the failure of his early life and the success of his later one my patients could never afford your remedies might i suggest an alternative spare them a mite yourself crippen seemed neither offended nor unresponsive i shall draw a cheque dr beckett frascatis at eight tomorrow the door jangled and he stepped into the rain it was still raining hard at six the next morning when eliot arrived at the cattle market it was almost an hour before sunrise the market was vast acres years old a monument to the practicality which illuminated the victorians life as gloriously as their religion a foot high white stone clocktower surmounted by a gold dragon windvane dominated as majestically as the campinale in florence a crushed cloister of shops and offices the post office and telegraph station around massed rows of ironrailed stalls for the cattle which lowed their way through every year along the edges stretched the sheep and bullock lairs low buildings with slateandglass roofs split for healthy ventilation openfronted with slim iron pillars a threefoot deep cobbled gully along the back for hosing away each mornings dung victorian expedience incorporated a pub at each corner identical italianate fourstorey square buildings the lion the lamb the bull and the white horse open all night eliot had sent a boy to bill edmonton at pouparts meat works saying to meet him in the white horsebill certainly could not read a note eliot bought him threehapennoth of porter but insisted leaving the warm gaslight before bill became hopelessly drunk they entered a broad gate in the bluepainted tenfoot railings under the naphtha flares the sight struck eliot as a brownish choppy sea with mooing for the sound of waves whistling and clanking of trains came from the huge triangular great northern goods depot against the regents park canal where truckloads of cattle and sheep from the midland shires and yorkshire moors were shunted about all night the iron rails which confined the beasts hemmed the humans into narrow lanes butchers in bowler hats and heavy topcoats landowners in deerstalkers and inverness capes farmers wearing oldfashioned varnished flat waterproof hats drovers with long sticks and leatherstrapped corduroys who had walked ten miles from the home counties during the night uncountable cockneys with caps and mufflers and their hands in their pockets and as many dogs barking snapping and sparring seeming to enjoy the morning better than any other living things in sight small tight groups of betterdressed men with notebooks and pencils directed at the cattle sharp looks honed on experience a nod sealing the bargain for another restless knot of animals to sizzle in the ovens or grills of londoners the repetitive largescale transformation of living organisms into dead edibles chilled eliots imagination to bill the market was only an area which filled and emptied in the early morning and needed hosing down before the next bill conducted him across the broad cobbled market road which bisected the pens a pair of men in oilskins like sailors goaded cattle into a long shed with a platform some six feet high running its length on which stood a pair of men with sledgehammers bill leered the killing pen they mounted the platform as the gate clanged shut on a packed snorting heaving line of cattle ave a look at the knockers at work unhurriedly the sledgehammers fell on the flat of the animals heads with a steady crack like a sportsmans gun the knockers never missed the beast fell or sagged against the flanks of its fellows once the line was silent and still save for mortal spasms the knockers rested sweating on their hammers the far gate was opened and a team of men with hooks dragged the carcasses into the brightly gaslit building beyond were they dead eliot wondered or merely stunned in the next building it made no difference all were raised by their hind hoofs on chains from the roof and had their throats cut over buckets the room was filled with men engulfed in leather aprons like a blacksmiths they decapitated the animals with a stroke of a cleaver tossing the heads like footballs into iron bins they spread the carcasses on the flagged floor shackling their hooves to short iron posts and dextrously rid them of their hides the shiny bloody torsos were shifted by handcarts to worn wooden tables where more aproned men chopped them to bits separating the entrails into separate round bins of liver kidneys lungs guts and tongues with a final bin for all the rest pouparts was hardly more than a shed impossible to see across for steam bullocks and sheeps heads bones with fragments of meat bits of internal organs which had escaped becoming sausages were dumped in boiling vats the meat was sieved and minced seasoned fiercely and packed into tins under heavy weights the liquor went for pea soup the skimmed fat for lard the bones were crushed through steel rollers for meal to nourish the roses in london gardens londoners love it eliot ended with a smile after recounting his investigation to crippen and ethel le neve at frascatis that evening in chicago crippen said with quiet pride theyve got slaughterhouses so efficient they say they use pretty well everything in a hog but its squeal peter youll put me off my dinner ethel dabbed her forehead with a tiny laceedged handkerchief crippen looked delighted ethel my dear when you dine with two doctors you must be ready to hear strange things isnt that so dr beckett perhaps i should never have mentioned it at dinner at all miss le neve but the market made so strong an impression on me theres a broad tumbling styx flowing into the heart of london he said dramatically none of those beasts will ever return to their lush fields and flyblown byres no more than we can reverse the torrents of the river severn yes it is sad said ethel ever so frascatis was large and handsome a cafe and grillroom with the plushcurtained palmfringed winter garden upstairs ethel was prettier than eliot remembered she wore a plain cream blouse and a navy serge skirt befitting the desk rather than the dinnertable her pearl necklace eliot assumed a sham when crippen had introduced her with muted effusiveness she shook hands in a ladylike way whole arm delicately raised her expression seemed consciously subdued a lively young woman wrapping herself tightly in a mantle of modesty to suit the company she differed from belle as a bunch of violets from a bunch of bananas conversation continued untaxingly with ethels enthusiasm for her new typewriter a smith premier with complete control from the keyboard she explained triumphantly it has a combination paragrapher and column finder with removable and interchangeable plattens a stencil key a ribboncolour change and a backspacer eliot gravely congratulated her on command of such advanced machinery then crippen said unexpectedly did you know dr beckett that belle is my second wife i was married to an irish girl from dublin called charlotte bell he reminisced pleasantly a student nurse at the manhattan hospital i was an intern a pretty usual combination isnt it peter has a son ethel added yes otto hes in california now my wife had a fit and died in her next pregnancy that was in salt lake city in the winter of peter makes the perfect husband ethel said with sudden spirit he had no vices and belle can do what she likes with him their house is an absolute disgrace dr beckett she wont keep a servant you know the gas stoves rusty and the kitchens covered with cooking stains theres dirty dishes knives flatirons saucepans everywhere mixed up with belles false hair and even her precious jewellery and as like as not some beautiful white chiffon gown that peters paid a fortune for tossed over a chair with his collars and shirts once she even took in lodgers ethel said indignantly germans she emphasized the horror crippen murmured in mitigation four young students he paused i had to black their boots why shes even had peter make a cage for the cats for fear theyll be put in the family way ethel stopped abruptly pink from the outburst she added firmly of course belle and i get along very well together sometimes were like sisters belle has an extravagant temperament crippen excused her shes polish really exclaimed eliot so she was one of a million central europeans who had jumped out of the fryingpan into the meltingpot her father had a fruitbarrow in brooklynas wed say in london a costermonger her mother was german she called herself cora turner and only after we married did i discover she was really kunigunde mackamatzki he revealed in a mild voice she was nineteen i had to win her from the protection of a man called lincoln crippen broke off his sentence the orchestra began the waltz from franz lehars merry widow which gave george edwardes a succиs fou at daleys in leicester square in crippen put his hand on ethels and exchanged a look of dreamy sentimentality our favourite tune he explained to eliot all that is needed to put the crowning touch on our happiness eliot stared down at his plaicerather than sole it was the five shilling dinnerto avoid laughing at a pathetic little doctor who created romance from a tinselly restaurant a banal tune and a commonplace typist with pretty eyes he had a talent for gemutlichkeit eliot thought he suspected suddenly that crippen had invited him to meet ethel had indulged in such confidences to enrol him as an ally against belle he remembered his fathers advice never be inveigled into marital conflicts or the beds of young married women he spent the rest of the meal talking mostly about the house of lords it bored ethel but crippen seemed to draw from it intellectual uplift over the fruitsalad crippen passed eliot the promised cheque he saw it was for a guinea youre very generous he said warmly the most generous man in the world ethel agreed youve only got to look at belles dresses and jewels havent you it was approaching midnight when crippen hailed a hansom ethel lived in constantine road on the southern edge of hampstead heath barely a mile beyond hilldrop crescent eliot avoided a lift on the excuse of some excitement in the streets of westminster he strode towards the river down kingsway intending to take a tram along the embankment to the houses of parliament he heard the newsboys shouting a special edition he thrust a hapenny at a ragged urchin for the evening times eagerly scanning the front page under a street lamp in the rain on lord lansdownes resolution the house of lords had rejected the house of commons finance bill by votes to eliot crammed the paper into the pocket of his raincoat therell be a general election he exclaimed excitedly a general election as soon as the years out he walked with a springier step seeing himself as dr eliot beckett mp well you made a bit of a fool of yourself said major beckett i misjudged the revolutionary passion of englishmen eliot told his father it boils but only as porridge boils it plops sedately then cools to a stodgy mass perhaps stodginess is our national genius the french and italians are like pans of fat igniting and burning out the kitchen every so often major beckett frowned he was a tall spare man who wore his frock coat and starched collar and cuffs like a uniform his son had developed a clever way of speaking which he enjoyed in women and distrusted in men he supposed those who played politics needed to wrap their opinions like christmas presents or their hearers would discern them no more intelligent than those of the man beside them on the omnibus you did very badly obviously sir as i lost my deposit when i was canvassing with my red rosette every working man in holloway swore to support me in the end they chose the liberal against the conservative they knew where they stood with both parties they dont trust socialism because its newfangled no one is more conservative than the british lower classes it was noon on monday january they sat in the smoking room of the imperial club at the corner of pall mall and st jamess street a cavern hewn from mahogany and leather eliot sipped his sherry his father being oldfashioned took madeira to soldier away half a life in india made a man confident of election to the club a factotum to a nobleman invited the sneering mutterings which could provoke blackballing colonel beckett has risked it he believed that the agent of a duke enjoyed a standing above that of a lord or even earl like dukes servants taking precedence below stairs when their masters were guests at country houses had it occurred to you eliot the working men might have given their vote were you one of them and not of a higher social station should i have sported a cloth cap like keir hardie im not suggesting you played the hypocrite why not sir were a nation of hypocrites we created an empire rather brutally we stand appalled at foreign accusations of drawing economic and political strength from enslaved nations we say were only bringing them the advantages of christianity and drains i suppose you politicos have faith in your ideals as a salesman in his samples however shoddy feeling his political antagonism had displaced paternal affection the major added it must have been a bitter disappointment for you the blackest of my life and wasted work always torments me whether its an experiment which fails or a patient who dies i spent the wettest winter that london has known tramping the holloway streets from the hour men leave for work before daylight to the hour they return well after dark i spoke every night in cold halls smelling of damp clothes and unwashed flesh only quarterfilled with people who were either indifferent or hostile and generally stupid i hope the carnival didnt embarrass you i got a good deal into the newspapers who seemed to find a medical man as a socialist an interesting freak what did the duke think his grace was quite amused he is not particularly interested in electioneering he knows that the important issues in the country are all decided by a dozen or so men like himself i excused you by suggesting youd grow out of it its a poor fighter who throws in the towel after a pummelling in the first round or a wise one your profession passes well in society today doctors have been knighted and of course lister is in the house of lords look at dawson the dukes doctor on the dukes recommendation hes now the kings doctor and set for his knighthood the duke has a soft spot for you eliot and youre damned clever give up this politicking set up your brass plate in harley street a word from the duke could bring you the patients which could bring you a fortune i dont want a fortune you will when youre married your wife will see to that the marriage bed is for me an article of furniture as elusive as a seat in the house of commons the major raised his eyebrows but seemed diffident about pursuing this remark you mustnt starve yourself of the normal pleasures for a young man i recall my own time as a subalternmind london was a rougher place in the seventies with the middlesex and the oxford musichalls going strong there were houses in the haymarket and covent garden where a young serving officer deprived by duty of feminine company might take a years compensation in a single night im going to the musichall tomorrow night said eliot looking amused one of the turns is a lady of my acquaintance i move in theatrical circles you see his father was curious whats her name belle elmore never heard of her she is the wife of a confrиre a funny little man called dr crippen who lives round the corner of course ive taken little interest in such things for years hows mother she has bred a new begonia mention of mrs beckett was an understood signal that one or the other had suffered enough serious conversation when eliot opened his front door with a latchkey emma appeared from the basement to say there were genmen upstairs he found ruston impatiently pacing the carpet wince on the sofa smoking his pipe and reading his times where have you been ruston greeted him the imperial club ruston looked outraged surely a fellow may lunch with his own father i could hardly have invited him to the holloway socialist workers club he tossed his widebrimmed hat on the iron bed why have i this pleasure after my resounding failure at the polls i imagined youd want no more to do with me ruston made an impatient gesture elections are a farce and the result in holloway proved as much the political parties of this country are as irrelevant as a literary teadrinking society all talk gentility and selfishness we shall achieve nothing without force and patience wince turned a page of the paper im giving you a chance to prove what youre made of rushton said such courage as i have is at the disposal of the cause eliot told him we dont want your courage ruston asserted we want your respectability a doctor will provide cover we plan to achieve all we hope in one sharp blow what assassinate mr asquith eliot asked derisively the german emperor oh thats quite ridiculous that is for others to decide not you eliot felt a strengthening of his feeling that ruston was mentally unsound have the practical difficulties occurred to your friends that we are in holloway and he in potsdam that he is surrounded by a bodyguard who would esteem it a privilege dying to the last man emperor william has been on the german throne almost years do you know how many times he has visited this country eleven as the kings nephew hes popular here even if his country isnt if you shoot kaiser bill on his next trip it wont prevent war but provoke it thats the ole idea said wince still reading the paper ruston had been striding the room while talking he stopped hands in the pockets of his tweed trousers we know our prussians theyve constructed the most wonderful military machine which theyre itching to get moving like the proud possessor of a brandnew rollsroyce the kaiser killed in britain think of the excuse it gives the hotheads in berlin once von moltkes general staff have started the engine and released the brake nothing can stop it eliot sat abruptly next to wince who was relighting his pipe and what use will a war be to the english workingman apart from ending his miseries by permitting him to be killed in it war brings revolution the countrys seething as it is look at the trade unionsgaining halfamillion members a year look at the wave of strikes theyre startling the old fuddyduddy union leaders scaring the bosses and terrifying the government out of its wits the election meant nothing nothing both parties were the bosses party the workers are impatient for power theyre scornful of compromise theyre impatient to tear down the plywood barriers in their way tonypandy added wince lugubriously the ole of the south wales coalfields out the workers ave rejected the advice of their own leaders oo are acting a bunch o cowards the bosses are using the one weapon they know and love ruston continued forcefully starvation i hope theyll succeed theyll have the whole working class up in arms there was silence broken by the bubbling of winces pipe i disagree with you said eliot you are not entitled to disagree with me about anything ruston picked up his umbrella and irish hat i only want to be reassured i can rely on you when the time comes i gave you my loyalty five years ago im not the man to withdraw it the first time its tested they left eliot with his legs stretched out staring at the neglected fire he had joined the british revolutionary movement while a medical student at st bartholomews like other young men he wanted to see the world changed not in his lifetime but before he was thirty he stirred uneasily on the sofa if ruston was not mad he lived among political lunatics isolated from the real world like the inhabitants of h g wellss country of the blind which he had just read in a magazine in the cold misty afternoon he was sweating he was afraid of no one but the prospect of helping murder a fellowhuman whether emperor or helpless cripple terrified him had his father met the kaiser he would have courteously invited him to sherry at the imperial club rather than blowing his head off it was growing dark eliot threw coal on the fire and lit the gas he wrote distractedly for a while then threw down his pen and reached among the musicrolls for beethovens sonata no the moonlight he sat on the sofa staring into the flames the music induced a dreaminess which he felt wickedly voluptuous he pulled out his watch and sighed in half an hour he must leave for the metropolitan music hall three or four miles away across regents park in the edgware road crippen had called at the surgery the previous friday with a pressing invitation to share his box belle had a fortnights engagement an agonized week had been passed turning over her wardrobe eliot readily accepted watching belle on the stage promised the fascination of watching blondin cross niagara falls on a tightrope he had picked up his hat and burberry for the theatre when the doorbell jangled loudly he wondered if ruston had returned with a plot to kill the czar as well there was a timid tap at his door he threw it open to reveal nancy they grasped each other for a minute they were unable to speak why didnt you write or cable you were coming dearest eliot asked still incredulous as they stood holding hands staring at each other and laughing oh i dont knowi wasnt sure i could go through with it until id actually rung your doorbell you took a gamble you might have found me living with another woman i didnt think youd possibly find another to suit you if you had id have bowed out happily after me she would need to be a paragon how long are you staying i dont know where im installed at the savoy move in here all right startled by the impulsiveness of invitation and acceptance eliot said but your father he wouldnt care for it at all ill write im in clean lodgings for single ladies hell accept that he accepted me walking the east side slums this winter climbing across tenement roofs with no more protection than a nurses uniform you have made your life complicated being in love with someone always brings complications otherwise wouldnt there be empty shelves in the circulating libraries now were going to the music hall what he took her arm as he had when firmly piloting her round london im committed i never chuck up my obligations to my friends surely you could find somewhere more romantic she protested tonights a memorable theatrical occasion come on they hurried downstairs ruston wince and the kaiser vanished from eliots mind they laughed all the way in the hansom the attraction was belle eliot explained sparkling in the footlights after three years in the domestic dark the reason for her revival was apparent in half a dozen ladies wearing long fur coats and elaborate hats standing in a line with tophatted gentlemen outside the brilliantly lit music hall facade placards declared official picket management unfair to artistes players not paupers eliots preoccupation with the oppressed masses overlooked that they included the musichall performers there was a national musichall strike like all strikes its causes seemed to outsiders mystifyingly trivial an arbitrator had awarded the artistes matinee pay at oneseventh of the evening performance rate in oneshowanight houses onetwelfth in twoshowanight houses barring an artiste for a fortnight from appearing again within a mile radius was to be abolished for those earning under ј a week the musichall managers rejected it a national alliance of artistes held a mass meeting in the surrey theatre will crooks mp in the chair rousing them to stand up and stand firm the managers determined on strikebreaking the names are not those of artistes as well known as those which it is customary to find in the bill era wrote of the musichalls which stayed open hence belles chance eliot realized hence the picketline evoking curiosity and amusement from the public as it pressed leaflets on them with the cheerfulness actors and actresses can never submerge in their activities even attending each others funerals crippen was waiting in the foyer he had a new grey frock coat with a bright orange tie and a lilac waistcoat he was delighted to see nancy how gratifying for belle to be viewed by a fellowcountrywoman on her great night havent you noticed belles strong resemblance to marie lloyd he asked leading them up the redcarpeted stairs to a twoguinea box do you know why she took the name belle elmore because marie lloyd first appeared at the royal eagle calling herself bella delmere he told them proudly they sat on redplush chairs the quack doctor leaves threadbare gentility to bask in the tarnished sun of his wife eliot thought ethel le neve inhabited the real world which the audience had entered the theatre to forget nancy sat squeezing eliots hand before babys illness she was a regular new york theatregoer always in a large party all beautifully dressed awarer of affording pleasure to the ordinary men and their wives peering at them through operaglasses from the cheaper seats it was a social gathering nancy could barely remember the plays she supposed this theatre of faded plush and scratched gilt resembled that her friends fathers recalled fondly the rialto on broadway south of nd street the met was large a seater fifty years old built over the white lion pub which had a reputation among cockneys for singsongs and kneesups the performers were in competition with its generous furnishing of bars the west end theatres seemed as formal as visiting relatives on a sunday afternoon the flickering displays in the picture houses as lacklustre as a dance of ghosts the musichall was like a bank holiday outing when everyone expected to enjoy themselves the songs and sketches went to the audiences hearts because they exhalted lampooned or consoled their everyday joys and pains all of them felt the relationship with lodger or landlord motherinlaw or pawnbroker what it was like to be stoney broke or rolling drunk everyone ate kippers and went to the seaside knew husbands who were henpecked or roving or cuckolds everyone knew they peopled the greatest country on earth and that all foreigners were ridiculous particularly as unable to speak english when the great macdermott had his audiences at the london pavillion thundering back we dont want to fight but by jingo if we do it was a threat which deserved britains enemies taking seriously moustached and brilliantined the conductor rose amid his stiffshirted orchestra bowing deeply to the whistling and clapping after a perfunctory overture the electric candles of the chandeliers dimmed the red curtain rose on a man in furs outside a stageproperty igloo with six seals who tossed brightlycoloured balls to each other played tunes on a rack of rubberbulbed motorhorns climbed ladders performed acrobatics and jumped into a glass watertank nancy was puzzled she had steeled herself for an evening of blue jokes and girls with slashed skirts like the burlesque shows in the bowery where she was no more likely to find herself than at a boxingmatch nothing could be more respectable than performing seals crippen sat engrossed hand limp on the plush edge of the box eliot fancied he had seen the same act as a carousing medical student but perhaps it had been performing dogs the seals were followed by weldon atherstone the monologuist with tophat tails and ebony cane perfect tailoring was his trademark like the black halfmoons of george robeys eyebrows or albert chevaliers suit of cockney costermongers buttoncovered pearlies he did fagin in the condemned cell from oliver twist the musichall falling as silent as a church the black stage the crossbeam the rope atherstones low voice seemed to ooze from him all the hideous apparatus ofdeath violent applause only forty years ago eliot reflected this audience in its ancestors shoes waited excitedly through the night for the mornings execution outside newgate jail calls of blackleg came from halfadozen voicesplanted by the strike committee he suspected next appeared a pair of chinese wirewalkers in kimonos and platelike hats then the orchestra struck up yankee doodle belle had not seen the pinnacles of new york for thirteen years but an american act was thought so smart on the london stage some natives changed their accent to brooklyn and their costume to wild west eliot saw crippens hand tighten on the plush belles waist was so pinched between bursting bosom and spreading hips it looked to eliot in danger of exploding like the boundup barrel of some ancient siegeartillery pressed back to service the skirt of her green silk gown foaming with lace trailed a yard behind her her hair was in bright blonde curls as tight as the head of a cauliflower her heavy face was vivid with greasepaint dusted with powder like an appledumpling with flour she stood between two vases of artificial red roses holding a mirror edged with gold tassels which she flashed along the stalls fixing on a sallowfaced man with a limp moustache she started to sing wholl be my sweetheart tonight the thin notes fell into the auditorium like shot sparrows blackleg and scab came from the same seats whistling and hissing from the gallery belle interpreted the noise as shouts of approval and hoots of delight she favoured her audience with reparteenot the daggered cockney wit of bessie bellwood the rabbitskinners daughter who lived with the duke of manchester but oh you naughty boy and wouldnt you like me to hold your hand expression and utterance had the mawkish combination of ardent promise and coy chastity in equal proportions the conductor was looking nervously over his shoulder belle stopped the house was in uproar she nervously exchanged a word with him smiled bravely and began something to warm your feet on hapennies started to fly across the footlights the strikers had come well armed coinage was augmented by eggs one cracking against belles skirt she burst into tears rushing from the stage still clutching her mirror the curtain fell the noise coalesced to a chant we want our money back three roughclothed men had quit the frustrating remoteness of the gallery to climb over the footlights a rousing roll came on the drums stand up eliot hissed at nancy why the national anthem always played after a show everyone in the house even the intruders on the stage stood stiffly while the orchestra on their own feet played god save the king the conductor cautiously signalled for another drumroll and repeated the verse the tension had gone a heavilymoustached man in evening dress appeared gingerly through the curtain to announce hastily that money would be returned at the boxoffice belles talents arent suited to these audiences said crippen she was born for opera his face was pink his bland expression blighted with disappointment and shame the evening had done ethel good eliot thought well belle dear i forgive you though i daresay hundreds wouldnt said clara martinetti amiably oh gee dont go on about it belle told her curtly i shant dear i promise ill not utter another word now ive had my say but you are honorary treasurer of the music hall ladies guild arent you dear and to go strikebreaking wasnt belle punished enough on the night paul martinetti asked charitably getting the bird is the worst punishment in the whole world clara agreed im sure peter could see that oh yes id much rather be hanged crippen assented mildly but clara sweetie dont you see i only got hissed because i was a blackleg there were folk planted in the house for no other purpose than to wreck my act im not downhearted no sir belles voice rose ive had offers last week from the euston from collinss across in islington even from the hippodrome and i could take my pick of the provincial touring companies tomorrow couldnt i peter claras expression indicated sour disbelief sugared with politeness it was a week later just before ten on the evening of monday january the four sat in the downstairs breakfast room at hilldrop crescent they had just finished dinnerloin of pork with jacket potatoes followed by blancmange with strawberry jam eliot and nancy had been asked too crippen had called at the surgery with the invitation the morning after the fiasco eliot had politely declined ithe had stomached enough of the grotesque crippensbut asked sympathetically after belle not in bad shape mr atherstone was wonderful last night you know comforting her she bounced back shes like a rubber ball he paused sometimes shes like a tiger he looked round the bleak consulting room sitting in the spokebacked chair do you use henbane in your practice dr beckett luckily i have no maniacal patients i first learned of it at the royal bethlem hospital for the insane crippen continued quietly its given a good deal in america you know in asylums ive prescribed it as a nerve remedy in a homoeopathic preparation very diluted in sugared discs naturally in its pure form which the chemists call hyoscine the dose would equal lths of a grain extremely minute as demanded by the laws of homoeopathy he asserted i bought five grains from lewis and burrows chemist shop in oxford street last friday five grains eliot exclaimed thats enough to kill a platoon of guardsmen i also find it useful for spasmodic coughs and asthma he explained and i am persuading belle to take it he hesitated again i can satisfy her demands in the way of clothes and jewellery others i cannot you understand dr beckett im not a young man like you and it is ethel and i who are proper hub and wife he continued solemnly our wedding day was december seven years had passed since ethel and i first met its a date i can never forget it was a thursday it was the time belle finally got rid of the germans it was rainy but it was all sunshine in our hearts his colleagues double life seemed to eliot more sickly than exciting and he had a roomful of waiting patients since then we have had one long lovely honeymoon we have an absolute communion of spirit it is not a love of a debased or degraded character it is a wonderful good pure love crippen continued with muted passion her mind is so beautiful to me ethel will always be my wifie not even death can come between us we meet in the afternoon once or twice a week at kings cross station and go to one of the little hotels for railway travellers crippen fell silent eliot began to look upon him more kindly as a patient to share a mans secrets was to fractionize his mental tension we were to have had a little one you know ethel and i crippen divulged in his flat voice in the early part of last year but poor ethel suffered a miscarriage no one knew at the office ethel was so often away from work because of her health her parents did not know only mrs jackson her landlady ethel went to her aunt in hove for recuperation we so wanted the child to live it would have been part of us both that was something belle could never give me not after her operation belle has a gentleman you know eliot was not surprised an american in the real estate business at chicago crippens bulgy eyes fixed eliots he was an actor on the musichall called bruce miller he met her when i was visiting america id left belle in rooms at guildford street over the river in lambeth he was across the herring pond for some business with the paris exhibition so it must be ten years ago hes often here he writes almost every month love and kisses to brown eyes ive seen some of the letters ive never met him he calls when im out i stay away from his path im easygoing i dont care for fuss im sure that one fine morning ill find belle has disappeared gone to join him in america which would be a solution to your difficulties i cannot give belle what he does crippen said simply do you know why i was attracted to her i expected belle to be a great favourite on the stage thunderous applause flowers across the footlights delightful suppersthats a vanished dream mind i enjoy the company of stage people like the martinettis but theyre so excitable so emotional theyre not cultivated like miss grange and yourself the dinner which eliot declined ended with the two men going upstairs to prepare for whist and clara following belle with the dishes into the kitchen put the bones in the sack under the sink belle directed peter takes them to pouparts in the cattle market whats the point missing a few pennies which are there for the taking how peter does look after you clara said admiringly she touched belles rising sun brooch adding playfully if youre ever tired of that lovely thing he bought you you can just pass it on to me aint there more to a husbands job than keeping his wife dressed a whole world more dear peter and me have had our own bedrooms since we moved in here oh i know that belle carefully gathered the four bottles of stout with a farthing returnable on each peter aint no good to any woman you cant blame me can you for looking around clara said sharply i dont think that relieves a woman of her duty to her husband she set her load of plates on the greasy wooden drainingboard beside a sink already piled with dirty crockerysome smeared with egg she noticed unwashed since breakfast peter doesnt mind belle said casually but whats the good of a home and a husband if youve got talent if the stage is in your blood you dont care much for the washtub and the dustpan thats true belle clara agreed though sounding sad that she had to they found crippen alone in the parlour adjusting the gasfire wheres paul belle demanded gone to the smallest room what by himself why didnt you take him crippen straightened blinking he knows the way the light it always on im sure paul doesnt mind clara said why this house is like our second home its common politeness belle sat in a pink armchair by the fire peters taken to leaving the light on all night because he has to get up she explained unkindly perhaps hes the same trouble as paul peter im cold fetch my shawl and pass round the chocolates she commanded as paul slipped back to the parlour the box was a condolence from the martinettis belle took three of four holding them in her palm and gobbling them one after the other they all turned hearing paul gasp he had idly picked up a large book and flicked the pages what is it paul clara was puzzled things not for the eyes of ordinary men grays anatomy crippen remarked he helped himself to a chocolate dr beckett loaned it me you shouldnt leave an awful book like that lying about belle complained youve upset paul no its interesting clara had her fingers in the pages oh what a spooky picture she exclaimed what is it crippen leaned between the martinettis thats your lungs and your heart with the great bloodvessels rising beside your windpipe it looks like some ship with two billowing sails observed paul more discriminatively oh mercy is that my leg clara cried those are the muscles crippen explained separated very prettily in the picture arent they like the petals of a flower clara turned more pages and that the womb peter snapped belle what language crippen took the book from the martinettis snapping it shut with unusual assertiveness werent we playing whist belle asked sarcastically set up the table and bring the cards peter they played until one in the morning to theatrical people night is the workingmans afternoon none needed be up in the morningexcept crippen at seven at half past one belle opened the front door paul was in overcoat silk muffler and top hat clara wrapped in furs gee its freezing belle announced sure you wouldnt care to pass the night wed best get back to shaftesbury avenue belle pauls better sleeping at home hes not at all well you know peter fetch them a cab therell be one on the rank round the corner in york road not at this hour crippen said doubtfully surely you can pick one up in the street crippen hurried into the sparsely gaslit night without overcoat or hat the three waited in the hall chatting until hooves clattered up the crescent the hansom stopped lamps like bleary eyes over its pair of wheels horse snorting muffled bowlerhatted cabby with whip on his perch breath of man and animal a cloud in the still frosty air the kneedoors flew open crippen stepped out and politely waited to help his guests in clara noticed him shivering goodnight belle she kissed her hostess fondly at the top of the front steps ill come down to see you off no dont come down belle youll catch your death the driver cracked his whip the crippens stood waving in their lighted doorway as the hansom drove towards the camden road from where they could hear the lowing of cattle gathering for sale and slaughter in the metropolitan market crippen shut the front door belle returned to the armchair by the fire he reached to dim the gasglobe why are you turning the gas down she demanded economy the companys left the curtain falls he remained standing in the middle of the room she pulled her shawl round her looking at him curiously thats a strange thing for you to say is it but a social performance is like one on the stage we all play our parts we can generally tell the others lines before they speak them with the martinettis i feel like the manager of a theatre i dont play a part not in my own home he said nothing arent you getting me another glass of brandy or dont you want me to have a wink of sleep crippen descended the stone steps to the kitchen the brandy was in a cupboard with the bottles of stout all bought from the grocers in brecknock road he reappeared with a squat glass containing over an inch of dark spirit belle took it without a word she sat sipping while he folded the greenbaize cloth collected the cards and moved the square table against the wall this brandys scented i guess its a new bottle i got it on my way home its cheaper which accounts for the stronger taste the grocer told me the best brandy is almost tasteless like drinking liquid fire she held the empty glass out crippen disappeared she heard him knock over something in the kitchen below which smashed on the floor it was the gravy boat he announced reappearing with more brandy it was cracked anyway theres something funny about you you dont usually break things if we had a housemaid i suppose shed break much more he stood facing her back to the gasfire hands under the tails of his grey frockcoat why did you talk to the martinettis tonight of engagements offered you at the euston and collinss you knew they were lies dont dare call me a liar she said stridently crippen kept his impassiveness you have been lying much worse to yourself you never had the slightest prospect of being a success on the stage not from the moment i first set eyes on you when you came into my office while i worked for dr jeffery in new york when youd just had a miscarriage she opened her mouth but instead of speaking screwed her eyes up youre sort of shimmering youve drunk a lot of brandy its slurring your speech i paid for your voice training with a proper coach right after we were married till the hard times came in the winter of and the money ran out i paid for your gowns i paid for your jewels i paid for that show you were in back in as cora motzi in vio and mitzkis bright lights he derided her daringly bright lights you never dazzled anyone in the world except me last week at the met i saw what you were worth nothing her only response was to say in a dreamy voice gee im kind of dry my throats burning get me a glass of water peter when he returned from the kitchen with a tumbler she was asleep he stood staring at her she opened her eyes suddenly where you been to fetch you a drink she took the glass crippen resumed his stance by the fire when are you going to see bruce miller again she choked unable to swallow shut your mouth about bruce miller what about richard ehrlich the german student who was your lover under this very roof did you ever see him again what if i did youre no use to any woman i am to any normal woman what are you saying im not normal you suffer from nymphomania belle started to laugh it became wilder then uncontrollable she swung about in the chair gripping the arms crippen watched her i intend to treat you for it treat me she stopped laughing staring at him fixedly i like that how ill ask with henbane thats a poison she shouted all drugs are poisons unless taken in the right doses why dont you treat ethel le neve belle asked thickly le neve she sneered she was born plain neve her fathers a coals canvasser who gets drunk in the pubs and gets arrested youre drunk yourself belle halfrose gasping that table the one we played cards on it moved look she gave a hoarse cry theres something under it a dog a huge black dog i cant see anything crippen said mildly belle slumped back holding her forehead in both hands my face is burning im sick i guess help me to bed crippen suddenly leant over her gripping her arms how many times have you threatened to leave me he said with unknown venom threatened it would be the happiest release for me and ethel you could take your jewels you could take our whole ј in the charing cross bank you could go off to america to bruce miller to whoever you cared but you wouldnt you found me too useful here working my heart out at munyons the drouet institute the tooth specialists providing you with clothes and comfort a slave for anything you fancied youve your own friends your own pleasures you leave me here lonely and miserable the only sympathy and affection ive ever had in the world is from ethel he straightened up she sat looking dazed slowly rubbing her arms all right all right ill go she mumbled its too late now what dyou mean i dont know my head is full of bees he told her abruptly she half rose face shot with terror she screamed it aint a dog its a bear he glanced quickly at the drawn curtains of pink velvet they were thick enough to muffle the sound the neighbours were anyway used to belles outbursts theres nothing there youre seeing things oh peter she looked at him piteously clutching her breast my heartmy heartits flying from my body youre drunk you had three glasses playing cards maybe that brandys not only stronger in taste she rose unsteadily from the chair her mouth opened no words came she staggered clutching the mantelpiece pulling the pink cloth smashing a china cat against the gasfire peter she screamed crippen continued staring hands under coattails im dying he did not move im going next door to mrs harrison she tried to walk knocked over the small table clattering the framed photographs on the floor she crumpled she lay face down on the carpet giving a huge gasp crippen stayed immobile belle he said quietly he hesitated belle he crouched and turned her halfover her face was dusky her mouth slack her eyes partly open he stood up so he said he gave her chest a gentle kick partly inquisitive partly insolent belle has left me he murmured he sounded unbelieving he walked quickly round the room hands in pockets he stopped suddenly righted the overturned table and carefully replaced the photographs he rearranged the pink mantelpiece cover picking up the fragments of china from the carpet cupping them delicately in his left hand leaving the room for the kitchen and tipping them into the round bin under the sink where belle had scraped the leavings from their dinner plates he returned to the parlour strode straight past belle crouched and switched off the gasfire then he turned belle on her back with his foot he raised her eyelids revealing pupils like black full moons he felt her wrist for a pulse noticing the forearms drawn in spasm the fingers clawed so belle shall vanish he said he began to undress her he unbuttoned her yellow silk gown down the back unlaced the waist pulled the bodice from her crooked arms and tugged the skirts from her feet the cotton underskirt was soaked with urine he remembered that belle had not visited a certain room since dinner he tugged off the black ankle boots with pearl buttons up the side and unbuckled the black lisle stockings from suspenders stretching halfway down her fat thighs he loosed the tape of her cotton knickers which ended in sixinch frills over the knee he unknotted the lacing of her stays ripping them off her wobbling buttocks she had only an undervest with six buttons which he loosed from wallowing breasts he had not seen her naked for five years or so she always had him come to her in the dark like an animal he noticed the scar running from navel to pubic hair the incision for the ovariotomy which turned her barren he unpinned the rising sun brooch unclasped the gold chain of a lozengeshaped diamond pendant from the fleshy bluetinged base of her neck slipped off her gold wristwatch pulled the two diamond rings from her right hand and the ruby from her left placed them among the photographs her broad gold wedding ring would not budge with determined tugs he noticed a sticky thick smear of vomit on the carpet noting to mop it with the kitchen dishcloth later crippen hung his frockcoat over the back of a chair he pulled belle by her feet across the carpet into the bareboarded hall the clocks chimed halfpast it was only an hour since the martinettis had left gripping her ankles he pulled her up the stairs her head bouncing from step to step tortoiseshell combs spilling from her hair he was sweating he tugged her across the lino into the bathroom grunting he bundled her into the bath there was a gurgle and faeces oozed through her flaccid anal sphincter he wrinkled his nose turned on the cold tap used the rosepatterned pitcher from the marbletopped washstand to swill it down the plughole he went downstairs felt for his leathercovered case of instruments behind the books and stuck grays anatomy under his arm belle filled the bath breasts slid sideways her stomach slack rolls of fat her face blue crippen loosened his cufflinks and turned up his sleeves as he moved her head long musclescalpel in hand she made a low groan he jerked up shocked was she still alive he decided it was a postmortem effect he dug the scalpel into her neck to the left of her windpipe trying to sever the tendinous end of the sternomastoid muscle from the top of the breastbone he pulled the knife out it was ridiculously blunt he inspected the edge noticed his razorstrop on its hook below the window and honed it for some minutes he was delighted to find that it cut flesh like the tenderest chicken he severed the big carotid arteries and jugular veins blood stickying his fingers as he slit through her windpipe and gullet he must decide the next step he opened grays anatomy on the corkseated white bathroom chair seeking the section osteology bloodying the pages as he turned them crippens anatomical knowledge was skimpy but principles learned in the dissecting room remain in the mind like the principles of christianity to the theological student long left the seminary he found the subsection vertebrae cervicales under columna vertebralis he dug the knife through the skin and fat of the neck severing the elastic ligaments which join one vertebral bone and the next like the segments of oxtail in a stew as he lifted belles head into the air something clattered against the enamel of the bath a circular metal hindes curler with three or four inches of bleached brown hair twined in it belle had overlooked unclipping it with the others when she dressed he wondered if the martinettis had noticed it reaching for a pair of long pointed scissors from the instrument case he cut the curler free clanging to the bottom of the bath where the headless body had trapped pools of blood he decided to take the hair off snipping into the rosepatterned washbasin until the head was as bare as a nuns he would burn the hair in the kitchen stove with his shirt and gray hair did not rot the teeth too could be an obstacle he could extract them and drop them into the bin at albion house unnoticeable among the days crop osteotomy forceps like a stout pair of nailclippers severed the ribs as though pulling apart the picked carcass of a chicken to boil for soup he tugged the severed gullet and windpipe from the hollow of the corpse he cut the flat muscle of the diaphragm which separated chest from belly he slit the guts from the filmy bloodgorged fatty mesentry which secured them to the trunk like a string of sausages in a paper bag he had blood to the elbows and leaning over the bath was backbreaking he freed the sloppy brownish gleaming liver the kidneys dangling from their springy arteries the spleen like a huge red mushroom the bag of belles stomach still containing her roast pork her potatoes in their jackets and her blancmange the brandy stinking like an uncorked bottle he severed the top of the rectum where it joined the big pipe of the gut gripping the joined organs by the gullet and windpipe he pulled them with a glug and a squelch from the husk he wondered what to do with them he dropped them between belles legs he rinsed hands and forearms under the cold tap from the hook on the door hung his greenstriped flannel pyjama jacket forgotten that morning after shaving he wrapped it round the organs like pastry round the meat of a cornish pastie he remembered belles womb it would never do leaving that he clutched it in the basin of her pelvis her bladder squirted the last of the urine between her legs with one cut he had her womb and most of her vagina her ovaries had gone to another knife seventeen years before the clocks chimed four completing the job could wait until tomorrow it was cold belle would not go off any sooner than a joint freshly bought from the butchers would the neighbours be curious over the bathroom light they were familiar with the gas burning in the smallest room next door he had forgotten the weddingring on her third finger reaching for the scalpel he adroitly severed the finger through the little joint at its base pulled off the ring and tossed the digit into the empty body no hilldrop crescent was equidistant from the church in oseney crescent across brecknock road and another at the angle of camden and caledonian road with the laziness of london clocks each chimed in succession not synchrony crippen woke as usual while they were announcing seven he was so late to bed he had set the doublebelled american alarm clock for seventhirty and he fumbled to press off the switch it was over a halfhour till sunrise he felt for a vesta and lit the bedside candle he was in clean pyjamas one of the three identical greenstriped pairs belle had bought at the winter sale of jones brothers shirtmakers holloway he lay still on the narrow brass bed in the cold small room with pink dogroses twining up the wallpaper was it a dream he reached for his round goldrimmed glasses stood up stretched crossed the lino to the bathroom he lit the gas it was clearly not a dream belles clipped head stared at him from between her feet the pile of entrails peeped glisteningly from the wrapping of pyjama jacket his problem was where to shave he collected his razor turned off the gas and descended to the kitchen by seventhirty he was dressed his steaming cup of camp coffee wedged among last nights dirty crockery on the kitchen table he felt belle was as usual asleep under the bright pink coverlet of her bed with pink bows on the corners as far as the world would know she was by his usual homecoming time she would be going to america it was fascinating living her life for her he bolted the tradesmans entrance and locked the front door behind him no one would call mrs harrison visited only when invited as they used condensed milk the milkman knocked only on sunday the baker left a loaf on the side step wednesdays and saturdays he took his usual way to caledonian road underground station skirting the cattle market he arrived before nine at aural remedies at craven house in kingsway miss ena balham thirtyish in black serge with pincenez and a faint moustache was behind her big square black typewriter did you say white rabbits crippen looked mystified its february the first she chided him he took her inchthick sheaf of newly opened letters aural remedies was a correspondence clinic people with bad ears responded to advertisements in titbits or john bullenclosing postal order with stamped addressed envelopeand crippen dispatched the remedies he flicked through them silently pencilling codenumbers for which letter miss balham should write or which bottle of eardrops dispatch you quite well this morning doctor she asked kindly perfectly she gave a slight laugh you seem so quiet not your usual self ive some urgent business at the tooth specialists he hurried towards oxford street a few minutes and he would be seeing ethel now they were really hub and wifie they could live under the same roof the future shone like a summer sunrise the shiny black leatherette cover stood on her machine wheres ethel he asked explosively the office contained only miss marion curnow the middleaged manageress in white blouse and check skirt she looked surprised she just phoned from constantine road shes a little poorly this morning ethel was often poorly they called her behind her back not very well thank you well doctor its an important day in your life crippen started why youre freed from slavery to munyons crippen nodded distractedly he had drawn dwindling commission as an agent since munyons office in oxford circus failed you dont take it hard doctor my continuing as munyons london manageress miss curnow accepted his manner as pique no not at all the money was hardly a kings ransom he paused all four who worked in his office knew that crippen had been short of funds since christmas his wifes dresses alonemiss curnow had thought severely im expecting quite a considerable sum coming in from america crippen went to his room he left before noon tell dr ryland i shant be back today he instructed miss curnow the head would be a difficulty it needed cutting into fairly small bits and he had not the luxury of time perhaps some other approach would suggest itself the limbs should sever easily at the joints with assistance from the arthrology section in gray he hurried to shaftesbury avenue turned into no king edwards mansions and rang the bell of the martinettis flat hows paul he asked clara at the door hes just gone into a nice sleep if you dont mind i shant waken him hows belle oh shes all right give her my love yes i will the next day was wednesday and the weekly meeting of the music hall ladies guild the morning was bitter and overcast gas flaring in the shop windows as crippen made his way to work he went directly to the tooth specialists miss curnow was unpinning her hat he set a packet on ethels typewriter and left immediately for aural remedies round the corner ethel arrived ten minutes later she wore under her overcoat a blue serge costume trimmed with black braid she sat at her typewriter unhurriedly opening the packet inside was an envelope addressed to her well i never she exclaimed shes gone to america who has mrs crippen hasnt she been threatening to for years crippens note asked her to pass an enclosed package to miss melina may secretary of the music hall ladies guild on the floor below he would look in later they could have a pleasant little evening the errand seemed unurgent ethel passed over the package at ten to one on her way to lunch mrs martinettis just telephoned remarked miss may at her desk with her typewriter and wire baskets of correspondence she cant come to the meeting her husbands still poorly miss may opened the packet she was dark pale pretty once broke her leg developed a limp had to renounce the stage she was surprised to find the guilds cheque book pass book and payingin book two letters were addressed from hilldrop crescent and dated that day dear miss may said the first illness of a near relative has called me to america on only a few hours notice so i must ask you to bring my resignation as treasurer before the meeting today so that a new treasurer can be elected at once she frowned the writing was not belles she looked at the foot yours belle elmore pp hhc miss may resumed you will appreciate my haste when i tell you that i have not been to bed all night packing and getting ready to go i hope i shall see you again a few months later but cannot spare a moment to call on you before i go i wish you everything nice till i return to london again now goodbye with love hastily well really complained miss may the other letter was longer addressed to the committeedear friendsexplaining the sudden flight submitting belles resignation urging the rules be suspended for election of another treasurer that very day sending my pals her loving wishes it was in the same handwriting as the other miss may was cross everyone liked the ebullient belle anyone merited sympathy over a sick relative but suddenly changing the treasurer meant enormous unnecessary fuss crippen had two mornings work in one at aural remedies eardrops must be made up and packed in their pasteboard cases the january accounts needed sending to eddie marrthe new york advertising man who put up aural remedies money he longed to see ethel but dared not reach albion house before the music hall ladies guild dispersed at about four he strolled down oxford street to attenboroughs with the three brass balls outside he pawned seven diamond rings a pair of diamond earrings and a diamond brooch taking the ј in banknotes he signed the contract note readily he was well known in the pawnshop he often brought belles jewellery for repair it was only threethirty he turned the opposite way to albion house towards shaftesbury avenue he was surprised to find mrs martinetti in not at the meeting well youre a nice one she greeted him at the door belle gone to america and you didnt let us know anything about it melinda phoned from the guild i couldnt leave paul in bed though hes much better crippen came into the flat which was small mahoganypanelled and embellished with framed photographs of other theatricals all ebulliently and lovingly autographed why didnt you send us a wire she was more curious than scolding i would have liked to go to the station and bring some flowers there wasnt time the cable came late last night i had to look out a lot of paperslegal and family papers the rest of the night we were busy packing she said with resignation but unable to suppress annoyance packing and crying i suppose we have got past that he said vaguely did she take all her clothes with her one basket clara was amazed but that wouldnt be nearly enough to go all that way she can buy something over there clara stood holding the rounded back of a chair crippen was edging towards the door the doctor was always busy belles sure to send me a postcard from the ship she said more agreeably or shell write when she gets to new york she doesnt touch new york no she goes straight on to california whereabouts to your son around los angeles he made a broadly embracing gesture up in the hills right up in the mountains clara concentrated perplexity and irritation into a small sigh i suppose you wont be wanting tickets for the benevolent fund ball now its the twentieth sunday fortnight at the criterion as usual ill take a couple anyway he said generously she picked up a book of tickets from the clothdraped mantelpiece theyre half a guinea each he opened his wallet taking care she did not see the pawnbrokers ј notes perhaps somebody else would like to go he suggested absently he waited until five before reappearing at the yale tooth specialists miss curnow had gone home ethel was alone with two men in office suits who were peering earnestly at the magazines while waiting for dr rylance she arched her eyebrows shes gone when i got home last night shed vanished shell come back i dont think so ethels eyes flicked towards the patients what about her luggage i suppose she took enough why do women ask so closely about trifles like luggage he wondered he added in a low voice she left a note saying i must do what i could to cover up the scandal they looked at each other deeply for some seconds all they longed for had unexpectedly unbelievably happened remembering his note she asked did you want to go somewhere this evening frascatis perhaps id better get home this evening there may be a wireless from the ship there must be a lot to clear up he nodded can i come and help wait till monday we can go to the theatre then itll cheer me up he placed his hand upon hers by the typewriter clasped it fiercely and left by saturday all was done sunday was crippens bath day he closed the window lit the geyser and lay in the hot water gazing through the steam into the bright morning sunshine deliciously gemьtlich his only concern was the grays anatomy burnt in the kitchen range with belles womb and vagina wrapped in the news of the world he wondered if dr beckett was expecting it back it would be polite to enquire when crippen did call upon eliot a couple of months had passed towards two oclock on the afternoon of saturday april he appeared at the peoples surgerywhich everyone in holloway called the free medicine shop nancy had a coat over her blueandwhite striped nurses uniform specially made by libertys in regent street she was going with eliot to the brecknock dining rooms which served beefsteak pudding cheese and tea on marbletopped tables for sixpence their usual patients were augmented that morning by venturesome newcomers from the most unfortunate of british classes the genteel lowest of the lowermiddle who fiercely upheld their distinction from the workmen they could read fridays daily mail had given a whole page to the surgery with an inspiring photograph of nancythe young and beautiful daughter of a new york millionaire sleeps rolled up to bandage and poultice the blemishes of the poor called throughout holloway the angel from america eliot had directed cut it out and send it to your father let him enjoy his philanthropy by proxy eliot greeted crippen with a started look the usual colourful tie was replaced by a black one a broad band of black crepe ringed the sleeve of his light grey overcoat his expression was of strained solemnity he removed his bowler i have bad news i thought you would care to know as you were acquainted and live so near belle is dead im so sorry eliot used his professional condoling voice when did it happen the wednesday before easter march im sorry too dr crippen said nancy when was the funeral oh belle didnt die here crippen came into the shop which reeked of the crowd that had packed its benches since seven in the morning she died in california she suddenly had to visit a sick relative she took a chill on the boat going across and never shook it off i was shocked at a letter from her relations saying she was very ill then i had one from belle herself telling me not to worry she wasnt so bad as people said i didnt know what to think my head was full of bees he complained pathetically next thing i had a cable saying poor belle was dangerously ill with double bronchopneumonia i had to consider going over right away but of course its more difficult for me to leave london overnight like she did he sighed i sat at home fearing every minute for another cable saying she was gone sure enough that came the following day nancy remembered baby its always a shock isnt it even when youve grown used to a dear one being gravely ill bronchial pneumonia is so more surely fatal than the croupous variety eliot said sympathetically the fever persists so long and there is nothing we can do except prescribe a jacketpoultice a steamkettle and spoonfuls of brandy everything turns on the skill of the nursing perhaps you would care to see her obituary notice which i inserted in era crippen took from his overcoat pocket a folded newspaper the size of the times eliot noticed he held some envelopes in an elastic band addressed in his cramped writing and edged with the thick black line of mourning crippen opened the paper called the actors bible its first two pages were filled with narrow columns of dignified advertisements by players all were mr or miss and gave their specialitysoubrette or juggler or trick cyclistoften followed by the telling words available or disengaged or at liberty inside was news of shows in the west end on the road in new york berlin paris even australia it reported meetings of the actors union the stage benevolent society and the showmans guild there was always a serious editorialthe issue which crippen unfolded doughtily defended the dryeyed flippancy of louis dubedats death in the doctors dilemma it had advertisements for dipilatory powder bronchial troches and rozelavalla wrinkle remover each week carried its list of deaths with ages and birthdays without the paid obituary announcements filled a separate halfcolumn crippens finger indicated elmoremarch in california usa miss belle elmore mrs hh crippen as sad a loss for the ladies music hall guild as for myself eliot said nothing he wanted his lunch im leaving hilldrop crescent when the quarters notice expires in junehow could i live in a house with so many strong memories of belle she seemed to express her character in the decorations the furniture miss le neve has meanwhile kindly arranged to leave her position at the office and come as my housekeeper why double your grief by enduring solitude ive just been for a nice little holiday to dieppe crippen revealed after what happened to belle i needed some change of air oh your anatomy book dr beckett it seems to have been mislaid in the fuss of belles departure im sure i know all the anatomy i need crippen was feeling inside his jacket i should like to make another donation the cheque from his wallet was drawn on the charing cross bank for ј thats most generous of you eliot said honestly he seldom had enough to keep the surgery open more than two or three weeks ahead he refused more from nancy than his other supportershe disliked feeling her fathers client and it was important politically to spread patronage and responsibility as widely as possible we have a tough job screwing money out of trade union officials clergymen and the brewers who contribute so much to what we treat crippen gave nancy his gentle smile i read the daily mail very touching i wish i had done something of this nature when a young man instead of going to munyons then perhaps people would remember me gratefully after my own death as im sure belle will be remembered good day the following friday morning a welldressed woman appeared in the surgery whom eliot did not at first recognize against the sunlit street we met at the crippens she introduced herself mrs martinetti she looked nervously round the waiting patients on the benches might i speak to you doctor in confidence eliot led her through the inner door nancy was on her daily round of bedridden patients he wondered if she was consulting him for some disease unfit for the ears of her husband i heard the sad news that mrs crippen had died he told her she has disappeared clara martinetti sat on the kitchen chair vast hat on head back straight gloved hands clasping the horn handle of her umbrella you know dr crippen well not particularly eliot sat at the deal table which was covered with papers medicine bottles and jamjars sealed by oiledsilk containing lumps of mouldy bread for his patients boils clara looked surprised he always made out so when i read about you in the mail i decided to come and see you because im terribly worried about belle she hesitated im wondering if the story of her death is true why shouldnt it be asked eliot in surprise to catch cold on a boat and die of catarrhal pneumonia six weeks later is tragic but perfectly reasonable the patient even has spells feeling much better as the temperature fallsexactly as mrs crippen wrote to her husband the disease may clear in one part of the lung you see only to break out afresh in another i have seen many cases and i can tell you that none recovered to eliots irritation she stayed unconvinced i heard of it yesterday fortnight i had this telegram it was sent from victoria station from her crocodile handbag came a buff form stuck with paper strips eliot read belle died yesterday at six oclock please telephone annie shall be away a week peter annie is mrs stratton one of our committee like mrs smythson and mrs davis and miss way were most concerned we called at albion house directly after easter last week to offer our condolences and ask where poor belle died dr crippen said in los angeles with his own relations we asked the address because we wanted to send a letter of sympathy and an everlasting wreath he said it wasnt necessary none of belles friends in america would ever have heard of the music hall ladies guild really eliot felt that crippens gravest offence anyway he gave us his son ottos address in los angelesyou knew the doctor was twice married eliot nodded the woman was stealing time from his patients he said his son was with belle when she died naturally i asked about the funeral would you believe what he said she wasnt buried she was cremated he was having the ashes sent over he said we could have a little ceremony then cremated its unnatural theyre very goahead in these matters in america her voice accelerated under the steam of her indignation i asked him what ship belle went by he said it was the french line something like la tourenne or la touvйe the doctor speaks french of course so i went down to the offices of the french atlantic shipping line in the city oh yes they had a liner sailing from new york to havre called la touraine but it hadnt arrived on february the second that was the day belle left and it went straight into drydock for repairs she ended triumphantly but dr crippen is always vague and must have been dreadfully agitated eliot told her impatiently he simply got the ships name wrong clara leant over the table that telegram was sent as dr crippen left for dieppe with his lady typist miss le neve eliot nearly laughed to save your embarrassment i know all about miss le neve i dont think you do dr beckett at our benevolent fund ball in februaryafter belle had left before there was the slightest suggestion that she was illthe doctor appeared with miss le neve she was wearing one of belles dresses magenta silk i recognized it beyond doubt she had belles fox fur belles muff belles earrings and belles brooch she was so fond of the one with the rising sun she wore it the evening you and the nice american lady came to dinner and belles gold watch a ring with four diamonds and a ruby belles i swear and a weddingband eliot rose any woman felt outraged at a friend who was ousted by another prettier and younger than them both he put his arm round her shoulders its easy to think terrible things when someone you love dies far away in the lawless wilds of california but we are men and women of the world mrs martinetti surely the theatrical profession well knows the temptation of a pretty girl to an older man to use his wifes ornaments to decorate her is appalling bad taste but nothing worse shes moved in with him she exclaimed accusingly a man must have a housekeeper after twenty years of married life you can hardly expect dr crippen to batch it surely werent mrs crippen and miss le neve perfectly friendly its only natural the doctor should turn to her for condolence eliot opened the consultingroom door why youll be suggesting the good little doctor murdered his wife no im not suggesting that he felt she made her reply unnecessarily thoughtfully a gossip a malicious gossip he pronounced to nancy that evening eliot sprawled on the sofa in camden road norfolk jacket off in his red socks reading the times the sunny day brought an evening cold enough for a fire they now had two rooms in the big housealways empty except for the visitor who arrived unexpectedly stayed secretly and left hurriedly what misery is occasioned by people who stir the mud in the murky little puddles of others lives he commented and what pleasure nancy was at the table writing an order for allen and hanburys the surgical suppliers across at bethnal green i have the utmost compassion for people with stunted bodies but not with small minds eliot observed into the pages of his newspaper belle was a nymphomaniac he revealed whats that morbid uncontrollable sexual desire in the female the deranged women furiously embrace every man they can get at its been a well recognized condition for over a century dr crippen had to dose her with hyoscine thats the usual drug its either a sedative or a straitjacket they get in awful trouble with the law otherwise he turned the page crippens was a happy release im not so sure ive seen a woman crazy with grief across the body of her husband killed in an east side knifefight yet everyone in the neighbourhood heard her screams night after night when he beat her up dr crippen is like a divalent atom with two combining powers he chose to link himself with a pair of elements as different as the violently explosive fluorine and the totally inert platignum whats miss le neve like i believe shes a very good typist three weeks later on the morning of wednesday april king edward vii arrived at dover from calais in the royal yacht alexandra he had journeyed by train across france from biarritz with his usual pause in paris biarritz saw the english king a week or two every spring he ate drank smoked cigars played baccarat strolled the promenade in the atlantic breezes which sprayed the sea along the rocky coast drove into the pyrenees in his mercedes the royal motorengineer mr stamper sitting next to the chauffeur poised to jump out for the breakdowns the machinery of state meanwhile clanked round the king mr asquith had kissed hands on appointment as prime minister in the hotel de palais the kings suggestion that a british cabinet meeting be held the following week at the hotel crillon in paris was thought placing the convenience of the monarch too noticeably above the proprieties of the constitution king edward returned among rumours of mr asquiths demand he create sufficient new liberal peers to swamp the house of lords and bring it to the prime ministers bidding a royal threat was enough the house of lords would fight for their right to throw out budgets but not at the price of being overwhelmed by a pack of upstart bounders he returned also to a buzz about his health the king went to the opera he saw lord kitchener and the pictures at the royal academy he went to the opera again he went to sandringham and to mrs keppels house in grosvenor street on thursday may he failed to welcome queen alexandra back from her mediterranean cruise and buckingham palace announced that he was suffering a severe cold the next morning the kings doctors declared that he gave rise to anxiety his horse witch of the air won the at kempton park they sent for the queen the queen with sublime understanding sent for mrs keppel at six oclock the doctors proclaimed his condition critical saturday mornings times appeared with thick black lines separating all its columns his people were shocked the reticence of the bulletins had drawn knots instead of crowds to the palace railings the king had worn the crown of scandal but earned the affection of his easygoing raceloving selfindulgent subjects as deservedly as his nickname tumtum he was crowned with france and russia his countrys implacable enemies he died leaving them enduring friends youll enjoy the royal funeral eliot told nancy that saturday evening we do those sort of things terrifically well eliot heard the doorbell there were hurried footsteps on the stairs the door flew open without a knock ruston appeared with wince who carried a brown attachй case both stopped staring at nancy she sat on a stool between the fireplace and eliot who stood unmoving hands in pockets resentful of the interruption were just going out to dine can i offer you fellows a b and s rustons gesture brushed aside brandy and soda i want to speak to you eliot in confidence miss granges discretion is as remarkable as her intelligence i must insist on seeing you alone ruston sounded angry he called every week his business trivialgenerally chiding eliot on not distributing the movements tracts among the doctors lawyers ministers of religion and similar professional men who might afford him confidence eliot objected that he was too busy patching the sick poor to ring middleclass doorbells he knew that ruston himself wrote the tracts and thought them intellectually powerfully persuasive nancy stood ive anyway to see frau ebert about our sunday dinner she said accommodatingly why must you keep company with that woman asked ruston peevishly as the door shut marat was married and even the incorruptable robespierre was not celibate women interfere wince laid the attachй on the table unlocking it with a key on a bunch from his trouser pocket and talk what we are to say musnt reach another ear eliot even in a whisper youll swear to that i can hardly give my sacred oath if we regard the bible as capitalist propaganda you cant have it both ways it makes no difference if you agree or not ruston told him impatiently the only way to keep a mans mouth shut is assuring him that his head will come off if he opens it you know we can do that dont you he asked menacingly remember what happened to thompson thompson was a young schoolmaster eliot had known in the movement before leaving for champette while eliot was in switzerland thompsons body had been found in hackney marshes with a bullet in the brain neither eliot nor seemingly ruston nor certainly scotland yard had a precise notion of the murderer or the motive but the reference was enough to make eliot uneasy id never tell my old woman so much as the time oday wince was spreading on the table the yardlong sheet of an ordnance survey map shed always look out someone to pass the news to well eliot nows a chance to show what youre made of rustons smile was more sarcastic than inspiring his imperial majesty kaiser william ii will soon be within our shores our fat kings funeral is may a fortnight today as his nephew the kaisers importance in the ceremony will be separated only by our new king george from that of the corpse wince nodded producing his curly pipe and tobaccopouch i dont think anyone knows at the moment when the kaiser will leave berlin not even the kaiser himself ruston continued hes due to attend a lecture next week by the outspoken mr theodore roosevelt at berlin university and he wont miss the chance of presenting himself as a man who can appreciate american politicians particularly one demanding britain to get out of egypt what were pretty sure about is our friends route the imperial yacht hohenzollen will berth here at sheerness on the northwest corner of the isle of sheppey eliot looked obediently at the map the oval island in the thames estuary some ten miles by five was separated from the north kent coast by a narrow reach of sea choked with sandbanks to the west lay the mouth of the river medway and rochester reminding eliot of charles dickens to the east the tiny port of whitstable reminding eliot of oysters we shall know when kaiser bill arrives with no more trouble than reading the newspapers ruston resumed enthusiastically well know the time his train leaves for london because therell be a reception committee in feathered hats at victoria thatll be announced in advance by the newspapers as well wince held a match over his pipebowl with one hand bin spyin out the land for just this chance the past three years sheppey itself we can ferget its a military area see barracks up there at garrison point he indicated with a stubby finger of his free hand railway runs straight sahth for three and a alf miles crosses the water at kings ferry bridge its all marshland flat as yer and theyll station a platoon up ere on barrows ill ter keep a sharp lookout on anyone moving abaht wince seemed to eliot an unlikely military man then he recalled some remark by ruston of wince in dusseldorf on a months training for active service perhaps winces shambling personality was a careful disguise eliot knew that he spoke fluent german and french and had a quicker head for figures than himself the branch line joins the main london chatham and dover tracks just ere another three miles further sahth its still flat an covered with orchardsas youd expect in kentso you cant see far then it runs west for five miles nearly all in cuttins ard against the old roman road ter london see that curved cuttin there ahtside a village called cold arbour puffing clouds of smoke wince tapped the map decisively thats where were going to do it do what asked eliot youre being deliberately obtuse said ruston irritably blow up the kaiser youre mad what do you mean eliot he demanded angrily are you with us or arent you youve known perfectly well thats our plan since january you chose to live here cheaply and in comfort and now youre asked to do something in return youre showing up as a coward im not a coward its just that im not interested in murdering people oh damn you ruston banged the table were going to change the history of the world and youre no more serious about it than a cricket match i dont see why you should pick me to do your dirty work let me explain our plan wince seemed unconcerned with the argument weve got a couple of blokes ooll be in the firinline railwaymen from the great northern members for ten years utterly reliable both been to dusseldorf and trained with explosives said ruston warmly there wont be nobody watchin the line most o the way stands to reason dont it theyd need arf the army an wots the point the kaisers a popular chap the kings cousin theyll send a tank engine ahead of the royal special so if anyones provided a rather generous detonator or removed a rail or two on the sly the driver and firemanll get it in the eye not is imperial majesty our men will set orf the charge as the train goes across then run for it they wont run far eliot said wince continued calmly therell be a carriage an pair with another of our blokes getting them to chatham along the main road in less than an hour in chatham weve an ahse they can lie low in as long as they like wherell you get the dynamite from eliot asked you cant buy it at the army and navy stores ruston smiled smugly its under your feet so far there seems nothing for me to do anyway eliot pointed out i dont care going along just for the excitement you are the hub of the operation eliot your orders are to take a room in the bull and mouth inn at sittingbourne for the week of the funeral sittingbourne is exactly where the two railway lines join our two railwaymen are heroes of the people but they are unschooled they can barely read and write we need an intelligent man to pass messages to free the snags to extemporize should anything go wrong a wellspoken fellow like you will create not a breath of suspicion you wont use your own name of course choose any you like ruston ended generously lenin suggested eliot you must take this seriously ruston repeated angrily i take extremely seriously the certainty that i shall be arrested and hanged as colonel of a regiment of two illiterates then you will be a martyr ruston assured him solemnly why not go instead wouldnt you like to be a martyr too to be frank i am too important to risk ive thought of another objection whats that my father will undoubtedly be sacked by the duke ruston glared he checked what he was about to say i interpret this foolish attitude as embarrassment at having to perform your duty when you had every intention of avoiding it we shall be back tomorrow wince began folding his map i have important things to accomplish tonight and i am becoming late for my dinner eliot was evasive about the visit until sitting in the corner of a narrow french restaurant in soho it was one of the few open the evening after the kings death the tables were crude the floor sawdusted the walls lined with scrolled mirrors the ceiling over the gasglobes thick with dead flies eliot said it served the best veal in london they wish to change my duties from pushing political tracts through clergymens letter boxes to blowing up the german emperor he announced nancy stared mouth agape oh god save us she muttered but its crazy i know the only effect of the plan will be the locking up of its perpetrators theres a lot about this movement youve never told me of isnt there she was more frightened than reproachful theres a lot i dont know myself you must have guessed the house is a stagingpost for comrades from the continent scotland yard certainly has our address but as were doing nothing illegal i dont give a tinkers cuss theres german money behind it which probably accounts for the kaisers privilege as the target communisms a german phenomenon marx and engels were rhinelanders remember over there its a voice demanding to govern here its just a voice to which the british workers are as deaf as to the streetcorner evangelists eliot reached for her hand across the zinctopped table with paper cloth i cant forgive myself for getting you mixed in this dearest i should have told you at the beginning but of course i was scared youd just fly off she was concerned only at his being mixed in it he said ruefully when i joined i suppose id have blown up the duke and my father with him now my ideas upon the british revolution are as gentlemanly as carlyles on the french one i still want a revolution but only in the abstract the fat proprietor in his tight alpaca coat presented the burgundy eliot sniffed sipped and nodded rustons probably as appalled at the scheme as i am but too frightened to admit it ive the idea that wince is the boss really everything is so devious in a revolutionary body i suspect for the fun of it we must leave the house at once nancy said firmly you must youre going home to new york by the next boat of course im not nancy my darlinglove is sweet but life is sweeter she looked scared you mean were in danger if theyre ruthless enough to kill the kaiser they certainly are to kill me the proprietor served their blanquette de veau a lancienne ruston tried to scare me about one of our comrades who was found shot eliot resumed though i doubt for ratting on the movement he was a young man afflicted with the same malady as oscar wilde he had strange business with important men who would have mourned him by cracking a bottle of champagne ill go to new york if you come too thatll solve everything i cant leave overnight like mrs crippen no more than dr crippen could ive patients depending on me they can go down the road to the royal free hospital they survived before your surgery was there theyd think poorly of me and i dont care to run away it would blow a hole in my political career why not stay in new york thered be no trouble fixing you a licence to practice he was silent for some time no he said do you suppose the whole plans a fantastic dream of those two men nancy suggested more cheerfully my father gets threats against his life every month nothing happens he just passes them along to pinkertons i shall emulate gilberts admirably sagatious duke of plazatoro in similar circumstances eliot decided i shall send my resignation in the first of all his corps o go to the police she suggested eagerly you know enough about ruston and wince enough to get them both hanged on the same morning but i can hardly denounce them without incriminating myself they decided the safest plan was an anonymous letter to scotland yard warning of an attempt upon the kaiser during his train journey to london eliot calculated it would line the railway with policemen to scare away the two unlettered assassins they must move house instantly nancy insisted eliot recalled crippens remark about leaving hilldrop crescent he suggested they bought the fagend of the lease nancy agreed scrubbed and stripped of its pink hangings the house was tolerable at least theres no dynamite in the cellar eliot told her preparing the anonymous letter on sunday morning was a fresh experience as alarming to eliot as preparing to blow up the royal train he tore a sheet from a cheap exercisebook wrote in pencilled capitals and took the metropolitan railway to post it in the city that afternoon he walked with nancy up camden road to hilldrop crescent a dark girl about sixteen in a brown dress and an apron opened the door the antipathy to servants had died with belle eliot gave their names the girl shrugged and called into the house madame ethel appeared smiling i read about you in the paper she said admiringly remembering nancy this is mademoiselle valentine the doctor and i brought her over from boulogne last week eliot brought a smile from the girl by addressing her in french oh i do wish i could speak like that ethel clasped her hands together valentine is living with us au pair as the french say on starvation wages as the english say eliot thought i hope shell improve my french conversation the doctor speaks the language perfectly of course hes out seeing mr marr at aural remedies ethel apologized even on a sunday would you believe it but mr marrs very useful to the doctor do come in she led them into the parlour with comfortable assurance as mistress of the house the room was still pink but the bows had gone from the pictureframes the photographs were cleared away it was full of clothesa fur coat overcoats in brown black and cream a feather boa jackets and skirts an armchair filled with laceedged silk blouses and coloured underskirts another with pink nightgowns stockings and stays eliot counted seven pairs of shoes lined across the carpet black blue blackandwhite and pink the card table was piled with hats a square wicker basket used by performers on the road stood empty its side stencilled in thick black letters belle elmore before the fireplace was a dark middleaged woman in a brandnew heliotrope costume made for someone shorter and fatter this is emily jackson ethels voice was fond she was my landlady at constantine road i was giving her some of poor belles clothes it seems such a shame just having them eaten by moths doesnt it nancy made a sympathetic remark about belle dying so far from home it was a great shock said ethel solemnly she looked quickly from eliot to nancy mrs jackson was more of a mother to me than a landlady she knows all about me and the doctor beforebefore the doctors one of the nicest men i ever met asserted mrs jackson warmly and now the poor king too has gone to his rest sighed ethel as this seemed to raise death from a personal to general subject eliot mentioned his interest in the house yes the doctor did give notice for sure ethel said but now were thinking of staying till september its so difficult finding somewhere nice and the doctors getting a bit more cheery now a few days in boulogne did him the world of good even though somebody stole his luggage going across would you believe it it was his leather hatbox one moment it was there the next it had vanished i told him to inform the french police but he said theyd never lift a finger to help an englishman if youre looking for a place why not ask the house agents we pay the rent to theyre lown amp sons ashbrook road at the bottom of highgate hill eliot thanked her they havent wasted much time dividing the spoils he remarked as they walked back to camden road do you suppose hell marry her oh yes hes dreadfully sentimental they left camden road two days later a moonlight flit with a couple of cabs one full of nancys luggage lown and sons had found them a furnished terraced house opposite the postmens office with the royal arms over the gate in the road running east from hilldrop crescent to kentish town railway station nancy immediately engaged two servant girls and a cook eliot knew ruston could find him any morning at the surgery but had grown a shell of indifference he did not somehow feel the sort who ended up on hackney marshes this ghastly plot has disillusioned me about anything done in the name of the people he confessed to nancy in their new livingroom with the greenstriped wallpaper and plants in brasspots who are the people the humans i treat every day in the surgery not very worldly not lettered full of prejudice and superstitions stupid but shrewd often noblea man will crack a joke rather than infect his family with his terror of coming death our democracy is the benevolent management of their organized misapprehensions thats all they need leadership for their own survival not the survival of their leaders but ruston talks about the people in the arrogant abstract and seeks an easy ride to political power on their backs ill always support the underdog but not one only ambitious to be the top dog at seven in the evening of wednesday may the hohenzollen anchored off sheerness she had been escorted from flushing by the cruiser kцnisberg and the despatchboat sleiper by four british destroyers from the shivering sands buoy the kaiser travelled with dr neider his personal physician count eulenburg his master of ceremonies general von plessen and viceadmiral von muller and baron von reischach his master of horse reading this rollcall in the times eliot wondered if all six would shortly be shot in fragments into the kentish air the newspaper mentioned to his discouragement that scotland yard had received a hundred anonymous warnings of assassination attempts against the kaiser which they took as malicious hoaxes on friday eliots paper told him the kaiser would leave sheerness at ten to be met at noon by king george at victoria station eliot walked down brecknock road for his usual mornings work at eleven he abandoned the struggle nancy had returned from her rounds he left her the patients found a cab in york road and directed the driver to victoria the crowd in the triangular station forecourt would reassure the kaiser that his popularity exceeded that of his countryif he arrived eliot thought the newspapers had laid cosy emphasis on the rulers of prussia and britain being cousins for the first time since george ii and frederickwilliam i eliot pushed his way towards the scarlettunicked guardsmen their officers with black crepe armbands drawn behind the cordon of policemen he nervously imagined the stir among the officials in gleaming top hats and morning coats beyond he already heard the whisper through the crowd which swelled into the horrified cry the kaiserkilled he saw himself tortured with remorse agonized with fear for nancy awaiting the knock on the door for policemen to bundle him into the black maria to join ruston and wince in the dock of the old bailey and with luck breaking stones on dartmoor for the rest of his natural life king george arrived in a landau with an escort of household cavalry he entered the station ten minutes later he reappeared with the kaiser in a black overcoat eliot cheered so loudly that people started looking at him the funeral was the spectacle eliot had promised nancy the silent crowds were so thick in st jamess that fainting ladies were succoured on the pavement by vinegarsoaked sponges suspended from the balconies of whites club ladies not being allowed inside in any condition the kaiser rode on king georges right immediately after the guncarriage behind the monarchs of europe and mr theodore roosevelt king edwards favourite terrier caesar was led by a gillie in highland dress a white scottie interloper joining them in piccadilly all the way to paddington station where the coffin was slid into the whitedomed mortuary saloon of the royal train last used for queen victoria on no platform for windsor the kaiser left after the weekend his farewell lunch at buckingham palace continued with earnest talk to his host in victoria station waitingroom though twice informed his train was ready to leave next mornings times reported his arrival at port victoria a few naval buildings and a coastguard station the rail terminal against a jetty over the river medway he changed aboard the hohenzollen into admirals uniform to receive officers of the royal navy and at on the morning of tuesday may he left british shores the kaiser never saw them again at item at the bottom of the account caught eliots eye railwaymen imprisoned george horace clem aged and henry teacher both of holloway london labourers employed by the great northern railway were each sentenced to months detention by the chatham magistrates on saturday for drunken and disorderly conduct they were arrested outside a chatham publichouse on the night of friday where they were shouting abuse about the german emperor the chairman said their conduct was despicable towards a personage of such importance eliot rubbed his chin it looked as if the assassination scheme had been hatched to produce only a dead chick on his way to the surgery he stopped at a small shop in brecknock road which combined a subscription library with selling stationery newspapers sweets and books he bought a school atlas opening it in the shop port victoria he murmured i wonder the mouth of the river medway was a mile across the railway from sheerness which wince had indicated on his ordnance survey map ran across the isle of sheppey on its east the separate railway from port victoria traversed the isle of grain on its west joining a different main line far away at gravesend on the south bank of the thames both the railway terminals of sheerness and of port victoria were the same distance by admirals launch for a yacht anchored in midriver wince had chosen one terminal but the kaiser another eliot laughed aloud startling the halfdozen customers saved by the london chatham and dover railway he announced mystifyingly he tucked the atlas under his arm and strode jubilantly along the pavement so much for the military genius of the british revolutionary movement he thought it could draw a blueprint of utopia but could not even start a fight in a publichouse that it would fail disastrously once it stopped talking and started acting he had always suspected perhaps that was the reassurance which drew him to it im resigning as socialist parliamentary candidate he told nancy that night i can do far more good in medicine than a dozen mps in parliament personally i suspect the duke has done more for british workers than marx and engels and rosa luxembourg combined and your father for american ones why he can create a thousand jobs with halfanhours cleverness on wall street amazing nancy kissed him arent you surprised at me he asked no only at how long youve taken they threw the dynamite into the river ruston told eliot with his sarcastic smile i had the strongest suspicion it was useless anyway that was seven years later when they happened to meet as ruston halted his company at a crossroads beyond poperinge the day before he was killed in the third battle of ypres on the friday morning of july a girl wearing a black dress pushed into the surgery eliot vaguely recognised her the free medicine shop was crammed as usual the warmth of patients praise lit hopes in others who came far across london on foot if they could not afford the tram eliot found himself playing christ at the pool of bethesda he cured where he could and comforted where he could not he felt that his miraculous aura reflected poorly on the abilities of the rest of the profession vous vous rappelez docteur mademoiselle valentine lecoq ah oui vous кtes chez crippen the au pair had called with an envelope it contained a letter of four pages which eliot opened in the consulting room hilldrop crescent holloway july dear dr beckett i am sorry i was not at home when you called two months ago because i always enjoy conversation with you who are such a credit to our profession i should like to see you very much at this moment because of some troublesome affairs of a personal nature on which i would welcome your advice my position has been made very difficult by mrs martinetti and miss may and the other members of belles old committee they always question me closely about belle whenever we meet and of course i cannot cut old friends easily particularly when their office is so near mine at albion house things came to a head last month when my son otto in california replied to miss mays letter enquiring about belles last hours etc in his home at los angeles where i had informed her that she died otto replied that he had heard of his stepmothers death only through me and that it occurred in san francisco this caused mrs martinetti and miss may to crossquestion me about the place of belles death and i explained that she died in fact in a little town near san francisco with a spanish name which slipped my memory when they pressed me about the crematorium in which she was disposed i said something about there being four crematoria in san francisco and that i had the ashes in my safe at albion house with the death certificate so far as i know belle did not die but is still alive great god exclaimed eliot so loudly the patients outside the door looked up he continued reading after our little dinner on january my wife abused me for not taking mr martinetti up to the lavatory she said this is the finish of it i wont stand it any longer i shall leave you tomorrow and you will never hear of me again she frequently threatened to go right out of my life to the man better able to support her than i was i took this to be bruce miller in chicago on this occasion belle did say one thing which she had never said before viz that i was to arrange to cover up any scandal with our mutual friends and the guild the best way i could when i went home between five and six p m that day i found she had gone i sat down to think it over i wrote a letter to the guild saying she had gone away which i also told several people i afterwards realized that this would not be sufficient explanation of her not coming back i told people she was ill with pneumonia and afterwards i told them that she was dead from this ailment i only put the advertisement in era as i thought this would prevent people asking a lot of questions the music hall guild ladies seemed upset that i took miss le neve to the benevolent fund ball with my wifes brooch and furs belle had so many clothes i do not know what she took away as for the jewellery i had bought it all whenever belle threatened to leave me she told me she wanted to take nothing from me you know how i have looked upon ethel as my wife these past three and a half years now she can take her rightful position in my home but belles old friends do not care for this they are treating me with such suspicion i am most uncomfortable i am managing to conceal their unpleasantness from ethel who thinks like the rest of the world that belle is dead as you can understand my head is full of bees i do not know where to turn i shall of course do all i can to get in touch with belle so as to clear this matter up i shall insert an advert in the chicago papers offering twentyfive dollars reward for information of her whereabouts i want nothing more than to discuss the whole unfortunate matter with a clearheaded professional man none better than yourself i am writing this before businessethel is not up will you take luncheon with me today in the holborn restaurant i shall be in the foyer at one oclock sharp i shall be very pleased and graceful to find you there yours sincerely hawley harvey crippen eliots response was a laugh poor little man crippen had covered his shameful abandonment and adultery with an elaborate piecrust of gentility which crumbled to the prod he wondered about the recipients of the blackedged envelopes anyone would anger at tears spilt over a corpse still enjoying life in chicago and liable to resurrection with a postcard he left nancy to finish the surgery found a passing hansom outside in brecknock road and arrived at the restaurant early the elaboratelydecorated foyer was busy as a railwaystation with dark suited men and a few ladies staring curiously at eliots norfolk jacket and loose tie he pulled out his watch dr crippen was quarter of an hour late eliot looked up to find his host approaching through the plateglass doors on one side was a burly beeffaced man in his midforties with a heavy moustache wearing a bowler hat and a blue serge suit on the other a younger thinner pale one in a dark tweed suit with a cap crippen smiled to them this is the friend i was expectingdr beckett of holloway may i introduce mr walter dew the older man shook hands didnt i read about you in the papers sir and mr mitchell crippen continued politely both are from scotland yard eliot looked startled crippen continued in his affable way they called this morning at hilldrop crescent and miss le neve brought them along to albion house we are all three trying to clear up the mystery of my wifes leaving home it takes a deal of time as everything must be written down and read over and signedisnt that the case mr dew but we still need our lunch before we go on perhaps we should eat alone if youd excuse me he apologized to eliot that would be best dr crippen dew agreed ill be glad when the whole business is cleared up for good and all thats why im so pleased that scotland yard is taking a hand in it crippen ended admiringly i smell a rat remarked nancy that evening she was reading crippens letter why hes living with his typist exactly as im living with you it shows a refreshing disrespect for middleclass convention the police wouldnt be interviewing him if they didnt smell one too the police dont take suspected criminals out to lunch dont they in london theyre so awfully polite when a man is last seen in the company of detectives his future movements grow in interest on the saturday afternoon eliot strolled to hilldrop crescent with a notion of the tкteаtкte denied them at the holborn restaurant valentine opened the door in her brown dress without the apron she seemed distressed the doctor and madam had gone out she explained in french leaving her a letter to deliver the envelope she took from her skirt pocket eliot saw was addressed to wm long esq the yale tooth specialists albion house london w with by hand urgent underscored on the top valentine deplored she knew nothing of london having ventured barely past regents park eliot felt the envelope it contained a door key he was curious he comforted the girl that he would take it by cab himself long was the only one in the office im worried about dr crippen he said at once he was here when i arrived at ninemost unusual for him when i asked what was up he said only a little scandal we had police officers here yesterday he started opening the envelope but only to find if mrs crippen had any estate to pay taxes on who told you that eliot asked sharply long looked surprised why the doctor then this morning he sent me out with a list of clothes to buy his voice grew puzzled a brown tweed suit a brown felt hat a couple of shirts and collars tie and boots and braces all boys size i put them in the back room no when i came back from my lunch theyd gone instead there was the hat which miss le neve was wearing i havent seen either of them since he gave a whistle reading the letter looks like the doctors done a bunk eliot took the closely written page of yale tooth specialists paper dear mr long will you do me the very great favour of winding up as best you can my household affairs there is јs due to my landlord for the past quarters rent and there will also be this quarters rent a total due to him of ј in lieu of which he can seize the contents of the house i cannot manage about the girl she will have to get back to france but should have sufficient saved to do this after the girl leaves kindly send the key with a note explaining to the landlord co messrs lown and sons thanking you in anticipation of fulfilling my wishes i am with best wishes for your future success and happiness yours faithfully h h crippen theres another addressed to dr rylance long continued looking startled do you suppose its all right to read it eliot glanced at the second letter which started i now find that in order to escape trouble i shall be obliged to absent myself for a time the other dozen lines were on business and ended with crippens kind wishes for his continuing success whats the game asked long nervously mrs crippen is not dead cor she ran off to a lover in america dr crippen put about the story of her death to save scandal but it stirred up more scandal than ever long stood openmouthed trying to steady himself in the social earthquake wheres he gone perhaps to america too he could make a fresh start but why the boys clothes miss le neves obviously gone with him it may not be thought entirely proper for a doctor to travel with a lady not his wife longs face brightened come to think of it miss le neve was a bit of a tomboy there were times shed put on one of the doctors suits and go out in the street for a lark on sunday eliot had promised nancy an excursion to canterbury monday july was bright and hot promising a scorcher to londoners tramping in their bowlers and boaters to work concerned about valentine eliot rang the bell at hilldrop crescent on his way to the surgery the girl received him conspiratorially voilа docteur he stared through the back window there were the two scotland yard men from the holborn restaurant both had their jackets off and were digging the garden on thursday the north london cellar murder was created the newspapers proclaimed that human remains had been found at no hilldrop crescent below loose bricks under the coal mysterious purchase of subtle drug before tragedy read the headline of the daily chronicle facing its editor with contempt of court by saturday every london police station bore a poster headed murder and mutilation followed by descriptions photographs handwriting specimens of crippen and ethel for whom was offered ј reward each so much for your innocent little doctor said nancy over the breakfast table but he is im sure of it eliot insisted he was giving his wife hyoscine to dampen her sexual demands he told me as much he was so appallingly ignorant he probably gave her a lethal dose by mistake then why did he cut his patient up and bury her in the cellar hed still face a manslaughter charge over the hyoscine which would have kept him away from the tender ethel a good few years if not for the rest of his natural life think of the scandal hes as sensitive towards that as mrs keppel and maybe he had some dark primitive idea that belle should silently vanish from the face of the earth as she so often threatened it seems a rather drastic way of achieving it perhaps he enjoyed it theres no knowing what strange bats flit in the dark corners of the human belfry perhaps he just panicked it makes human beings do the most wildly illogical things you know more die in fires from trying to get through the exit all at once than roast to death so if hed rushed out of the house and confessed to the first policeman in sight everyone would be saying this morning poor man how tragic to have slain his own dear wife in error rather than calling him the biggest monster since jack the ripper youre perfectly right and cutting her up wouldnt signify much to him anyway you mentioned once at champette how a doctor sees the body as a watchmaker a watch he was simply taking a timepiece to bits youre just making excuses because you liked him nancy objected but look how perfectly the scheme worked eliot persevered if he hadnt decamped with ethel belle would have lain in rest until they demolished the house if the police hadnt believed his story theyd have arrested him over the cheese and biscuits at the holborn restaurant supposing we had moved into the house eliot nancy shuddered supposing wed found the body oh wed have invited the martinettiscome to dinner we think we can dig up belle elmore nancy sighed you never take anything outrageous seriously thank god even blowing up the kaiser crippen was everywhere at vernetlesbains in the eastern pyrenees with a youth at llangranog in west wales with a young lady at stonebridge in sussex he was arrested seeking lodgings with his companion at willesden in london he needed rescuing from a fierce crowd by the police a young female found drowned at bourges in central france and many others elsewhere in europe were weightily announced by the police forces as not being miss le neve the battersea flat crime the slough murder the train murder were outshone in the newspapers the times gave crippen four columns and invariably called him dr in inverted commas which infuriated eliot the william atherstone who comforted belle after her disaster at the metropolitan shot himself in battersea the coroner relished the coincidence and the next day dropped dead himself in the north atlantic shortly after midday on friday july captain henry kendall of the ton canadian pacific lines montrose sent his whitejacketed tiger to present his compliments to dr stewart and invite him for a peg before lunch a ships captains life is as lonely as diogenes he intrudes among his officers like a headmaster amid his boys the passengers who are not wearisome provoke jealousy among the others from invitations to his cabin engineers prefer their own company and he can no more sit with his purser than a lord with his butler his only irreproachable companion is the ships doctor trusted confidant of everyone on board the captains quarters in the montrose shone with teak brass and leather in the style of supreme marine comfort the ship was ten years old steerage passengers segregated by sex with bunks in her converted hold twenty saloon class with cabins and meals at the officers tables she had sailed two days before from antwerp for quebec mr john robinson and master robinson captain kendall swivelled in his leather chair he was middleaged squarejawed with a long mouth and protuberant ears have you noticed anything about them the son is a wee bit overweight observed the doctor over his whisky i saw a couple of safetypins holding his trousers together at the back hes going to california for his health i havent been invited to inspect his chest i should think not exclaimed the captain they booked through our brussels agents just before sailing their luggage consists of a handbag bought in belgium their clothes the brown suits and canvas shoes they stand up in i examined their hats while they were at lunch yesterday he continued significantly the rim of the boys is packed with paper the doctor thought it odd that the captain should go about spying on passengers hats my suspicions were aroused before we left the scheldt i saw the boy squeezing the fathers hand immoderately upon the boat deck unnatural for two males unnatural but not unknown the captain leaned towards the doctor who sat on a leather bench against the bulkhead when i spoke to robinson just now he said theyd laughed all night over the comic ditty at the smokingconcert we all walked into the shop smiling the doctor recollected in song one night while out with several pals twos raining hard outside we saw a card in a milkshop window families supplied hows the chorus go we ordered a couple of kids apiece then we all walked out againwe all walked into the butchers where the meat was hung on pegs the fat old butcher kept shouting out ive got some lovely legs i told robinson a funny story the captain interrupted to make him laugh he explained the doctor looked lost to see if he had false teeth and he had said the captain triumphantly he has no moustache but is growing a beard it makes him look more like a farmer every day his nose has marks yet he wears so spectacles well doctor what do you make of that i cant make anything of it sir i make of it that master robinson is a girl the captain folded his arms the doctor said nothing like many captains his was a spasmodic eccentric a girl captain kendall repeated delighted with the mystification insatiable with detective stories he revelled in playing the detective as a junior officer he was scourge of the ships cardsharpers havent you seen the boys hands soft and white nails carefully manicured and how refined and modest he is how under his fathers thumb and his endearing smile well i noticed the father cracks nuts for him this morning i called mr robinson on deck he paid no heed till the boy had the presence of mind to make him turn captain kendall tapped the pile of crumpled newspapers dr stewart had observed on his desk why do you suppose i had the chief officer collect every english and belgian newspaper on board they must not suspect their deeds are discoveredthey might do something rash they must not suspect what i suspect that the robinsons are dr crippen and miss le neve good god exclaimed the doctor shall you put them in irons on the other hand they may not be the captain admitted lamely which could land me in all sorts of trouble with head office so i prepared this for the marconi operator the doctor read the pencilled form from the captains desk drawer piers liverpool have strong suspicions that crippen london cellar murderer and accomplice are among saloon passengers moustache taken off growing beard accomplice dressed as boy voice manner and build undoubtedly a girl both travelling mr and master robinson kendall this very morning captain kendall continued impressively robinsoncrippensat looking aloft at the wireless aerial with the crackling electric spark of the messages and said what a wonderful invention it is but time is running short our wireless has a range of miles we are already miles west of the lizard should i send it undoubtedly urged the doctor now you mention it i have noticed how the girls under his hypnotic influence how she follows him everywhere though from her lack of distress she must surely be utterly ignorant of the horrible crime committed do you know what hes reading the captain grinned a shocker by edgar wallace the four just men its about blowing up parliament the villains have ј on their headstwohundred and fifty apiece the same as our friends the robinsons another peg thank you sir only a chota peg it was seafarers hindustani for a small drink the morse of captain kendalls message was received at that friday afternoon by crookhaven wireless station on the coast of county cork which passed it to the canadian pacific office in liverpool which passed it to scotland yard which dispatched chiefinspector dew the next morning by the white star laurentic from liverpool as mr dewhurst on operation handcuffs unbeknown even to his wife the life of a secret with a fortune in its pocket is short among the brigands of fleet street monday mornings papers announced that dew had left he was aboard the allen lines sardinia to new york from le havre crippen had fled disguised as a cleric with an effeminate son by tuesday the liverpool courier laid hands on kendalls message crippen was trapped by wireless the montrose carried the marvellous instrument which a member of parliament had tried a fortnight earlier to make compulsory on all ships but was defeated on the argument of expense crippen was under restraint miss le neve had confessed no he was not and she had not the only sure news was their sailing westwards unaware of dew overhauling them in a liner three knots faster it caught public imagination like a race to the moon the front pages had atlantic maps the two ships positions marked daily the world first learned of father point near the new brunswick port of rimouski dr crippen will arrive home in ample time for the adjourned inquest on august observed the times cosily crippens life at sea described by wireless said a special edition of the weekly dispatch above photographs of crippen with his round glasses and moustache belle elmore inspector dew captain kendall in oakleaved cap ethel looking soulful and even charlotte the first mrs crippen shorthaired and puddingfaced who had died in fits at salt lake city mr eddie marr backer of aural remedies appeared at its kingsway office and scraped crippens name from the glass front door the world held its breaththe laurentic was slowed by fog in the mouth of the st lawrence perhaps the pursuit of dr crippen might reach the ears of the only couple in civilization still ignorant about it perhaps they would jump over the side and ruin the fun the laurentic reached quebec on friday night inspector dew was cheered from the dockside at on sunday morning in a white hat and blue suit disguised as a pilot a lifeboat rowed by sailors took him to the newlyanchored montrose off father point quarantine station the two men met on the boat deck abaft the funnel good morning dr crippen ethel was in her cabin reading georgie sheldons audreys recompense she was arrested screamed and fainted in dews arms murder and mutilationoh god said crippen he was searched he had dollars and two diamond rings sewn into his undervest he carried visitingcards printed e robinson amp co detroit mich presented by mr john robinson one had written on the back i cant stand the horror i go through every night any longer and as i see nothing bright ahead and money had come to an end i have made up my mind to jump overboard tonight i know i have spoiled your life but i hope one day you can learn to forgive me with last words of love your h ethel had a sachet of white powder doubtless poison reported the times though it was a headache cure the stewardess lent her a blouse skirt and petticoat the montrose blew her whistle the press poured aboard from their pilot boat overrunning the ship interviewing every passenger even if few spoke english ten days later some reporters were struck by measles which was rampant in the steerage how can the man possibly have a fair trial after this cinematograph chase eliot demanded furiously it was completely unnecessary captain kendall could have got him arrested in quebec the canadian police are surely equipped with handcuffs and an extradition treaty it was the monday morning of august all the newspapers printed a photograph of the galeswept dockside at liverpool crippens plea against extradition from quebec as an american citizen had been brushed aside the canadians excitedly discovered that he had lived fourteen years before in toronto with a plump fashionable woman presumably now recovered from the hilldrop crescent cellar floor in prison ethel had a dressmaker to provide a costume from the found on her crippen so disgusted the other prisoners he had to exercise alone the bishop of london sent him a book but he never read it inspector dew took a holiday at niagara on the suddenly lowered baggage gangway of the megantic at liverpool bowlerhatted raincoated dew clutched the handcuffed crippen wearing his captors ulster collar up to hide his face from the booing crowd as strachey was writing of general gordon dew had left england already famous and would soon be glorious the liverpool police saw no point in shading from his radiance their chief took a tender to the mersey bar and his officers swarmed aboard in port like bumboat women at suez the homecomers had been reinforced by crippens other luncheon guest at the holborn restaurant sergeant mitchell dispatched in the lake manitoba with wardresses foster and martin from holloway jail dew sailed home as silas p doyle crippen as cyrus field ethel as j byrne mitchell as m f g johnston but the wardresses remained themselves ethel used the passenger gangway on the to london the pair had separate compartments with blinds drawn in the reserved coach next to the engine first class at oclock inspector kane was waiting to welcome them at euston groaning and hissing straining against the wooden barriers the crowd glimpsed three motorcabs taking them to bow street police station the most exciting episode in the history of police work they call it eliot tossed the paper with the liverpool photograph disgustedly across the breakfast table instead of two lives splintered on the anvil of public ghoulishness for a month he had complained angrily about the crowds with their cameras in hilldrop crescent the organs they dug up might be anyones nancy sighed eliot dear a suspicious mind is unattractive but even the archangel gabriel would purse his lips over that cellar i know more about those famous remains than people on the newspapers who can have no possible idea what they really look like or smell like remember i went to the society of medicine on saturday nancy nodded i met one of the pathologists whos working on them at st marys bernard spilsbury thought a pretty sharp fellow about my own age i knew him at st bartholomews do you know theres no head no bones and they were buried in slaked lime which does nothing to encourage decomposition a doctor like crippen would have known that quicklime was a different chemical you always said what a rotten doctor he was there werent even any sex organs the body may not be a womans at all belle could still be alive and laughing the publicity would put her top of the bill for life miss le neve wouldnt do badly either i saw she was offered a week to appear in vaudeville in new york shed do better in london this country has an unhealthy preoccupation with transvestism look at vesta tilleymade a fortune on the musichalls dressing as a man and singing burlington bertie look at pantomime as much as english institution as christmas and the principal boys always a girl in tights but ethel will end up on the scaffold not the stage he ended gloomily perhaps shell strike a bargain get her charge reduced from murder by telling the police all she knows turn kings evidence slip the noose round her lovers neck with her own hands women dont do that sort of thing eliot stared speculatively through the lace curtains of their downstairs diningroom he ejected crippen from his mind can you be back at the surgery by midday nancy im lunching with my father remember are you going to tell him about us if you like he said casually what about us whatever you like hell be dreadfully shocked were not married less than your father would in ducal circles fornication is thought an occupation as healthily natural as hunting only the middle class disapprove i suppose because of their everlasting suspicion of paying full price for slightly shopsoiled goods major beckett was waiting on the broad marble chessboard of the imperial clubs hall floor eliot found his hand seized with startling enthusiasm the major usually greeted his son far more casually than his friends you know him youve met him the major exclaimed by jove living just round the corner from hilldrop crescent whats he like a fisheyed monster as the servants say a smoothtongued bluebeard he stopped two clubmen may i introduce my son dr eliot beckett he is a neighbour of the crippens on intimate terms with belle elmore and ethel le neve the pair instantly afforded eliot an interest never given the son of a dukes man of business its so shockingly unfair eliot repeated as they sat down to lunch crippen and miss le neve have only this morning been faced with and had the right to reply to the charges which have already entered our folklore yes i saw they were due in the police court said the major absently ordering the clubs famous horsdoeuvre which included relishes from india china malay and borneo at quartertoeleven ethel and crippen had shared the wellshone wooden bench within the unassuming black castiron railings of the bow street dock he appeared from the cells below first politely standing aside for her whispering something he was in frock coat with wide lapels of grey silk a high starched collar and striped shirt with a bright print tie she wore a navy coat and skirt and a large blue hat with a motoring veil which she raised to face sir albert de rutzen the magistrate she kept twisting her black gloves crippen was charged with murder ethel with being an accessory after the fact the booing crowd still filled the street outside a man from madame tussauds waxworks took their photograph with a camera hidden in his bowler in court was sir william gilbert librettist of trial by jury meanwhile the inquest on belle elmore stands adjourned in the holloway central library eliot continued with pc gooch lugubriously telling coroner shroeder of five hours hard digging in the cellar as though it was his potato bed the inquest will certainly return a verdict of wilful murder against crippen thats enough to commit him for trial at the old bailey if the bow street magistrate hasnt obliged already for a man to be effectively twice on trial for his life in the same london postal district simultaneously is something overlooked in magna carta come eliot his father said impatiently its all open and shut as if inspector dew had burst upon the wretch with the bloodstained chopper in his hand may i disagree sir why some tramp may have intruded into the house while crippen was out at work cutting up a mans wife is a procedure demanding more forethought than stealing his gold watch i cannot believe that one as mild agreeable and loving as crippen could live six months with ethel le neve while the wife he had killedor about half of herwas a foot under his boots every time he went to replenish the kitchen fire eliot said firmly and i think i know as much of the human mind as anyone crippens only peculiarity was a taste for younger womenbelle years his junior ethel thats a failing he shares with a few men in this room i daresay im sorry for crippen im determined to help him as best i can youll make yourself dreadfully unpopular among whom not the people who matter to me the working men the labourers the poor listen to some advice which has stuck in my mind remember never to make yourself the busybody of the lower classes for they are cowardly selfish and ungrateful the least trifle will intimidate them and him whom they have exalted one moment as their demagogue the next they will not scruple to exalt upon the gallows eliot smiled who said that its shrewd enough for either charles i or cromwell a sailor called parker just before he was hanged after the nore mutiny of as innocence is useless without a good lawyer eliot resumed im trying to get marshall hall for crippen i expect hell take the brief cheap the advertisements worth a thousand times as much no get f e smith whos he the cleverest man in the kingdom his father told him eliot shrugged did you see about me in the daily mail i do not read the yellow press it gave me quite a reputation as a medical missionary where ones most needed here in london how much longer are you going to throw your talents at the poor youre like some nouveau riche speculator courting popularity by tossing shillings to his tenants his father reprimanded him he continued more pleadingly settle down make yourself a proper living the duke will still help you im sure of that his concern for myself has increased as the father of a son with such peculiarities as a matter of fact sir i am thinking of chucking the free surgery eliot confessed the trade unions have stopped supporting me i suppose they feel their money is buying glory for myself rather than their officials so has the church it finds that relieving humanity of its pains in the next world is less expensive than in this one perhaps ill go back to switzerland and open my own sanatorium though thats like running a luxurious hotel in which closest attention to the welfare of your guests cannot prevent your regularly losing a good many customers for ever that would be the end of your political ambitions his father sounded hopeful i did badly in the last election i might do worse in the next what if i became a labour mp id have to be as respectable as a family solicitor look at our dashing brilliant victor grayson in the house of commons at my own age too independent a spirit for the burntout firebrands running the labour party hes taken to the bottle in frustration im chucking politics into the bargain medicine is far too important a human activity to be complicated by idealism this club claret is excellent sir his father asked slyly may i suppose there is a woman behind this welcome change of heart yes im living out of wedlock with an american lady well its among a young mans amusements faire la bкte а deux dos is she respectable entirely no money i suppose oh yes about five million dollars the colonel dropped his knife and fork good god eliot and i was beginning to think you a bit of a fool hows mother she has discovered a new sort of climbing rose so he filleted her suggested eliot dr bernard spilsbury nodded he was tall straightbacked handsome his thick dark hair brilliantined a red carnation in the lapel of his grey suit eliot thought him solemn aloof and selfopinionated he thought eliot cynical and flippant both were young doctors of exceptional intelligence with energy as limitless as their ambition if the remains are belle elmores eliot said oh im sure of that spilsbury was always precise brief and confident eliot had a lingering feeling that he treated his acquaintances as interesting subjects on which he was performing the postmortem it was midseptember the trial at the old bailey was fixed for the eighteenth of the following month spilsbury unlocked a cupboard on the wall of his small laboratory at st marys hospital near paddington station it contained five large glass jars covered like homemade pickles by glazed white paper tied with tape spilsburys finger indicated the blueedged labels which might have read onions or tomato chutney thats the stomach with one kidney and the heartfatty obviously of a plump personand part of the liver the next contains a pair of female woollen combinations found under the cellar floor with a female undervest the next small gut more liver and some hair the last more gut some muscle and two lungs when you savoured the crippens hospitality you may have observed this garment airing on a clotheshorse spilsbury untied the cover of the last bottle removing with forceps a long strip of green and white flannel the most damning specimen of the case a piece of pyjamas found with the organs note the curious arrangement of green lines exactly like those we know mrs crippen bought from the admirable jones brothers of holloway on january for seventeenandninepence cash on delivery by the firms cart his forceps reached for a metal clip with a sixinch tuft a hindes curler as used by mrs crippen eliot nodded i recognize the hair luckily hair is one of the last anatomical structures to decompose he dropped it back if you remain unconvinced beckett i can show you a strip of lower abdominal skin with a longitudinal midline scar from umbilicus to pubis the ovarotomy operation mrs crippen underwent at new york in doubtless the defence will try passing it off as a fold in the skin but its a scar right enough pure fibrous tissue without the sebaceous glands one would find in skin i have examined it under the microscope which i shall bring with me to the old bailey and invite the jury to see for themselves isnt that rather coup de thйвtre murmured eliot feeling that the pathologist fitted the crime not at all i am responsible for my own opinion which has been formed on my own scientific knowledge i can demonstrate to the jury exactly how i formed it he retied the jar eliot supposed that spilsburys professional attention to crippen would make his reputation like bernard dawsons to king edward vii in his own inevitably final days you believe that the hyoscine which killed belle elmore was administered inadvertently spilsbury locked the cupboard with good reason crippen confided in me that he was giving her hyoscine in homoeopathic doses to dampen her sexual demands the half grain i found in the body was hardly a homoeopathic dose spilsbury said mockingly it would slay a prizefighter crippen was lying to you as to everyone else you know they slept in separate rooms so do our kings and queens but we never lack heirs to the throne i dont think you can compare the arrangements in buckingham palace with those in hilldrop crescent well if you feel strongly hes innocent youd better pass your notions on to tobin eliot nodded a a tobin was the kings counsel briefed to defend crippen a barrister on the northern circuit whose oratory customarily mingled with the sea fogs of newcastle i wanted to interest marshall hall but hes abroad on holiday anyway i couldnt get further than crippens solicitor is arthur newton good i heard he organized the defence of oscar wilde he seems to specialize in that sort of thing he defended lord arthur somerset over the male brothel in cleveland street and got six weeks himself for spiriting away the three telegraph boys involved i hear hes up to his ears in racing debts and i suppose wants to boost his reputation horatio bottomleyyou know he edits the despicable john bullis putting up the cash for crippens defence as an advertising stunt of course whos on the other side richard muir will be leading for the crown a redfaced scot with the forensic subtlety of a whirring claymore the judge is lord alverstone whos he spilsbury looked shocked the lord chief justice murderers are remembered their judges never spilsbury was moving towards the laboratory door perhaps youre right beckett and crippen never did mean to kill his wife with hyoscine eliot looked surprised at the admission he intended to shoot her dew found a revolver and rounds of ammunition in the breakfast room next to the cellar but perhaps crippen was concerned over the noise disturbing the neighbours everyone says he was such a considerate man hasnt it occurred to you that she could have swallowed the hyoscine entirely by accident eliot was becoming irritated with spilsburys sarcasm the henbane plant which contains hyoscine is sometimes eaten in mistake for parsnips he replied authoritively which in january are not in season eliot wrote three times to mr a a tobin kc at his chambers in the middle temple he had no reply he supposed despondently that every post brought a hundred letters of lunatic notions for freeing his client the week before the trial he marched in himself but the barristers clerks peevishness withstood even eliots determination he strode back to the strand disappointed and angry though reflecting that a mans lawyers like his surgeons required to operate without assistance from interested passersby crippen was to stand trial alone eliot attended the fourth day in court no at the old bailey it was friday october and spilsbury had usefully provided a ticket he watched the show in the company of two theatrical knightstree the tragidian and hare the comedianand miss phyllis dare the belle of mayfair who was gallantly invited by his lordship the judge to sit beside him on the bench the court had oak panelling and atrocious acoustics below the royal arms and sword of justice sat also the lord mayor of london the lord mayorelect of london the recorder of london two london aldermen the sheriff of london and his undersheriffs mrs martinetti was in a row below with other flashily feathered vultures from the music hall ladies guild eliot felt a shock at seeing crippen suddenly appear five yards away in the witnessbox beside the jury he looked more cheerful than six months previously when dressed in mourning for his wife eliot decided against some small encouraging gesture towards the prisoner lest lord alverstone ordered his own removal instantly to the cells wigged and gowned redfaced and squarejawed eyebrows like iron filings mr muir was crossexamining on the early morning of february you were left alone in your house with your wife yes she was alive she was do you know of any person in the world who has seen her alive since i do not do you know of any person in the world who has ever had a letter from her since i do not do you know any person in the world who can prove any fact showing that she ever left that house alive absolutely not had crippen asked at the york road cabstand whether lady and luggage had left while he was at business had he asked the neighbours the tradesmen at the shipping offices anywhere at all advertised in american papers eliot stared disbelievingly while crippen agreed in his mild vague way of doing no such things as though in a railway lost property office describing the mislaying of his umbrella why did he flee in july because of suspicion crippen explained suspicion of what suspicion of being concerned with his wifes disappearance on what charge he apologized for knowing nothing of the law but he was a reader of romances to a great extent and had an idea that he might be arrested and held on suspicion until she was found you stayed with le neve disguised as your son in a hotel in antwerp yes you stayed indoors all day oh no we went to the zoological gardens the mans behaving as though charged with riding a bicycle without a lamp or having no dog licence eliot thought irritably and dejectedly his quaint gemьltlichkeit had worsened now it was pathological euphoria or perhaps he was colourblind to the myriad hues between right and wrong did he risk his neck as a pure moralist who saw sin and virtue only as black and white the skin with the scar was being shown him on an enamel plate from which people ate their dinners crippen gave it a mild look through his goldrimmed glasses he did not recognise it as belles the court adjourned for lunch eliot decided against returning the trial was bearbaiting a donkey foxhunting a lapdog thick crowds crammed round the brand new granite court justice without her blindfold atop its copper dome stones from dickens newgate prison in its foundations the police had been on duty since seven in the morning there had been five thousand applications to the sheriff for seats eliot pushed into the magpie and stump public house opposite the landlord would remember him as a student at st bartholomews up the road a pinkfaced young man with a fringe of ginger beard in shiny blue suit and bowler asked cheerfully dr beckett isnt it a chum on the mail pointed you out im at the bugle i hear that youre acquainted with crippen slightly i had dinner at his house at hilldrop crescent the reporter looked as though eliot had supped with the devil in hell go on what was it like i refuse to discuss my personal affairs the public would like to know then the public is a prying nuisance and deserves disappointment any views on the trial he persisted yes i have eliot said forcefully it should be held in the drury lane theatre its perfectly disgusting men and women who wear the airs of leaders in our society hastening to gloat over another poor human in his agony im equally repulsed by the mass of ordinary british people who assume this man guilty as unthinkingly as that the sun will rise and the public houses open every morning they would like him hanged from nelsons column in trafalgar square on a saturday afternoon so they could take a picnic and enjoy it thats coming a bit strong doctor the reporter complained amiably from one who stood as a labour candidate truth is a distant relative of politics and newspapers i fear every man jack of you on fleet street knows your proud columns about this trial showing british justice at its best are humbug for which the public has an insatiable appetite look how theyve made a hero of plodding inspector dew who let the pair slip from under his nose and gain a fortnights lead on him then spent three days searching at hilldrop crescent before showing enough intelligence to dig up the loose bricks of the cellar floor look at the ridiculously melodramatic captain kendall with his amazing discovery that a boy with wide hips and large breasts might be a girl by the wits of their pursuers dr crippen and miss le neve deserve to be living peacefully in california by now yet the fuddled british public sees the voyage to father point as the most spectacular stroke of revenge since birnam wood came to dunsinane what wood was that doctor birnam no h the reporter nodded busy with his notebook but wouldnt you agree with everyone doctor the crippen case has shown how the law has new weapons wireless simply caught the imagination of the feckless public like a new show at the fairground against marconi are you doctor asked the reporter encouragingly im against no one exceptif i may be frankyour editors and proprietors who hope to see fortunes and titles sprout from fields so assiduously spread with manure how about a photo he indicated a clothcapped youth beside him with a glass of ginandwater and a camera as you like eliot agreed offhandedly eliot learned in the magpie and stump a principle which twenty years later assisted him to worldly successnever address the most insignificant representative of the press without care caution and cunning he sent laura the parlourmaid for a copy of the bugle before breakfast she returned with eyes sparkling excitedly youre all over the front page sir photograph and everything eliot stood before the freshlylit fire in the diningroom crippens friend said the headline the stupid british public he was quoted below the most amazing statement of crippen week was made outside the old bailey by dr eliot beckett selfappointed peoples doctor of holloway it began eliot ran his eye through the column from his censure of inspector dew he might have attacked wellington the morning after waterloo from his acquaintance with crippen he might have played surgical assistant disembowelling belle and second gravedigger in the cellar dr beckett who pretends to be the peoples friend gives free treatment in a greengrocers shop round the corner from hilldrop crescent eliot read very strange treatment mouldy bread the bugle asked the kings physician dr bernard dawson of the london hospital if mouldy bread ever did anyone any good none whatever said the kings doctor it seems a cranky notion to me perhaps dr beckett is obliging the neighbours by getting rid of their old loaves dr beckett stood for parliament in the election as labour candidate for hollowayat which he dismally failedwhile despising those he urged to vote for him perhaps he wants a seat in parliament at all costs the doctor is moons away from the working man he claims to represent he does not lack money he enjoys with a wealthy american lady the same relationship our readers will have read about elsewhere in holloway eliot handed the paper silently to nancy who came downstairs in her nurses uniform she read it calmly is it libellous only infuriating im afraid robert knox had to tolerate the same sort of thing at edinburgh in the s he taught anatomy and after the burke and hare murders the newspapers whipped up feeling against him he was as upright as i am and traded with bodysnatchers only for the sake of his students just like any other surgeon youre taking it very calmly how else can i if i wrote complaining theyd make me look a bigger fool than ever how do they find all this about us the patients perhaps our servants in holloway you can learn a lot about a man for sixpence laura threw open the door without knocking oh sir she looked frightened the bakers boys just said that something terribles happening down at the surgery sir theyre breaking the windows sir eliot jumped up he told nancy to stay in the house seized his hat and muffler and strode in the bright autumn morning to the corner of brecknock road he stopped a crowd of men and women were shouting and gesticulating in the street outside the surgery two policemen separated them from the smashedin shopfront urging everyone to move along heads stuck from windows the pavements were choked with those who preferred to be spectators rather than perpetrators and some fifty excited children eliot strode on angrily the mob outside were the same who had sat inside the slaughtermen market porters and their families they had come from the pubs eliot knew and in a mood of mindless bellicosity he wondered how many were literate enough to spell out the front page of the bugle he supposed its story had run round the neighbourhood gaining strength as it passed from mouth to mouth like the germs men were continually breathing over each other im dr beckett a third policeman was regarding the affray from the corner thats my premises theyre damaging the policeman held out an arm shouldnt go down there if i were you sir im not frightened of people who attack nothing more dangerous than plateglass a greyhaired woman in a shawl pointed at eliot from the edge of the crowd there e is thats the doctor thats im friend o crippen eliot found himself suddenly the centre of a jeering jostling circle mouldy bread they shouted at him murderer screamed another woman crippen crippen yelled the rest it was the fashionable malediction eliot remembered belle on the stage at the metropolitan none o that the policeman directed adding urgently run along sir while the goings good i refuse to be intimidated by a mob go on sir crippens a strong word eliot felt a flick against his cheek he raised his fingertips someone had spat at him contempt is impossible from the contemptible he snapped he turned and strode away pursued by boos he had sat almost quarter of an hour glaring into the fire legs stretched arms folded unspeaking nancy on the arm of his chair im never going back to the surgery he announced she said in her practical way then youd better get the window boarded up or youll have the place looted they can help themselves to as much mouldy bread as they please he added despondently it doesnt work anyway the bugle was right there was a timid tap laura reappeared looking more frightened than ever a policeman was at the door eliot found an inspector in cape and shako he warned gravely that the inflamed people of holloway would find eliots address fill the street outside break his own windows the inspector advised him to lie low somewhere there was the safety of the american lady to consider hes been reading the bugle too eliot thought lie low for how long eliot asked just till theyve hanged crippen the inspector assured him blandly eliot returned to the dining room were moving this morning where to the savoy but we cant nancy objected why not were not married she pointed out oh very well well get married well use a registry office theyre quite fashionable she put her arms around him oh eliot you are so romantic he smiled i suppose your father would have loved a show in new york hes reconciled that his daughters an oddity he bears me no rancour im just a business bid which failed i guess she kissed him youre really as romantic as romeo arent you dearest but you always want to seem absolutely different from everyone else from now on im going to be absolutely the same as everyone else but im going to be better at it eliot took a savoy suite with two bedrooms guests however wealthy were not permitted by the management to sleep there with ladies other than their wives or who allowed themselves to be passed as such at the following afternoon the old bailey jury retired twentyseven minutes later they returned barely a minute afterwards everyone stood except the judge his elderly clerk in his best morning coat laid on his lordships wig a square of black silk the judge reminded the prisoner that he had cruelly poisoned his wife concealed his crime mutilated her body disposed piecemeal of her remains possessed himself of her property and fled from justice on the ghastly and wicked nature of the crime the judge would not dwell he assured its convicted perpetrator that he had no hope of escaping its consequences and recommended making peace with almighty god i have now to pass upon you the sentence of the court continued lord alverstone which is that you be taken from hence to a lawful prison he spelt out with the laws ghoulish relish from thence to a place of execution and that you be there hanged by the neck until you are dead and that your body be buried in the precincts of the prison where you shall have last been confined after your conviction implying that his judicial exhortation extended further he ended his grisly catalogue and may the lord have mercy on your soul the prisoner was removed in the charge of the warders eliot read in his times on monday morning crippens amen he thought exactly a week after her lover was first brought into the same courtroom ethel le neve faced the old gang reunitedlord alverstone mr muir and mr travers humphreys his junior humphreys was winning double fame at fareham in hampshire he was simultaneously prosecuting lieutenant siegfried helm from the st battalion of the german emperors nassau regiment for imperiling the state by sketching the forts at portsmouth the lieutenant was young and goodlooking the court crowded mostly by ladies there was one newcomer f e smith member of parliament aged who had been the youngest ever kings counsel and was to be the youngest ever lord chancellor ethel had avoided the debtridden solicitor arthur newton she instructed the staid firm of hopwood and sons eliot wrote to them passing on his fathers suggestion he never knew whether this was the cause of its implementation f e smith was tall handsome with thick eyebrows a mouth turning down arrogantly a pearl tiepin the size of a muscat grape and a liking for long cigars he and ethels case suited as man and wife he defended her with one speech and one argument how could a simple typist in her twenties live blithely with crippen on the run had she the slightest suspicion he had recently dismembered his wife and buried most of her in the cellar the prosecution had no stomach for the fight perhaps they were exhausted by their sustained indignation the previous week perhaps they saw their depiction of crippen as too fiendish for another member of the human race to receive comfort and maintain him as ethel was accused she was freed in a day f e smith called no witnesses not even his client the judge later criticised him for it i knew what she would say f e told him you did not all day the new home secretary sat in court winston churchill as a drowning man gives a final shout crippen took his case to the court of appeal in a few minutes mr justice darling threw it out it was guy fawkes day a fortnight later on saturday november eliot and nancy were married at holloway registry office nancy had a scheme for them to separate and meet at the altar like any decent couple eliot objected that he was an atheist nancy consoled herself that his love was rooted in the soul he affected not to possess nancys father neither crossed the ocean to see his younger daughter die nor to see his elder one wed the duke gave them a lanchester motorcar eliot wondered desperately how the devil one worked it there was no honeymoon the week after crippens conviction at the old bailey eliot had received a letter from the kings physician forwarded in his fathers hand from the ducal castle bernard dawson apologizes for his mouldy bread remarks in the bugle he never knew the particular witchdoctor was me a paper with their morals wouldnt hasten to enlighten him hes atoning for making me the second most unpopular man in england he tossed the letter to nancy across their sittingroom overlooking the thames at the savoy he ran into dr pasquier of all people eliot continued hes over from champette for a meeting at the brompton chest hospital about phthisis dawsons offering me a job in a free sanatorium for the poor which hes opened on money raised in the city at bognor the south coast you know sea breezes i suspect phthisis would kill me with boredom but a step by dawson can mean a leap to higher things what do you think take it im sure thats right oh ill have my plate up in harley street in no time he asserted the rich shall provide my living and the hospital poor my reputation just like everyone else how much more sensible to use the familiar machine rather than trying to dismantle it and make a different one from the worn parts eliot called on dawson the following week at his home no wimpole street he found himself obliged to be vetted by the london hospital board of governors on the monday morning after his wedding he returned to the savoy after the interview to find his bride with a telephone message from the medical officer at pentonville jail would eliot call that afternoon he was puzzled crippen was in a condemned cell to be hanged there two mornings later on wednesday november the prison was only half a mile from hilldrop crescent across the cattle market it was a wheel of radiating blocks on which the spirits of prisoners were painstakingly broken by solitude and silence eliot left his cab at the balmoral castle public house on the corner of brewery road opposite the facade of untidy classical columns rising among terraces of small neat lawabiding houses a dozen plane trees fronted the high wall behind it rose the grey barred slateroofed blocks in the middle poked a fat square chimney the visitors entrance was to the right of the vast oak gothic door eliot gave his name to the warder in highnecked tunic and shako keychain dangling against his thigh he signed a ledger on the counter inside the gatehouse which had a good fire and a singing kettle two other warders brewing their tea in a brown metal pot eliot was led across the courtyard to a block with stylish columns between the windows of the first floor a stone corridor with gates at each end which his cicerone unlocked and locked behind them led to the prison hospital there had been little room for crippen in eliots head he thought of him as the sailors in the french submersible pluvoise hit by a crosschannel paddlesteamer earlier that year her bows above the surface but her crew doomed to die under the eyes of the world he was shown into a small greenpainted gaslit office with a desk opposite the fire on a horsehair sofa sat a woman in a serge suit who rose as the warder left it was ethel dr beckett she was as surprised as himself her large velour hat was shrouded in a motoringveil she looked pale a smile flickered on her lips later eliot saw kings and queens stark naked but never again felt as awkward how is he bearing up sometimes he seems his usual self others he cries im here to see the prison doctor i dont know the reason hes ever so kind to peter sos major myttondavies hes the governor hes quite convinced that peters innocent you know that a man like peter could never commit a murder not in all his born days and hes not the only onejust think fifteen thousand people signed the petition to spare peters life the prison doctors with peter now thats why im waiting give him my eliot stopped what greeting could anyone send a man due to hang in hours time assurance that he is ever in my thoughts hes written me some lovely letters she felt in her large handbag eliot wondered if she had the inexpressible almost unthinkable pride of a woman who drives a man to terrible deeds which drive himself to destruction delilah behind a typewriter would you like to see one as she seemed eager eliot took the lined buff sheet stamped with the royal arms and h m prison pentonville it was a pathetic mixture protestations of innocence references to a god so bafflingly reluctant to establish it directions to ethel about his own past business affairs and her future ones impregnated with sentiment towards my own wifie dear i see ourselves in those days of courtship having our dinner together after our day of work together was done or sitting sometimes in our favourite corner of frascatis by the stairway all the evening listening to the music i sometimes thought that a little corner of heaven on earth and now my prison dinner is just waiting and i must eat it while it is hot have just had a nice dinnerroast mutton vegetables soup and fruitand now back to my wifie again eliot handed the letter back a man who could write of roast mutton in the condemned cell would feel gemьtlich in the grave how are you he asked kindly always so tired lifes difficult in silly little ways i have to go about in a closed cab if people saw me in the street thered be a riot mrs jackson was very goodmy old landlady you know eliot nodded of course you met her at the house that sunday afternoon just after the old king died ethel stopped suddenly eliot had a vision of belles clothes ethel said quietly but i dont want to see any of the old crowd none of them never again how will you manage after he hesitated in the future i cant stay here can i im going to america im booked on the majestic from southampton on wednesday under the name of miss allen the most loving relatives of patients in extremis at champette eliot reflected had to plan beyond their release from the sick room then i shall go to toronto peter talked so much about it on the boat ill start a new life i wish you all the luck in the world miss le neve her interview with a new employer for the position of his lady typist was a scene beyond eliots imagination thank you she ran her tongue over her full lips theres something she stopped yes theres something no one knows it never came out at the trials peters or mine i cant bear keeping it locked in me it wakes me at night its worse than any memory ive had of these awful four months keeping secrets is as much second nature to a doctor as staunching blood i know that id always trust you dr beckett peter did more than anyone he knew the hatboxyou remember i told you that same sunday afternoon the doctors hatbox was stolen on the boat on our way across to fetch little valentine from boulogne to eliots annoyance the door was opened by a pink faced man with grey hair cut like a brush and a grey stubby moustache wearing a blue serge suit after him came a warder it wasnt stolen ethel finished breathlessly it was dropped over the ships rail she turned nodded at the intruder and followed the warder dr beckett im dr campion said the greyhaired man most kind of you to come i hope that didnt embarrass you id no idea miss le neve was here not at all ive been acquainted with miss le neve for a whole year eliot sat facing the doctor across the desk exmedical officer in the army or navy he supposed a good job for a man expended of ambition he wondered what it was paidј a year he speculated twothirds the governors salary you were almost a neighbour at hilldrop crescent i believe campion continued in a friendly way the prisoner talks sometimes as though you were close colleagues why did you want to see me eliot demanded his thoughts were still on the hatbox so she did know belle was dismembered and beheaded before they ran away the doctor stared at the ceiling rubbed his large red hands and returned his eyes to eliot i face an awkward choice dr beckett crippen himself is a model prisoner indeed everyone has grown very fond of him not only the guards who must watch him day and night but the chaplain and certainly the governor though he did attempt suicide he revealed strangely enough ive never seen that before in condemned men i suppose they grasp at hope to the end like the sick the miraculous fingertips of jesus last night he managed to break off the steel side of his glasses the warder noticed it and searched him hed slipped it up the seam of his trouserleg he must have intended to divide his radial artery with it under cover of his blanket he wouldnt be the first medical man horace wellsthe american who discovered anaesthesiakilled himself by severing a femoral artery with his razor in the toombs prison one january night of hed been run in for throwing vitriol in prostitutes faces dr campion paid little heed eliot reflected that the occupation of prison doctor gave little encouragement to the intellectual embellishment of the profession my choice is between defying the home secretary and possibly loosing my position or honouring my professional principles and keeping my good name mr winston churchill is a busybody he suddenly wants to know about the smallest items for which he nominally carries responsibility his personal secretary sent a stiff note to major myttondavies about the procedure for executions everythings in home office regulations of course but mr churchill demanded a simple description of a single sheet of paper the same day he particularly wished to know if the man had anything to help him face the ordeal more substantial than the ministration of the chaplain he gets half a mug of rum of course some refuse it they say they want to meet their god with a clean breath thats usually the drunkards mr churchill is always straining to bring in something newso we hear from the home office i suppose he wants to appear a progressive young politician now hes demanding that some drug be administered so that the prisoner may be hanged in a merciful state of coma whos going to prescribe it eliot asked immediately exactly for any doctor that would be contributing to the extinction of life and against our principles and against the law dr campion nodded there is a difference in assisting a man to die on the end of a rope and in bed we can perhaps allow ourselves sometimes to be part of the natural process but never of the unnatural one otherwise we should become executioners ourselves but mr churchill is most wilful he cannot understand these ethical niceties are so important to us he imagines that we are being pigheaded you asked me here to sign the prescription you have saved me a deal of unhappy explanation dr beckett crippen was known to you as to no other medical man give me the sheet of paper said eliot at once you realize dr beckett that the general medical council could be sticky about this should some enemy in the profession learn of your action id be struck off eliot added thoughtfully ill risk that for crippen what drug will you give theres only one powerful enough hyoscine dusk comes early to london in midnovember but the night is short for the man who knows he will not see the end of another day the condemned cell was fifteen feet square with a highup barred arched window crippen wore a rough grey jacket and trousers and a white calico shirt he had no tie and tapes instead of buttons lest he swallowed them and forestalled his execution or awkwardly deferred it with an operation for obstruction of the intestines several others had worn the same outfit but the authorities fumigated it in between as though they had died undramatically from smallpox the clocks untidily struck away the hours with terrible unconcern at midnight major myttondavies brought his last word from ethel an opened telegram just delivered by a boy on a scarlet bicycle at seven the governor was back there were two hours to go crippen was hunched on the blackpainted bedstead like a prison hospital cot two warders sat with practised stolidity under the gas at the twofoot square table where he wrote his daily letters to ethel the blotches on its greasy surface as fixed in his minds eye as a map to a treasurehunter the warders enjoyed three days special leave from that morning they had played cribbage and snakesandladders with crippen to divert his mind it was in the regulations the governor had the dose in a mug of cocoa something to buck you up he explained crippen drank it grimacing at the bitterness the governor wondered if the doctor knew he was poisoned near to death at his customary three minutes to the hour hangman ellis entered the cell he wore a blue suit a high starched white collar and a black tie folded in his jacket pocket was an order to hang half a dozen lines penned in clerks copperplate and signed by charles johnston sheriff of london which spared ellis being as black a murderer as his victim behind came assistant hangman willis the two warders had already been joined by the chaplain robed for a funeral lost at ministering to a prisoner comatose beyond confession or repentance crippen lay on the grey blanket breath faint cheeks dusky with his goldrimmed glasses on the table was the halfmug of brandy inexorably provided by the regulations the warders eyed it having agreed to share though crippen was nearer corpse than man rules required following ellis carried a footwide buckled blackleather bodybelt with four pairs of straps across the front he slid it round crippens waist securing it at the back strapping wrists and elbows across his midriff he took from willis a short black strap which he loosely secured below crippens knees and a conical linen cap to stick on his head like a dunce i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord began the chaplain had belle had crippen converted he would have got it in latin a hanging was a singular legalecclesiastic ceremony outside the cell a procession had assembled the chief warder led followed by the chaplain who had reached man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery by skipping next came crippen limp between two warders then ellis and willis major myttondavies undersheriff rupert smythe in frock coat and black cravat dr campion and the deputy chief warder for the rear the way was short the execution shed stood open beyond the facing oaken doors of half a dozen condemned cells a stout beam ran from one whitewashed wall to another with three shiny hooks like a butchers from one hook a brandnew rope two inches thick hung by a brass eyelet attached to its end by a clip like dogcollar to lead was a yard of soft rolled leather tapering to a small brass eyelet which created the noose this hung precisely over the trap a thread drawing a loop of rope towards the crossbeam the scaffold was welltried designed for the home office in by lieutcol alten beamish of the royal engineers the thread was ellis own idea of which he was proud hanging does not invite much innovation the sides of the trap always underran two planks the public imagined the objects of its retribution standing a few remorseful seconds awaiting the drop but a man can seldom support the weight of a body from which life will be shordy squeezed two warders held every prisoner by the armpits as they were obliged with crippen the obligatory onlookers made the shed crowded willis pulled cap over face ellis applied the noose by snapping the cotton securing it with a stiff leather washer behind the right ear he pulled the iron lever shifting an unseen pair of well greased steel bolts under the twin trapdoors of threeinch thick oak which crashed into their hooks on the whitewashed brick walls of the pit below crippen disappeared a faint slap came from the stone floor of the pit as one of his slippers fell off forasmuch as it hath pleased almighty god in his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed said the chaplain the violently twisting rope slowed the body needed stay an hour before delivery to mr shroeder the coroner who had sat on belle half a mile away by noon crippen would end in quicklime and they were letting him have ethels letters dropped in ellis got ј willis ј s on october five miles to the north they had buried in finchley cemetery all they had left of belle the blackframed notice on the prison gate was signed by the governor the undersheriff and the chaplain the customary bell was not tolled from official tenderness towards three other men inside shortly to undergo the same procedure it was uncharacteristic of eliot to take a cab from the savoy that misty morning he had always shunned the carnivals of the people especially the macabre ones he felt impelled to see the end of the drama he had watched before it began and he was anyway the executioners assistant as last intended with the german emperor the crowd at nine oclock was thinner than eliot expected perhaps the public was growing either tired of crippen or ashamed over him as he strode away afterwards a touch came to his elbow mouldy bread bill edmonton stood grinning it had become a holloway catchphrase hello bill hows your boils gorn doctor i changed me job but not your habits eliot thought catching the reek of beer im on the railway nah eliot found halfacrown in his pocket thank you doctor always said you was a proper genman bill pointed his short clay pipe towards the prison across the caledonian road remember when i met im in the free medicine shop eliot nodded i got ter know im pretty well bill continued proudly used ter come to the cattle market regular in the mornins on is way ter work ed bring scraps bones wot mrs crippen ad left over or cadged orf of the other ladies rahnd illdrop crescent mind e stopped coming abaht the middle o last february then o course he adnt a wife no more to do is shoppin ad e what did you do with these bones eliot asked horrified they all went in the boiler bill told him amiably pouparts piccadilly potted meat observed nancy when eliot hurried back to the savoy londoners love it well belle always wanted them to didnt she eliot pointed out on tuesday february the ailing king george vi went shooting at sandringham and the next morning was found by his valet dead in bed from a coronary thrombosis his daughter learned that she had become queen elizabeth ii at the outspan hotel near nyeri on the outer slopes of mount kenya in his last months the king walked with death as an acquaintance whom he did not fear in the end death came as a friend said winston churchill the coronation was tuesday june eliot and nancy were driven home from westminster abbey in their postwar rollsroyce i told you we did this sort of thing rather well said eliot darling after years i am still amazed by the british flair for ceremony and understatement did you notice the beautifully dressed old gentleman with the duty of holding a pole of the canopy he was a patient when i still practiced urinary incompetence dreadfully embarrassing at a party not to mention a coronation he telephoned last week for advice down his velvet breeches was an invaluable rubber device called a whybewet they wore scarlet robes eliots ermine caped nancys ermine trimmed she had a closefitting dress of silver lame the bodice embroidered with rhinestones and sequins eliots coronet was in a leather box at his feet nancy preferred a cap of state eliot was too old to rejoin the army he had run londons medical services from the start of the blitz nancy was an american citizen who had become the bestknown englishwoman she had organized the wartime evacuation of children from city to country she shared the cover of life with wendell willkie when he wore a tin hat in london airraid shelters trying to stop roosevelts third term in after nancy turned her energy to keeping american forces and the british on the best terms possiblethe relationships between allies in any war being only slightly worse than with the enemy if by hazard the venom of herr hitler strikes me down churchill had told a house of commons in smiling mood shortly before dday i am tempted to think that we can continue to go forward with the war organized by lady beckett we dont see much of winnie since he became prime minister eliot observed as they drove home among the coronation crowds or became so wonky or so gaga charles moran told me last week that winnies already had three strokes the first was in monte carlo in the last under a year ago i suppose hell soon hand over to anthony if the british will accept a divorced prime minister any news of margarets romance by the way i heard nothing at the mountbattens whos coming tonight beaverbrook and the luntsdid i tell you they were across for the coronation i hope to get willie maugham but evelyn waugh definitely not perhaps thats good actors always seem to get on well together writers never actors make their living by submerging their feelings writers by exposing them it was a cold rainy day eliot stared for some time at the people on the pavements how lucky they are he exclaimed a coronation concentrates memories do they know it the germs which prowled for most of my professional life as dangerously as hungry tigers have been killed by domagk fleming and florey now waksmans won the nobel for streptomycin and tuberculosiswhat we used to call phthisishas followed its victims to the grave did you hear the swiss sanitoria are changing themselves into hotels theyll go bust otherwise i actually saw a brochure from the clinique laлnnec renamed the hotel sporting de champette it advertises the spacious sunny balconies i wonder if the guests realize how many people died on them id like to see the clinic again it would be like walking over the somme a violent old battlefield turned impotent with the passage of time like us said eliot their town house was among the embassies in belgrave square eliots secretary was at the door lord beckett we had a telephone call from mrs stanley smith urgent the doctor in addiscombe says shes in heart failure and she particularly wants you to see her tell chevons to keep the car though i must divest myself of these glad rags they might raise an eyebrow in suburban parkview road surely youre not going eliot nancy scolded him youll need a good rest before dinner i have retained few patients mrs stanley smith is the most important really eliot i cant understand why youre still obsessed with the crippen case because i still dont think he did it but i suppose any doctor who prescribes the wrong dose deserves hanging i think he killed her in cold blood did he or didnt he mrs stanley smith who was miss ethel le neve died aged of cardiac failure on august at dulwich hospital in south london in eliot suffered a fatal coronary thrombosis in the lobby of the waldorf astoria in new york when on his way to give a lecture at the massachusetts general hospital in boston while this book was being written nancy was still living at shiplake castle in kent
