iain banks dead air for roger with thanks to mic and brad one b is for apple youre breaking up orry never mind at see you later i folded the phone this was three weeks before the stuff with the clout club and raine sorry the stuff with the clout club and raine and the taxi and the road under the railway bridge and the window and the nosebiffing incident and basically the whole grisly westtoeastend night experience when i realised some bastard or bastards unknown seriously wanted to harm me or even and this was according to their own threats kill me all of which actually happened not far from here here where were starting here where were picking up our story precisely because it was like the start and the end of something a time when everyone knew exactly where they were all of it probably within sight if not a stones throw of this raised here maybe theres no going back to check because the place where were startings not there any more whatever i associate what happened in one place with what happened in the other with things beginning and finishing and like the first tile in one of those impressive but irredeemably geeky recordbreaking dominofalling displays that people stage in sports halls where one tiny event leads to a whole toppling fanning branching cascade of tiny events which happen so fast and so together they become one big event with just stuff generally being set in train being pinged from a rest state into restless reckless spreading escalating motion who was that jo joined me at the parapet no idea i lied didnt recognise the number she pushed a short glass into my hand there was ice in the whisky and an apple squatting on top of the glass like a fat redgreen backside on a crystal toilet i looked over my shades at her she extracted a strip of celery from her bloody mary and clinked my glass with hers you should eat im not hungry yeah precisely jo was small with very thick black hair cut short and very thin white skin variously pierced she had a wide rockstars mouth which was sort of fitting as she did pr for the ice house record label today she was looking vaguely drowned worldera madonnaish with black tights a short tartan skirt and an old leather jacket over an artfully ripped tshirt people not all americans had been known to call her cute and feisty though not normally twice she had a temper which was why i automatically lied about the phone call even though i had no reason to well almost no reason i hoisted the apple from the glass and took a bite it looked shiny and great but tasted of nothing much jo was probably right that i ought to eat something breakfast had been some orange juice and a couple of lines of coke each i did very little of that stuff these days but i had this theory that the last time you want to get coked up is late at night when you just make your body stay up way beyond the time it wants to and you therefore stand a good chance of missing the next day snort during the hours of daylight instead and sort of slide off into alcohol as the evening descends so maintaining something remotely like the bodys usual rhythms as a result we hadnt eaten much of the wedding brunch at all and probably should force ourselves to eat a little just to keep things on an even keel on the other hand the apple was pretty unappetising i put it down on the chesthigh brick parapet it wobbled and started to roll towards the drop i caught it and steadied it before it could fall the hundred or so feet to the pitted asphalt of the abandoned car park beneath which was not in fact totally abandoned my pal ed had left his gleaming new yellow porsche at one end near the gates everybody else had parked in the almost unnaturally quiet and empty street on the other side of the old factory kulwinder and faye had lived here in the notyet fashionable bit of london s east end north of canary wharf for a couple of years always knowing that the place was likely to be demolished at any time the redbrick building was over a century old it had originally made stuff with lead mostly lead soldiers and lead shot which apparently needed a big tall tower to drop little spits of molten lead down into a big water pool hence the height of the place eight tall floors mostly full of artists studios for the last dozen years or so kulwinder and faye had leased half the top floor and turned it into a big new york style loft spare echoing and vast it was as white as an art gallery and it didnt really have many readily identifiable rooms instead it had what stage people would call spaces mainly one big space full of minimalism but very expensive and artfully arranged minimalism however some developer had finally got their planning permission and so the place was getting knocked down in a week or two kul and faye had already bought a place in shoreditch buying seemed to encourage the need for further commitment so theyd got married this morning and jo and i were two of the fifty or so guests invited to the wedding i couldnt make it show to do and the subsequent feast back at the loft not like i say that wed eaten much i frowned and dug into my glass to hook out the ice dropping the glistening blocks on the wide brick parapet jo shrugged thats the way it came hon she said i sipped cold whisky and looked out towards the unseen river the roof terrace faced south and east producing shadowed views beneath the scattered clouds floating over the towers of canary wharf and the unending cluttered flatness of essex a cool wind chilled my wet fingers i didnt like it when jo said hon thought it sounded like an affectation she said daunce sometimes too when she meant dance shed grown up in a posh bit of manchester but she sounded like she was from somewhere between manhattan and mayfair i looked at the slowly melting ice cubes puddling on the brickwork and wondered if there were similar little things about me that were starting to annoy her i flicked the lozenges of ice overboard down to the cratered asphalt of the car park ken jo how you two doing kulwinder joined us fine kul i told him he was wearing a cool black suit with a white shirt and nehru collar skin as rich and glistening as dark honey big liquid eyes currently shielded by some silverframed oakleys kulwinder was a gig promoter and one of those annoying people who was effortlessly stylish never more so than when they went back to some old fashion people had half forgotten but which when picked up again by somebody like kulwinder everybody suddenly realises actually looks pretty good married life still suiting you he smiled so far so good nice suit jo said touching his sleeve yeah kul said holding out one arm and inspecting it wedding present from faye faye was a journalistnewsreader on the radio station i work for she and kul met at one of our aftershow pub afternoons i think im on record on air describing faye as comely when do you head for nyc i asked they were honeymooning in the states new york and yosemite just for six days due to kuls gig work and the move to shoreditch next week tomorrow whereabouts are you staying plaza kul said he shrugged faye always wanted to stay there he took a drink from the bottle of hobec he was holding you going on concorde jo asked kul liked to travel in style drove a restored citroën ds he shook his head no hasnt started flying again yet jo looked at me accusingly ken wont take me to the states she told kul he raised his eyebrows at me i shrugged i was thinking i might wait until democracy had been restored kulwinder snorted you really dont like dubya do you no i dont but thats not the point i have this oldfashioned belief that if you lose the race you shouldnt be given the prize getting it handed to you because of electoral roll manipulation the police in your brothers state stopping the black folks from voting a rightwing mob storming a counting station and the supreme court being stuffed with republican fucks is called gosh whats the technical term oh yeah a coup détat kul shook his head and looked at me with his big dark eyes oh ken he said sadly do you ever get down off that high horse got a whole stable full of them kul i told him shit jo said staring at her mobiles display i hadnt heard it ring she usually had it set on vibrate which about six months ago gave me the idea for one of the shows more longrunning and successful items well longrunning in the sense i still went back to it now and again and successful by the perverse standards of me and my producer in that wed had dozens of complaints about our crudity and obscenity rather than the more common handful jo thumbed a button scowled heroically and said with a totally insincere brightness todd how are you what can i do for you she shook her head and sneered down at the phone while todd one of her bosses at ice house and allegedly deeply inadequate in every way talked she held the phone away from her and clenched her jaw for a moment then turned and put the phone back to her ear i see cant you deal with it she said as she walked slowly along the broad terrace right no i see yeah yeah no of course so what about you ken kul asked leaning on the parapet and glancing at jo who was a few paces away now and giving the finger to her phone while still making noises into it jo going to make an honest man of you i looked at him marriage i asked softly also glancing at jo are you talking about marriage he just grinned i leaned on the parapet too looking down at the gradually browning flesh of the apple i dont think so once was enough how is jude all right last i heard my ex was currently shacked up with a cop in sunny luton still in touch kul asked very occasionally i shrugged slightly dodgy territory here as jude and i did meet up now and again and on a few of those occasions had despite all the bitterness and recriminations and other usual failedmarriage stuff ended up falling into bed not something i wanted jo to know about or judiths boy in blue not something id talked about with any of my friends in fact also not something that had happened for over half a year so maybe that was over at last probably just as well you must have been seeing jo since about when faye and i met up kul said jo was on the other edge of the terrace leaning on the parapet facing south still on the phone and shaking her head that long yeah about eighteen months he drank again looking past me at jo i guessed youd either be settling down or splitting up he said quietly i showed the surprise i felt why ken your relationships rarely make it past the yearandahalf mark a year is probably the average jesus kul do you keep notes on this sort of thing he shook his head no i just remember stuff and i can see patterns well i began and would maybe have half admitted that perhaps jo and i werent going anywhere except she shut her phone and came marching over to us trouble i asked yeah she said almost spitting those fucking addicta wankers again addicta were ice houses latest hot band happening their time was very definitely now i kind of liked their music melodic english grunge with oases of surprising wistfulness but had come to hate them in a vicarious solidarityinspired way because they were according to the usually reliable source that was jo such total and complete arseholes to deal with that fucking useless cunt needs me to go and hold their fucking hands while some fucking precious snapper drapes them across a fucking bentley or something supposed to happen yesterday but the fucking dickhead forgot to let me know she kicked the parapet with one doc marten cunt youre upset i said i can tell oh fuck off ken she breathed heading for the flats interior i watched her go chase after and try to smooth things or let her go not make a bad thing worse i hesitated jo stopped briefly to talk to faye who was heading in the opposite direction with some people then she was gone in a moment faye was smiling at me and introducing these people and the possibility of pursuit and attempted mollification had gone ken thought you were avoiding me emma as if i said sitting beside her on one of the main spaces two chrome and blacksuede couches i chinked glasses you look great i told her just jeans and a soft silk shirt an alice band in her hair but she did look good its a few drinks later here but it definitely wasnt the drink talking or looking she just raised her eyebrows emma was married to my best pal from school days in glasgow craig verrin craig and i were our own little twoguy gang for fifth and sixth year before he left for university college london and within a year was settled down with emma and a baby girl meanwhile i viciously scapegoated by my teachers and examiners on some trumpedup charge of not having done the necessary work to pass my exams left to make tea and score drugs for the more lazy and dissolute djs on strathclyde sound emma was smart and funny and attractive in a delicately blond way and id always loved her to bits but things had become a little spoiled between us because we shared the guilty secret that just the once wed slept together she and craig had been going through a bad patch when it had happened after craig had strayed and been found out and they were splitup again now had been for a couple of years so it somehow seemed not quite as bad as it could have been but still my best pals girl what the hell had i been thinking of the next morning had been probably the most embarrassing of my life emma and i had both been so ashamed it had been pointless trying to pretend to the other that what had happened had been anything other than a colossal mistake well it was just one of those things you wished you could delete from reality i supposed wed both done our best to forget about it and just the passing of time made the guilt less sharp but sometimes when emma and i looked each other in the eye it was like it had been only yesterday and we both just had to look away i lived in intermittent terror that craig would find out i suppose it was sort of similar to but different from when jude and i fell into bed and it was another relationship i couldnt talk to anyone about come to think of it i couldnt talk about most of my relationshipsliaisonswhatever you wanted to call them for one reason or another i certainly couldnt talk about the other big one the one with celia celia the svelte celia the sexy celia the slinky as a seal either jeez a shallow person could come away from a review of my private life with some sort of idea that i liked a frisson of danger in my dalliances but that particular one was not just dangerous that one could get me very seriously hurt or worse in my darker moments it sometimes occurred to me that these entanglements or one of them would be the death of me havent seen you for a while emma was leaning towards me talking quietly voice nearly lost in the partys hubbub things have been hectic i bet i saw jo storming out well no that wasnt quite a storm it wasnt a common walk either granted somewhere in between more of a flounce something you said remarkably no no that was a workrelated flounce or storm wheres craig picking up nikki she glanced at her watch should be here soon and how is the gorgeous so emma broke in hows your programme going you have to ask i pretended to be hurt dont you listen any more you lost me when you were banging on about how only criminals should have guns thats not quite what we were saying maybe you should have been more clear what were you saying i cant remember i lied yes you can you were saying criminals should have guns i was not i was saying the idea that if you took handguns away from ordinary lawabiding people then only criminals would have guns was a crap argument for keeping guns because because its the ordinary lawabiding people who go crazy and walk into primary schools and open fire on a class of kids compared to that crims use guns responsibly to them a guns just a tool and something they tend to use on other crims i might add not a gym full of undereights you said criminals should have guns thats a quote i heard you well if i did i was just exaggerating for comic effect i dont think its anything you probably missed the way we developed that i told her we decided only extroverts and nutters should get guns crims or not because its always the quiet ones that go mad ever noticed that the shocked neighbours always say the same things he was very quiet he always kept himself to himself so guns for nutters only makes sense youre not even consistent you used to argue everybody should have guns emma im a professional contrarian thats my job anyway i changed my mind i realised i was on the same side as people who argued that the states and israel were havens of peace and security because everybody was tooled up emma snorted well i said waggling the hand that wasnt holding my drink the statistics arent that clearcut they have a lot of guns in switzerland too and not much gun crime emma watched her drink as she swirled it in her glass you wouldnt last in the states she muttered what i said mystified somebody would shoot you what i laughed nobodys shot howard stern i was thinking more of jealous husbands boyfriends that sort of thing ah i knocked back my scotch now thats a different argument entirely i stood up can i get you another drink in the long gleaming gallery that was the kitchen faye was sweeping up a smashed glass from the slate floor the caterers were unpacking more food from cool boxes i squeezed through a group of people i vaguely knew via my pals in advertising saying hi and hello and how are you smiling and patting shaking offered hands kul was leaning against the pucecoloured smeg fridge while a suit with a flushed face and holding a slim briefcase tapped him on the chest us have to go to work this afternoon you know the suit was saying we have meetings kul shrugged i put on gigs man i work at weekends this was the first day we could both manage well okay let you off this time the flushed suit said swaying but dont let it happen again he laughed loudly ha ha kul said yeah dont let it happen again the suit repeated heading for the front door na it was great great thanks thanks for the invite been brilliant hope youre both very happy thanks for coming take care kul told him yeah thanks thanks the suit bumped into somebody spilling a drink sorry sorry he lurched round to wave to kul who had already turned away and was headed for the lofts main space i poured myself some more glen generic then saw that somebody had brought a bottle of caskstrength laphroaig so abandoned my first glass and poured another of the leapfrog and went to the fridge for some water hey ken i closed the fridge door and saw craig official best pal scottish usual faintly diffident grin and sloppylooking thrownon clothes wee round glasses beneath a shaven head when craig still had visible hair it was black like mine maybe a little curlier weve both always had the same mediumslim build and since third year in high school ive been a couple of inches taller we used to get mistaken for brothers which both of us thought unfairly flattered the other our eyes are different his are brown and mine are blue alongside craig was his daughter nikki balanced on a pair of crutches a few seconds were required to take in this vision i hadnt seen nikki for over a year when she was still at school all gawky awkward and blushing now she was as tall as her father and as beautiful as her mother she had long glossy auburn hair half hiding a slim pale face that just shone with youth and health craig nikki i said kid you look fabulous i looked down at the freshly plastered leg hanging at an angle from her bootlegged jeans but youve broken your leg football she said shrugging as best she could craig and i hugged and slapped backs in fullon hailfellowcaledonianwellmet style i embraced nikki rather more tentatively she sort of leaned into the cuddle and nodded against my cheek she smelled of the open air of somewhere fresh and perfect a long way from london heard youre about to start at oxford yeah i said shaking my head as i looked at her she was nodding uhhuh she said then yeah just a water or something to her dad chinese wasnt it i asked yup she nodded brilliant good for you you can teach me how to swear in mandarin she giggled suddenly briefly a child again only if you promise to do it on air uncle i sucked air through my teeth favour dont call me uncle okay make an old man happy while were together and pretend you just might be a trophy waif ive picked up ken she kicked out at me with one crutch hey i said rubbing my shin ive a reputation to keep up or downhold whatever youre terrible come on i said offering my arm lets get you a seat craig were through here i told him he waved nikki nodded me to go ahead of her hobble this way i said and pushed through the pack of people towards the main space while nikki clumped after me i looked at her again as we got clear of the kitchen crowd and sighed oh dear nikki what you are going to break so many hearts at oxford youngster organs rather than bones good idea mmhmm football you said girls do play it nowadays you know golly you dont say dont you find the long skirts get in the way ow will you stop doing that well what position striker i was scythed down in the penalty box on a hattrick too disgraceful nikki nikki here oh nikki emma had jumped up she hugged her daughter tightly eyes closed i hovered for a bit but there was no room on the sofa once theyd got settled and emma seemed to be deliberately ignoring me i waved to nikki and wandered off time for another line or two andor one more quick session on kuls playstation if that last bit makes me sound like some kid whose parents wont or cant buy him a games machine of his own i have to plead half guilty to the childishness charge i did have a ps of my own but i got annoyed at it one drunken night back in the summer and threw it overboard i live on a houseboat so i can do that sort of thing a drink or two later a couple of lines and various conversations to the better i was standing on the terrace again admiring the view and breathing in the fresh autumnal air with jo gone i felt a sense of freedom and even opportunity and promise the afternoon and evening stretching ahead invitingly i had a couple of evo s with me and pondered taking one loved up for the rest of the day this would mean though that id be out of synch with jo assuming we reconnected before the day was over with addicta involved probably we wouldnt but then you never knew an arm slipped round my waist a body against mine a kiss on my cheek and a voice purring herrlerrr amy well hello indeed amy was a friend one of jos friends originally though i suspected she and i got on better these days than she and jo who seemed to have cooled towards her amy was nearly my height she had fine shoulderlength darkblond hair with a natural curl she also had very long legs and a figure there was something slightly timewarped about amy altogether she was actually younger than jo by a year but she dressed and acted five or ten years older pa to a lobbying firm you look well ken amy leaned back against the parapet arms along the stone she wore pearls a blue blouse a midlength skirt and a long jacket court shoes and you look delectable as ever i told her smiling amy and i met up for lunch every now and again wed been flirting and joking about having a torrid affair for a year or so but we both knew it wasnt going to happen well probably it was amy id been on the phone to earlier when wed got cut off she smiled slowly and looked around jo here was had to go work was it her addictive band lot again the same she held a glass of white wine and took a delicate sip what was the wedding like the wind produced a tiny gust moving her hair across her face she blew it away dont know i said couldnt make it show to do ahhah ken do you have any drugs some coke couple of es think i might have some of the charlie i dont know why just feel like it she wrinkled her nose do you ever get that every day with a y in it there were a couple of children at the party and at least two print journalists i didnt trust so we found a room off the lofts only corridor it had been fayes office but now it was full of packing cases ready for the move back on the terrace a little later the two of us talking up a storm she picked up the parteaten apple still lying on the parapet twirling it in her hand its all right i told her its one of ours she threw it to me it looked pretty unappetising all brown around where id taken my single bite out of it i leaned on the brickwork and held it over the drop to the car park amy leaned beside me i let the apple go it tumbled very slowly almost disappearing it hit the asphalt and exploded in a highly satisfactory manner all little lumps of whiteness bursting out across the dark surface excellent amy clapped her hands we looked at each other our chins just off the brick parapet i felt suddenly like i was a schoolboy again hey i said what lets drop more stuff thats just what i was thinking i know which is how it came to pass that we ended up chucking what seemed like half the contents of faye and kuls loft over the parapet we started with more fruit theyve got far too much food in anyway amy said as we loaded up on oranges bananas a melon and more apples we stared at the asphalt a hundred feet below that was disappointing was a bit wasnt it i said looking down at the squishy mess produced by a couple of oranges i dont think citrus fruits are the way to go they just dont fragment in a satisfying manner or bananas agreed lets go back to apples then the melon that might be good yes i have high hopes for the melon lets do two apples at once one each good idea on three one two three oh yes very good well synchronised lets do four this time two each weve only got three apples ill get another one no dropping the melon while im gone wouldnt dream of it ere wot are you two up to ed hi hope you dont mind dropping fruit onto the car park sokay nowhere near your car fucking ell mate i hope not only got it last week cost me seventy grand ed was my official best pal english slight of build with a face that always reminded me of a black mark e smith hard and soft at the same time the phizog of a pliable bantamweight bruiser club dj sort of indemand guy does two gigs a night and catches a helicopter in between the porsche probably constituted a weeks wages its a beautiful car i told him but yellow thats a fuckin traditional porsche colour that is traditional how can yellow be traditional blue or green those are traditional colours even red but not yellow yellow is traditional for jcbs and tonka toys even lime green at a pinch kawasakis but not yellow wot a load of shit ed laughed wot are you on hi ed amy said returning with another apple here thanks fibre i said to ed holding the apple up to him im on lots of fibre ready readhey i said indignantly theres a bite out of this apple amy nodded ya somebody was eating it i looked at her what are you loik i said in my best dublin accent she just shrugged and got ready with her two apples poised to drop ready ready i said wot you doin this for ed asked as we let the apples go eh ken ed said while amy and i concentrated on the fruit falling to its doom whats the the apples duly splattered aow yeah ed said see thats why i said cool man melon said amy melon definitely i agreed hefting it let me said ed i want to drop the melon amy and i exchanged looks come on said ed i havent got to drop nuffink yet thats the test amy said sternly you have to bring something worth dropping to the party or its no entry i nodded you havent been initiated ill get sumfing ed started towards the apartment then stopped old on lets see the melon go first i held it out over the drop with both hands and then let it go amy whooped and we highfived outstanding fucking yeah man fine sport we need more fruit ill find some ill find some youll be lucky yeah something of a shortfall situation on the fruit front ill find sumfing else what i dunno rubbish junk have you seen this place their livingrooms like an operating theatre they dont have junk theyre movin man they must have stuff theyre frowin out good point see what you can find lets all see what we can find even better whats going on out here kul asked the very man i said kul had a bit of a sheen on him looked a little glassyeyed it never did take much to get him drunk kul you must have loads of stuff you were going to throw out havent you umm well most of the people at the party were taking turns to throw things over the parapet for a dedicatedly minimalist couple faye and kul had a surprising amount of stuff they werent going to miss when they quit the loft quite a lot of old kitchen bits and pieces like bowls plates jars a broken juicer a defunct thermos flask some outdated goblets a bilious green fondue set then a handful of ornaments theyd been given by fayes parents which theyd never liked or ever displayed but had kept in case the old couple ever came to visit the ornaments were like fayes parents pretty hideous followed by bigger stuff as faye and kul got into it and people started to camcord what was happening an old hifi system a bust tv a misbehaving radio and bottles lots of bottles me fuckin car ed wailed as half a dozen carefully released wine bottles plummeted to their destruction a big cheer went up as they shattered more or less simultaneously the wreckage is going nowhere near the damn car ed i told him you cant be fuckin sure man what about me tyres those are fuckin brand new tyres they cost a bleedin fortune plobly bean bags amy laughed as one of kuls promoter chums heaved through the crowd clutching two of the things over his head like giant brown scrotums you have you ever had bean bags i said to kul he shrugged promise you wont tell whats the point somebody shouted theyre not going to shatter now the promoter chum said he meant no but like ed he was from sarf landin but i was finking that if you like dropped eavier stuff on top of them brilliant i yelled deeply impressed at such forethought kul faye said laughing but sounding a little unsure i thought you liked that chair yeah well not that much kul said give me a hand here we got the big metal and wood chair up onto the parapet a whole bunch of us positioned it where it looked like it would drop onto one or both of the bean bags then we let it go very big cheer for the chair direct hit on one of the bean bags resulting in an explosive spray of white polystyrene beads splashing out across the now fabulously wreckagestrewn car park like a giant snowy feather pointing towards the chainlink fence hey if we dropped this fish tank would the fish experience weightlessness i mean like double weightlessness just kidding faye do you want this old table i found more bottles faye looked at kul her eyes wide she clicked her fingers that case of awful cava my uncle got cheap from tesco remember kul took her face in his hands and kissed her knew it would come in useful for something you certainly cant drink the stuff he set off towards the interior an unsteady stream of bottles of various sizes whistled to the asphalt each getting a small cheer as it hit people were calling out marks for technical merit and artistic achievement i bet you started this didnt you ken i turned to find nikki perched on her crutches all grumpy glare i held up my hands guilty i said surprised at her expression why whats wrong throwing perfectly good food away is wrong ken she said shaking her head as though at a child who needed to be told that scrawling on the walls with crayons was bad it was only a few bits of fruit i said it would probably have been oh ken she said she shook her head and stumped away kul came back with a cardboard box full of bottles of cava and started handing them out to the many grasping hands just for dropping he told people seriously i beg of you whatever you do dont drink it i halfheartedly considered trying to get to within bottlehandingout range of him but the press of people was too great i turned to amy and held up my hands never mind she said we leaned back against the eastfacing parapet she put out her hand to shake good new game ken she looked flushed excited i dont know i said keeping hold of her hand i liked it more in the old days really more big cheers as the full cava bottles hit with satisfyingly loud thuds and booms shake them first shake them up first somebody was shouting yeah i said call me a purist but i feel the soul kind of went out of it when we switched from fruit and lost our amateur status you cant live in the past ken i suppose we should be proud we were there at the start youre right was it my idea or yours i asked maybe we had it together indeed absolutely great minds idea time had come not about ownership about result destiny s child synchronicity the police i said just as my mobile went i keep mine on vibrate too as i pulled it out of my jacket amys ringtone sounded something classical i knew but couldnt name haha she said synchronicity indeed i laughed and looked at the display on my phone my producer calling from the office i heard one or two other phones going off around the place and thought i could hear the landline in the apartment too and wondered hazily whether for some bizarre reason everybody here had something urgent they had set alarms for a little after two oclock on a tuesday in september yo phil i said amy answered her call too what what new york the what where the world trade center isnt that a plane what a big plane like a jumbo or something you mean like the two big um skyscrapers kulwinder was walking back through the crowd of people as more phones went off and faces started to look puzzled and the atmosphere began to change and chill around us he was heading for the lofts main space again talking to somebody on his phone yeah yeah ill put the tv on two dressdown wednesday half man half limp bizkit there their mission impossible themeette hasnt been on the play list for a while phil you attempting to make some sort of point with that title not me boss you sure phil i looked across the desk at him we were in our usual studio at capital live i sat surrounded by screens buttons and keyboards like some sort of commodities dealer because thats the way studios have gone even in the relatively short time that ive been in the wonderful world of radio broadcasting you had to search for the two cd players in this studio up to my right between the email screen and the callers details screen to reassure yourself that you werent some suit playing the futures market only the microphone anglepoised out from the main console gave the game away positive phil said blinking behind his glasses phils glasses had thick black frames like michael caine as harry palmer or woody allen as himself phil ashby was a big gentle rumpledlooking guy with thick unruly prematurely saltandpepper hair the grey entirely down to me he said though i had photographic evidence to the contrary and a slight westcountry burr to his voice he had a relatively slow drawly almost sleepy delivery which though id never admit it to him complemented my own voice a running joke weve used is that hes on permanent valium while im forever speeding and one day well swap drugs and just both sound normal phil had been my producer for the last year here at capital live another two months and i would have established a new onair employment record i rarely last more than a year before i get sacked for saying something that somebody somewhere thinks i shouldnt have lalo what it was my turn to blink lalo phil repeated i could only see his head above the various screens and electronic gear between us sometimes i couldnt even see that if hed got his head buried in a newspaper isnt that one of the teletubbies i only ask because i know you are an expert no lalo schifrin he fell silent shrugged good radio shrug there phil i had sound effects for many of the silent syllables that made up phils fractured body language but i was still working on one for a shrug he raised his eyebrows right i picked up an oldfashioned mechanical stopwatch from the green baize of the desk i clicked it okay im putting the dead air stopwatch on you until you explain yourself ashby i glanced up at the big studio clock above the door another ninety seconds and we were off air through the triple glazing in the production suite where producers used to be decently confined in the good old days our assistants appeared to be conducting a lowlevel conflict which consisted of throwing paper planes at each other bill the newsreader wandered in on them waving his script and shouting lalo schifrin phil said patiently into the silence on our side of the glass he wrote the original theme for mission impossible i clicked the stopwatch off four seconds youre not even trying so lalo you mean for the tv series i take it yes bully for him and your point would be caller phil knitted his brows vaguely poprelated people with names that sound like they were given them by babies i snorted just people so obladi oblada by the fabs wouldnt count or inagaddadavida or gabagaba hey hardly target audience ken is lalo jaylo jaylo jennifer lopez i know who jaylo is p diddy for that matter lulu kajagoogoo bubba without the sparxx iio aaliyah gawd rest the poor girls soul i shook my head its only tuesday and were at the friday bottomofthebarrel stage already phil scratched his head i pressed a function button on my fx keyboard an exaggerated wooden headscratching noise of dubious comedic value sounded in my headphones it was either that or the dead air watch again and you can overdo these things our listeners whom we knew thanks to some very expensive proactive and robust market research to be statistically stoutly loyal and containing a major proportion of adagency primetarget as and bs with a lofty disposable income profile would be familiar with the array of assertedly wacky and indeed even zany sound effects i used to give them an idea of phils silent onair actions they also knew about dead air which is the terrifically technical term us radio boffins use for silence i took a breath can we talk about what we havent talked about yet must we phil looked pained phil i was held off the air for three days last week we played the pop equivalent of martial music through the whole show yesterday what is that what you get from marshall amps yeah and yet were told the world changed for ever seven days ago shouldnt a purportedly topical show reflect that i didnt even know you knew the word purportedly i leaned closer to the mike lowering my voice phil closed his eyes thought for today listener for our american cousins phil groaned if you do find and kill bin laden assuming he is the piece of scum behind this or even if you just find his body i paused watching the hands on the studio clock flick silently towards the top of the hour phil had taken his glasses off wrap him in pigskin and bury him under fort knox i can even tell you how deep thirteen hundred and fifty feet thats one hundred and ten storeys another pause dont worry about that noise listeners its just the sound of my producers head gently thumping on the desk oh one last thing as it stands what happened last week wasnt an attack on democracy if it was theyd have crashed a plane into al gores house thats it for today talk to you tomorrow if im still here news next after these vital pieces of consumerist propaganda i was in bond street this morning dkny had no normal stock that i could see at all do you know what they had instead kenneth no i dont know ceel why dont you tell me they had five thousand red tshirts with the twin towers on them five thousand red that was all in the whole shop it was like an art gallery not a shop i thought hey thats really touching really artistic i also thought theyll never sell all those but somehow it didnt matter she turned in the bed and looked at me everything seems so quiet so spooky dont you think she turned back again i stroked away a rope of her long brown hair and licked at the valley between her shoulder blades that hollow was the colour of milk chocolate and tasted of salt i breathed in the warm scent of her skin senses swimming losing myself in the sweet heady microclimate of her long slim body its the planes i said at last smoothing a hand down her flank over waist and hip to thigh her body so light for somebody so definitely black looked dark as old mahogany against the startling whiteness of the hotel sheets the planes she asked taking my hand and holding it in hers theyve stopped them flying over the city on the way into heathrow so another mr atta cant crashdive into the canary wharf tower or the houses of parliament makes the whole place seem quieter that day sitting in the ruins of the abandoned party at faye and kulwinders while it slowly dawned on those two that they would not be going to nyc for their honeymoon at least not the following day and probably for many days we kept going out onto the terrace to look at the canary wharf towers tall against the skyline less than a mile away half expecting to see them hit by a plane and crumble with the same awful grandeur as the first tower its pearl harbor ii we said theyll fucking nuke baghdad i cant believe this i just cant believe im seeing this wheres superman wheres batman wheres spiderman wheres bruce willis or tom cruise or arnie or stallone the barbarians have seized the narrative fuck the bad guys are rewriting the scripts challenger and chernobyl were sf aum shinrikyo and the tokyo underground was manga this is a disaster movie directed by satan switching channels some man on the beeb was saying that when people claimed theyd seen people jumping from the towers they were really only seeing cladding falling off then you switched back and saw the bits of cladding holding hands as they jumped together skirts blowing up around their bodies then the second tower collapsed and there was no more jumping or falling to be done just the catching up with the additional fragments of atrocity popping up and ploughing in elsewhere in america i see celia said softly turning away again youre right she stroked my hand but i mean its really quieter too kenneth ceel was the only person apart from my mother who ever called me kenneth well also apart from ed who sometimes called me kennif and eds mum whos been known to call me kennit but that doesnt count less fewer people especially in places like mayfair and knightsbridge and chelsea too ah the posh places the hedonistic hoods you reckon theyre quieter yes i think theyre all staying in their places in the country youre probably right so why are you still here i hate gladbrook gladbrook was ceels place in the country or rather her husbands deepest surrey disliked it the instant i heard of it even before ceel told me her husband only really used it for business meetings and impressing people she said she could never feel at home there and hated staying so much as a single night i mean gladbrook it even sounded wrong like the name of an offtheshelf company some wellsmarmy city type would buy to front a dodgy taxshy scam never actually been there but i saw the estate agents details for the place once basically a coffeetable book it should have had its own isbn number ran to a good forty pages including all the glossy photographs but all anyone needed to know was that the main house had a heated driveway you know for all those blizzards they get in surrey is that where mr m is no john is in amsterdam again hmm john mr m mr merrial in the importexport business drugs to begin with people largely these days plus fingers in more pies than he has fingers some of mr ms business interests were even legal these days impressive property portfolio apparently a man a little older than me maybe about forty a quiet even diffident guy by all accounts with a halfposh vaguely southeast accent pale skin and black hair usually dressed in an unshowy savile row suit and not at all the sort of chap who looks like a multimillionaire crime lord who could have people much more important than me rubbed out as quietly and efficiently or as painfully and messily as he wants any day of the week and im screwing his wife i must be fucking mad but then when we fuck and i am lost in her surrendered to those depths beyond mere flesh nothing could be better nothing ever has been better nothing ever will be better there is no one like her no one so calm and studied and childlike and innocent and wanton and wise all at once she thinks i am mad too but only for wanting her so much in the first place not for risking whatever her husband would do to me if he ever found out about us for herself she says she has no fear because she feels she is half dead already i have to try to explain this she doesnt mean half dead in any trivial sense of being tiredout or tired of life or anything like that but half dead in a way unique to and only capable of definition by her own bizarre selfmade religion a belief system without name ceremony or teachings which she cleaves to with the airy casualness of the truly convinced not the fundamentalist intensity of those who secretly guess they may well be wrong its a mad bastard concoction of voodoo spirituality and cosmologically intense physics like something stephen hawking might have dreamed up on a really bad acid trip me i was a humanist an evangelical atheist a fucking cardcarrying member of the rationalist inquisition and ceels totally barking but utterly unrufflable beliefs just drove me crazy but the truth was neither of us really cared and the only time we discussed stuff like that was in bed she enjoyed being told she was nuts and she loved the way it got me worked up what it boiled down to was ceel sincerely believed herself to be half dead in the sense of existing in this world while in a deeply soulentangled state with a twin ceel in another reality who was dead a ceel who died almost exactly half her life ago when she was fourteen its all to do with lightning with the lightning well come back to this and have you seen kenneth how everybodys become so suspicious suspicious yes looking at each other like everybody they meet might be a terrorist you want to take the underground kid people have started eyeing each other especially anybody carrying anything that might be big enough to be a bomb even more so if they put it down on the floor and could even conceivably leave it there when they get off i get claustrophobic on the underground i know i take buses sometimes she said in a small voice as though to apologise for having a chauffeurdriven bentley on call and an unlimited taxi account so youve told me and may i express on behalf of the struggling masses our gratitude that you deign to descend amongst us and grace our mean and surly lives with your radiant presence maam she slapped my hand gently and made a tutting sound i took my hand away and brought it down over her flat belly through the soft spring of curls and dipping to the cleft beneath her upper thighs tensed closing fractionally im a little sore there from before she said taking my hand again she held it as she rolled over on the snowwhite sheets and settled on her front on her left side there is a strange patterning of dark shadows exactly as though somebody had traced a henna tattoo of forest ferns upon her lightbrown skin it stretches from one shoulder skirting her breast and continuing down to the honeyed swell of her hip this is from the lightning what is that i remembered breathing on the night of the day that i first saw it nearly four months ago in the alloyed sheen of golden street and silver moon light in another room across the city it was like something from an iffy science fiction series from budget star trek or alien nation or something thinking it really was some sort of weird fernhenna tattoo i even tried to lick and rub it off she just lay there watching me great dark eyes unblinking that is from when i half died she said matteroffactly what from the lightning kenneth lightning yes lightning lightning as in thunder and yes she had stood on a cliff in martinique once when she was barely more than a child watching a storm and had been hit by lightning her heart stopped she could feel it had stopped and when she fell down it was pure luck that she fell back into the grass and not forward off the cliff towards the rocks thirty metres below she had felt very calm and had known as she lay there waiting for her heart to start again and the smell of burning hair to disappear that she was most definitely going to live but she was also absolutely certain that the world had gone in two different directions at exactly the point when the lightning bolt struck her and that in another world right alongside this one and identical until that point in every respect she had died either killed by the bolt itself or fallen to her death on the rocks below there is still a small mark on my head too shed told me in the darkbrown heat of that first remembered room shed smoothed back her hair above her forehead revealing a thin wavy brown line that ran barely more than the thickness of a single hair itself from the edge of her scalp back into the tangled wilds of her long lightdark hair i stared at it for a while jesus christ im fucking harry potter shed smiled i traced the frondlines with my gaze as she guided my hand down to the cheeks of her perfect behind if you like she said perhaps you may go here instead im on it babe ah yes so you are gently now somewhere beyond and beneath the layers of thick dark curtains london growled quietly to itself whats that ah i sighed happily staring at the framed note yes my very first complaint letter i was sort of locum dj at strathclyde sound sitting in on the nightly rock show while our resident tommy vance wannabe was attending to his customary midjanuary dryingout regime i cant read it yeah i used to think the smudges were the result of tears but then i realised it was probably just drool least its not written in green ink what did you do suggested lynyrd skynyrd and mountain should appear on a double bill nikki looked at me blankly well you had to be there i sighed before your time anyway child lynyrd skynyrd were a band from the states whose plane flew into a hillside phil supplied looking up briefly from his guardian they wrote a song called sweet home alabama seen as a confederate reply to neil youngs southern man which was an indictment of southern racism ahhah nikki said i had the strong impression we might as well have been talking about ancient greece phil has all the annoying attributes of encarta without the easeofturningoff facility i told her start talking about your sex life ken that usually does the trick phil said reaching for another piece of chewing gum oh yeah and he smokes i said phil isnt it time for your next nicotine patch he glanced at his watch nope eighteen minutes forty seconds to go not that im counting we were in the shows office in the soho square headquarters of capital live part of the fabulous mouth corporation complex in what used to be the united film producers building afternoon phil who trawls the press assiduously for material before the show then goes on to read the broadsheets afterwards unforgivable assistant kayla a droopyeyed überfemgeek forever in graded shades and camo baggies was on standard afternoon perpetual phone duty hitting and hitted scribbling notes and talking in a quietly intense monotone nikki shook her head and hobbled towards the next frame on the office wall she was down to one crutch now but still lame her plaster had been covered in a variety of multicoloured messages she was here because i knew she was a radiohead fan and thom yorke had been coming in to talk on our lunchtime show only now wed just heard he wasnt so the best i could offer the girl was a tour round the place culminating here in the narrow much partitioned and generally brokenup space where phil myself our two assistants and the occasional backup researcher put the show together each day from here we had a fine view of the rainstained whiteglazed bricks of the lightwell though if you squatted down by the windows and looked up you could see the sky the office walls were mostly covered in posters for indie bands i had never heard of i suspected phil only hired assistants who heartily despised all the music we played it was one of his little rebellions against the system however we did have as well as the officeequipment mandatory portrait of our dear owner sir jamie a few sony awards donated gold and platinum discs from artists and bands whod been cruelly deceived by their record companies into thinking wed helped them with their careers and what i was genuinely by far the most proud of a modest but highquality collection of framed landmark hate mail this ones a lawyers letter nikki said frowning just a sample muttered phil yes i said id suggested that if you speeded up you are the sunshine of my life by stevie wonder you got the main riff from layla by your man clapton there was talk of legal action but it passed duane allman phil said what i asked him came up with the riff not clapton allegedly you know the lips are particularly rich in blood vessels philip you could usefully stick that nicotine patch there nikki nudged me hard with one elbow and nodded at the next frame of shame that one ah my first death threat i said with what i hoped sounded like undue modesty a particularly proud moment death threat nikki asked wide eyes twinkling yes my dear from funny sleepy old northern ireland where time stands still id said let the orangemen walk through catholic areas but for every march they got to take part in a similarsize one had to be allowed through loyalist areas with tricolours posters of bobby sands seventies hungerstriker and republican martyr phil squeezed in lots of hearty singing of republican songs that sort of thing i continued which sort of developed into my patent threeword solution for the troubles united federal secular now get on with it thats eight words phil mumbled i was allowing for subsequent editing i said looking brightly at nikki anyway exception was duly taken theyre awfully touchy over there phil cleared his throat i think your humorous observation about the red hand of ulster being a symbol of a land won by a loser prepared to mutilate himself to claim a scraggy patch of rainlashed bog may have contributed to your healthy fanbase in the shankhill too see you try to bring out the local colour in some quaint little part of the provinces and these silly people insist on taking it all the wrong way im sure your nobel peace prize is in the post uncle ken nikki said this one first international death threat i said all due to our then spankingnew webfeed back to the old gun control debate again i was arguing for if memory serves but i was making the point that in the us it was all too late theyd made their bed and they damn well had to lie in it in the states i was for no gun control laws at all in fact in the states i reckoned guns should be made compulsory for all teenagers might produce a grand killoff of course but whos to say that was such a bad thing in the end that way thered be less of the little bastards to bother the rest of the world and why stop at just handguns and automatic weapons lets get with grenade launchers pull down some mortar and mines action get jiggy with some surface to air ordnance and seriouscalibre heavy weaponry chemical and biological weapons too theyre kind of the green option in a wacky sort of way longrange missiles nukes too and if some dickhead with a grudge decides to waste manhattan or washington with one of these well too bad thats the price you pay for freedom nikki looked at me and they pay you for this ken young lady for this they dont just pay me they compete for me hes a hot dj phil said there you are i told her yup hot like a potato phil said i smiled at nikki hes going to say always getting dropped always getting dropped told you now nikki are you sure i cant take you for lunch yeah im fine thanks but you must be hungry no id better get back books to order stuff to read you know flying start at the chinese course thats the idea we were sitting in my ancient land rover in the offices underground car park waiting for the engines plugs to warm up are you sure i cant take you for something to eat come on itll make up for not meeting lord thom of yorke i was all set to deliver this great treat and then i was thwarted i really feel i need closure here seriously i know some great places we may well see some celebs no thanks is that your final answer yep would you like to call a friend no really look you dont have to drive me back to craigs ken i can jump in a taxi jump well hobble fall in honest i dont mind not at all i promised your dad id get you home safely i can look after myself you know ken nikki said smiling indulgently at me never doubted it but taking you back is the least i can do rain check on lunch some other time say yes some other time she agreed sighing brilliant the little coilwarming lamp on the fascia went out i started the engine and it settled down into an alarming percussive rattle hey i said heaving on the bussized wheel to pull us out of the parking bay i dont know if ive said but i think its really cool you getting into oxford she shrugged looked almost embarrassed youre absolutely certain you dont want to celebrate your ascension to the dreaming spires with some slapup nosh she just looked at me i laughed turning for the exit ramp oh well come on then lets get you home i swung the land rover out of the mouth corp car park we went bouncing and rattling and squeaking into dean street i looked over at her whats so funny nikki laughed to herself for a moment then glanced over at me through her long red hair i wasnt expecting a land rover she said i thought youd have a harley davidson or a limo or maybe a smart or one of those audis that looks like a bar of soap or something i was never into harleys i said suzis and kwaks were my kind of bikes back in my courier days but this old thing i slapped the dark grey plastic fascia under the narrow slab of the landys windscreen despite ill grant looking like the sort of transport that would be infinitely more at home hauling a brace of sodden sheep from one field to another on a failing hill farm in darkest wales is almost the ideal car for london you reckon nikki sounded like she was humouring me think about it i said its old slow and a bit battered so nobodys going to want to nick it even the wheels dont fit anything else look comedy wipers i turned on the windscreen wipers on a land rover of this vintage theyre about seven inches long and just sort of flop about in a disheartened kind of way looking more like theyre waving at the rain to welcome it onto the glass than undertaking to do anything so strenuous as actually clear the drops off the windscreen look at that pathetic no selfrespecting vandals even going to bother bending those wouldnt be sporting they are a bit pathetic nikki agreed as i turned them off and let them slump with what looked like exhausted gratitude to the base of the screen again youre high up as you may have noticed clambering awkwardly in here with your gammy leg so you can see over most other traffic the better to take advantage of what overtaking opportunities do arise in the hurlyburly of metropolitan motoring then there is the fact this is a series three of the diesel persuasion so when people hear you coming they think youre a taxi and often mistakenly treat you with the respect due to your standard hackney carriage the ancient design means that the vehicle is narrow as well as having a short wheelbase for squeezing through gaps and into restricted parking spaces and lastly driving one of these no kerb in london holds any terror for you whatsoever if a brief expedition onto the pavement or over a minor traffic island is required to facilitate progress you just happily bump onto and over it without a second thought now thanks to the appalling noise levels and seats patently constructed from lowgrade friable concrete it would certainly be utterly hellish on long journeys or at any speed above a brisk jog but then when the hell do you get to do either of those in london i glanced over at her so for an agricultural device only one automotive chromosome removed from a tractor this is a surprisingly suitable urban runabout and i commend the vehicle to the house i waggled my eyebrows at her as we inched along old compton street id been developing this whyalandysgreatforlondon speech and variations thereof for nearly a year and this was imho a particularly fine and welldelivered example of the breed which i thought might have elicited a pained grin if nothing else from the lovely nikki but it drew only a woundingly blank ohyeah hohum look across her glowing features could do with power steering couldnt it she suggested and a better turning circle but glad you spotted that i said the chance to maintain upper body strength through incar exercise is a truly valuable nocost option yeah right she said she was silent for a few moments then nodded at the radio thats not your station playing is it ah no thatll be mark and lard on radio one isnt that disloyal deeply can i let you in on a terrible secret what im only half joking about it being secret i said first the press havent heard this yet and on a quiet news day with a following wind it could just make it into print and conceivably cause me problems in a strawthatbreaksthecamelsback kinda stylee guides honour she said saluting ironically thanks okay here it is hold on id been gradually nudging the land rovers muchdented front further and further into the traffic stream for the past few vehiclegaps and somebody in a nice car had finally got the message i waved cheerfully at the silver merc that let us out of old compton street as we swung onto wardour street to start heading north in a vaguely highgateish direction i looked at nikki yeah its this i cannot fucking stand commercial radio i nodded there its out now and i feel better for it including the station you work for obviously obviously so you listen to radio one itll get turned off promptly at three but for large parts of the day yes and i have a definite weakness for mark and lard there listen in fact all we were listening to was the landys rattling engine and ambient outside traffic noises until the boy lard squeaked carry on and the programme resumed see i said dead air there silence used to be anathema for djs and radio people in general nowdays well nobodys much bothered about leaving pauses any more but these guys have made it into a feature repeat until funny as theyd say themselves genius i glanced at nikki who was looking sceptically at me from beneath her mass of red hair but the point i insisted is that the beeb has minimal advertising i mean they carry trailers for their own shows and those can get wearing enough but what they dont have is relentless highrotation drivel every fifteen minutes from fucking loan companies ambulancechasing shyster legal firms and chipboard warehouses owner shouting at you from too near the mike to come on down and feel the cut of his special offers i hate adverts i prefer the licence fee thats how i want to pay up front efficiently then get to listen to what i want to listen to and nothing else whether its popclones or beethoven or the sort of crap allday talk shows that taxi drivers listen to i suppose that guy phil points out that the adverts are what pay your wages phil i laughed hes a radio three and four man hates adverts even more than i do i glanced at her again as we troubled the usually littleused upper regions of the landys gearbox in a miraculous void in the traffic which gave us an almost clear run to the lights at oxford street dont get me wrong hes a good producer and hes a real muso goes to see a band practically every night whether its at wembley arena or a pub in hackney but he cant stand capital live either no its our friendly local station manager to whom it falls to bring the realities of commercial radio regularly to our attention we crossed oxford street and started to head up cleveland street following a motorcycle courier on a honda vfr perhaps i thought a little reminiscing about my days as a fearless gonzo courier only a few years ago after all would impress nikki it started raining and i turned on the wipers to hilarious effect i looked at nikki well do you listen to capital live mmm sometimes she said not looking at me yeah well exactly youre eighteen you should be part of our target audience what do you listen to anyway umm well they sort of come and go but i think theyre all illegal black stations from south of the river what kblak xmen chillharbour lane yeah and rough house precinct radio free peckham is that still going no it was closed down well frankly good for you for ignoring the usual commercial tat i was snatching glances at nikki to see if she was impressed that i knew all these cool illegal stations but she didnt seem to be not i added that many of them play much radiohead as i recall sadly no never mind radiohead are local where youre going bound to get loads of air time in oxford hmm she sounded distracted and when i glanced over she was looking at a clothes shop window i looked ahead again shit oh a blue car swept out of a side street right into the path of the courier in front of us i caught a brief glimpse of the car driver looking the wrong way and talking on his mobile the bike rider didnt have time to bail or brake just went whump into the bmw compacts wing the bike stood on its front wheel then clattered back to the raingreased street just in front of us files spilling from one pannier and skidding papers over the street and into the gutter the rider went sailing over the beemers bonnet as it braked and skidded to a stop he landed heavily on the road ahead sliding on his back a metre to hit the kerb hard with his helmet oh oh nikki was saying id pulled up hell probably be okay i told her quickly you just stay here she nodded she cleared some hair from her face with a trembling hand and pulled a mobile from her jacket as i opened the door should i phone for an ambulance she asked good idea i jumped out and ran past the whitefaced car driver just getting out still holding his mobile it crossed my mind to tell him what a fuckwit he was but i didnt a couple of people were already standing looking down at the black figure lying in the road he wasnt moving some kid in a puffa jacket was squatting by him doing something to his helmet just leave the helmet on yeah i said to the kid kneeling on the couriers other side and carefully lifting up his visor behind me somebody had the sense to turn off the fallen bikes engine which was more than id thought to do the courier was older than me grey beard glasses face pinched by the helmets foam padding he blinked fuck he said weakly how you doing there pal i asked him bit sore he croaked the rain was making little spots on his glasses he put his gloved hand up towards the helmets fastening i held on to it hold on hold on i said can you feel everything waggle your toes and stuff ah yeah yeah i think yeah im all right i think im all right breathings a bit what about the bike think youre going to need new forks shit fuck ah rats you a biker too eh yeah used to be he looked away to one side where i sensed more people standing and somebody approaching i turned round and saw the car driver the biker coughed and said wheezily if this cunt says sorry mate i didnt see you deck him for me will you nikki was beautifully bedraggled by the rain you didnt need to get out kid i told her she was trying to dry her hair with a small chamois leather the landys interior was trying to mist up the operator was asking me where the incident had taken place and i couldnt see the street names she explained then i thought id better stop the bikes engine well i think the guys going to be all right we did good we make a fine emergency team triples all round id left our details with the cops and the biker had been persuaded to take the ambulance he was still dazed and might have some broken ribs nikki had handed him the vfrs keys though the cops had taken them away again because they wanted them left with the machine she gave me back the chamois leather thanks youre welcome i used it on the windscreen blimey welcome to london eh oh do just say if you need a stiff drink or anything she shook her head no thanks yeah just straight home i think we continued north through the rain for highgate this is about what i think its about isnt it think so so what do you think that were going to get carpeted old son cripes biffo a rocket from the wingco eh what severe dressing down after you tallyfuckingho well here is an alternative fatwa women of islam judge your men and if they are bad kill them they oppress you and scorn you and yet they are frightened of you why else would they keep you from power and the sight of other men but you have power you have the power to judge whether your man is good or not ask yourself this would your husband kill another person just because they are jewish or american or something else people are simply born to be allah has let people be born these things would your man kill them for no other reason than the faith or the country they were born into by the will of allah if he would then he is a bad person and deserves death for he brings shame upon your faith and the name of allah when next he comes to you have a kitchen knife concealed beneath your bedclothes or a pair of scissors or even a penknife or a cartoncutter and slit his unworthy throat if you have no knife bite out his throat if you wish only to mutilate him use a knife or your teeth on his manhood but do we actually say debbie cottee our station manager used the remote to click off the dat machine on the other side of her light airy office she slid her glasses down her nose and looked at me with weary bleary blue eyes well hmm i dont know i said do you think were using too much compression on my voice ken but nobody phil said was actually saying that i mean there was a bit just before that where ken was saying that we didnt force muslim women in this country to wear miniskirts or bikinis whereas a western woman going to saudi has no choice but to conform to their dresscode the whole point is about toleration and intolerance and about public figures like religious leaders being allowed to pass what is in effect a death sentence without any sort of trial or defence on nationals of another country that was the whole point of putting the bit at the start pointing out that nobody in a position of responsibility in the west would say something like that is fucking irrelevant phil debbie said putting her glasses down on the surface of her desk which covered about the same area as our whole office her view from near the top of the mouth corp building was out over the square and the cluttered rooftops of soho towards the blunt pitted blade of centrepoint debbie was thirty but looked older she was fit in a chunky sort of way her hair was mousy brown and she had tired puckered eyes im not sure i see it as irrelevant at all really phil said with the air of an academic discussing some fine point of ancient etruscan property law or the historical basis of estimates for the yellow rivers siltdeposition rate during the hang dynasty the whole point is that you put a disclaimer at the beginning and the end youre not saying go and kill these people youre saying no one here is saying go and kill these people debbie glared at him thats just semantics no its grammar phil said appearing baffled that anybody could possibly think otherwise he looked briefly at me of course it was semantics rather than grammar i was almost positive but debbie who was certainly one of the more human execs in the mouth organisation in general and capital live in particular and not an ignoramus wasnt quite smart enough to feel confident arguing the toss over that at such moments i loved my producer phil debbie said slapping the surface of her desk her flatscreen monitor wobbled what if somebody what if a muslim person switches on just after your socalled disclaimer at the start of this this diatribe and then switches off totally fucking incensed as well they fucking might be if they can even believe their ears just before the end what the fuck are they going to think they just heard oh come on phil said thats like asking what if somebody hears the word country but switches off before the ry bit i mean its just one of those things he held his hands out thats one word this is a whole speech yes but its the principle phil insisted stubbornly debbie switched from phil to me ken she said even for you debbie i said holding up both hands as though in surrender were proving our own point here what about prejudice about bigotry how does insulting people do that how does the islamic council of churches screaming down the phone at me do anything to defeat bigotry youre just because we had the head rabbi screaming down the phone last month i pointed out the israelasaroguestate rant phil said nodding so fucking what debbie said loudly are you trying to claim that insulting two religions is somehow better than insulting one its being evenhanded i agreed its being bigoted towards ethnoreligious groupings she shouted it is arguably inciting religious and even racial hatred towards jews and muslims thats not fair i protested we insult christians too whenever we possibly can we did that whole week of christ as certifiable nutter but he was a jew debbie yelled and sacred to islam as well one stone three birds i yelled back whats the problem all abrahamic religions have been selectively targeted over time for trenchant robust but above all fair criticism phil put in i have the relevant records debbie looked from phil to me this isnt a fucking joke guys there are mosques synagogues being firebombed you sure phil said people being attacked because theyre middle eastern in appearance yeah i know i said shaking my head jesus sikhs have been attacked for being islamic terrorist sympathisers i spread my arms so proving the essential point here bigots are fuckwits the point debbie said exasperatedly is that some nasty little dickhead from the national front or the british national party could listen in to a programme of yours where you lay into the jewish people or the muslims and fucking cheer you on ken debbie slapped the desk again but softer this time she put her glasses back on and fixed her gaze on me now is that what you want this was actually a pretty good point and one that phil and i had worried over ourselves thats why we have to attack bigotry and stupidity everywhere i blustered if we stop now theyll be left thinking the last lot we went after were the definitive bad guys what debbie said looking over her glasses at me again fair enough this last assertion didnt make much sense even to me i think that is a fair point phil said nodding well here are another two points gentlemen debbie said sticking her glasses back up her face and pulling herself closer in towards her desk theres such a thing as this stations licence and the broadcasting standards authority there are also such things as our advertisers they pay all the fucking bills and they can pull their ads even faster than the bsa can pull our licence several already have but theyve been replaced phil said looking just a little red in the face now he took his glasses off for now at lesser rates debbie said steelily rates have been going down everywhere for the whole year phil protested he started polishing his glasses with a clean hanky new ones are always going to be lower than old ones in the current climate its some very important people some very vital advertisers have been having words with sir jamie debbie said through clenched teeth to our credit i thought at this point not one of the three of us even glanced towards the dear owners portrait on the wall at cocktail parties in his club at board meetings on the grouse moors at charity events over his mobile and his home phone he is not happy he is not happy to the extent that he is seriously weighing up which he needs most your show or his good name which do you think he will choose she sat back letting this sink in guys you run a reasonably successful programme for us but in the end its only ten hours of air time per week out of one hundred and sixtyeight sir jamies backed you until now ken phil but he cant let you jeopardise the station let alone the reputation of the mouth corporation or the goodwill hes built up from nothing over the last thirty years phil and i looked at each other jesus christ debs phil said shakily are you telling us to tone it down or are we sacked i mean what he put his glasses back on youre not sacked but its not just tone it down its make amends make amends i squawked this attacking islam and judaism in particular has to be reversed so we can attack christianity i suggested debbie glared at me what i said holding out both hands weve got the perfect thing phil announced just like that i did probably the first genuine doubletake id ever done in my entire life we have phil nodded ken doesnt know about this yet he told debbie i dont suggestion came in just yesterday from the breaking news people i just managed to prevent myself saying it did the new channel four thing debbie asked eyes narrowed yeah their competitor for newsnight phil said werent they trying to poach paxman for that i think so but he wasnt having it last rumour i heard was their main presenters would be cavan luttonjames and beth laing shes on sky isnt she contract coming up for renewal anyway debbie said waving one hand anyway phil said theyre still doing dummy programmes at the moment but they start for real on monday and they want something hardhitting and controversial something thatll get them headlines i thought they just wanted me to practise on in one of these dummy programmes i said stupidly i realised as soon as id closed my mouth again it was entirely possible phil was winging it here they did at first phil said i persuaded them otherwise they want ken for the monday programme debbie asked if we can get the terms right phil said debbie could probably see the surprise on my face youre not kens fucking agent phil this was true though he sometimes acted like one my real agent the longsuffering paul complained that thanks to my to him incomprehensibly bizarre political fastidiousness what i needed was an antiagent somebody who would look for brilliantly remunerative work i could then cheerfully turn down in fact he said aside from contract negotiation time at the station all i really needed was an answering machine that shouted no i mean the terms of control over content and the people involved phil explained patiently i didnt want ken going in there thinking he was about to do a short piece of light relief about mike technique or something and then being confronted with half a dozen swiveleyed fanatics representing all the different brands of fundamentalists weve upset over the last year thats the sort of thing that can happen and i just wanted to make sure it wouldnt why is ken looking like well like that she gestured at me like what i thought i tried to look businesslike and unperturbed phil glanced my way then said look this is something ken and i talked about weve had too many dodgy manipulative offers for tv appearances for him in the past either theyre too trashy to be worth considering in the first place or they sound really interesting and we get all fired up about it then it falls through or they change their mind or it turns out there was some hidden agenda we agreed that id handle these proposals until there was something worth taking to ken then wed talk about it phil glanced at his watch if it hadnt been for this meeting wed be doing just that right now he said happily he didnt add in the pub he looked at me sorry to land this on you like this ken i waved a hand so debbie said still sounding and looking suspicious what are you proposing that we give them something hardhitting and controversial phil said debbie still looked deeply dubious but i could see she was interested which would be what one of their ideas is to get ken to debate with a genuine holocaust denier a guy from the extremeright aryan christian movement who claims the allies built the death camps after the war phil said all three of us exchanged looks i wasnt so sure about that he added but well maybe given what youve been saying about the perceived if mistaken bias against the jewish and muslim faiths that would be the way to go after all he turned from debbie to me obviously only if you feel comfortable with the idea ken im still not sure about it frankly oh im comfortable with it i said a fucking holocaust denier somebody from the extreme christian right prepared to put themselves up for a tonguelashing what selfrespecting militant liberal wouldnt want to get their teeth into one of those fucks debbies eyes were so narrow they were almost closed why do i feel that this might just be a good idea she asked slowly and yet we seem to have come back to the original totally facile and childish proposal that the way out of all this was to insult christians some more oh come on phil said with a laugh in his voice this guys christian like satan is christian the point is hes wildly antisemitic and hes mad articulate but mad kenll be seen defending you sure this guys mad debbie asked well he agrees with the idea currently gaining ground in sections of arab society phil said in the sort of slow considered voice that told me he felt back in control here that the september eleventh attacks were organised by the international zionist conspiracy to discredit islam and give sharon carte blanche against the palestinians but its okay he hates the arabs too this guy has a consistent belief system totally based around race religion and sexuality nordicaryan christianstraight equals good everything else is just shades of evil who is he whats his name his name is lawson umm briarley or something i was only half listening it was while phil was talking about this that i thought of it my big idea i knew what i was going to do if they did let me onto the show with that antisemitic fuck i knew exactly what i was going to do to him it was perfect mad bad and dangerous to contemplate and it probably meant i was a bit mad too but hey fire with fire my mouth went dry and my palms felt suddenly pinpricked with sweat oh fuck i thought what a sweet beautiful terrifying idea did i really dare okay im going to have to consult on this debbie announced i clicked back to reality debs was going to kick it upstairs sensible woman fine by me phil said he looked at me and i nodded but we need a decision by friday at the very latest tomorrow would be better well have one debbie said she pushed back on her desk her big black leather executive chair rolling over the wooden floor we were excused obviously debbie i said getting up what i want you to make it very clear to whoever else you talk to about this that i really want to do it i mean really want to do it i think its important phil looked at me with a frown then smiled at debbie ill let you know she said in the meantime i think wed all really appreciate it if you avoided offending any major ethnic or religious groups could you do that for us we can certainly try phil said merrily fuck no its okay phil said as we walked away down a broad corridor lined with framed plaques discs awards and letters of thanks and endorsement none of which were mine this is a feature not a bug you werent making any of that up in there were you phil grinned course not you silly sod sod which i was under the impression had dropped off most peoples list of plausible invective around about the early seventies was phils most powerful expletive ill call the breaking news people before we hit the pub he frowned at me as we stepped into the lift didnt realise youd be quite so keen i wasnt going to tell him about my idea best if he didnt know for his own sake apart from anything else yeah well i said keen ken thats what they call me no they dont three downriver uptown what i said was these nambypamby holocaust revision people didnt go remotely far enough it wasnt just the holocaust that didnt happen it wasnt just the death camps that were faked the whole of the second world war is a myth occupation of paris battle of britain north african campaign convoys and uboats barbarossa stalingrad kursk thousandbomber raids dday fall of berlin singapore pearl harbor midway hiroshima and nagasaki none of it happened all special effects and lying guys of a certain age you remember thinking how close those airfix spitfires and lancasters looked to the real thing you saw in the film footage thats because they were just models too all the old airfields the concrete tank traps a few socalled bombsites they were built after the war the girl looked uncertain then she laughed thats insane i clinked her glass thats the point and besides i said what sort of chickenshit neonazis are these people anyway they should be saying sure we killed six million wish it had been more not splitting hairs about whether it was one million or two million and whining about the fucking führer being misunderstood you dont actually believe any of this do you though are you mad i cackled of course not im taking the piss out of fascist fuckwits so is this what this tv things about yeah theyre going to get one of these nutters for me to debate with should people like that really be allowed to say that sort of stuff on national tv though ask channel four that not me i said drinking up but yes i think they should you cant hide that poisonous shit away for ever itll come out somewhere better to face it and squash it i want it out in the open i want to know who these people are i want to know where they live i finished my drink thats why these cowardly little shits love the internet they can post any sort of hatefilled drivel they want with no comeback because online they can hide its the perfect medium for bullies liars and cowards we were in the golden bough our usual aftershow drinking hole in hollen street the bough was a basic central london pub one of those places neither flattered nor insulted to be called a boozer not fashionable rarely crowded to the point of standingroom only save on a friday evening and saturday night reasonable juke box basic unpretentious food only one gaming machine tucked out of the way under the stairs to the small firstfloor function bar and a solid unadventurous choice of drink there was no particular crowd associated with the place instead you got a smattering of all sorts in the bough workmen in dusty boots and paintspecked overalls advertising creatives theatre types tourists office workers music people film people homeless guys nursing a half and keeping warm waiting staff from restaurants and posher bars one or two girls from the sex shows and us there was one dealer who used the place though for a quiet drink not for dealing a couple of cops stuck their heads round the door about once a month or so the manageress was clara a brusquely rotund nononsense halfportuguese grandmother with a dry wheezy laugh and sixtyaday habit nobody we know has ever seen her without one of two turbanlike things on her head one green one yellow and there was a longstanding variableodds potbet which has allegedly been running with a rolling roster of regulars for over twenty years concerning whether she was bald underneath there or not last time id checked it had been for slapheadedness and id stood to make a fiver if it turned out she wasnt can i get you a drink whatll it be oh thanks wkd blue cheers i havent asked you your name i said to the girl as i signalled to clara tanya she stuck her hand out ken pleased to meet you tanya tanya had overheard phil and me talking about the breaking news thing earlier id seen her staring brows pinched at us and she hadnt looked away when id stared back id guessed shed picked up an alarming selection of racehateassociated buzzwords and was thinking about either walking out or throwing her drink at us and then running its okay id said to her past phils shoulder were both nice liberals really and this is genuinely one of those rare occasions when it honestly isnt as bad as it sounds tanya was quarter jewish which was one reason she had been taking offence at what shed thought shed been overhearing she worked for a film company in wardour street i could be pretty sure of this because phil had grilled her about the film industry albeit subtly for a few minutes phil had this paranoid theory that unscrupulous tabloid journalists had realised we drank in the bough that they thought we were worth exposing in some way and were likely to send somebody here to coax me into saying something i might regret thinking i was talking off the record to a civilian when in fact it was an undercover journo and i was very much on the record given what i say when i know im on record and on air this seems a fairly bizarre fear but there you are anyway tanya seemed to pass phils hostilejourno filter and he lost interest in her when our production team and assistant gaggle walked in tanya was short and slim and dark and always moving sort of half dancing swaying to and fro seemingly without really knowing she was doing it rhythmic and slow like an underwater plant in a meandering rivers languorous undercurrent id seen girls doing this before in situations like this and it often meant they were loved up but i didnt think she was she had wide greygreen eyes and hair in little black spikes we ended up with the others from our show and a couple of people from timmy manns the one after ours though not the boy mann himself it turned into a moderately serious drinking session all sat round our favourite circular table in one end corner of the bough i was getting on i thought awfully well with tanya who laughed at all my jokes and touched me on the forearm a couple of times id been supposed to meet up with jo that night and take in a film but jo had to cancel yet another addicta crisis and id started thinking that maybe i should see how things progressed with tanya instead tanya was drinking her blue wkds very slowly and i had moved on to whiskies after a couple of pints of fullers but for the past two scotches id been cheating when nobody was looking id lower the short glass towards the floor and upend it letting the drink fall onto the ancient and already pretty tacky carpet underneath jeez they were single twentyfive mill measures with no water probably evaporated before they made it to the floor but the point was they werent getting me drunk if anything did develop with the lovely tanya id be in a fit state to appreciate it all in vain tanya had to go at six to meet some friends and would not be dissuaded i even followed her to the door of the pub and out onto the street she gave me her mobile number and disappeared into the twilight heading for tottenham court road underground station i sighed as i watched her go looking at the display on my motorola where her number still glowed the phones screen went dark and i went back inside our drinking party started to break up as people went off to catch trains tubes and buses phil and i decided on takeaways from the taj our local curry house round the corner from the bough then went our separate ways i felt sober enough to drive but i knew i wasnt so i left the landy in the mouth corp car park and got a minicab home suffering a lecture on the superior qualities of wholesome caribbean soul food compared to this highly suspect indopakistani fare from geoff the jamaican driver i always seemed to end up with whenever i was clutching a carrier bag full of curry or a leaking parcel stuffed with doner kebab me car gonna stink now mon heres an extra fiver my good fellow wave it around and it should help disperse the ghastly subcontinental pong geoff thought this was so funny he lit a big spliff as he drove off down lots road cackling and trailing clouds of ganja smoke sometimes i told people i lived in a tied cottage the houseboat at chelsea wharf used to be one of sir jamies pads in the city back when he was basically trying to be richard branson sir jamie even had a supposedly trademark beard back then too though he switched to a ponytail and earring shortly afterwards surrendering the high ground of facial fuzz to the bearded one the temple belle was an old and muchconverted coaster it still belonged to mouth corp but it was rented to me at an extremely reasonable rate i was on a pretty good contract since id shifted to the latemorning show and i could probably have afforded the rent or mortgage if id had to pay the market rate for the tub but getting it cheap certainly made an appreciable and very pleasant difference though it did as phil had been the first to point out give sir jamie an extra hold over me if i lost the day job i lost the cool houseboat and chelsea address too the temple belle was riding high on the flood tide as i walked down the jetty past the other houseboats music and light came from a couple of them upriver where the breeze was coming from seeded with light rain a train grumbled across battersea railway bridge nearer the towering façade of the chelsea reach development glittered with a cheesy opulence the river was silent and traffic pretty much inaudible the high tide meant there was no awful smell the main drawback of living on the boat was that at low tide especially on a hot summers day the revealed mud smelled of ancient shit and things long dead probably because that was exactly what it was despite the rain and my empty belly i hesitated by the old wheelhouse with the door keys in one hand and the slowly cooling curry in the other looking out at the dark water for what turned into a minute or two feeling a little lonely all of a sudden and then in my defence almost immediately a bit ashamed for feeling sorry for myself the gentle background roar of the unsleeping city filled the sodiumstained skies and i stood listening for the rivers dark liquidic music in vain from my parents house in helensburgh thirty kilometres down the north bank of the clyde from glasgow i could see the river from my bedroom i grew up watching the distant cranes of greenock gradually disappear as the shipyards closed to be replaced later by offices shops housing developments and leisure facilities by then wed moved to glasgow itself to be near my fathers new dental practice in the city centre our firstfloor flat in the leafy south side was big my brother iain and i had rooms easily twice the size of those wed had in the bungalow in helensburgh but the outlook was to the broad treelined street the parked cars and the tall red sandstone tenements like ours on the far side i missed the view of river and hill more than id expected i met jo on a river cruise one sticky summer night ceel in sir jamies glittering new penthouse at limehouse tower during a storm youre the guy did that cat stevens cover didnt you get sued late summer i was still doing the capital live premidnight programme at the time and had been talking to my then producer near the stern of the little river cruise boat we had been watching the metallic shells of the thames barrier pass each one like a sinking ship upended the last of the sunsets ruby light flaring from their summits when this crophaired blond semigoth with lots of facial metalwork barged in between us producer vic stepped back to give her room looked the girl up and down decided i probably didnt mind being interrupted by her raised his eyebrows at me and wandered off i did a bit of entirely justifiable sizingup myself the girl was all in black dms jeans scoopnecked vest batteredlooking bikers jacket off one shoulder about midtwenties i wasnt exactly sued i said warily wondering if i was talking to a journalist there was an exchange of lawyers letters that seemed to cost as much as serious litigation but we managed to avoid an actual writ right the girl nodded vigorously oh jo lepage she said holding out a hand to shake while nodding back towards the glass superstructure of the boat where music thudded and impressivetenyearsago disco lights flashed im with ice house she explained the record company youre ken nott the dj right right i shook her hand right what was that song rushdie and son uhhuh but the tune was mostly moonshadow ha right what was it im being shadowed by a fundamentalist she sang huskily but in tune nearly i said it was im being stalked by a fundamentalist i think im being shadowed i spoke rather than sang the lyrics i was still feeling wary of the girl just because she said she was from the record company didnt mean she really was i had already given at least one interview without knowing it one drunken lovedup night to a girl in a club who turned out to be a reporter for a tabloid with a dreadfully unreconstructed attitude to drugs and drugtaking the resulting interview had nearly got me fired and started an argument between capital live and the paper about whether shed told me she was a reporter at the start of our conversation or not id claimed she hadnt but it was just possible she had and id not been listening because i was too busy grinding my teeth and staring at her tits jo had rather impressive breasts too not large but high and braless beneath her top the deck lights strung above us showed her nipples as little sharply defined bumps raising the thin black cotton yeah she said i heard it at a party once never did get hold of a copy well id love to ah provide you with one i said grinning but i dont even have a copy myself any more sorry she said smiling i wasnt trying to blag one she pushed her hand through her spiky blond hair exposing inkdark roots in an unselfconsciously endearing gesture and looked back briefly at the main party what do you do at ice house i asked her she shrugged bit of a r bit of what my boss calls asset management looking after bands anyone i might have heard of hope so addicta heard of them yeah heard the hype certainly she shook her head emphatically not hype they are really good right i saw an interview with them the lead singer seemed a bit full of himself she grinned and your point would be i smiled yeah i guess it kind of comes with the territory theyre okay she said the band brad can sound arrogant but hes just being honest in a way hes good and he knows it and he isnt into false modesty wohno i agreed i dont think hell ever be accused of that she looked around so enjoying the cruise no i sighed i hate these things i said to her quizzical expression well apart from what happened to the marchioness i always feel trapped you cant get off a normal party or gig or do you can always bale out and head for the door one of these things youre along for the whole ride whether youre totally bored or well the opposite of bored a couple of times ive met somebody and ah you know been getting on exceptionally well with them ah a female somebody a female somebody of the complementary gender of choice indeed and weve suddenly found ourselves in an ungregarious mood and wanted to be somewhere together just the two of us and well weve had a very frustrating wait for the end of the cruise she smiled widely and took a bottle of beer from one jacket pocket you make a habit of picking up women on these cruises just twice so far of course you could always have joined the metreunder club or whatever youd call it fucking in the loos in the boat you know i said frowning as though this had just occurred to me ive never known a relationship that started in a toilet last very long odd that hmm why are you looking at me like that beg your pardon counting your piercings uhhuh uhhuh seven that i can see ha she said and hoisted her tshirt to show a belly button neatly cinched with a little boneshaped metal rod eight i said she drank and wiped her lips with the back of one hand left her mouth hanging open her tongue running along the inside of her lower teeth as she nodded and made an obvious job of measuring me up nine altogether she said and performed a little movement that made me think at first she was taking a bow then i realised she was making as though to look down at herself my i said must be fun going through airport metal detectors her brows furled a little everybody says that she shrugged not a problem well thats airport securitys loss youre not into piercings what can i say im a fully paidup hetero male i grinned a hoisted eyebrow made it look like she took the second meaning she glanced back at the lights of the boat again her facial metalwork glinting hey she said you want to dance gee i thought youd never ask we didnt join the metreunder club or whatever shed called it we waited a whole extra hour and had boisterous energetic sex back on another boat my new home the temple belle i found the ninth piercing whoo rock the fucking boat man i woke in the depths of the night my arm gone to sleep beneath her the temple belle rested on some notquiteperfectlylevel mud at the bottom of the tide so that you could to that minimal extent tell what the state of the tide was even at night down in the main bedroom with the skylight curtains closed by the presence or absence of a faint sensation of being tipped towards the head of the bed i had that feeling now i took a deep breath testing for the smell of decay that sometimes infected the air on summer nights like this born of the mud and capable on really warm still nights like this of insinuating its way even down here nothing just her perfume the girl slept on sprawled half across me muttering quietly in her sleep she liked to talk during sex too and she liked being bitten well nipped really but fairly hard she professed herself amazed that i didnt share this predilection she made a strange little exhaling noise in her sleep like an exasperated sigh then snuggled up closer to me and fell still and silent breathing slowly and regularly just visible in the glow from the radio alarm a little plastic canister rested on the bedside table her party contacts jo wore fashion contact lenses that made her eyes seem to fluoresce under ultraviolet light dancing with her on the cruise boat with its dated lighting rig had been interesting looking carefully at her face i could just make out the soft reflections from some of the surgical steel piercings that punctuated her skin i didnt mind in the least if people wanted to get tattoos or prick their bodies with bits of metal was it better worse or no different from having a facelift or collagen implants or liposuction or botox injections i didnt know but the more you thought about it the more shoving lumps of metal through your skin did seem a slightly odd thing to do the lengths we go to to differentiate ourselves i thought but then people had earrings and metal fillings in their teeth and there were much weirder things like the tribe that put more and more rings round the girls necks as they grew until they were extended to such a length that if the rings were taken off their necks just collapsed and they died jo was fun uv contacts and all wed already established we were both between serious relationships which kind of implied we were both ready to start a new one wed see guest in your country sir and i could not believe that which i was hearing here in the city of london was not really coming out of kabul or baghdad i could not believe my ears i had to look around and reassure myself i was in a london cab not mr hecht where the hell do you people get off dear god man we lost four thousand people in a morning every one of them innocent civilians this is war dont you understand that its time to wake up its time to choose sides when the president said that youre either for us or against us he spoke for all decent americans your mr blairs chosen which side hes on and wed like to think he speaks for all decent english people but i dont know what side you think youre on it sure doesnt sound like ours mr hecht if the choice is between american democracy and murderous misogynists and a state governed by diktat and sharia believe me i am on your side id shop id turn in my own brother if i knew hed had anything to do with the attacks on september the eleventh mr hecht i know it doesnt sound like it usually and im sure it didnt sound like it to you when you heard me yesterday but theres a lot about america i love i love its freedoms its celebration of free speech its love of betterment it is still the land of opportunity i know that theres no greater place on earth to be young and smart and healthy and ambitious a lot of us brits affect to be appalled so few americans have passports but ive been to the states ive travelled all over it and i know why they dont america is a world in itself the states are like countries the sheer scale of the place its variety of climate and landscape its stunning it is truly beautiful and is there any nation and ethnic group in the world not represented in the states americans dont have to go out into the world the worlds already come to them and you can understand why i still have a lot of issues i have a problem with anybody who voted for the man claiming to be your president for example but then as not all americans are eligible to vote and half of those who were eligible to vote didnt bother to vote and less than half of those who did vote voted for dubya that means i guess im probably only appalled by about twenty per cent or less of the population which is not so terrible but these are like the issues you have with a family member you love they only matter so much because youre so close to them in the first place my point is that in your anger and your pain youre your government is making a series of awful mistakes mistakes that will damage america damage all of us in the future and i do not want to see that well this is like listening to two different people sir i dont know how you square what youre saying now with what you said yesterday mr hecht im saying that theres a kind of madness built up about this already a denial that benefits nobody no thats not true it will benefit the sort of people who did this your denial will benefit your enemies if you dont understand this if you dont understand them youll never defeat them so believing that america was attacked out of jealousy is not just ludicrous and selfdeluding its selfdefeating as well this was not an act of grossly overdeveloped petulance for gods sake twenty highly motivated men do not train for months to kill themselves in a meticulously planned and executed operation that the biggest bestfunded security services in the world dont get the faintest whiff of even though its happening right under their noses because youve got more domestic appliances than they do what was the phrase its the economy stupid well in this case its the foreign policy its that damn simple it doesnt even matter if you or i dont see it this way mr hecht but to them its every corrupt undemocratic regime the united states has poured money and arms into since the last world war propping up dictators because theyre sitting on a desert full of oil and helping them crush dissent its the infidel occupying their holy places and its the unending oppression of the palestinian people by americas fiftyfirst state thats the way they see it you can argue with their analysis but dont kid yourself any of this happened because theyre just jealous of your shopping malls damn right id argue with their analysis so are you now trying to say you are on our side may i refer my honourable friend to the answer given above im sorry no im sorry mr hecht a piece of british parliamentary phraseology we use on the show sometimes look mr hecht do i think you should invade afghanistan for what its worth and its worth almost nothing i realise that no but when you do it couldnt happen to a nicer regime ive been banging on about the taliban for years but dont forget you helped put them there you funded the mujahidin and you armed bin laden and supported the pakistani security service like you once supported the dictator saddam hussein because you needed him and like youre supporting the dictator general musharraf and the grotesque mediaeval despotism of the saudis now because you need them meanwhile new missile defense which destroys arms limitation treaties with pinpoint precision but is utterly guaranteed to have no discernible effect on any enemy missile whatsoever which needs a homing beacon in the nose of its target to miss it in the same hemisphere and which after september the eleventh has been proved to be an even more wilful and irrelevant waste of money is a hundred per cent certain to happen i mean this is madness mr hecht its national psychosis we have a right to defend ourselves sir we had that right before nineeleven now we have the right to demand it and were going to have it whether it suits people like you or not if you want to be part of it fine but if youre not part of the solution youre part of the problem you know something mr hecht back when i was a teenager just starting to think for myself i came up with a very basic formulation i decided that whenever somebody says youre either for us or against us you had to be against them because only moral simpletons and outright conniving rogues see or even claim to see the world in such preposterously black and white terms i am deeply dubious about being on the same side as anybody that stupid or that disingenuous and certainly will not be led by them evil always starts with a good excuse mr hecht george w bush may be in effect president by acclaim now and compared to the people who attacked america hes personally almost blameless but the fact remains he got where he is by chicanery and deceit and not even very deep down hes a sad inadequate little man go to hell sir as you surely will mr hecht hung up think we lost him notty i took a deep breath that is your single deployment of that word for this year phillywilly us embassy on line one oh stop it youre killing me ken great to meet you come in come in ah yes let this delightful young lady take your coat nice to meet you ah jamie call me jamie no standing on ceremony here come on in to the body of the kirk as they say i have scotch blood too you know us heelanders have to stick together against these sassenachs eh listen were all really excited about you joining us at capital live i hear youre doing incredibly well caught you a few times myself wish it was more schedules meetings business you know but ive heard you i have heard you very good very good very near the bone very near the bone but i like that thats my style too edge work nothing like it is there the danger the risk risktaking thats what its all about isnt it dont you think so how are you settling into the old temple belle ah very nicely i said i hesitated wondering whether to point out that id been settled in there for over a year brill superb superb ah helena like you to meet ken ken nott ken this is my wife the lovely helena ah drinks excellent excellent ken champagne lady werthamley i said nodding to her thank you sir jamie werthamley our dear owner had a penthouse in the top two storeys of his own newest office building limehouse tower overlooking the river at limehouse reach this was april and id been working for him for nearly a year by then three months of that on the relatively prestigious latemorning show but this one of his birthday parties was my first chance to meet him strictly no presents the invitation had said which might have seemed superfluous for a man who owned several gold mines a bank a caribbean archipelago and his own airline anyway id happily complied sir jamie was a younglooking fifty ginger going grey the trademark ponytail was long gone but the single diamond stud in his ear was still there he was dressed casually in designer jeans a white tshirt and a blue jacket that looked glossily fine and very expensive id dressed in my best smartbutcasual but i felt like a tyke next to him there were maybe a hundred people in the sunken space of the main room which famously had been fashioned by a filmset designer the room held the crowd easily i had my coat whisked away by what looked like one supermodel and a glass of dark gold champagne slipped into my fist by another before id really had a chance to draw breath sir jamie was the touchyfeely sort taking your hand cradling your elbow patting your back gentlepunching upper arm all that stuff and all the time talking in that intense breathily enthusiastic manner words only just getting out of each others way in time in that respect he was exactly the same as when he was interviewed on tv his wife sat upright and poised in a tall hightech wheelchair lady w had suffered a bad fall horseriding ten years earlier not long after they were married she wore something blue and gauzy and a few shimmering pieces of diamond and platinum jewellery she was maybe ten years younger than her husband and had raven black hair and violet eyes call me helena please she said letting go of my hand thank you helena she turned the wheelchair round using a little joystick at her right hand and moved it towards the steps down into the sunken part of the room i listen to your show ken she said over her shoulder as i walked after her thank you you are terribly outspoken arent you thats my job helena i said as lady ws chair got to the top of the steps and stopped you do upset a lot of people im afraid i do a lot of important people in fact guilty as charged maam i agreed i know quite a lot of those people i id be surprised if you didnt i said evenly she snorted in a very english public schoolgirl way and looked up at me winking yes well keep up the good work now who shall we find for you to talk to she surveyed the room i did too the space itself was very swoopy and primary coloured it did look like a film set actually it looked like the bad guys lair in an austin powers film which was a funny thing to spend a couple of million quid on but there you were the windows facing south and west were three metres tall and easily fifteen long great slabs of darkness sprinkled with the lights of london there were a lot of famous faces from i guessed at the time pretty much every walk of life that led to people getting their faces into the papers or onto tv apart from crime actually i was wrong about the crime bit i imagined that the people i didnt recognise were just plain rich or powerful in a lowprofile way or both and realised there was a decent chance that i was the least important person in the whole apartment with the notagiven exception of the supermodelresembling serving staff ah said mrs w decisively you might be interested to meet ann and david schuyler she teaches political philosophy at the lse and hes a tribune group stalwart come on the wheelchair lurched forward and using a rotating threewheel setup at each corner descended slowly motors whirring to the dark red carpet below the schuylers were charming and fascinating and interesting to talk to and i chatted to various other people who were all or most of those things during the course of the evening and passed some pleasant time with a formula one driver a junior minister who was about fifteen years older than me but still amazingly attractive and who had an even more amazing eyewatering contempt for her minister and a beautiful young actress whose name i could still recall weeks later but whose personality entirely escaped me i drank the champagne and sampled some of the meltinthemouth food circulating on silver salvers borne high by the catwalkgrade serving staff and fascinating as all this felt at the time the only thing that came to mean anything eventually was meeting celia later i had already seen her as i made my way back from the loo head for the monet and then hang a right at the picasso as sir jamie himself had instructed me she was standing with a smallish pale man who was dressed in a severely tailored black suit listening while he talked quietly to a rotund lord who owned a national daily and a few regional titles she wore short heels that brought her nearly up to his height of about centimetres and a long black highnecked dress a single string of large greyblack pearls skin like milky coffee she looked mixedrace a combination of white and black and maybe southeast asian too pushed id have guessed she was in her midtwenties but her face was extraordinary it gave the impression that it belonged to either a teenager who had seen some terrible things in her short existence or a sixtyyearold whod never had a days trauma or a single ageing event in her entire life there was a sort of intense calmness to her features an almost wilful innocence that i couldnt recall ever having seen before it seemed almost identical to the poised serenity of a secure untroubled child and yet profoundly different something struggled for and arrived at rather than inherited rather than bestowed her eyes were amber beneath fine sculpts of dark brows and a forehead like a smooth and perfect bowl and there was a roundness to her mouth and eyes that swept into elongated lines at the outside edges contributing to that expression of thousandyard tranquillity her hair was gathered up full and shining immaculate it was the colour of heroin her gaze slid straight over me as i passed a few metres away in pursuit of some more of that very pleasant champagne i didnt recognise her or the man at her side who looked a bit like bernie ecclestone with no glasses and better hair though i did see him leaving an hour later without her but with a blond guy so wide and tall he just had to be a bodyguard a storm had been advancing on london from the west since the vividly bloody sunset hours earlier the party was in full swing by the time it hit but aside from a distant roar if you stood near the windows and the swirling patterns of rain whirling over the westfacing glass it was easy to miss i headed towards the monet again ready to turn right at the picasso but there was already somebody in the bathroom sir jamie clutching a thinnecked bottle of krug and in the company of a pair of giggling young soap stars stopped and said ken queue walk this way show you another pissoir mi casa and all that oh fancy a game of snooker afterwards were missing oh i tell a lie no were not he said as a sort of vapidly handsome young man i recognised from a boy band came clumsily down some spiral stairs to our right beg your pardon ken offer suddenly and embarrassingly withdrawn hiya sammy sir jamie said grinning and slapped the young man on the arm he turned to me and nodded to the spiral stairs ken up there or theres a lift of course either way follow your nose ha ha see you later have fun then to the girls and the young man right and off they went i walked up the stairs then along a broad deeply carpeted corridor lined with art windows at the far end gave out onto a view east to the millennium dome crowned with a circlet of red highbuilding lights i couldnt find any open doors so i shrugged and chose adventurously the one doubleset i could see a suitably large bedroom the size of a tennis court presented itself and i crossed to where i guessed the en suite might be it was a gym but far away on the other side of the room was the bathroom it really did have a little lidded ceramic pissoir fastened to the wall as well as an ordinary loo two sinks the size of small baths a vast sunken bath studded with nozzles lights and underwater speakers a colossal shower cabinet with marginally more nozzles than the bath and a sauna the size of a log cabin it felt slightly pathetic only to do a pee in this palace of evacuation exfoliation and immersion like using a mclaren f as a golf cart i stood there looking around and realised that this was probably just sir jamies bathroom there was no special facility to help a disabled person use the place it was all immaculate save for a poorly wipedclean area on a glass shelf where a few tiny white crystals lay scattered i lifted some to my tongue with a fingertip and tasted cocaine moderately heavily cut so surely not sir jamies probably sammy the clumsy boy bandee about to quit the bedroom i saw the curtains that filled one wall move at the edge and felt a hint of a draught brush my face i hesitated then tentatively pulled the curtains back the view was to the northeast over a terrace cut diagonally across the towers summit shrubs and small trees in giant pots swayed in the wind and the surfaces of ornamental pools ruffled as the gusts stroked and struck them the sliding pane at this edge of the giant window had been left open a fingerwidth i wondered if i ought to close it if the wind changed but so what sir jamie probably had a butler or a majordomo or whatever the hell to do this sort of stuff i was going to let the curtain fall back and just leave things as they were when i caught a glimpse of a figure in the shadows near one edge of the terrace where thin straight railings segmented the view lightning much later i thought it ought to have been lightning that lit the scene that it had been that sort of storm and when i first saw her standing there it was courtesy of a flash of lightning which lit up the mysterious figure in the shadows but it wasnt just the lights of the stormpressed city sometimes reality isnt gothic enough i could see it was a woman standing about four metres away in the lee of the building under a roof projecting over part of the garden the shelter was only partial i could see her being buffeted by the swirling gusts she looked thin and frail and dark her arms were crossed under her breasts the wind tugged at the hem of her long dress and as my eyes adjusted i could see little strands of her hair whipping about her face and flickering up about her head like quick attenuated flames i realised she was probably aware that somebody was watching her a sliver of light had fallen across the paving stones at her feet when id pulled the curtains back just as she turned her head to look straight at me she stood like that for a moment then her head tipped to one side i recognised the woman in the narrow black dress with the extraordinary face i couldnt see her eyes even then in theory i could just have let the drapes fall back and toddled off downstairs tipsily descending to the party but you come upon opportunities little chance setups like this too seldom even without having read about scenes like this or watched them in films and on tv even if youd never read anything or watched anything in your life there would be a kind of imperative of the moment that required you to behave in a certain way take advantage of the presented chance because to do anything else was just to declare yourself terminally sad or maybe i had swallowed sir jamies chummy bullshit about being a fellow risktaker in any event what i did was slide my hand into the gap between the windows and their frames and push the heavy glass panel aside hello she said her voice barely audible over the roar of the wind youll catch your death you know i beg your pardon i raised my voice your death i said almost shouting i was already feeling foolish the grand gesture of the occasion evaporating shredded by the noise and force of the wind youll catch it yes she said as though this was new and important information id presented her with gawd i thought shes some sort of simpleton look i said will i just i gestured back into the bedroom meaning to suggest id leave her to whatever solitary communing with rooftop nature shed been indulging in she tipped and lowered her head holding one hand to an ear she shook her head shit i said under my breath and stepped out onto the stones well what else was i going to do she was beautiful the guy shed been with had left the hooha without her i was thirtyfive and starting to watch my weight and check my hair for grey each morning and i wasnt so entangled elsewhere that i couldnt handle the potential extra complication of getting tangled up with a woman who looked as good as she did providing she wasnt simple and unlikely as it probably was anyway rain sprinkled itself across my face and the wind uncombed my hair ken nott pleased to meet you i held out my hand she looked at it for a moment then took it in hers celia merrial she said how do you do her voice was soft with a faint accent that was probably french you okay out here i asked yes is it all right sorry for me to be here is it all right it is permitted with a sinking feeling i realised that she hadnt recognised me from earlier down in the party it sounded like she thought i was a security guard for mouth corp come to shoo her back to the properly appointed funhaving territory down below havent the faintest idea i admitted civilian here myself this wasnt leading anywhere make excuses and leave this was preposterously early to be baling out of a potential situation but some sort of instinct i would usually ignore was telling me to forget it listen i said if youre okay ill just leave you to it i just you know i saw you out here and i wasnt even handling my withdrawal gracefully she ignored this her head was canted to one side again quizzical she frowned and said ah i know your name do you now you are on the radio she said brushing away a strand of hair sticking to her mouth she had a small mouth and full lips someone said you would be here her teeth were very white as she gave a little tentative smile i listen to you that was me hooked as far as my ego was concerned she might as well have claimed to be my biggest fan at the same time a tiny crease of disappointment ruffled my contentment intelligent rich overachieving and wildly influential though i naturally assumed all my listeners to be there was something insufficiently exotic for a woman like this to be listening to my popraddled commercialchoked show on daytime radio between the hours of ten and midday this woman ought to be perfecting her technique playing bach fugues on her grand piano or wandering the galleries clutching a draft of her thesis standing in front of vast canvases nodding wisely she should be a radio three type i told myself certainly not listening to any radio station with an exclamation mark in its title im sorry you fall beneath the acceptable standards of intriguingness that my overheated and deeply wretched romantic sensibilities demand very groucho altogether sad git im very flattered i told her are you why i gave a small laugh a gust of wind thudded into us showering us with rain and making us sway together as if dancing to the pummelling music of the storm oh im just always flattered when i meet somebody who admits to listening to my terminally facile and disposable show and you is it really so she said do you really think it is facile and disposable i had been going to say something on the lines of and you are the most stunningly beautiful creature at this party largely composed of stunningly beautiful creatures which makes your interest in me especially gratifying but instead she was having the temerity to interrupt a professional talker and taking my small talk seriously didnt know which was worse well it can certainly be facile i said and when it comes down to it it is just local radio even if its local radio for london noam chomsky it aint you admire noam chomsky she said nodding and stroking away another strand of hair from her mouth the wind was howling round the building scattering rain drops over the two of us it was april and not too cold but there was still a fair amount of windchill factor happening here you have mentioned him a few times i think i held up my hands closest thing to a hero i have i folded my arms you really do listen to the show dont you sometimes you say such things i am always amazed that you get away with what you do so often i think they wont let him get away with that and yet next time i switch on there you are we do call the studio the departure lounge she said smiling i know she nodded the wind hit her in the back making her take a step forwards towards me i put a hand out but she adjusted her stance straightening again she didnt seem to notice the gale blowing round her you must make many enemies the more the better i agreed airily there are so many people deserving of utter contempt dont you think you really dont care that i might make enemies of my elders and betters yes not enough to stop you really dont worry that somebody might take such offence at what you say they try to harm you i refuse to worry i told her i wouldnt hand people like that even the partial victory of knowing i was concerned so then are you brave she asked with a small smile no im not brave i just dont give a fuck she seemed to find this amusing lowering her head and smiling at the paving stones i sighed lifes too short to spend it worrying celia carpe diem yes life is short she agreed not looking at me then she did but you might risk making it shorter i held her gaze i said i dont care and just then there on the roof in the loud midst of the storm i meant it she lifted her face up a little as another gust shook her and me in sudden succession i really wanted to take hold of that perfect little chin and kiss her look i said apart from anything else like i say its just radio and its a reputation i have that ive developed mostly by getting sacked from other radio stations admittedly but its what im known for i kind of get a special discount because of that people know im paid to be controversial or just plain rude im a shock jock the shock jock jock the shock if you prefer your definitions in tabloid form if jimmy young or one of the radio one djs or even nicky campbell said the things i do thered be some sort of outcry but because its me people just dismiss it to really make an impression these days id have to say something actually slanderous and that would get me fired though thatll probably happen soon enough anyway still it seems strange to approach what you do the way you do most people want to be liked or even loved she presented this as though it was something that might not have occurred to my sorry cynical ass before oh im always ready for my fair share of both i told her but you insult people and their ideas even their faiths the things they love people dont have to listen i sighed but yes i do insult things people hold dear this is what i do she was frowning i put my hands to my cheeks look i dont mean i insult people or their beliefs because i want to hurt those people because i get some sort of sadistic kick out of it i mean that what i find i need and want to say and which is what i do sincerely believe which is what i think is the truth as exactly as i can tell it is stuff that happens to hurt other people does that make sense yes i think so she said in a measured sceptical tone what im trying to say is i have my own beliefs i oh shit this is like so not postironic or postmodern and so insufficiently cynical for our knowing you know cynical sorry repetition of cynical jeez i took a deep breath of the storms air i believe in truth i told her she was smiling a little now i was making a complete idiot of myself but i didnt care any more there i said it i believe there is something pretty damn close to objective truth more or less all the time and im not accepting this shite about everybody having their own truths or respecting somebodys opinions just because theyre sincerely held the nazis sincerely hated the jews they werent just kidding im not respecting their fucking ideas just because they were deeply held i believe in science in the scientific method in doubt in questioning in facing truths not hiding from them i dont believe in god but i admit i could be wrong i dont believe in faith at all because faith is belief without reason and reason is the only thing we have the only thing i do believe in i think people have every right to believe in anything they want no matter how ridiculous it might be but i dont accept their right to coerce others into the same views and i certainly dont accept any right they might think they have not to have their views challenged just because theyre going to feel peeved in the process you have faith in reason she said calmly tucking some strands of hair back into place dont you i laughed out loud waving my arms about this is crazy i yelled were standing here on top of a tower block in the middle of a fucking hurricane getting soaked to the skin and were talking about philosophy i left my arms spread does the essential absurdity of this situation not strike you too celia i added in case she thought id forgotten her name she put her head to one side again another staggering gust of wind another adjustment of stance im sorry are you cold she asked sounding concerned we could go in no no i told her im fine out here if you are im a scotsman were legally and morally bound not to admit to feeling cold certainly not in the presence of thinly clad females and especially not heartstoppingly beautiful thinly clad females we might legitimately assume are used to balmier climes the penalties are actually quite severe they endorse your passport and she was nodding a tiny frown creasing her brows yes you only become inarticulate when you are being especially sincere she said concluding that took the wind out of my sails my hands dropped id been talking with them as well what are you i demanded celia come clean are you some sort of flying squad criticcomephilosophical psychoanalyst i am a married woman a housewife a listener married married do you give your husband this hard a time i would not dare she looked quite serious then she shook her head well i might but he would not understand fuck this i was getting cold this was the most interesting even unusual woman id met in a long long time but there comes a point i held her gaze and after a breath said and are you a faithful wife celia she didnt say anything for a while we just stood there looking at each other i could see little drops of rain on her face like sweat or tears and her hair was coming undone in the tearing wind she shook in those gusts as though shivering i have been she said eventually well i she stopped me holding up one hand towards my mouth shaking her head she glanced behind me to the still open window my husband is she began then stopped she tutted looked down and to one side and pinched her lower lip briefly with the fingers of her right hand she looked up at me once she said i thought that if i really really hated somebody i would make love to them and have my husband find out but only if i really hated the person and wanted them dead or perhaps thought that they wished they were dead i let my eyebrows rise holy shit i said reasonably she did not look like she was joking he is ah of the jealous persuasion then you do not know his name ah i said embarrassed i tapped my temple was it merry merrial she said he is john merrial i shook my head im sorry i said not ringing any bells it should perhaps i think well you have the advantage over me i said she nodded slowly solemnly she said i would like to see you again if you would like her voice was nearly drowned by the wind yes id like i said i was thinking i havent touched her kissed her anything yet nothing however you must know that if i were to see you she said it would have to be seldom and secretly it might seem sound casual she said frowning again as though she wasnt putting this just as she would like but it would not be it could not be it would be she shook her head of significance not something to be entered into lightly she smiled i make it sound all very formal do i not ive suffered more romantic propositions i moved slowly forwards and reached for her she came up on her toes raising her head and tipping it bringing her hands to either side of my face and opening her mouth to mine while the wind tugged and pushed and jostled us and the rain sowed the gusts like a soft cold shrapnel of the storm jo had been at a big ice house bash that night she rolled in drunk half an hour after me staggering down the steps into the temple belle grinning and smelling of smoke she laughed and started tickling me then kissing me then we fell into bed she had a way she preferred to be fucked sometimes when she was drunk like this on her back naked but for her tshirt lifted up over her head and caught round her neck with her arms folded up inside it making a sort of square around her head her face hidden in the black cotton as she yelled and whooped a horny swearing wildchild in the carnal negative of a burka john merrial mr merrial ed said hes a gangsta mate hes what hes a fuckin gangsta im telling you crime boss whatever you want to call it yeah boss is better mind you im saying that but could be hes not much involved in actual villainy these days gone legit inne like in the godfather part two when they talk about in a while theyll be totally legit by the end of the year or whatever it is you know that sorta fing course on the uvver uvver hand theres better profits in stuff like drugs and refugees an cars an computah crime an stuff computah crime yeah you know fraud must be hard to give up on that sorta action an let uvvers in pride involved even i should fink plobly why eds eyes went wide fuckin ell ken you aint finking of sayin sumfink orrible about him are you fuckin say it aint true im serious mate fuckin bargepole know what im sayin i wasnt thinking of saying anything about him i said truthfully i just saw him at a party the other night and somebody said who he was but not what he was and i thought id ask i had no idea he was a cross between the kray brothers and al fucking capone well he is leave well alone know what i mean i am leaving him well alone we were in eds then new car a black hummer with darkened windows it made my land rover feel like a cv we were driving through the streets of south london on the way to a gig in an old cinema in beckenham ed was determined to make me some sort of club dj or at least teach me the intricacies of getting two bits of plastic to revolve at different rates so that the tunes contained sounded like they had the same bpm wot sort of party was this you was boaf at anyway the dear owners sir jamie one of his birthday parties what does he have more than one like the queen an official birthday and a real one whats that about then just the one birthday but several parties i think i was at the second most exclusive soirée we drew up obstructed by a bus loading people at a stop on one side and the oncoming stream of traffic on the other there was in fact a sizable gap between the two one you could have got any normal car or even a transit van through quite comfortably the landy could have made it with both doors wide open but ed was probably right in erring on the side of caution especially as the machine was lefthand drive behind us a horn sounded jesus christ ed i said looking at the rear end of the bus to our left and the hummers expanse of bonnet i do believe this thing is literally wider than a london bus yeah its rough innit ed grinned teeth like a snow field rough yeah wicked innit i slapped the transmission tunnel this was a tall blackfurlined box between ed and me about the size of a big fridgefreezer combo you could have believed the thing had a spare mini hidden underneath if ed had been any shorter id have had to rise out of my seat to make sure he was really there what the fuck is it with this fucking black patois shit what ed said innocently we still werent going anywhere the horn from behind sounded again i didnt know who was leaning on it but they were brave if id been stuck behind a blackedout hummer i wouldnt have done that id have been too scared the fucker would get slung into reverse and just roll right over me rough means good i said indignantly wicked means good fucking hell bad means good i mean i realise there are issues about slavery and centuries of oppression here but do you have to take it out on the language na mate ed said finally making slow forward progress as the bus rolled off ahead of us its like you go so far into the concept right the meaning that you come out the far side know what i mean i looked at him what he asked my mistake i said waving one hand and looking away silly old me i didnt even realise that meanings had sides you could come out of serves me right for passing up a university education thatll learn me or not as is in fact the case its what language is about innit communication you dont say but if people make words mean the opposite of but everybody knows what they really mean dont they do they course they do its about context innit but hold on the first time somebody said bad when they meant good how did anybody know what the hell they really meant ed thought about this right he said way i see it it was like this some bloke was trying to cop off wif this bird right an she was a bit coy right a bit not wantin to seem too eager but still wantin it yeah an she says oh you wicked man or somefing like maybe hed been telling her all the fings what he wanted to do wif her and she was pretendin to be modest but actually she was gettin really wet right he was gettin her juices flowin but she calls him wicked an smiles an they boaf know what she means see so thats the first time that somebody says wicked an means good brilliant bring it on so then like by extension know what i mean people start using uvver words what are the opposite of what they seem to mean like rough for cool and bad for good cause its not like really much of a leap from usin wicked that first time an the reason that all this is happenin in the black community right here or in the states is precisely because the bruvvers havent got much else that is theirs we could be boxers or musicians an that but all these uvver like modes of expression is closed off to us artistically and so we fuck wif your language an thats what i fink happened plobly i stared at him there could actually be a grain of truth in that silo of gibberish i said ed went hee hee hee in a wheezy voice but this still doesnt explain how you can come out the other side of an accepted lexicological meaning for a perfectly clear and unambiguous term such as bad its like klein bottles innit its like what klein bottles theyre like fourdimensional bottles what can only exist in fuckin hyperspace man what the fuck has that got to do with anything my old mum knitted me a klein bottle hat when i was a nipper are you on drugs hee hee hee na but listen like the spout of a klein bottle sorta curves round and goes back into the bottle doesnt it it may astonish you to know and it certainly appals me to admit that i do sort of know what youre talking about so thats like the meaning i was talking about earlier innit goin out beyond itself an then coming back in bleedin obvious i should fink fuckin pay attention ken i was actually lost for words eventually i recovered enough to say and you seriously had a hat that resembled a klein bottle you mad fuck or was that the bit i hallucinated me mum was doing this open university course wasnt she geometry an that so she decided to knit a klein bottle and then it sorta turned into a bob marley hat fuckin orrible it was she made me wear it to school once too cos she was so proud of it came to the school gates wif me an everyfin so i couldnt accidentally lose it i do trust that your pals did the decent thing and kicked the living shit out of you ha they did too ed shook his head a happy nostalgic expression on his face never liked mafs ever since we were silent for a minute or so then i said hey we just went past a cop car without you getting pulled over thats cause they fink youre driving the fucker of course white man in the righthand seat easily enough to confuse the average plod ill grant you zactly why else do you fink i offered you a lift you fuck youre exploiting me hee hee hee four lacking that small match temperament no no im for lots more cctv cameras i think they should be everywhere and especially in police stations craig rolling a joint on the kitchen table sniggered im serious i told him canteen culture sounds interesting lets see it total coverage even the toilets no more of these black or asian guys beating themselves up throttling themselves and stamping on their own heads and then blaming our stouthearted defenders of decency the stairs craig suggested dont forget the stairs oh christ yeah the stairs youd want serious sky premier league coverage on the stairs top and bottom at the very least with the important player cam option naturally prisoner cam sus cam con cam i nodded vigorously with the intense concentration on total trivia of the truly stoned crim cam shplim shplam bim bam craig wheezed laughing what i said you still not got sky yet craig said raising the joint to lick the rizlas did you really say but moving on what sky no fucking way i said vehemently im not giving that shite murdoch any of my softearned dosh id moved into the temple belle a year earlier it hadnt been lived in for many years so it only had terrestrial craig had been trying to persuade me to have sky fitted ever since mind you craig mused for a clydebank supporter whats the point i suppose fuck off hun craig and i had this unpleasant though also comforting habit of reverting to our west coast male scottish cultural stereotype when we met up talking about football craig was a bluenose a rangers supporter almost his only failing really unless you were going to count his part in a longtermstruggling marriage and in a spirit of male solidarity and the abovementioned cultural stereotype i was dutybound to blame that mostly on emma regardless of anything else it was early may a couple of weeks after the party at sir jamies groovy pad at the top of limehouse tower we were sitting in the kitchen of the family home in highgate an elegant threestorey terraced house with a large conservatory and lots of decking in the garden emma had her own place these days a garden flat a couple of streets away nikki lived with craig but spent occasional nights at emmas those tended to be the nights i came along and craig and i got the chance to relive an adolescence that he a father and effectively a husband at eighteen had quit maybe too abruptly and i arguably dissolute still alone but variously entangled at thirtyfive had never quite shaken off so we listened to some music smoked joints drank beer or wine more often these days and talked about women and of course fitba it was my misfortune to be nominally at least a clydebank supporter could have been worse i might have decided to support dumbarton clydebank were the closest team of any note to where i grew up in the prim grid of sunny southaspected helensburgh a town far too middle class to have anything as proletarian as a decent football team of its own the rugby club on the other hand was a social centre almost on a par with the golf club clydebank is one of those teams at least one level beneath the big scottish clubs that are themselves a level beneath the big two the old firm of celtic and rangers craig had inherited his rangers scarf from his dad they were posh hun not bigoted or anticatholic but unswervingly committed to the team supporting a team like clydebank has its compensations i told craig as he lit the spliff blowing smoke into the darkened kitchen i had a sudden vision of nikki the next day sniffing the air and flying round opening windows here and in the adjoining conservatory daad though actually these days she would say craiaig compensations craig said cupping his free hand to his ear hark do i hear the sound of a straw being grasped at why i do believe i can i just looked at him in fact what he could hear was moby sounding soulful and interesting on the kitchen mini system what compensations he demanded having to travel to cappielow for your home games or visiting east fife no i said ignoring the insults i mean that it prepares you more comprehensively for life as a supporter of the national team you what craig said sounding very london for a moment think about it i told him accepting the joint ta if you support a team like clydebank you get used to disappointment i paused to pull on the number then talked out through the smoke the grossly truncated cup run the good players the very rare good players sold on before they have a chance to do much for the club beyond show up the rest of the team for the sorry plodders they really are the midseason nervousness as they sink towards the lower reaches of the league even in the long term the occasional promotion you know will probably end in demotion the following year the just plain boring inept displays of football where you sit in the cold for two hours realising youve doled out twenty quid to watch two gangs of intellectually challenged bampots running around a muddy field hacking away at each others legs and seemingly competing to see who can punt the ball the furthest up the park while your fellow men around you hurl abuse and insults at their own team and the other supporters i took another deep toke and handed the j back ah the beautiful game craig said affecting mistyeyedness and so i said when it comes to supporting scotland as a national team youre fully prepared for the resulting failures disillusion frustrations letdowns and general allencompassing despair which is the natural result of following our plucky but generally rather undistinguished bravehearts youve been inoculated against such disenchantment throughout your supporting life this is the sort of rubbish youre used to watching and coping with every week or every fortnight of the three seasons where it rains you just scale up your already prebattered readydeflated expectations a little and youre there you on the other hand i said taking the number back you i repeated after a deep pull with your fancy nine league championships in a row and your players with ferraris and your fortyfive thousand fans through the turnstiles every home game and your european experience you get used to success you feel cheated if theres no new silverware in the trophy yeah you have a trophy room we have a trophy cabinet currently empty if memory serves thanks fuck off you start whining when you dont finish top of something at the end of the season were just glad our teams still exist and some fucker hasnt sold the ground out from under us for a new b q the point is that you get totally conditioned to winning to victory so when you support bonnie scotland as youre genetically programmed and constitutionally bound to you cant cope with the fact were basically crap were not crap craig said defensively well not total crap but just not much better than a team from a country of only six million people ought to be so suddenly youre in a position of inferiority of having to deal with all right all right craig said kicking off his moccasins and putting his feet up on the farmhouse table i take the fucking point you end up taking refuge in peripheral stuff like having nice supporters nicer than those nasty yobbish xenophobic english supporters certainly which is the unspoken subtext of this arentwegreat caledonian selfcongratulation drunk but amiable harmless pretty much like the team exactly just going for the spectacle craig said with a trace of sadness stretching to hand me back the spliff its the national equivalent of the straws you clutch at league level with teams like clydebank people around you applauding sportsmanlike behaviour the fleeting glimpse of skill when somebody on the park accidentally does what they meant to do the combined pride and resentment when a player sold to the big boys three seasons ago scores a hattrick in the english premier i pulled on the j until it was finished and then mashed it into the ashtray with the one wed had before craigs homemade chilli i reached for my wine yeah but when you do win craig said leaning back in his seat and putting his hands behind his neck its worth it even as a supporter of the bankies you must have at least heard of this you know from supporters of other teams i ignored this too is it im starting to question that frankly behind his trotsky glasses he blinked what winning isnt fun na i mean im getting fed up with football in general craig gave a stagy gasp and said wash your mouth out with halftime bovril you blasphemous bastard do you not think so i asked seriously im just getting supersaturated with the damn game and thats without having fucking sky theres too much football craig put his hands over his ears now youre starting to scare me im going to pretend youre not here until you stop saying bad scary things i had this idea cant hear you world cup craig started to hum i raised my voice above this and moby still being moody somewhere inside the sony systems jewellike mechanisms world cup i repeated takes far too long i shouted my idea would get the whole overblown rigmarole over with in one day same with any cup competition actually la la lalala whats the best most exciting most intense and nailbiting part of many a final i yelled i spread my arms the penalty shootout craig looked incensed he took his hands down from his ears and said youre not suggesting yes scrap the ninety minutes of the actual game ditch the halfhour of extra time and go straight for the penalty shootout without all the running around and panting and diving beforehand total intensity from the first whistle of the first game through to the last fallonyourkneeswithyourfaceinyourhands goaliejumpingupandairpunching moment that sends the jules rimet trophy back to luxembourg where it belongs you are such a fucking heathen even to have thought of that the yanks would love it i told him the networks would finally have a soccer format they could get ads into every three or four minutes the attention span of your average peorian would not be taxed the penalty shootout is a disgraceful travesty of the worlds best game craig said solemnly tossing a coin is more honourable at least its admitting its just luck spoken like a member of the sfa im talking about the future you reactionary bluenose bastard get with the programme or start following shinty luddite craig did a very good impression of not listening he was gazing frowning at the mini system where mobys play was about to stop moby he said looking at me what about him dyou not think he looks a bit like fabien barthes later in the lounge sitting side by side on the couch waiting for my taxi to arrive sharing one last joint and a final couple of glasses of bin emma says we never talk about important stuff oh i said yeah its about number three hundred and seven on her list of reasons why craigs crap well if she wants to talk to you about socalled important things no no no not her and me you and me you and i i looked at him whats she talking about i think she means we dont gossip oh you mean we talk about things that we think are important like football sex and politics not like relationships something like that craig said scratching his head whenever ive seen you she asks after your mum and dad and your brother and jo and i end up shrugging and saying i dont know ah right so how are your mum and dad and your brother iain and girlfriend jo then ken they are all fine thank you craig thank you i shall inform my currently estranged first wife when next i encounter her how is em anyway how are you two these days why did i feel so guilty whenever i asked after emma she was a friend shed always meant a lot to craig and no doubt always would and wed only spent one drunken night together which we both severely regretted and wished hadnt happened so why did i feel so like a traitor when i mentioned her to craig ah were bumping along craig sighed the bottom i think but bumping along yourself still seeing jo yup anybody else not really well i grimaced so still playing the field then craig said with an easy smile i squirmed a little acknowledging awkwardness not so much actually playing the field more darting out from under the cover of the hedgerows every now and again to retrieve your ball i was thinking more of ploughing and seedscattering analogies but you could put it that way i conceded craig looked away thoughtful i think i should have done more of that jeez man youre thirtyfive youre in your prime youre not at the baffies and pipe stage yet for christs sake yeah but i have friends whore mostly married and i work from home no flirting over the coffee point or the photocopier for me hows your work going i asked him designed any good webs recently he groaned dont ask spent the whole day flushing out the pcs with antivirus probably some little shit from outer khazaktavia with a fucking sinclair spectrum what about you youre not supposed to ask a radio dj how things are going i told him tiredly youre supposed to tell me how each successive show of mine that you listen to every day is even better than the one before i looked at him youre not really totally up to speed with this friendship thing yet are you what the hell do i want to listen to you for craig demanded ruby light from a secondgeneration postironic lava lamp on a shelf behind him reflected off his glasses and his shaven head if i was desperate enough to listen to you tomorrow what do you mean if you disloyal exsocalled best friend brackets scottish close brackets all id hear craig went on would be what i just heard tonight what i screeched look me in the eye you devious lying toerag and tell me you wont be regurgitating that drivel about supporting rubbish league teams being a better preparation for supporting rubbish national teams than supporting successful ones or that gobshite nonsense about the world cup composed entirely of a series of penalty shootouts you shocking shocking man i stared at him for a while its a fair cop i said huskily i should demand royalties craig said a wage do you really never listen to me craig guffawed course i do until the adverts drive me nuts but you do recycle stuff weve been talking about i know should i start mentioning you crediting you enrol you in the crapital live bupa scheme i told you a regular cheque would suffice fuck off he sighed anyway anyway dont fucking sit here feeling sorry for yourself get im not feeling sorry for myself neither you should youve got a good satisfying successful career youve helped raise a smart beautiful daughter and youre the lucky friend of at least one really great dead famous person me i mean what more can you ask for more sex would have been nice look get out there and start socialising meet some women come out with me well go clubbing yeah maybe no not maybe definitely lets do it call me persuade me when im sober and not morose are you morose now a little i do love my job but sometimes i think its just electronic wallpaper and whats the point in it all and nikki is totally brilliant but then i think shes probably going to get hurt by some worthless bastard i mean i know its caveman stuff but i dont even like to think of her having sex you dont shit i do oh ken craig said shaking his head even for you sorry sorry i said sincerely the doorbell chimed good craig said now get tae fuck out of my house you vemonous vemonous you venomous cake of shite that you are okeydokey i said jumping up and slapping him on one knee same time next week probably safe journey back to the gin palace on the doorstep i stopped clicked my fingers and said oh i didnt mention what craig said warily about my torrid homosexual affair with lachlan murdoch uhhuh yeah and funnily enough ive started writing for one of his dads tabloids too craig closed his eyes lets just get it over with okay he sighed just thought you should know ive got a column in the son oh fuck see ya yeah try telling that on the fucking radio mr funny that was just for you baby til next week yeah yeah when i first kissed celia on the night of the storm that was as far as it went it was a fabulous kiss with her warm taut body against mine and her soft mouth and hard little tongue flickering inside my mouth like a tiny flame of moist muscle but that was all she wouldnt even give me her address or phone number or mobile or anything at the time of course i still didnt know who her husband was just that he sounded somewhat on the psycho side which goodness knows should have been enough i worried that despite all the solemnity a few moments earlier she was kidding me on that this was all just a bizarrely serious tease but she would be in touch she said now she had to get back to the party for soon a car would be coming for her to take her away another long unbearably sexy kiss when she let me run my hands all over her then she slipped inside the bedroom i stood there in the wind and rain hardon like a giant redwood waiting for a decent interval and wishing for once that i smoked because now felt like the right sort of time to do just that then via the megabathroom again to dry my face and comb my hair i went back down to the party celia had already left nothing for weeks life went on all the usual nonsense happened dental appointments runins with management a couple of boozy flirtatious lunches with the lovely amy a gig in brighton with ed which ended in some chilly dawn skinny dipping with a couple of girls from argentina jo and i went out to parties and films got loved up and went clubbing had good fun sex every now and again and i decided that celia was just one of those neverquite things a little oasis of highgrade strangeness charm and drama in an existence not normally all that short of them in the first place anyway the woman was a gangsters moll worse his wife for gods sake edge work and risktaking and all that crap was all very well and i hadnt been entirely lying when id told her i didnt give a fuck but i wasnt actually suicidal life was too short not to seize the day but shed been right about behaviour that might shorten that life dramatically then one overcast wednesday in midmay over a month later a courier arrived with a slim padded envelope immediately after id finished the show the envelope was light so light it felt empty there was a grey plastic hotel key card inside i was in the corridor from the studio to our office at the time i looked inside the envelope but there was nothing else in there i tipped it up and tapped it but still nada i looked back down the corridor as i walked in case id missed something else inside falling out nothing there either the key card didnt say what room it was for or what hotel they never do i put it in my pocket and inspected the envelope looking for a senders name wondering if i could trace it back to whomever had sent it my mobile sounded as soon as i switched it back on the phones display said anonymous hello i answered is that kenneth said a female voice ken nott yes may we talk yes i said i stopped by the office door inside i could hear phil and andi his assistant talking and laughing who is this we met on the roof about five weeks ago do you remember please dont say my name but do you remember me ah well ah yes yes of course i do how are you do you still i am not sure what to say wish to proceed this is very unromantic i am sorry ah i said staring at the carpet beneath my feet i found out who ah who your other half is so you do not i see im sorry i have been stupid please dispose of well no hold on you received what i sent size of a credit card nothing else thats right yes where is it for the dorchester six zero seven its just that i would have liked to have seen you again i dont know it was just something about the way she said it i swallowed and asked you there now yes i glanced at my watch i have a few things to tidy up here half an hour we have all afternoon until about six so ill see you two things what you must not leave any mark on me nothing of course i understand also what just this time would you be silent silent completely from when you arrive to when you go thats a little weird it is a private superstition you would probably say i know it makes no sense to you but i would like you to indulge me in this hold on i said nearly laughing is this place bugged no i could hear her smile a pause will you do this for me just this one time what if i say no then i will not have been indulged and because of that if we go ahead i will believe that this will end badly for us i do not know what you will believe kenneth i thought about this all right half an hour then i will wait for you see you soon yes the phone clicked off at the dorchester number was a suite i hesitated at the door i was sweating mostly this was because i had walked from capital live the stuff i thought i might have to tidy up had proved utterly trivial or just entirely fit for putting off until tomorrow or later and so id made my excuses the following days show was pretty much prepared already and left id walked the streets under the low grey sky it was warm and the air felt thick and humid for may walking gave me time to think was i doing the sensible thing here well that was hardly worth answering objectively knowing whose wife i was hopefully about to fuck i was behaving like a masochist with a death wish or not of course maybe shed been exaggerating that night on the terrace outside sir jamies bedroom perhaps shed been dramatising the whole thing because doing so fulfilled some appetite for mystery and her husband didnt give a damn what she did or who she did it with i fingered the little sliver of plastic in my pocket the whole cloakanddagger setup with the key card was either faintly amusing and reassuring or deeply worrying what was i doing hes a gangsta mate we reassure ourselves that were all special but was anybody that special was anybody so extraordinary they were worth taking the sort of risk i might be taking of course people had been taking mad risks for sex lust love for as long as wed been people wars had been fought for what you could if you were being uncharitable characterise as basically a bit of slap and tickle holy books had been rewritten the laws of god changed to facilitate the having of some desperately yearnedfor piece of ass desire was the backhanded compliment humanity had no choice but to pay itself it was just the way we were it was what we did we couldnt help ourselves seen one seen em all i reminded myself but then that of course was such shit sexists said that the way racists claimed they all look the same to me both were confessions of personal inadequacy of the inability to really see i used the key card and stepped into a dark hallway illuminated only once id closed the door by light spilling from a small loo on the other side of the hall the air was very warm i had to take my jacket off on a small table opposite a huge display of flowers filled the air with a thick sweet scent there were two large doors left and right both ajar both rooms dark beyond just ambient sound of the city in both directions heavily muffled the first door led to a sittingroom darkly curtained the afternoon sunshine held at bay by drapes thick as carpets tall as the distant ceiling all a bit edwardian but suitably sumptuous the other door led to the bedroom there had been a light on in here all the time celia was sitting at a rolltop desk on the far side of the room reading by a desk lamp she was wrapped in a white robe that was too big for her her golden brown hair was down spreading and reaching almost to the seat of the chair she turned round when she heard the door open she wore little round glasses it felt even warmer in the bedroom a vent thundered quietly overhead producing a draught of tropical heat that was already drying the sweat on the back of my neck and uncombing my hair she raised one finger to her lips my heart was thudding i was half expecting muscled goons with eighteeninch collars to burst out of the wardrobe whack me on the back of the head gaffertape my mouth and zip me into a bodybag though from the impression i had of the room from the desk lamps weak light this place was too posh for wardrobes it had a dressingroom instead i stood there in the heat wondering how much initiative she wanted me to take how much indeed i wanted me to take this whole silent running deal or at least me agreeing to it had put that ball pretty firmly in her court the dome of an elegantly gleaming trolley sat in one shadowy corner of the bedroom a champagne bucket and two glasses sat on a low table in front of a towering display of lilies the flowers scent saturated the bloodwarm air celia closed her hardback took off her glasses got up and walked over to me raising herself on her toes with her last step and kissing me just as she had on the night of the storm she smelled of musk and roses i used both hands to undo the ropethick belt then pulled her robe open her skin was smooth and warm warmer even than the overheated air of the room i held her away a little to look at her she let the white robe fall my eyes went wide and i breathed in seeing the strange curled imprint of her lightning scar for the first time i was about i think to say good god but she anticipated me and gently put her cupped hand over my mouth silencing me as i stared at the tracery of dark brown lines she stood still in the glowing white whorl of the fallen robe letting me inspect the fernmark raising her arms and gathering up her hair to let me see better displaying herself quietly on not in a vast bed beneath a swooping canopy we fell to our shared cause i let her undress me an urgency in her hands and expression i could not comment on i stroked her hair while she did this ploughing its rich thickness with my fingers her body was the most sensuous thing i had ever seen in my life limbs slim but muscled enough to curve waist tiny her areolae and nipples were unexpectedly pink for her caramel skin whose tone save for the lightningintaglioed print descending her left flank didnt vary anywhere except faintly on the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet her pubic hair was darker than that on her head surprisingly soft but tightly curled she skinned my jeans off the head of my cock was already protruding out the top of my calvins purple and positively polishedlooking between the grey cotton and the pasty flesh of my irredeemably pale scots skin i had always thought this looked a bit gross erections usually did regardless of the circumstances but she smiled when she saw it as though it was already an old friend and peeled off my briefs i mimed putting on a condom and pointed at my jacket which shed hung over a chair she shook her head i raised my eyebrows and shook my head slightly in what i hoped looked like a suitable translation of you sure she nodded emphatically well okay i thought as she kissed me again i wanted her so much so immediately but i decided to take charge a bit and got her down on her back i wanted to see her to experience every part of her with as many senses as i could bring to bear i knelt between her legs clutching her perfect little buttocks in my hands and lifting her up her vagina was pink as her nipples parenthesised by the full rosygrey folds of her labia fronded and frilled and rising to the little puckered lip of hood hiding the glistening stubby button of her clitoris her cunt smelled of talc tasted of sweetened salt i buried tongue and lips in her pressing and nosing her like some truffling hound while rubbing and pressing the tiny rosette of her anus with one thumb listening to her breath quicken feeling as though my mouth would burn with the engulfing heat of her entering her was a slow gradual almost tentative process just the opposite of what i think wed both expected i found myself quivering shaking like some adolescent getting laid for the first time my mouth suddenly dry tears tears welling in my eyes she lay on her hair head to one side facing the darkness the tendon on the side of her neck a taut deeply shadowed column her arms thrown out across the bed fingers clutching caging fistfuls of plump white pillows her legs in a tensed v toes pointing then finally when at last i was fully in her she gasped and threw herself around me arms and legs wrapping and squeezing me with an astonishing power as though my whole body was one huge cock and her body a hand limbs fingers i even managed to come quietly but then afterwards lying there chests heaving limbs trembling she rolled over to me slick with sweat and put two fingers delicately to my lips its all right she said softly these were the first articulate sounds she had made we can talk now kenneth it did cross my mind to shake my head or just ignore her or pretend to fall asleep in other words or their lack tease her but instead i said youve changed your mind she had said to remain silent throughout she nodded slowly her long thick hair fell spooled tangled heavy on my chest just the beginning was enough and that you were prepared to uhhuh uhhuh she said mimicking me i took a handful of her hair rolling my fist around in it taking up all slack her head tipped towards my hand her large darkly amber eyes gazed down you are a very singular woman celia will we do this again i raised my head and made a show of looking downwards in about five minutes id guess she smiled you will meet me again oh i should think so good we wont be able to go out to meet in public it will have to be like this this is okay i can handle this handle me she whispered lowering herself into my arms so began my erratic erotic tour of the luxury hotels of london every few weeks apart from once when holidays got in the way a courier would deliver a slim package holding only a hotel key or key card the accompanying phone call got shorter and shorter each time until all i would hear was the connaught three one six or the landmark eight one eight or the howard five zero three in a succession of tallceilinged feverishly hot darkened suites on top of a series of king or emperorsize beds celia and i pursued our sporadic affair that first time in the dorchester it turned out we had longer than shed first said not until six but until ten when she really had to go id nodded off at one point into sharply sultry dreams of swimming in thick red perfume beneath a fiery lilac sun then woke to find all the lights out but the room illuminated from outside and below and her standing by the windows looking out between the drawnback curtains the silvery lustre of a full moon combining on her skin with the glow of the hotels floodlights reflecting from the ceiling and framing her slim dark form with gold i padded up behind her held her and she put her hands on mine at her shoulder as i nuzzled her neck and hair that was when i asked her about the long swirling mark on her left flank and she told me about the lightning strike the dark bodies of kensington gardens and hyde park lay strung with pinprick cords of light below us cradled in the scoop of the buildings forecourt facing park lane a great dark tree rustled in a freshening breeze new growth all green and black and full of life and movement and promise who are you celia tell me about yourself i said into the darkness later if you want what do you want to know everything about you everything would be boring kenneth dont you know that knowing everything about anybody would be boring not you i suspect i told you i am a married woman a housewife a listener perhaps you could start a little closer to the beginning i am from martinique you know where that is i know my father was a fisherman my mother a waitress i have four brothers five sisters my your parents were busy sexual athleticism runs in the family then i studied languages i became a model i moved to paris then london i met a man who i thought loved me she hesitated perhaps thats not fair to him he thought he did love me we both did then what about you loving him her body tensed fractionally against mine then relaxed again love she said as if saying tasting the word for the first time getting the measure of its meaning in her mouth and mind i dont know i felt her turn her head to stare off into the shadowy heights of the room eyelashes flitted against the skin of my shoulder i felt fondness for him he was kind to me he helped me helped me considerably i dont mean to say that i married him out of gratitude but i felt that i knew him and that he would be a good husband and is he she was silent for a while he treats me well he has never struck me he became cold towards me about the time when it was found i could not have children im sorry the point is more that it does not matter that he is a good husband to me what matters is that he is a bad man to others he would say they always deserved it but did you know he was like that when you married him she was silent for a moment yes and no i knew a little i did not want to know it all i should have do you mean to stay with him i would be afraid to tell him i was leaving him also practically my whole family works for one of his businesses now on the island ah ah indeed what about you kenneth what dont you know from my many exciting and unfailingly accurate profiles in top media outlets your marriage your wife i married a nurse called jude judith met in a club when i was between jobs not long after i moved down to london great sex similar interests robust crossplatform political beliefs with only a few troublesome legacy systems she believed in astrology compatible groups of friends and we certainly thought we were in love she didnt really want to get married but i insisted i knew what i was like i knew i was very likely to stray or certainly to want to stray to be unfaithful and i came up with this bizarre concept that if i got married then the fact id made a solemn promise to her to forsake all others made a legally binding commitment would stop me i paused probably the single most barmy idea ive ever entertained in my entire adult life and that when by common assent the field of other contenders is both wide and deep i shrugged gently so as not to jar her head where it lay against my shoulder and chest however i cheated she found out confronted me with it and i swore it wouldnt happen again i meant it too i always meant it repeat until no longer funny i breathed deeply shes okay now in a stable relationship i still see her now and again do you still love her no maam you still sleep with her i felt my body jerk she must have felt it too you guessing celia i asked or are we in some creepy play misty for me vibe here guessing you would call it i am good at it well as you guessed i shrugged again we never mean to it just happens old times sake i suppose lame but true but anyway not for a while and you have a regular girlfriend yes nice girl bit mad works for a record company she doesnt know i hope about you and me i hope nobody does nobody you dont mind some men like to boast not me and no i dont mind usually we met on a friday but not every time never at the weekends she said this was because she liked to listen to me on the radio beforehand soon with every show i did id start to wonder was she listening more to the point was she listening in an eighthundredquidanight suite slowly undressing in the darkness while a crankedup heating system wound round to maximum gradually toasted every molecule of air in the place on several occasions especially on fridays i had to stand people up jo a couple of times i claimed a commiserating menonly drinking party with a justdumped colleague on the first occasion and plain alcoholinduced forgetfulness in a mobilereceptionfree dive bar the second time jo shouted at me on both occasions then wanted to have sex which was awkward i just about managed it the first time though i felt a sore and b guilty that i was still thinking about ceel the second time i faked incapability through drunkenness i began to make friday night engagements tentative rather than firm wherever it was i met ceel she was always there always waiting almost always reading a book usually something recent id heard of white teeth man and boy bridget joness diary once it was the prince once madame bovary and once the kama sutra which she was reading for ideas we didnt really need twice it was a brief history of time the room suite was always dark always hot there would be something light to eat if we wanted and vintage champagne it was a while before i realised the glasses we drank from were always the same ones and that there would always be a different spare glass present she brought the crystal flutes herself they belonged to her she seemed pleased that id noticed you were a model you said yes what like clothes she gave a onebreath laugh into the warm dark those are what one usually models kenneth swimwear lingerie sometimes i began in swimwear when a magazine came to the island to shoot a feature and two of their models were hurt in a car crash thats how i got my break what about them how do you mean did they break anything i shook my head already feeling foolish sorry i the two models yes one broke an arm and both had facial injuries i dont think either ever worked as a model again it was very upsetting not how id have chosen to get into such a career sorry i shouldnt have said anything thats all right did you appear mostly in french magazines yes im afraid i have no portfolio to show you what was your modelling name celia mcfadden mcfadden i said laughing what possessed you to take a scottish name it was my maiden name she said sounding surprised youre a mcfadden from martinique my greatgreatgrandfather was a slave on barbados he was given the name of his slave master who may have been his biological father he escaped and ended up in martinique woh sorry thats all right celia said shrugging you changed your name didnt you yeah not officially just for the radio it still says mcnutt on my passport mcnutt she smiled yes with two ts so this i said changing the subject and stroking the lightning scar has appeared in public has it it wasnt a problem perhaps it was a small problem i always had enough work but im sure i lost some jobs because of it but no i dont think it ever appeared what did they do cover it with makeup no they shot from the other side so all your model shots are from the right mostly though they dont all appear so once theyre printed you just reverse the neg oh right of course sometimes when the light or the background meant we had to they would shoot from my left side and i would hold my arm in a certain way and if there was anything of the scar visible it would be airbrushed out later it is not a problem she shrugged covering things up is easy the latest she ever stayed was ten pm i was welcome to stay longer if i wanted but i never did and i knew she preferred me to leave first she would arrive and depart with her hair tightly compressed under a wig usually blond and wore large dark glasses and baggy undistinguished clothes in claridges shed stripped the bed to its bottom sheet and covered the surface and a dozen extra pillows in red rose petals the lights mostly stayed on for that one this was where she finally explained her insane theory about having half died when the lightning struck her what there are two mes two of me in different parallel worlds hold on i think i know this theory simple idea but the complexities are hideous mine is quite simple yeah but the real one is confusing to a bonkers degree according to it there are an infinity of yous a pleasing prospect i might add except there is also are also anyway an infinity of mes too and your husband husbands whatever see how confusing it is yes well she said waving one dismissive hand but for me it is very simple i half died then when the lightning struck me in that other world i am half dead too but also half alive just as in this one so did you fall off this cliff in the other world or not i asked deciding to humour this matteroffact madness of hers yes and no i did but i also fell back onto the grass just as i did here so in this world here you fell off the cliff too yes and yet you woke up on the grass that part of me did this part of me did so in the other world what if you woke up on the grass in this one she must have not woken up because she was lying dead at the bottom of the cliff no she woke up too on the grass so who the hell fell off the bleedin cliff i did you did but both of i i and i what now youre a rastafarian she laughed we both fell off the cliff i remember it happening i remember seeing myself fall and the noise the air made and how my legs made a useless running motion and how i could not scream because the air had been knocked out of my lungs and how the rocks looked as i fell towards them so did the lightning kill half kill you or was it the fall does it matter i dont know does it perhaps both did or half did i think weve gone on to quarters by this stage perhaps either would have been enough all that matters is that it happened it would be useless to suggest i suppose that this might all really only have happened in your head the result of having ninety thousand volts zapped through your brain pan and down your body but of course it is not useless to suggest it if that is what you need to believe to make sense of what happened to me by your way of thinking then of course that is what you must believe thats not quite what i meant yes i know but you see when it happened i was there and you my dear were not i let out a long breath right so so what are the symptoms of you being only half alive in this world and the other one you do seem wholly and i would risk saying even vibrantly alive in this world to me especially about ten minutes ago oh though there is that thing about the french calling it the little death of course though thats not what youre talking about is it but back to the symptoms what makes you feel this that i feel it right no no not right im not getting it it feels obvious to me in a way i always knew it reading about parallel universes simply made sense of that feeling i didnt feel any more certain of what i felt and it did not really alter what i felt or what i believed but it made it more possible for me to explain it to others i laughed so all weve been talking about in the last five minutes is after it became easier to explain yes easier not easy perhaps less difficult would be a better formulation right i think it might all change on my next birthday she said nodding seriously why because the lightning hit me on the day of my fourteenth birthday and on my next birthday i will be twentyeight you see yes i do my god your aberrant personal belief system is actually contagious i suppose they all are i sat up in the bed you mean that on the day of your twentyeighth birthday in april next year the fifth what she shrugged i dont know perhaps nothing perhaps i die perhaps the other one of me dies and if the other one dies i will become fully alive which will manifest itself she smiled well perhaps i will decide that i love you i stared into those amber eyes it seemed to me then that she had the most direct clearly honest gaze of anybody i had ever met no humour there just now no irony not even doubt puzzlement perhaps but no doubt she really believed all this there i said is that big little word that neither of us have spoken until now why should we speak it i wondered what that meant i might have pursued the matter but then she shrugged again and her immaculate breasts moved in just such a way that in this world and surely any other all i could say was oh come here in the meridien piccadilly finding she had a suite with a kitchen attached she had already been across to fortnum and mason and bought the ingredients to make an omelette flavoured with saffron she was trying out different types of underwear on that occasion so that i came bizarrely to associate the smell of eggs cooking in olive oil with a basque and stockings i laughed as she presented the tray to me in bed what she asked you spoil me i said as she jumped up onto the bed her stockinged legs folded neatly beneath her she took up a fork i gestured at the food at her this is pretty much most guys fantasy good she said she looked round the dark bedroom then at me and smiled no complaints here either think you might let me pay for one of these conjugal visits one day or even take you away for a weekend she shook her head quickly its better this way she put the fork down this has to be outside of real life kenneth that way we can get away with it we expose ourselves less less of a risk is taken and because this happens outside of our normal lives it feels less connected to what we might talk about to other people it is like a dream no so we are both less likely to say something that might give us away do you understand yeah sure just a residual scrap of oldschool male pride wishing to pay for something but its all right being an intermittently kept man rather appeals to me i wish you could take me out she said smiling at the thought of it i would love to sit in a café with you watching people go by go to lunch with you sitting on a terrace by a river in the sunlight be taken to a play or a film or to dance sit on a beach with you under a palm tree perhaps just the two of us crossing a street holding hands i find myself dreaming of these things sometimes when i am low she looked away then back then i think of this the next time we shall meet that makes everything well i gazed into her eyes again lost for a thing to say she smiled winked it will get cold eat up in the lanesborough we spent hours in a cavernous bath experimenting with various lotions and creams she emptied a bottle of no into the oiled foam and i smelled of it for three days what do you do ceel what do you mean how do you pass your days what is your life like im not sure i should tell you this is supposed to be separate not attached to our real lives dont you remember i remember but telling me what a more normal day is like isnt going to make that big a difference i do what the women of rich men are supposed to do i shop and lunch friends some different friends for different things some for shopping and lunching some at my health club some for ice skating you skate a little not well there are a couple of friends i have from my modelling days who are also married now or settled down with rich men just two who live in london i visit paris to see friends there and one of my brothers it is so easy now with the train you go to paris a lot a few times a year sometimes i go there with john usually he travels alone hes away often europe south america i go to paris more than anywhere else john doesnt like me to spend nights away unless he knows the people i stay with well in paris its all right because i stay with my brother who works for john and lives in a company apartment what does your brother do she looked at me it was one of the few occasions shed ever looked even slightly angry nothing bad she said sharply okay i held up my hands do you have any really close friends she turned away most of the women my age have children and that separates us she shrugged i spend time on the phone each day calling my family back on the island and they come to visit sometimes she paused not as often as id like later while she was in the bathroom i noticed her bridge shoulder bag lying on a chair and her mobile phone inside its little brown leather cave a green light blinking slowly she usually switched her phone off while we were together this must be the phone my mobile knew only as anonymous i watched the faint green light for a few more beats of its tiny silicon heart looking straight at it it almost disappeared i could see it better from the corner of my eye i swallowed a little pride not to mention some principles and quickly rolled over and dug the dainty nokia out id had a similar if chunkier model to this two mobiles back and knew how to access the phones own number i scribbled it on a piece of hotel paper and stuffed the note in a jacket pocket after id returned the phone to her bag long before she reappeared this was a safety precaution i told myself in case i ever needed to warn her of something like a terrorist threat wed heard about via the newsroom but couldnt broadcast because it would cause mass panic yes something like that say in the berkeley she had brought drugs and we had time to have frenetic cokedup sex and make slow stoned love i didnt know you smoked mais non but i dont she giggled coughing a little later lying there in a stunned haze of drugged satiation limbs spread where theyd fallen on our uncoupling i watched a small patch of sunlight the product of a sunbeam penetrating the tall sweep of the drawnover curtains from the very centre of their summit move slowly across the white sheets towards her left arm half asleep i kept staring at the molten coin of yellow as ceel drifted into a quiet smiling doze the eggsized blob of buttery light slid gently up her coffee skin slow as the hour hand on a clock and revealed the tiny yearsold scars spattered on the flesh above the veins on her upper arm and the inside of her elbow a flurry of them like pale minutely puckered tearshaped freckles on that smooth surface of golden brown i gazed at her face lying half averted on the pillow her blissful smile directed into the darkness of the suite and then i looked down again at her arm i thought about her time in paris and about merrial and the bad situation hed helped her out of i decided i would never say anything if she didnt beneath the light beneath the skin her blood pulsed slow and strong and i imagined it minutely warmed by that small fall of light coursing through her body while she stared unconscious and blind back to the memory of a poisoned chemical rapture a few times i tried to follow her to see where she lived or just what she did next after one of these trysts there was a bar in the landmark with a view of reception i sat there pretending to read id peeked in her bag earlier to check which wig she was wearing that day and in the wardrobe to see what clothes shed arrived in it was a grey suit hanging neatly above some harvey nics bags i sat there and i watched really carefully but i still didnt see her i dont know if she had more than one wig or if i just glanced down at the wrong moment and shed walked quickly through the bill already paid or what but i sat there for an hour and a half drinking whisky and nibbling rice crackers until my bladder drove me from my lookout post a month later i tried again sitting in a café across from the connaught again i didnt see her but after about an hour i got a call on my mobile anonymous said the screen ohoh hello i live in belgravia usually i go straight home sometimes i do a little more shopping bookshops often are you still there yup still here i said i took a deep breath im sorry you would make a very poor spy yeah i sighed its not its not what its not some weird obsessive thing i mean its not something to worry about its not like im stalking you or anything like that im interested you intrigue me were so intimate and yet you know so strange to each other strangers still im sorry it has to be that way but it does you do accept that yes of course you wont do this again will you please no i wont youre not angry with me more flattered than angry but more alarmed than either its not worth the risk it wont happen again but what it was worth it for this phone call she was silent for a moment you are very sweet she said i have to go now in the ritz id brought some e we knocked the pills back with champagne listened to some whitelabel chillout sounds id been given by one of eds dj pals and drifted into some sublimely blissful lovedup fucking until my balls ached with the emptying you never ask me about john thats right do you hate him no i dont know him i dont hate him just because hes your husband if hes some sort of crime boss i suppose i ought to hate him on principle for being what he is but i cant work up any enthusiasm for the subject maybe ive taken to heart your idea of keeping this compartmentalised from real life or maybe i just dont want to think about your husband in the first place do you ever hate me hate you are you mad i stay with him i married him ill give you the benefit of the doubt there i think that was the time i swallowed more pride and checked her purse i think i was half expecting to find a fat roll of bank notes but there was barely a hundred in there it had occurred to me that she would not want to pay all these hotel bills by credit card not if she was trying to keep all this as secret as possible finding no thick swissroll of grubby twenties kind of stumped me it was only later i thought that maybe she paid in cash all right but before rather than after that was the longest interval after the ritz her husband was taking her to oz and new zealand on a monthlong holiday and there was a weeklong overlap while jo and i spent a fortnight doing the tombs on the nile and snorkelling in the red sea while she was away i made the mistake of going to see a film called intimacy about a couple who meet up every now and again in a filthy flat for sex and remain strangers to each other it was probably a good film in a british arthouse kind of way but i hated it and walked out halfway through something id never done in my life sometimes id take out my mobile and cursor through to ceels number and just sit and stare at it for a few moments until the phones backlighting clicked off infected by celias caution i hadnt even entered her name in the mobiles own memory or the sim cards just put the number in by itself as far as my phone was concerned she was just location in the savoy one night amongst mirrors and acres of cream and gilt in a suite looking out across the dark river to the floodlit bulk of the festival hall she had turned off all the lights and drawn the curtains right back she placed a small seat in front of the tall open windows she had me sit there bollocks to the chintz already licked sweetly achingly erect then she straddled me facing the same way both of us gazing out to the lightbrowned clouds and the few bright stars between while the sounds and smells of the summer city rolled in through the opened doors of glass like this she said placing my hands just so so that i was in effect holding her in a head lock ah yes lordy fucking mama so whats the problem basically youre having the perfect affair perfect sex i dont know well the actual sex fuck yeah but i dont know craig and i were sitting in his lounge watching football on the telly it was halftime time for men to talk after peeing anyway nikki was in her room two floors up listening to music and reading id told craig the absolute minimum about my very occasional affair with celia normally i might have shared this sort of thing with ed who possessed the merit of pursuing with extravagant success a lifestyle that made mine look restrained to the point of celibacy in comparison but the trouble was id asked him about mr merrial that day in the hummer and i wasnt absolutely sure that i hadnt mentioned seeing mr ms wife at the time too and paranoid though i knew it was really i felt it would be just possible that ed would put two and two together and well faint probably maybe celia guessing about the fact jude and i still fell into bed together every now and again had spooked me a little look at it objectively craig said you meet up with this mystery female whom you describe as the most beautiful woman youve ever slept with you always meet in circumstances surroundings that you describe as somewhere between very nice and sybaritic where you proceed to fuck the arse off her and yeah but the fact remains im in a relationship where the best thing that can happen is that it just fizzles slowly sadly out what oh fuck what just there what when i said you fuck the arse off her right yeah you winced well your cheek winced like a facial tic never did i really oh okay right so that means youre falling in love with her now you have a problem the big breaking news thing was stuttering it got all rather hyper and frenetic over the next day or two after our meeting with debbie the station manager the way sometimes these relatively trivial things tend to with urgent allhours weekendlong phone calls texts and voice mails flying back and forth between channel four capital live the production company winsome assorted producers assistants secretaries pas agents lawyers and people whose job it seemed to be purely to ring up and say they needed to speak to somebody urgently all tying up a significant proportion of the capitals mobile and fixedline telephony capacity trying to get this incredibly vital piece of exciting epochmaking edgy challenging confrontational television arranged for the monday evening even sir jamie himself got involved because according to my contract he needed to give personal permission for me to appear on another not preagreed media outlet this turned out not to be a problem as he was a good friend of the owner of winsome productions and even had shares in the company then of course just as everybody concerned had whipped themselves up into a high teetering effervescent froth of wildeyed expectation and teethchattering frenzy it all fell apart even id got myself all worked up and im joe totally cynical about these things after years of people telling me they have this great project for getting me on telly and how theyre really excited about bringing a new dimension to my work and then nothing happening youre telling me its not fucking going ahead its being postponed phil said tiredly putting his mobile down on the scratched wooden table we were in the capital live canteen on the floor beneath debbies office having an early breakfast it was just after seven oclock wed come in early to do a special recorded edition of the show so that i could get to the channel four studios in time for the recording of breaking news theyd backed off the original idea of doing it live my mobile vibrated on my belt i checked the display my agent yes paul i said then yes i just heard then yeah i know me too par for the fucking course yeah yada and then yada raised to the power of yada yeah when i see it in fact probably not until i see it when its number thirtyseven on tvs one hundred most embarrassing moments yeah well see okay you too bye i sat back in the creaking flexibility of the brown plastic seat and drummed my fingers on the table top looking at my toast and marmalade and my cup of milky tea look on the bright side phil said theyd just have wanted you there about four hours early and then theyd have wanted to do another of those preinterview interviews where some breathless researcher with a famous name just out of chalet school asks you lots of questions so they can find out which ones are the good ones and you give really good fresh answers and then they ask you those same questions in the actual programme and you sound all stale and talked out because youve already answered them once and got bored with them and during the recording youll have to answer the same questions a third or a fourth time because somebody knocks over a bit of the set and they have to start again from the top so youll sound even more stale and talked out then theyll record more than three hours and use less than two minutes and youll forget to take your makeup off and workmen will give you funny looks in the street and afterwards people whose opinion you respect will say they missed it or go all cagey when you ask them what they thought and people you dont like will call up and tell you they loved it and the papers you hate will either dismiss it or say how you should stick to what youre good at not that youre very good at that either and youll be all depressed and grumpy for weeks probably phils longest diatribe it was too laidback to be called a rant i looked at him so when did they tell you it might happen now oh tomorrow he grinned fuck off na he said leaning back too and stretching and yawning lucky to be this year now according to my new close friend at winsome moselle major rethink on format after the events of september the eleventh he scratched his head what a brilliant excuse thats turned out to be for so many things yeah i breathed i toyed with my toast and stirred my already wellstirred tea part of me was deeply relieved id come up with this great idea for what i was going to do on the programme if they put me on with the holocaust denier guy and it still excited me and scared me in equally intense proportions now i wouldnt have to either do it and let fuck knows what happen or chicken out and not do it and curse myself for evermore for being a sad pathetic hypocritical lilylivered crapout merchant in fact just the sort of sad pathetic etc who would feel as relieved as i now did that i wouldnt have to make that choice at least not for a while and maybe the way i knew these things tended to work ever i threw the teaspoon down and stood up ah come on lets go and do the fucking show phil glanced at his watch we cant judy ts using the studio till half past i sat back down again heavily fuck i said eloquently putting my head in my hands fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck five mission statement yeah id just like to say that dont you think these eurosceptic people should be called europhobes yeah phil and i rolled our eyes i leaned right up to the microphone this has the pretty universally automatic effect of making people lower their voices and i was no exception it should sound like i was talking personally just to the caller actually steve we went through all this two years ago on the evening show and if you recall we did a sort of rolling greatest hits of the evening show for the first week of the daytime slot when that very point came up oh a few times kind of guessing here youre new to the programme steve oh sorry yeah steve seized up audibly its great he managed keep it up practically my personal motto steve i said with a smile sitting back again thanks for calling i clicked on to the next caller which the screen said was a mr willis from barnet subject eurp poound kayla may have put the ass in assistant but her typing owed more to the carpetbombing approach than any concept of precision targeting mr willis not a first name that told you something immediately without even saying hello to the guy mr willis i said crisply mr nott your point sir yes i just wondered why an apparently intelligent fellow like yourself was in such a hurry to get rid of the pound and throw in our lot with a currency thats dropped so much value since it was launched im not in a hurry mr willis like most people in britain i think its going to happen sooner or later so it becomes a question of which is best when is best but i dont claim to know my point is that its all about economics and politics and it shouldnt be about sentiment because the pound sterling is just money like any currency if the germans can give up the deutschmark we can surely stop using bits of paper with the monarchs head on them but mr nott why should we a lot of us happen to think the pound is important we love the pound look mr willis you lost the pound whatever it was thirty years ago i can just about remember this the pound the real pound had two hundred and forty pennies a third of a pound was six and eightpence yes but there were thrupenny bits sixpences shillings florins halfcrowns halfpennies tenbob notes and i know if you were being fancy guineas that all went in the sixties and that was the end of the pound what youve got now is a british dollar basically so why all the bellyaching about it its not bellyaching to wish to preserve a vital part of our proud british culture i am a member of an organisation i looked at phil on the other side of the desk and spread my hands he did the throatcutting thing i nodded mr willis i said fading his voice down heres a handy hint attack the euro via the interest rate a single interest rate barely makes sense throughout the uk let alone all twentyfive members of an expanded eu unless you want in fact to impose absurd levels of worker mobility or a vastly increased centralised regional compensation fund look we didnt fight and win the second world war its been interesting talking to you mr willis goodbye i looked at phil as i cut mr willis off we getting crossed lines with the daily mail letters page or something i think its encouraging that we have a spread of listeners of various ages views and ethnic and cultural backgrounds ken phil said leaning towards his mike phil ashby listeners voice of reason singing in harmony from the hymnal of corporate mission statements thatll be me then hi phil said right up to the mike whos our next caller its another steve from streatham according to the screen he wanted to talk about scotz erop u streatham steve hello awright ken ma man a deep voice shouted i looked at phil and crossed my eyes steve youre doing some violence to the mike on that mobile im sure if you return it promptly to its owner they may not press charges wot agh hahaha na mate its mine well bully for you and the exact flavour of your beef would be what wot what is it you want to say steve yeah i dont want to be a european you dont right which continent should we tow the british isles to lie off then na you know what i mean indeed i do well so vote against it whenever you have the chance yeah but its still gonna happen innit fraid so its called democracy i hit the fx for hollow laughter yeah but the fing is i blame you scots dont i ahhah i said any particular reason steve or is this just some generalised anticaledonian prejudice yeah the governments all scotch innit the labour party theyre all jocks arent they very high proportion of the top jobs yes steve the dear leader himself our prudent chancellor is a scot worse hes a fifer phil cut in na phil sorry i said what phil asked yeah steve said thats what hold on steve pal i said come back to you in two seconds but i just need to straighten something out with producer phil okay ah steve said yeah what phil repeated innocently blinking behind his glasses sorry phil pal i said but you cant do that cant do what bring up divisions or petty squabbles between different bits of scotland our internal prejudices and micromanagement bigotries are our own affair were allowed to indulge in that but youre not its like black people can call each other nigger but us white folks cant and rightly so i might add phil nodded things dont mean what the sayer says they mean what the listener hears i hit the fx key for a quiet minutelong sample of the hallelujah chorus and over it said voice raised still our most elegant formulation of what really would be one of our mission statements if we didnt spit on such foul aberrations from a great height and grind the ordurejammed cleats of our jockboots into their snivelling faces along with phil said if you dont give people justice theyll take revenge and never underestimate the greed of the rich not forgetting ditto the ability of people to take exactly the wrong lesson from a disaster nmd come on down i was laughing again or our emission statement im coming im coming or the posh version im arriving im arriving indeed i unclicked the sample but anyway phil said still grinning but anyway indeed philip what it boils down to is he said slowly that i cant say the things about the scots that you say all the time of course not youre english a few of us clever jocks still blame you for the whole glasgowedinburgh antipathy thing the good citizens of each verymuchequallyworthy conurbation just loved each other to bits until you guys came along and frankly the utterly preposterous idea that if we hadnt had the english to unite us in hate wed still be a bunch of barearsed hill tribes marrying our sisters and murdering each other in caves holds no water with us whatsoever no sirree we reckon you were just dividing and conquering so like i say just dont start okay its a good job youve got us to blame phil said it most certainly is i agreed emphatically just dont for a nanosecond expect the least scintilla of gratitude as if phil said smiling as apparently the young folk say these days yeah youll prise that copy of clueless out of the video one day phil phil laughed silently and i went back to steve steve yeah all these scots in westminster hear what youre saying but dont forget if you think the scots are crap and theyre the ones whove clawed their way to the top of this particular greasy pole what does that say about the english politicians i fink its a conspiracy mate brilliant phil a conspiracy form i picked the paper copy of the running order from the desk in front of me and rustled it near the mike thank you steve ready shoot cos like you want to get us into europe dont you we do i smiled widely at phil yeah we do youre right steve i think youre on to something here possibly a rehab programme but listen this makes sense its a scottish conspiracy to get revenge for three hundred years of oppression which we secretly feel we never did resist strongly enough i fink its cos youre jealous of course we are our invasions of you lot never worked same with yours of us though obviously our impression is very much that you were always much better at killing lots of us than we were at killing lots of you then you guys realised where our weak spot is and just bought us that was smart except weve never forgiven you for being cleverer than us were supposed to be the canny ones in this relationship yeah cos you lot do want to be in europe dontcha naturally scotsll make great europeans when we hear the english say we dont want to be ruled from a distant capital where they speak differently from us and impose an alien currency on us we think hold on weve had that for three centuries weve been there weve had the conditioning weve done the apprenticeship london brussels whats to choose better to be wee and ignored in a potential superpower than wee and ignored in a postimperial backwater where the only things that arrive on time are the corporate bonuses yeah well steve said excellent work there steve fine contribution breaks my heart we dont pay anything sawright of course this does mean though steve that having started to uncover the conspiracy the people who really run the country are now going to be after you basically youre on the run from here on in chum sorry and id get moving now frankly because these people dont hang around theyve been known to collar somebody while theyre still making the phone call that alerted what little remains of our socalled free society to the threat in the first place im not kidding mate while theyre still id clicked steves line off steve hello steve steve steve are you dear god phil i said in hushed strangled tones theyve got the poor beggar my god theyre fast that was quick phil agreed hes probably already trussed into a headtotoe straitkilt and being bundled into an unmarked irn bru van even as we speak ayee phil said in what was already recognisable as his incurably atrocious scots accent hell be languishing in a pibrock on the isle of ocktermuckty before the day is oot ken och phil i sighed happily when you speak its like being home again shplendid sho whosh our nexsht caller well were obviously shunted onto a deeply scottish vibe here phil as that spookily accurate sean pertwee impression of yours so powerfully testifies lets have i scanned the callmonitoring screen paging down to where the new calls were still appearing ah angus now theres a fine choochter name i clicked on his line angus are you scottish say yes aye man ah am hullo howre ye doin fine and dandy yourself magic aye and what have you and your magic eye been looking at then aye ah was jus listenin to what yur man there was saying about us an the english an ah jus thought he wiz talkin a lod a shite beep shite was a beepable word phil did the business this time though we all had a button beepable words were cunt fuck and variations thereof shit and variations thereof shite but not crap bastard but not apparently the scotified versions i kept getting away with prick in context and cock in context we could do this because the show went out with a threesecond delay this meant that in theory phil could beep me if i said anything slanderous or likely to bring capital live into disrepute or court ha ha so cogently put angus i said aw sorry man i looked across the desk beep count today phil thats the first thought it was seventy minutes in dear me standards are slipping so angus is that all you want to say we do allegedly have a national reputation for cogent intellectual discourse we ought to be maintaining here angy and frankly youre not coming up to the mark or pound or groat na but its just if the english dont want to be part of europe fine but why should we have to no be a part of it too like let them go their own way well go ours we dont need them man theyre just an embarrassment sometimes this made me laugh phil took umbrage from the nation that gave us the krankies he said voice rising indignantly and the deepfried mars bar we embarrass you i was still laughing yeah well angus i said i know what youre saying but then weve always wanted it both ways havent we us scots i mean when the empire was still commonly held something to be proud of we were like aye an dinny forget who really built it fur ye we wur yer best sodjers an engineers an aw sorts and we built yer ships fur ye too an mined the coal tae make them go aye when ye were takin civilisation tae the fuzzywuzzies it might a been the inglish general an is foppish chums on their horses on the ridge sayin charge an tallyho chaps but it wiz the bams wi the kilts an the bagpipes that stormed in tae dae the real bayonet work oh an did we mention we inventit the steam engine an the telly right but then like soon as imperialism became a dirty word we were giving it aye solidarity there black brother ken exactly whit yeve went through by the way those inglish bastirts invaded our country before anybody elses so they did under the imperialist yoke fur three hunner years us totally exploited stole that steam engine an the telly frae us too by the way anguss mobile feed had crackled broken up and gone back to the dial tone about halfway through this phil said angus has left the airwaves indeed he has i said glancing at the studio clock and using my pencil to cross off another segment on the running order well thats the end of the looney tunes section of the show where all you brave brave people ring up to be insulted by a professional weve got some vitally important information about stuff you didnt know you wanted coming up right here and then after that talking about insults itll be shaggy take it away shaggy take it very very far away what on earth are you doing ive changed me mind i want a gin and juice so youre phoning craig to change your order yep hes about eight fucking metres away i protested pointing into the bar i can see his slapheaded cranium we were sitting on some aluminium chairs on the pavement outside a bar on frith street this was back in august i think it was a saturday evening one of those warm summer nights in soho when the whole place feels like its inside like its a vast warrenlike room when the people throng the streets between the lowrise buildings and turn it all into a single space and the cars edging slowly slowly up the narrow streets often slower than the people walking seem to bloom to the same size they look in a showroom big ungainly things all that hot fast metal trapped by the press of soft summerstripped bodies music came whumping out of the bars open doors and windows seeped from a club down some steps across the road and pulsed from the vehicles crawling their way up the street sounding dull if the windows were closed and sharp if the windows were open i smelled cigars blow exhaust perfume curry kebabs beer sweat and tar plus every now and again there came the faint almost subliminal smell of drains of sewage like something decaying and noxious seeping up from underneath ed twisted briefly in his seat glancing back towards the crowded noisy bar where craig had it seemed finally got to the counter yeah maybe he is he said thumbing the phone but you try gettin froo to im or attractin is attention it occurred to me that ed had a point it also occurred to me that a wellaimed ice cube might do the trick but i looked at my bottle of budvar and eds bottle of becks and thought no even with a reliable ice cube supply which we didnt have and my fabulous lobbing abilities which it was highly unlikely had been in any way compromised by the three or four hours of drinking accomplished until this point such behaviour could just conceivably result in a miss a misunderstanding and a fracas even a mêlée ullo craig yeah hee hee hee best way mate na a gin and juice you know wif orange yeah cheers mate make it a double i yelled at the phone some passing people looked at me yeah that was im ed said into the mobile see you youre so decadent i told him im so pissed off dont take it personally ed should not have been here hed been just about to start a gig in luton when it had been cancelled due to a series of bomb alerts with nothing to do hed joined craig and me on our night out this was supposed to end up with craig and i going clubbing but somehow wed kind of sidetracked ourselves down a serious drinking route lovedup dancing on the prowl for luvverly laydeez was now almost certainly out of the question of course we might convince ourselves otherwise in the interim but in that case the night would almost certainly end in abject humiliation why would somebody bomb a club anyway i asked ed or threaten to turf war mate settin these fings up doin the security providin the pills lot a dosh involved ed finished his becks course it usually all runs nice an smoov cos thats in everybodys inarest so that the money keeps comin slidin froo but every now an again therell be some sort a disagreement where neevir sidell back down an some cunt feels the need to make a point this evenin patently being one of them he nodded at me sorta fing that merrial guy might be involved in really possibly ed shrugged i dont know an i dont want to neevir just a bastard when these geezers cant get their fuckin acts togevver leaves a onist jobbin dj out of pocket dunnit wait here ill organise a whipround fack orfft i have no idea where this happened ere what dyou unnerstand everyfin your mates sayin what craig yeah oo else ya nutter course i do bit of a accent though asnt he dontya fink what the hell are you talking about i mean i can just about cope wif your highlan brogue but i almost need a interpreter wif im are you trying to be funny na im serious mate hee hee hee youre talking nonsense craig hasnt got a scottish accent any more well virtually none he goes back to glasgow and they think hes a londoner na but really and what the hells this about my accent too ya bastard what dyou really fink you speak bbc english or somefing do you better than that i roared i think people looked round again i dont have an accent ha you got an accent man im telling you naw ah dinny i said i meant it to be ironic hee hee hee all right then what nationality am i youre british ed rolled his eyes all right which bit of britain brixton you is just being deliberately obtuse here man all right youre english see im not im inglish inglish what dyou mean inglish theres a fucking e at the start there yeah but its pronounced inglish innit i beg to differ say film fim na come on say it like you always say it that is how i always say it fuck off you say fillum you always do i do not film there see see what you said fillum i did not yes you did heres your mate lets see how he pronounces it ere craig mate say film craig sat down put the drinks on the table and smirking said movie oh how we laughed na its just like realising theres the powerful and the powerless the strong and the weak the rich and the poor the winners and the losers and which lot do you identify with if its with the winners then youre basically saying right fuck the poor or the dispossessed or the oppressed or the whatever im just out for me i want to be one of them winners and i dont care who i hurt or what i do getting there and staying there if you identify with the losers youre a loser ed said no no no youre not anyway you got money im not saying having money at all is immoral though im not so sure about having shares lissen to you man wots wrong wif havin shares the legal precedence youre automatically accorded over workers and consumers thats what i said at this point even i was aware i was sounding a bit pompous yeah right i bet you got shares anyway man wevvir you know it or not no i dont i protested no ed said you got a pension no i exclaimed triumphantly ed looked amazed wot no pension plan nope opted out of the companys and never opted into another youre mad im not im principled you bastard selfrighteousness is easily worth a few percentage points to a man like ken craig told ed at the time i thought in support still fink youve got shares somewhere where do you keep your dosh then building society nationwide the last big mutual all my money goes to provide loans to people buying houses not into the rest of the capital market and certainly not into lining the pockets of fucking fat cat directors yeah ed snorted an wot you gettin four per cent a clear conscience i said oops skirting the perimeter of the pomposity precipice again anyway my point is that you can still have ambition and want to do well and want your friends and family to do well but youre keeping your keeping your what am i trying to say here craig youre tryin to say i am drunk ed laughed loud and clear i think craig said youre trying to explain what determines whether youre right or leftwing or liberal or not something like that he waved one long arm i dont know craig sat looking gangly and overhanging his seat limbs on a very low state of readiness light reflecting from his shaven head we had moved on to the soho house after the bar had shut there might have been somewhere in between see above whatever we had all been very sorry to leave the bar because all these stunningly beautiful women had kept walking by us going up and down the pavement and the street and wed all observed that theyd got more and more beautiful as the evening had gone on remarkably anyway now we were here in the house and it was crowded and hot and when i thought about it i couldnt remember what floor we were on or which room we were in or where the loo would be from here at least wed got a table somehow but sitting down in the midst of all these standing bodies meant you were situated kind of low to spot any natural landmarks and so get the old bearings i had no idea how wed got onto this stuff about belief but if id stopped to think about it it would probably have been me whod brought the subject up something like that i said feeling i was agreeing with an important point though not quite able to recall exactly what it might be its a fucking mission statement man one that actually has some point its about where your sympathies lie with yourself or with your fellow man women human beings this is what its all about this what this what im going to explain right here right now well go on then its about do you see somebody having a really tough time of things and think tough shit loser or do you see somebody having a really tough time and think hmm too bad or oh thats a shame or oh poor person i wonder how i can help thats the choice choices choice its all about how nasty or nice you are wow you really must be nice craig said you missed out the one thats worse than tough shit loser i did there is one yes its hmm how can i exploit this already downandout and therefore usefully vulnerable person for my own ends fuck i breathed abashed by my own lack of sufficient cynicism so i did i shook my head god there are some real bastards around never more than ten feet from a rat ed said he raised his eyebrows specially round ere ten feet i said i thought it was ten metres twenty feet craig offered possibly as a compromise wotever yeah i said soho i suppose there just might be the odd tad of exploitation going on here ed made a show of spluttering into his drink fuckin exploitation city here mate the girls are all slaves craig said nodding wisely who what girls the prossies craig said the girls wif their cards in the phone boxes ed said oh yeah of course yeah you try findin a ho wot can speak english round ere right i said yeah theyre all from eastern europe or somewhere now arent they slaves craig repeated take their passports tell them theyve got to work off some ludicrous amount of debt the girls think once theyve done that they can start earning some for themselves and sending money back home but of course they never do he nodded read about it observer i think and the police are out i suppose i said because then theyll just get deported or slung into a detention centre or something not to mention whatll appen to their family back ome ed clicked his fingers nuvvir fing your mr merrials involved in come to fink of it im an is albanian chums who craig said looking mystified i had a sudden fit of hullbreachcategory paranoia and waved one hand with what i hoped looked like airily casual dismissiveness woops ed said catching the glass before it fell all the way to the floor nuffing in it anyway sorry sorry i said um ah yeah too complicated i told the still mystifiedlooking craig i turned to ed ed i said what do you believe in i believe its time for anuvver drink mate i wasnt i didnt i didnt say half the things i was supposed to have said ya so like what did you say three things two of them simple unarguable road safety points one estimable and thoroughly civilised city though it is it was something close to criminal neglect on the part of the parisian authorities that a piece of road like that had massive square concrete pillars unprotected by crash barriers it couldnt have been much more intrinsically dangerous if theyd attached giant iron spikes angled to face into the traffic stream two this is supposed to be a mature responsible adult mother of two beloved by millions so she might have done the first thing that any rational human being does when they get into a car especially one that might be going to travel quickly and even if you havent guessed the driver is quietly pissed and put on a fucking seat belt three and this is the one that really caused the trouble my conscience was clear but a lot of the people who turned up to watch the procession and throw flowers onto the hearse if they blamed the photographers chasing the merc on their motorbikes which a lot of people did then they were hypocrites because by their own logic theyd helped kill her ya right ya how because why were the snappers bothering to stay up late outside a flash parisian hotel in the first place because the photographs they might get could be worth something why might the photographs be worth something because the papers would pay good money for them why would the papers pay good money for them because those photos sold newspapers and magazines my point was that if any of the people that blamed the photographers a profession i have no great love for believe me ever bought newspapers that regularly featured the royals in general and princess di in particular and especially if they had ever changed from whichever newspaper they usually bought or bought an extra one because it contained or might contain a photograph of diana then they should blame themselves for her death too because their interest their worship their need for celebrity gossip their money had put those snappers at the door of the ritz that night and set them off on the chase that ended with a black merc totalled round an underground chunk of reinforced concrete and three people dead me im a republican nothing what like the ira right no not the fucking ira i mean im a republican rather than a monarchist nothing against her madge or the rest personally well anyway but as an institution i want the monarchy dumped i wouldnt buy a piece of shit like the sun or the mail or the express in the first place but even if for some bizarre reason id ever been tempted id have been less not more likely to do so if there had been a photo of princess di on the cover so i hadnt helped kill her my question to whoever might have been listening was how about you right i see right do you so they sacked you bummer i shrugged the papers got a little upset personally i think the express and the mail just didnt like being called tabloids but you found something else right ya oh ya oh youre making fun of me youre terrible am i yes im a big fan you shouldnt insult me i thought i was doing quite well what you thought you were doing quite well amnt i i looked her down and up youre funny you think definitely another drink okay no you sit ill get them you havent let me buy anything yet please if you insist raine i do same again yeah dont go away raine said touching me on the arm again shed done this a lot over the last hour or so i liked it oh okay then i said raine slid out from behind our table and insinuated her lithe size six body into the crowd towards the bar phil leaned over i think youre in there mate yeah i think i might be too i agreed whod a thunk it shit i was a bit drunk id actually knocked back that last whisky mistake i turned to phil can i have some of your water yep there you go i drank from his bottle of evian we were in clout on shaftesbury avenue a big coolly swish thirdgeneration pleasure complex designed for the discerning older clubber who might equally favour home or be found in fobar fucking old beyond all recognition ageprofile successor to fubar fucked up beyond all recognition phil and i were sitting in a booth in the retox bar on level tepid if you listened carefully you could just make out the thudthudthud from the main dance area on the floor above from downstairs where the main chill spaces were and quiet relaxing sounds were the ambient noisescape there was what sounded like silence well maybe just the occasional quiet pop of yet another fried brain cell departing this world above you could hardly hear the person next to you if you hollered in their ear below it felt wrong to do much more than whisper here music played but normal conversation was perfectly possible i must be getting old because i preferred it here fucking right i did here was where you obviously got to meet pieces of class ass like raine fucking yeeha calm down calm down i told myself i tried breathing deeply ive been on a real fucking roll recently i told phil shaking my head jo ceel ah ceel who was really in another category altogether who was a whole world in herself but who i saw so horribly seldom id lost track start again jo ceel that argentinian girl in brighton one or two others tanya well not tanya whod baled out on me but i still reckoned i was greenlight with amy if i wanted to take things further down that nextonpersonalplaylist route and and now this raine girl a total fucking stunner with a sloane accent and she seemed to be after my body i loved london i loved even the modest morsel of fame that i had i have havent i yeah phil said nodding wisely dont know what they see in you myself me either i agreed i drank some more water and studied the floor at my feet the floor of the retox was some blond scandinavianlooking wood pouring a whisky away straight onto it might cause unseemly dribbling splashing noises like youd pissed yourself or something ahhah phil had put his jacket down on the floor when raine had slipped in beside us perfect i hooked his jacket closer underneath me with one foot while he wasnt looking here you go raine said setting my whisky down in front of me it was a double here i got you some more water ah paul phil said phil ya sorry phil raine smiled at me and raised her glass it looked like a g t i raised mine down the hatch raine said and drank deep i put my glass to my lips and made a big show of drinking but didnt keeping my lips tightly closed i sniffed it instead i was getting paranoid about this thinking that raine was watching me drink i made my adams apple bob like i was swallowing i put the glass down on the table keeping it covered by my fingers so the level wasnt obvious nice bit peaty is it an islay ah ya raine said ya thats right she wore tight leather pants a couple of layers of pink and white chiffon blouse and shades with a faint yellowtint that made her look a bit like anastacia midtwenties like her waist awfully good cheekbones and a jaw line like david coulthards except smoother obviously her nipples were kind of obvious through the chiffon was it fashionable again looked good on her anyway and something about her bare shoulders reminded me of ceel raines hair was blond and thick and she kept flicking it back off her face so raine phil said ever skydived in la mancha he grinned inanely at her then at me i got the impression he was at least as drunk as me wed started mobhanded in the pub gone on to the groucho then the soho house and ended up here losing coworkers en route to pathetic excuses like food prior engagements lifepartners children that sort of thing i had the vague impression wed had a good talk about the show during some part of this and come up with some new ideas and stuff for me to rant about but i couldnt recall any of the details at all luckily phil usually did and he normally took notes in tiny writing in the useful diary he always carried with him it was a friday so we didnt have a show tomorrow we were allowed to go out to play dammit jo was absent for the weekend with the addicta boys in stockholm and helsinki also it had been three weeks since id seen celia and id been hoping there would be a couriered package for me immediately after the show and an anonymous call on my mobile in fact id spent the show the day since i woke up even the week if i was being honest looking forward to signing my name on a dispatch riders acknowledgment form received in good condition sign here print here insert time here but there had been nothing just an empty feeling id decided it was time for a jolly good drink sorry the girl said phil waved a hand woozily nothing ignore me ya raine looked rather meanly at my producer i thought bit cheeky i thought this man was one of my best friends and a very fine producer too who did she think she was looking at him with a justfuckoff expression how dare she this man deserved respect for christs sake while she was distracted i took the opportunity to pour about half my whisky over phils jacket then brought the whisky glass up and did the pretend drinking thing again just as raine switched her attention back to me and a smile reappeared on her face she clinked glasses once more i thought i could smell the whisky fumes evaporating from the dark surface of phils old but still serviceably stylish paul smith i swirled my whisky round in the glass raine was watching you trying to get me drunk i asked her in a sort of kooky rolereversal kinda stylee she lowered her eyelids a little and slid up to me on the seat until i could feel the warmth of her through my shirt im trying to get you to come home with me she murmured ha i laughed i slapped my thigh you shall go to the ball cinders phil was snorting with laughter on the other side of me raine gave him a dirty look i took her chin in my hand and brought her mouth towards mine but she put her hand on my forearm and gently pushed my hand down finish your drink and lets go okay id already disposed of most of the rest of the whisky and could happily have slugged the rest because it wasnt enough to make any real difference but by now it had become something between a game and a point of honour to dispose of the whole lot without a drop passing my lips so i looked over raines shiningly blond head and said okay shit is that madders and guy ritchie she looked i dumped the last of the whisky onto phils jacket and stood up lowering the whisky glass from my mouth as raine turned back again guess not i said i felt fine i thought the prospect of sex with somebody new especially somebody new who looked as good as raine was a profoundly sobering influence all by itself still i felt myself sway as we edged out of the booth phil got to go fine have fun he said thats the intention you take care and you precautions he sniggered see you monday i just have to visit the loo raine said as we crossed through the crowds ill see you at the cloakroom i spent a couple of minutes nattering to the cloakroom girl on the ground floor unlike phil i usually checked my jacket in but then i didnt use mine as a wearable handbag ready raine asked passing her receipt to the girl very i said raine let me help her on with her coat it was an afghan which i interpreted as a retrofashiondriven coincidence rather than some subtle geopolitical statement she turned and looked me in the eye gaze switching from one pupil to the other it felt good very sexy to be inspected so closely she hadnt tipped the cloakroom girl but i didnt care i kind of fell against her and she let me kiss her though not deeply she pushed me away and glanced at the girl come on she said it was raining as we left i nodded at the bouncers who smiled and nodded back i was moderately certain i knew their names but i wasnt absolutely sure and getting bouncers names wrong was a lot worse than not calling them anything i stared at the rain and the traffic sizzling up and down the avenue lights bright in the dropjewelled darkness its rain raine i said right ya she said gazing down the street yes kenneth i thought to myself like shell never have heard that one in her life before friday night in the rain i said authoritatively our best chance is a taxi dropping somebody off ill bravely volunteer to make a dash for one if it pulls up right or i could just phone a minicab i said taking my mobile out after a struggle with the little holster at my hip ill tell them theres an even more exorbitant tip in it than usual i squinted down at the little motorola as i flipped it open just dont say anything about curry i muttered closing one eye to see the display properly raine looked round she put her hand over mine over the phone no its all right heres a taxi now a black cab had just pulled up at the kerb glory be i said putting the mobile away again na its lights off but raine was already pulling me across the pavement towards the cab ya i flagged it fine work raine i said grabbing for the door handle and missing she opened the door but i insisted on holding it open for her i then hit my head getting in ouch you all right fine i started searching for my seat belt this is a really good omen you know raine i told her raising my backside off the seat to grab at the belt ya it is isnt it getting a taxi that quickly on a rainy friday i said youre a miracle worker or as a combination were just blessed right ya the cab pulled out into the traffic heading northeast i finally got my seat belt on raine hadnt bothered with hers i started lecturing her on the extreme inadvisability of this given what had happened to princess di but she just looked at me strangely and i realised that as well as preventing you from being flung forward limbs flailing in a bad crash seat belts also stopped you from snogging they made you safe in taxis i was appalled with myself i was sure id known this before but i seemed to have forgotten youre right i said though she hadnt said anything i undid my belt solidarity sister i slid along the seat towards her i caught the driver glancing up at us in his mirror raine let me slip my arms round her pressed up against the seat corner i covered her mouth with mine she opened up a little more this time i fumbled to get my hands inside the afghan coat maybe you should put your seat belts on eh the driver said it was an oldish cab so he had to talk through the gap in the perspex screen between us rather than use the intercom setup the more modern cabs have raine pushed me away ya i suppose we should ya she said with what i took to be obvious reluctance ha see i said wagging a finger at her i felt for my belt again she watched me then put hers on here she said helping me with one end thanks i sat back closing my eyes have a snooze why not raine said i opened my eyes looked at her im not tired i told her is it far ya fair bit to go yet she glanced at the driver then leaned over to me and said quietly get some rest youre going to need it she gave me one of those heavylidded looks again and stroked my hand in a manner i decided was distinctly carnal i grinned in what i hoped was not too lecherous a fashion and sat back closing my eyes if i start snoring im only pretending in a sorta postmodern ironic way okay ya right sure the taxi drove on grumbling and clattering through the latenight traffic it sounded a lot like my old landy very relaxing the rain swishing beneath the tyres and against the wheel wells sounded calming and soothing it was quite warm here in the back it made me think of darkened hotel suites i took a deep breath and let it out a little while to rest the eyes why not a snooze would do no harm on the other hand i didnt really want to drop off and start snoring or drooling or looking gross so maybe it wasnt such a great idea some time passed a male voice said quietly is that him gone yeah i think so said raine at least i thought it was her her voice sounded different we nearly there yet then nuvver five minutes that was weird i thought behind my closed eyes with my chin somewhere near my chest had i dropped off just a little but why was raine asking the driver if they were nearly there yet didnt she know the way home maybe shed just moved in but what did the driver mean when he asked her is that him gone just check hes out will ya doll check hes out what the fuck was that about i felt a hand stroke mine then pinch the skin i didnt react ken ken raine said quite loud i stayed just as i was my heart had started to speed up then she said yeah hes gone roight what was going on here what the fuck was going on where were we going anyway had she given the driver an address as we got in id kind of assumed shed told him her home address while i was getting in and smacking my head off the top of the door frame but had there been time wouldnt i have heard something i couldnt remember shit i was drunk of course i wasnt going to remember stuff like that but then the taxi had appeared really fortuitously too just rolled up in the damp midst of a wet friday some time between theatre and bar chucking out time on shaftesbury avenue just appeared its yellow for hire light already off if my hazy memory served me right ready and waiting at the kerb just like that and it had seemed as if shed been looking for it but then she would have been looking for a taxi any taxi but then we came back to this check hes outyeah hes gone shit what the fuck was all that about hed expected me to be out to be gone to be unconscious sweet jesus h christ the whisky there had been something in the whisky what was that daterape drug i couldnt remember but something like that the drink shed insisted shed get then watched me drink or thought that was what she was watching while i suppressed a giggle and played my silly game and anointed phils jacket with the stuff instead distracting her making my adams apple go up and down smacking my lips and doing everything but wipe my mouth on my sleeve look im drinking it see its gone shed put something in it she must have what was that daterape stuff euthymol no that was a toothpaste wasnt it a fucking micky fucking finn in this fucking day and fucking age and id fucking fallen for it or would have if i hadnt been determined to salvage some dregs of sobriety from my drunken stupor for the purposes of hopefully fucking oh shit id sniffed it the whisky with the daterape drug or whatever it was id breathed it in how powerful was that stuff some must have stuck to my lips when i pretended to drink it was i falling into a drugged sleep now no no definitely not me nohow noway very awake and horribly edgily tensely sober with my heart hammering so hard im astonished that raine if thats really her name cant hear it that she cant see my entire body shaking with each thudding crashing flailing tremor of it you awwight the driver asks for one idiotic moment i think hes talking to me and for a totally deranged micromoment im actually about to answer him then the girl says yeah quite casually as though shes bored i open one eye very slightly the left one away from her where are we i have a vague feeling were somewhere in the east end but i dont know my head is down and i cant see much without raising it how long did the driver say five minutes yes it was five minutes but how long ago was that one minute ago two four i can see the little red telltale light on the door at my side near the handle of course cab doors lock while the vehicle is in motion safety device allegedly stop you doing a runner more like doesnt matter i cant just make a break for it when we slow down have to wait for a complete stop shit we slow down here and i start to get sweaty palms thinking about grabbing the door handle and sprinting off but then we speed up again i use the acceleration as a plausible excuse to let my head fall back my neck over the back of the seat now and my view through my halfclosed eye a bit better i sense raine looking at me i start snoring through the trembling blur of eyelashes i can see a lightly trafficked road and lowrise buildings i must really have dropped off were well away from the west end here we take a left into a darker quieter road what look like low warehouses and light industrial units line the road i see plentiful graffiti and billboards with old torn rainsodden posters flapping in the cold wind we go under a bridge engine echoing off the rivetstudded undersides of massive black girders nearly there the driver says mmhmm says raine we slow theres a brighter noisier road ahead and traffic lights just over these lights turning amber right thank fuck yeah i fink thats danny there i can see turning red uhhuh oh yes oh yes just stop right here on the far side of the busy traffic from wherever it is were going from whoever the fuck danny is the cab stops engine idling noisily the little red light by the door handle should click and go off now now theres a click i wait for the little red light to go off it doesnt something in my bowels makes a terrible trembling course through me squeezing cold sweat from every pore the driver taxi drivers can override the doorlocks stationary offswitch keeping it on hes locked us in im fucked these people can do whatever they want to me i may be about to die the lights are still red but the traffic crossing our path has just stopped the driver is reaching for the gear stick i sit up suddenly raine looks at me and her mouth starts to open as her eyes finish widening i click my seat belt unlocked and swing my right leg as hard as i can at the window to my left it shatters first time it feels like my leg does too but the windows gone in an almighty bang falling spraying to the street outside and the rubbermatted floor of the cab in a thousand squareedged little jewels glinting sodium in the streetlight the drivers shocked face turns towards me raine grabs my arm and i do something ive never done before ever i hit a woman punch her square in the nose and send her head whacking back against the door window on her side then im out of the smashed window on my side so fucking fast john woo would be proud of me turning on my back hands to the top of the frame and levering myself out with just some kicking flailing footwork to spoil the balletic beauty of it i land with a windexpelling whumpf on the road just as the taxi jerks forward and then screeches to a stop again nose dipping im rolling on the broken glass and bouncing to my feet starting to run theres shouting behind me and a door slamming more shouting from further away these both male female screaming now the road ahead is broad and almost deserted some parked cars one or two transits and lutons i angle for the pavement to put some of the parked stuff between me and them more shouting and screaming the wind roars in my ears as i run engine noise back there now im near the end of the street the engine behind me whines caught in the low gear of reverse then the engine seems to cut out theres a squeal of tyres a moment of silence and the engine screams handbrake turn i run out onto the street ahead at rightangles and pelt across a sudden burst of traffic horns blaring right and left as i leap a traffic island in one stride and spot a chip shop with a queue of people outside a hundred metres away i make the pavement just dodging a royal mail van which skids to a stop so close i have my arm stuck out and the grille nudges the flesh of my palm i run for the chip shop queue dodging between a few slowly walking people like gates on a downhill slalom course the royal mail van races past to my left the driver leaning out of the window shouting that im a fucking wanker and backing this up with a gesture there are two cars at the kerb just beyond the queue at the chip shop i splash through a puddle the rain is off i notice the cars beyond the chip shop are parked outside a little lit doorway and window with a cheaplooking sign above glaring yellowwhite above the pitted brickwork and spelling out the two most beautiful words in the most beautiful language in the universe minicabs i slow and look back just as i get to the queue but theres no taxi anywhere to be seen and nobody running i straighten my jacket run fingers through my hair and by the time i get to the first cab in the rank nodding first to the guy in the doorway and then at the car im actually whistling well do you ever look at the number of a cab when you get into one na craig admitted who does phil probably i said id called him on his mobile and home number but only got answer machines i still think craig said you should have gone to the police christ man i just wanted to get away yeah but yeah but what it was half eleven on a friday night the cops are going to be busy enough with fights and brawls and the usual weekend nonsense and what exactly would i be ringing up to report anyway i think i was being kidnapped i think somebody tried to spike my drink but if you want any proof youll have to get another guys jacket and test it for the drug if its still detectable i think some violence was planned for me but i dont know im fairly sure i was chased but thats not even illegal fucking hell the only definitely criminal things that actually happened were the things i did i smashed a cab window and i punched a woman in the face i fucking hit a woman man jesus christ that was something i had hoped to get through my whole life without doing like breaking a major bone or changing a nappy i sucked very hard on the j id wanted a brandy or something but craig had reckoned what i needed was a nice mellow smoke my very first thought once id got into the cab and told the guy to head for basildon this had to be east of wherever we were so it meant we didnt need to chuck a uey and go past the end of the road id been chased down was to call amy she lived in greenwich which was feasibly in the area and turning to her and up on her doorstep in an hour of need on the run from heavies might be just the sort of romantic icebreaker required to shift our relationship onto whatever next phase might be on the cards the last time id seen her had been on september when wed all sat together in kulwinder and fayes loft watching the unbelievable unfold until shed been called away by her boss then i thought of celia christ merrial maybe he was behind whatever had almost happened back there i dont know who id imagined might want to have me kidnapped and whisked off to the east end for whatever but of course celias husband had to be a prime suspect why the hell hadnt that been the first thing id thought of could this be anything to do with celia and me had we been discovered we thought wed been so careful but who really knew oh shit should i use the mobile number she didnt know i had try to warn her but if it wasnt anything to do with her with us and she discovered id taken her number without asking without telling her yeah but if all this was about us then it was entirely possible a phone call could save her life im ken by the way i said to the guy driving the minicab he was a strapping white lad with a shock of reddyed hair id sat beside him rather than in the back we shook hands dive dave ive a bit of a funny request yeah wossat can i use your mobile ive got one of my own but i need to use a different one please add a fiver to the fare its important here you go you are a saint sir i pulled out my own mobile cursored through to ceels entered but never used number and clicked it into daves sony the mobile phone you are calling is switched off another couple of tries got the same response no voice mail or message service available thanks i said to dave the driver handing him back his phone never got through i hesitated listen dave what i said about a fiver call it a tenner but in the unlikely event a woman anybody ever phones about a call made like now just say you dialled the same wrong number or something you never saw me i wasnt here the lad quoted grinning used to work in a boozer mate lying to people on the phone looking for somebody they finks there is like second nature yeah well cheers i said i tried amy next on my own phone but her mobile was switched to message and the landline to her place in greenwich was on answer with a long beeptime of stacked messages before the tone i sighed and rang craig he was in sitting watching tv about to go to bed okay dave i said change of destination i tried celias mobile again from a phone box near craigs place in highgate still nothing you should still go to the cops craig said again looking down at the big old geographia london street plan hed spread on the kitchen table to see if we could work out where it had all happened idiotically i hadnt thought to get the number or the name of the minicab company the first thing i remembered from the drive was seeing a sign for stratford station off to our left as wed headed in the general direction of essex report what happened craig insisted because of what might happen because of what might happen i echoed supposing something else does and it has to be something the cops get involved in if what happened tonight comes out theyre going to want to know why you didnt mention anything about it youve got to report it man the cops might be able to find out if an old taxi gets its left window repaired over the next couple of days i doubt that a kidnap that never really happened will be far up their list of priorities just now plus i have said one or two unflattering things about the boys in blue over the years i observed dryly i hoped i was still shaking and my leg hurt where id kicked the window out i was going to have a splendid bruise in a day or two there were various other mysterious aches pains grazes and likely bruises i couldnt recall picking up in all the excitement plus my hands and fingers were a little cut where id grabbed the window craig had handed me a bottle of tcp and some kitchen towel and told me to get on with it i know he said but you still have to report it what exactly is this stuff that might happen what were you thinking of i dont know craig stretched his lanky frame back in the kitchen chair and put his hands behind his head you dont have any idea who these people were they were both white southeast england maybe london there was somebody i didnt see called danny the place i was being taken to was in the east end and the driver seemed to know the area id guess hes a proper taxi driver done the knowledge it was i gestured at the map in front of us there somewhere suspects motives craig asked grinning stop enjoying this you bastard no im being serious can you think of any suspects and what their motives might be oh jesus do you want them alphabetically or in order of appearance the world is basically composed of people who want me dead and my close friends im not sure those are mutually exclusive categories fuck off thats a tad paranoid even for you craig ive lost count of the death threats ive had over the years we have to report each one to the local nick they have a photocopied report form with my details already filled in the people who open my mail get danger money im not joking you told me it was dirty money okay its mostly shit not bombs but still the point is lots of people have claimed to want me dead and thats just the ones who feel a burning desire to tell me this could be fundamentalists of any persuasion a corporate hitjob craig sniggered oh come on excuse me i have affected the share price of large corporations thats a capital offence yeah ha ha colour me chortle but no you havent not alone craig said youre not an investigative reporter or anything ken youre a commentator you comment on what others have dug up if you didnt somebody else would people who do dig stuff up private eye mark thomas i dont know rory bremner i mean shit people have been trying to close down the eye for decades if maxwell couldnt and jimmy goldsmith couldnt i mean why would anyone bother trying to kill you did any of that make sense even to you i asked him im tired craig flapped one hand mr penfold and i have been in deep discussion most of the evening have you heard some of the things ive said about people about fundamentalists in parfuckingticular fundamentalists dont listen to your show khomeini didnt read the satanic verses so fucking what well they dont sound like fundamentalists do they white man and woman somebody called danny that ill give you i put the dead joint into the ashtray they dont sound like fundamentalist muslims anyway could be fundamentalist christians aryan nation militia types or something they cant all be wanking over pictures of ayn rand and polishing their desert eagles in south dakota my hand was still shaking man i really need a drink ive got a box of red banrock okay if its red and it has lots of alcohol in it thats all that matters craig rose sounds like your blood pal you ruddy sod my jacket stank of whisky im sorry i didnt see it lying there i lied dyou still have it i mean you havent washed it or anything have you exhibit a is in a binbag in my kitchen phil said he paused he shook his head i still cant believe you punched a woman for the last time i didnt have a fucking choice well craig said as long as you didnt enjoy it about as much as im enjoying this i muttered phil had picked craig and me up on saturday morning and taken us to the temple belle id been worried what i might find there id wanted reinforcements phil and craig knew each other so well they frequently had great sport with my insecurities telling me they were actually better friends with each other than they were with me this time they didnt do that but they ganged up and made me swear that if they helped me here id report what had happened to the police on the monday morning the houseboat was fine nothing had been disturbed no horses heads in the bed nothing there was a tool box in the cupboard under the stairs id rummaged around in it until i found a hammer which i suggested we took with us in case we were attacked but the guys just stood there and shook their heads in unison like theyd been rehearsing i put the hammer back we went for a pint and a light lunch then set off for the east end in search of the site of the previous evenings fun i found the place eventually haggersley street off bow road which was where the chip shop and the cab firm were it all looked very different in the fresh pale light of an october afternoon just past the rail bridge by the traffic lights there was still window glass on the road i took a handful we mooched warily around the culdesac on the far side of the lights where haggersley street ended in a dead end off devons road i think your birds have flown chum phil said kicking at an old lager can if they were ever here yeah thanks phil cheers i said phil was compared to craig rather more sceptical about my account of what had happened the night before probably because he had seen how drunk i was and maybe because of the jacket we were in a place of old crooked kerb stones peeling tarmac laid over ancient cobbles windscreen glass that crunched under foot like gravel burntout and abandoned cars with rusted panels and sagging plastic trim and framing it all on three sides tilted lengths of desultorily graffitied corrugated iron topped by rusting angle iron strung with thin strands of barbed wire jagged strands of sharp spaced knots decorated by the greyedout tatters of ruined black binliners fluttering in a damp wind like the prayer flags of a halfhearted monochrome hell some of the corrugated iron sections were crude gates all strung with ancient padlocks and grimy chains i took a stirrupstep up craig made me take my shoe off which would have made running away interesting and looked over the corrugated iron walls concrete aprons in front of abandonedlooking light industrial units freight containers sheds puddles piles of wooden pallets waste ground weeds more puddles there was nobody about not even any guard dogs came bounding out to greet me the rain was coming on again i hate this place utterly said phil seen enough craig asked me i can feel my lifeforce draining out through my soles phil muttered nobody wears grey socks any more ken yeah youre right i said tutting and detaching one sleeve from a snag in the barbed wire let us to fuck get thats you off the german beer until your grammar gets back to normal pal i tried calling ceel at least twice a day from a variety of phone boxes throughout central london i now knew her number by heart she never answered instead on the thursday just after id finished my show a package arrived by courier the package was slim and light like celia herself but i didnt dare hope i signed for it opened it and there glory be was a key card my mobile rang something inside me melted and went south for the winter from the mobiles tiny speaker ceels voice said one aldwych dome suite are you i started to ask but the line had clicked off i let my head drop my phone burred again what ceel said are you okay i asked almost choking yes she said sounding puzzled of course i smiled into the middle distance ill see you soon i couldnt fuck i just wanted to cuddle fully clothed ceel seemed more confused than annoyed but also more confused than sympathetic no i didnt get the taxis number i said who ever does i do oh yeah what was the number of the last taxi you four four one seven oh ceel youre kidding no i used always to leave gloves scarves bags umbrellas and so on in taxis strangely it was always easier to remember the taxis number than to all right all right i breathed kenneth dont you want to take your clothes off aah or mine well ah i think we need drugs ceel said decisively luckily i have contacts she was right do you know what john does when he is not with me or away on one of his trips overseas no do you want to know not particularly he goes caving he does what he goes caving he spelunks he descends into caverns under the ground mostly in england and wales but also abroad that i breathed is so not a gangster thing to do we were lying on a giant circular table in one of the rooms in the dome suite the dome itself in fact at the very top of the whole hotel we had made it comfortable with sheets and pillows from the bedroom two rooms away through the sitting area the dome room had numerous small high windows that looked straight down waterloo bridge partway up the aldwych and down most of drury lane if wed stood up wed also have had a view to part of the strand there were twelve severe formallooking seats spaced round the giant table even all the soft accoutrements hadnt made the solid surface all that comfortable the bed would have been more forgiving but this was how and where ceel had wanted it mobile phones do not work in caves she said after a long time i thought i thought twice in fact dont suppose he goes scubadiving too does he yes i thought some more why would he need that excuse i dont know that is why i think perhaps it is not an excuse there was silence for a while ceel cuddled up to me she hadnt quite managed to get the suite up to what she considered to be full operating temperature yet so perhaps she was cold i lay there perspiring gently and thought about what craig had said about love some time passed then she murmured into my shoulder you have my mobile number dont you i closed my eyes holding her had never felt more precious yes i admitted she said nothing for a while but i felt her give what might have been a small nod you have been careful she said i appreciate that i understand now why you were concerned im touched but please be even more careful you have the number committed to memory i know it by heart remove it from your phone all right thank you this girl was she very beautiful very attractive in a sort of obvious blond way ceel was silent for a while then she said i feel jealous i know i should not but i do im sorry me too well i feel jealous of your husband and yet there are times you and i meet up when the last person to make love to me was you i thought i dont know whats the more pathetic i said quietly the fact that that does actually make me feel a little better or the fact that we are clutching at this straw in the first place its not just about sex ceel i mean that im jealous he gets to be with you more than i do that you two can have something like a normal life together it is not very normal he is away so much no but you can walk across a street together holding hands another pause he never holds my hand youre admitting you assaulted this woman mr mcnutt it was selfdefence but yes i see oh shit i breathed there was no comeback nobody was going to press charges after all and of course as id expected the cops did nothing at least nothing they ever told me about they couldnt even test phils jacket for traces of rohypnol a visiting friend had assumed the jacket in the bag was to be taken to a dry cleaners and done just that never mind id fulfilled my part of the bargain and reported the incident to the police like a good little citizen well maybe like we should leak it to the press yuh the speaker was nina boysert mouth corp group pr chief and special adviser to sir jamie whatever the fuck that was supposed to mean she didnt say ya like raine sorry raine hers was more of a yuh meant the same thing we all looked at her this was her office an even more spacious one than station manager debbies not high up but wide and deep and airy and with a pleasant view over soho square also present were debbie phil and the groups chief inhouse legal mind guy boulen ah the police did say not to boulen pointed out wed covered this point about a minute ago boulen was an oddly rugged man to be a lawyer about my age tall and fitlooking and with a face that appeared windburnt strapping would be the word looked like he belonged halfway up a fell in the rain and cloud manfully scrutinising a compass and leading a bunch of deprived kids on a characterbuilding hike softly spoken though home counties accent yuh but like theyve got their job to do and weve got ours right we have to think whats best for the group nina was businesssuit posh long not inelegant face perfect teeth and silky skin black hair bobbed deep voice shed been headhunted for the mouth corp from an internationally renowned management consultancy firm still under thirty may i call you nina i asked her with a smile ah yuh yuh sure ms boysert i said not smiling my life might be in danger im not entirely sure from what youve been saying whether youve fully grasped that fact im asking for help from my professional colleagues and from the firm that employs me now it was the now that did it phil jumped in after that of course what id wanted to say was listen bitch fuck the group fuck the shareholders and fuck sir jamie too i was the one being bundled off into the depths of the east end in the middle of the night to have fuck knows what done to me lets focus on whats best for me but id reined myself in and come out with a little speech that i thought was far more polite even with the sarky and probably unnecessary bit at the start about not using the womans first name i think phils right boulen said to whatever phil had said id kind of missed it still glaring at ms corporate good this is a legal matter and we have to take our lead from the police yuh but im thinking like what about the publicity i mean this would be quite big news yuh im seeing the front page of the standard top djs death threat hell and a photograph of course something like that yuh i mean thats big we cant ignore that you almost cant buy that there was an awkward silence i said are you for fucking real look ken phil said quickly rising and clapping me on the shoulder youve had a tough couple of days you dont really need to be here i can look after things why dont i meet you in the bough half an hour say yeah he waggled his eyebrows at me guy boulen was nodding fractionally his expression somewhere between a grin and a grimace debbie was looking at the floor what a splendid idea i got up looked round them excuse me as i got to the door i heard a deep female voice say was it something one of us said yuh well done phil said clinking glasses in the groucho that evening we were in the wee nook with the blue plaque up in the snooker level you told the police what happened and to my utter astonishment you didnt tell nina boysert exactly what you think of her proud of you thank you so fucking much do i get a badge or something im having a special commemorative medal struck tomorrow did she shut the fuck up about leaking the story eventually or did you just throw her out the fucking window that would be option a there phil nodded though it did take boulen and i threatening to resign if she insisted on going ahead i did also somewhat talk up your acquaintanceship with sir jamie she might have got the impression that if anything happened you didnt like youd take it up with the dear owner the next time youre playing polo together i shook my head drank i bet she leaks it anyway i dont know phil thought wouldnt like to hazard a guess but i wouldnt be at all surprised ive never met anybody who thought quite so much like a spreadsheet well never mind fuck it fuck her hmm well after you hey look phil can i stay at your place tonight jos away again is she yeah i hate sleeping alone on the boat well no you cant sorry oh come on no im vulnerable dont abandon me stay with craig hes got nikki staying for the weekend so they dont want me there so get a hotel i dont want me there i what nothing let me stay at yours phil come on please no youre probably safe now they know youll be wary im trying to be fucking wary thats why im asking you to let me stay with you no please no why not i have a friend staying what the compulsively tidy jacketcleaner what about ed hes away oh forgot to tell you those winsome people rang again just before we left the breaking news company yes the thing with this holocaust denial bloke is back on second or third week in december though thats still tentative tentative really right but dont go changing the subject come on let me stay over youll never know im there no stay in a hotel or go back to the boat look man im fucking frightened dont you understand you have to face it sometime i dont want to fucking face it i want to fucking live even so im thinking about asking ed to get me a gun oh for goodness sake six london eye nah mate sorry no ed come on na now thats wrong ken you shouldnt even have asked me lets forget you did look at the view instead i sighed and leaned back against the curve of glass we were on the london eye riding one of the big bulbous cars on its grand fortyminute rotation through the air we were about twothirds of the way round now slowly descending it was a bright endofnovember day and the air was clear most of eds extended family were here laughing and pointing and generally having a fun time ed had reserved the car for us the blazered attendant and i were the only white people on board id become quite worried on the way up it had suddenly struck me that the eye would be a perfect terrorist target the supporting legs stretched out behind it looking i thought a lot like the marching hammers in the wall splaying down to the ground by the side of the old glc building they and their supporting wires and cables suddenly appeared terribly vulnerable jesus id thought a big enough bomb there blowing the whole structure forward to fall into the river just a bridge away from westminster but we were on the way down now my atypical paranoia subsiding along with the gradually flattening view downriver the tall white support towers of the new works on the hungerford bridge seemed to echo the architecture of the eye itself ed had just come back from djing in japan and this was the first chance id had to catch up with him it had taken a good twentyfive minutes and the passing of the best of the view at the top of the circle for me to get him alone would you get me a gun if i was black wot ed said loudly incredulous a few of his family turned and looked at us i guess wed made it obvious this was meant to be a private word he lowered his voice listen to youself man ken i mean fuckin ell i shook my head patted his forearm and sat forward my head in my hands im sorry i said sighing im sorry ed that was that was truly truly shit i look mate i can see youre really shaken up wif this dont blame you ed leaned down so that he was level with me and he could say even more quietly but a shooter is not going to solve your problems itll just add to them plobly its only for selfdefence i said lamely but id given up i knew i wasnt going to convince him worse i knew he was probably right yeah thats what they all say chummy youre not denying you know people who could get me one though are you course not but come on ken ed said he gestured at the mass of people in the car look at this lot i looked at them they were a colourful happy mostly female bunch all bright dresses and laughter and flashing smiles youd rarely see so many smiles in the one place these days at least not without a bottle of pills eds mother saw me looking at her and waved her smile as wide as the view of london i returned the wave and could not help but smile back at her i was well in her good books because id remembered to tell her as we boarded the car that her hair looked wonderful i mean it did look good but it wasnt the sort of thing id usually comment on because well im a man but ed had given me the tip years ago that with black women in particular complimenting them on their hair was a bigger step into their affections than anything else he could think of certainly than anything else he could think of that was free at the time id told him this was appallingly cynical and accused him of belonging to that vast and mostly black movement sexists against racism but of course id used it ruthlessly ever since im not some fuckin yardie nutter ed told me nodding at his family i got all them to fink of an a career im a bleedin businessman these days know what i mean i dont need the sorta people who never leave the ouse wifout a uzi ive seen what that leads to ken an its shit it just does the job the cops an the racists want done for them fuckin ell look at the states amount of blackonblack is fuckin heartbreakin man the amount of bruvvers in jail an on def row is fuckin obscene i know i sighed ive mentioned this on the show yeah well a lot of that is down to fuckin ordnance mate an unless you got no uvver choices which you ave an you know zactly wot youre doin which you dont you just dont want to get involved im not asking you to hand me a piece i just want a name a number a place to go what was that pal of yours that did the time robe couldnt he na not robe loss contact avent i just a number ed i cant do that ken you mean you wont i cant wif a clear conscience you know what i mean yeah i said i know what you mean if you feel freatened in london take a holiday go back to scotland maybe ive got commitments ed a show to do ive got a contract yeah well but maybe somebodys got one out on you thats why i thought a means to defend myself look either theyre so crap you wont need a gun to get one over on them like you already ave or theyre so good avin a glock down the back of your s aint gonna make a blind bit a difference you ever see leon i looked at him you know i think you were right earlier we should just admire the view i didnt want to leave london i liked it here part of it was pride not wanting to run part of it was fatalism depending who might or might not be after me maybe they could get me anywhere so i was better off where i had the most friends even if the bastards wouldnt provide sanctuary or the means to defend myself part of it was i had a living to make and a job to do which i happened to enjoy i bought a big long maglite torch a sixcell job even longer than the ones id seen security people carrying a good strong beam but at half a metre long an even better club it fitted neatly into the angle between the headboard of the bed and the mattress and sometimes if i woke up during the night especially if jo was away id reach out and feel its smooth massy diamondcut coldness and be reassured and fall asleep again one thing i hadnt told ed was that capital live and mouth corp were in on it now phil had insisted and when i checked with paul my agent hed confirmed that there was a clause in my contract that meant i had to report any material threat to my life my wellbeing or my potential ability to fulfil my contract to present the show i should have felt outraged but actually i felt relieved sir jamie himself had phoned me from la assuring me that id be looked after mouth corps head of security a grizzled toughlooking exsas geezer called mick beezley had the alarm system on the temple belle replaced a new cctv monitor added on the quayside linked to mouth corps own security monitoring centre and an xray machine installed in the post room we were these days already looking out for anthrax a satellite tracking system was added to the land rover also feeding in to the monitoring centre something called a category four thatcham alarm system apparently made the landy virtually impossible to interfere with or nick except by stealth helicopter i didnt dare point out that adding all this electronic wizardry to something that was basically diesel clockwork and string had probably increased its value and presumably therefore its attraction to those of a thieving disposition by about two thousand per cent i was told i could even have a bodyguard for times when i felt i might be especially vulnerable though from past experience i suspected i was most vulnerable when i was being led by the dick by some flirtatious floozy and didnt want anybody else around in the first place with the possible exception of her twin sister i said id think about the bodyguard idea this is from the boss mick beezley growled handing me a chunky box the boss was how he referred to sir jamie it was a watch a very chunky watch with dials within dials and a rotating bezel with lots of marks and notches and tiny figures on it for working out when you might dream of making your last payment on it and it finally becoming yours and a variety of buttons and knobs including one very big one that looked like you could attach big ben to it and have a fair stab at winding the bastard it looked like the sort of watch small boys used to think looked really cool not nowadays now they covet the sort of smooth highly postmodern spoon i was wearing the thing looked like it was probably waterproof to the bottom of the marianas trench but it also looked like the sort of watch there would be no point waterproofing because it was so fucking heavy it would drag you straight to the bottom the instant you dived into the briny i stared at it then at the piece of simply elegant sculpture on my wrist and then at the scarcelylesschunkythanthewatch features of mick beezley what is this i asked him fucking james bond that is a breitling explorer that is beezley rumbled instructions included but basically if you pull this big button here hard a wire comes out and a signal goes out to a satellite only for use in genuine emergencies otherwise youre left with a watch with a big long wire sticking out of it and no way of getting it back in again and a very expensive repair bill after a real emergency they repair it for free does it work indoors not so well right how much does it cost three and a half grand so dont lose it bloody hell and its not james bond youve been able to buy these over the counter for years i studied it ive obviously been shopping in the wrong jewellers i lifted it up it wasnt as heavy as id anticipated but it was heavy enough jesus it does tell the time too i take it beezley looked at me i looked at him after a bit i scratched my head and said do they teach you that look in the sas okay were back to that phonevibrator thing for those of you new to the show this is our longrunning project to get somebody to build a mobile phone of the correct dimensions and degree of ah proofness to be used by ladies as an intimate comfort device i think that was the euphemism we settled on wasnt it phil i recall so phil agreed from the other side of the desk so were trying to get somebody to make it come on there must be some enterprising manufacturer out there they can make the damn things waterproof these days whats the problem not new technology okay so there might have to be a thin sort of aerial thingy hanging down again theres a precedent phil supplied it has to be safe it has to be shaped it has to be comfortable and it has to work phone sex will take on a new meaning when a woman says call me youll know she really means it even though you also know youll probably never get an answer till home them cows does come thank you phil i paused phil youre looking smug i realise you labour under the pathetic delusion that you deserve to look like that all the time because youre just so intrinsically fabulous but why do you look so particularly smug right at this point in time that was a song lyric what till home them cows does come yes fascinating joni mitchell he said quietly smiling or was it melanie safka then he frowned i couldnt help it i burst out laughing you dont say again not precisely on the button in terms of our target audience philip permit a middleaged man his little foibles right foible away anyway come on i said were talking to one of the most vibrant cities in the world out there phil guffawed it cant be beyond the wit of human kind to invent a phone itd be an utter pleasure for a woman to use and men phil chipped in i raised my eyebrows at him some men he said shrugging just a thought well we do know you are of that persuasion yourself phil but well phil said taking off his glasses and starting to clean them with his hanky being gay doesnt automatically mean you feel a desire you might even say a burning desire to put electronic vibratey type things anywhere near your situpon area give the words ring tone a new resonance though wouldnt it i said laughing despite myself phil grinned anyway he said lazily maybe this isnt really perfect morningshow material i glanced at the callmonitoring screen phil from the screen here i can see there are literally integers of people ringing in to disagree with you lets hear what the people have to say shall we lets i agreed but listeners be warned any more calls consisting primarily of a buzzing noise and the sounds of human passion will be dealt with ruthlessly or recorded and used later on a premiumrate line phil added up close jimmy i said firsttime caller from lambeth wants to make a point about the show what would that be james i clicked the line open a quiet even male voice with no real accent said theyre going to need a new presenter for it dead man then the line went dead phil could see the expression on my face he bleeped the lot i made a cutoff gesture and said woh serious bleepwork there mother ive told you not to call me at work hopefully well find somebody with a civil tongue in their head on line five marissa thats you what have you got for us ullo ken yeah id like to place an order for one of them phones but not too little a one i clicked her off now that is more like the calibre of call we need and want on this show more after hey some good music how did that get in the spooks i hit play and sat back shaking phil looked at me you all right im fine i said though i didnt feel it want to take a break we can go backtoback with the next few tunes i took a deep breath no fuck them proceed as normal well okay but think we should maybe zoo it up a little phil suggested get kayla and andi in too i knew what he was thinking of have all four of us chattering on air just one big squabbling family and no more risky phone calls i glanced into the control room where both our assistants were sitting looking serious and nodding through the glass at us yeah i said why not i thought we werent taking any more anonymous calls debbie the station manager said we were in a small meeting room in the middle of the building her office was being redecorated phil and i were there also kayla and andi and trish eaton station human resources manager i was still trying to work out what personnel had done to fall out of favour we never kayla protested andi whod also been taking caller details over the phones nodded supportively the number came up on the auto screen as normal phil told debbie it was a mobile ive passed the number on to the police but they think its almost certainly stolen or maybe a payasyougo with no record of who bought it kayla sat back looking justified well then maybe you just shouldnt take any more phone calls at all what do we think trish suggested she was a plumpish matronly type with youthfully smooth facial skin and finely drawn eyebrows well its not our unique selling point certainly i said but its an important part of the show im loathe to lose it i looked round them all so far these people havent repeated trying to kidnap me so maybe they wont repeat this either and we do still have the threesecond delay this is even assuming the two things are linked phil said looking from me to debbie the thing in the taxi and the call this morning yes i said lets look on the bright side maybe this is just a normal death threat i looked round them trying to appear reassuring and reassured they were all looking at me what do you need to take some leave debbie asked trish was nodding oh shit id misjudged it no i said i lowered my voice both in volume and tone and i dont believe in giving in to what is basically personal terrorism either i said firmly i say we carry on as normal otherwise the bad guys win i dont think any of us i glanced meaningfully up at the portrait of the dear owner looking down at us from the wall want to be a party to that especially in the current climate there is a war on after all i looked at trish and debbie now they were both nodding and i knew id won that was the sort of bullshit they understood ohkay debbie said slowly but any more calls like that and we pull the phone lines agreed we all looked around nodding maybe you should get another job jo suggested why i love my job i protested do you jo stopped and turned to me we were walking down bond street on the second sunday in december ken you hate most of what you do and what youre involved in what are you talking about think about it would you listen to capital live if you didnt have to are you mad of course not the music you play like that dont be ridiculous its almost all shite during the day fucking westlife and hearsay things have come to a pretty grisly pass when you play jamiroquai and they sound like a breath of fresh air what about the people who phone in with a few honourable exceptions theyre dullards deadbeats opinionated dingbats and bigoted fuckwits the adverts dont even get me started on the fucking ads fellow djs vapid cretins offer them a straight choice between opening another supermarket for a fat fee and sucking sir jamies cock for nothing and their single brain cell would fuse the tories new labour american republicans the cia the imf the wto rupert murdoch conrad black the barclay brothers whatdyoucallhim berlusconi george dubya bush ariel sharon saddam hussein thingy farrakhan osama bin laden the entire saudi royal family muslim fundamentalists the christian right zionist settlers the uvf continuity ira exxon enron microsoft tobacco companies private finance initiatives the war against drugs the cult of the shareholder she only stopped i assumed because she ran out of breath i stared at her for a moment then shook my head how could you leave out thatcher she spread her arms there is just so much you hate ken your life your working life its like full of stuff and people and things and organisations you just cant stand youre trying to make some sort of point here arent you in fact forget your working life your leisure life too can we go to the states on holiday ive told you not until democracy is restored okay venice rome with that corrupt fuck in charge surrounded by his fascist australia with their racist immigration policy no fucking china not while the butchers of tiananmen square are still i rest my case is there anywhere iceland iceland id love to go to iceland so long as they dont start whaling obviously plus we have been to egypt and then theres france i feel cool about going to france ive finally more or less forgiven them for sinking the rainbow warrior ive even started buying french wine again youve always bought french wine no i havent it was embargoed i had personal sanctions against it until about six months ago so what the hell is champagne ah champagne is different though admittedly i ought to despise it on principle as a sort of geographical closedshop i look forward to the day when a workers cooperative in new zealand can produce the equivalent of a krug jesus is there anything you really like without qualification theres loads of things i like like what apart from the usual suspects im not talking about films i laughed me neither i mean apart from friends and family and world peace and little babies and nelson bleedin mandela yeah exactly what students students yeah it seems to be fashionable to be horrible about the little fuckers but i think theyre okay if anything theyre a bit too studious these days not rebellious enough but basically theyre all right what else cricket i honestly believe cricket may well be the greatest game in the world it is total heresy for a scotsman to admit to this and i entirely see the point of the american who said that only the english could invent a game that lasts for five days and can still end in a draw but i just cant help it i love it i dont completely understand it and i still dont know all the rules but theres something about its bizarrely erratic pace its sheer complexity its psychology that just lifts it above any other sport even including golf which is full of grotesquely overpaid reactionary bastards but is still a thing of skill and craft and beauty and was of course invented in scotland like so much other truly neat stuff thats still only two things i clicked my fingers liberals the chattering classes political correctness basically im for em again they get a bad press from veracitychallenged moral midgets employed by greedy zillionaires to wankoff bigots but not me i stand right by them theyre my kind of people liberals want niceness what the hell is wrong with that and bless them they do it in the teeth of such adversity the world people are disappointing them all the time constantly throwing up examples of what total shites human beings can be but liberals just take it all they hunker down they grit their sandals and they keep on going thinking well of people reading the guardian sending cheques to good causes turning up at marches getting politely embarrassed by workingclass oafism and just generally getting all hot under the collar when they see people being treated badly thats the great thing about liberals they care for people not institutions not nations not religions not classes just people a good liberal doesnt care whether its their own nation or their own religion or their own class or their own anything thats being beastly to some other bunch of people its still wrong and theyll protest about it im telling you its a sick sick nation that turned the word liberal into an expletive but there you are the yanks think basketball is a sport and that theres nothing cruel and unusual about taking four minutes to kill a man by putting thirty thousand volts through him did you say you liked political correctness news to me political correctness is what rightwing bigots call what everybody else calls being polite or what everybody else calls not being a rightwing bigot jo looked at me through narrowed eyes i bet i could find tapes of you banging on about how political correctness was something else to hate like everybody else i have my own definitions of what is what and i would never seek to deny that a few stupid people can take a perfectly good idea too far but i stand by my contention that political correctness is more sinned against than sinning besides a chap can change his mind oh and journalists i like them what jo said incredulous you hate journalists no i dont i just hate the ones who make up quotes subsidise criminals hound the innocent collude with the truly talentless and otherwise squander their undoubted gifts on tat a disgrace they assuredly are but a journalist determined to get to the truth of a story expose lies and corruption to tell people whats really going on to make one lot of humanity care for another lot or even just start thinking about them weightingold they are in fact weightinmicrochips guardians of liberty mean more to democracy than most politicians fucking secular saints course it helps if theyre liberal too dont shake your head at me young lady im being serious now i know youre taking the piss i swear im not i said waving my arms and i just thought of something else i like yeah what i nodded this city london yep but youre always going on about how the tube is dirty smelly and dangerous and the traffic is awful and the air stinks and the people arent as friendly as they are in glasgow and the drinks are too small and expensive and its not as exciting as new york or as civilised as paris or as clean as stockholm or as cool as amsterdam or as groovy as san francisco or yeah yeah yeah but just turn and look behind you look jo turned round and looked at the shop window shed had her back to while wed being going through all this stuff wed included bond street in our sunday afterlunch stroll because id wanted to look in some posh jewellers and see if they had my excessive new watch the shop wed happened to stop outside was a jewellers and its window was full of fish slices suspended in the space behind the glass like a surreal hail of twinkling trowels it was the rabinovich collection of antique and modern silver fish slices to quote the elegant sign in the window we were a few doors down from a shop called zilli which seemed somehow appropriate how the fuck i asked can you not love a city that throws up stuff like that jo was shaking her head she was blond again and had taken to teasing her short hair into little meringuelike spikes she stuck her arm through mine she was wearing a silver puffa jacket i wore an old raf greatcoat an uncle had given me when i was seventeen come on she said im getting cold we started walking again heading south back towards the river and music of course i said i love music but you just said you hated the stuff you have to play yeah because its commercial effluent its the sonic equivalent of a coke or a mcdonalds it fills you up but its just productionline shit and theres precious little in there thats really any good for you the music i love is the music people make because they have to because they need to from their souls not their wallets you dont believe in souls i dont believe in immortal souls i just mean the kernel of who you are not anything superstitious yeah well be thankful you just have to play the stuff and dont need to get involved in the process of making it you make it sound like pies pies yeah you know that thing about it being a good idea if you like eating pies never ever to see how they were made and what goes into them yeah well jo said hoisting one steelstudded eyebrow believe me there are a lot of pie bands out there i believe the same applies to sausages ditto i looked over to the far side of the street at the dkny shop i remembered ceel telling me about its five thousand red twintowers tshirts nearly three months ago in the december cold i shivered for the dark baking heat of that hotel room that had been another solitary feature of todays walk one i couldnt share with jo our route had taken us past a few of the hotels id been in with ceel we had passed claridges just ten minutes earlier and id almost suggested that we went in for a drink or a pot of tea or just the chance to pretend we were guests and get to ride in a lift that actually had a uniformed liftoperator but in the end some prophylactic instinct some grudgingly acknowledged requirement to obey celias stricture about keeping our affair as separate as possible from the rest of our lives prevented me is that your watch jo said stopping at another jewellers window and nodding at a display of chunkily sparkling breitlings on a background of piled yellow cloth i glanced at the armlengthening bracelet of heavy metalwork on my left wrist no i said not nearly expensive or complicated enough jo looked at my new watch and shook her head as we walked on that thing makes you look ten years older you know dont diss my timepiece ho it makes you look like you should be driving a roller and shopping for fucking hell those we both stared at and then walked quickly past a window containing two large thrones mere chairs they were not made of cut crystal and red velour holy shit did we really see those i feel ill we walked to the embankment via st jamess park through similarly sauntering locals and clumps of tourists amongst coots storks black swans and panhandling squirrels ahead the top of the london eye stood out against sky revolving almost imperceptibly over the departmental buildings of whitehall like an ironic skeletal halo hey skating cool almost by definition i muttered look can we head back after this my feet are sore yeah okay jo guided me into the great courtyard of somerset house where a temporary ice rink had been set up for the winter holidays strings of lights articulated the wide quad tall windows columns arches and chimneys looked down upon the scene where hundreds of people ambled about sat swaddled in thick clothes outside little cafés or stood watching the skaters who circulated above the inscribed white ice like a slow flat sweep of leaves caught in a stirring wind i could smell coffee fried onions and mulled wine above us was a watercolour sky hues bleeding and feeding and fading into each other as the light started to wane above the skeins of slowly drifting cloud on the ice people laughed and shrieked holding on to each other or the sides of the rink doubled over feet skidding squeals echoed off the courtyards imposing architecture as people fell thumping to the cold scarred surface of the rink a gap opened in the crowds on the ice there was a blur of rising blue as somebody jumped and that was when i saw it was celia she was dressed in a powderblue skating outfit tights a short flared skirt and a sort of tight tunic with a high neck and long sleeves she wore brown gloves and white skates her hair was gathered up rising to the top of the jump that had first caught my attention she twisted sleekly in the air spinning once then landed square on her right blade knee bent her left leg held out straight behind her the quiet smack of her blade landing sounded across the ice between the circulating bodies she sliced away arms out to balance herself sizzing across the ice in a wide slowly tightening spiral she skilfully avoided a couple of other skaters and then with an elegant little skip turned to skate backwards into a clearing space near the centre of the rink stooping and tensing her body for another jump people got in the way and i lost sight of her i moved to the metal fencing describing the edges of the rink putting my hands on the cold tube of rail trying to see her again lengths of blue plasticised canvas were tied to the fencing and i could feel one of the plastic ties under my left hand my mouth felt cold and dry and a swirl of wind made me feel the tears in the corners of my eyes i saw her once more as the crowds on the ice parted again and her skimming sinuous course brought her gliding on a metal hiss towards me like a fabulously exotic alien creature fallen into our mundane world from a higher reality i suddenly realised two things the first was that i had never really seen this woman in daylight before the second was that she was the most beautiful thing i had ever beheld she swivelled poised jumped and landed and then swung into a neat spin perfectly centred not ten metres away she brought her arms in and raised them above her head the spin speeded up and her slim body became a tall blurred pillar of light blue above a spray of white reflected light strobing off the glittering blades of her boots she came out of it and pushed away again edges aslant across the rasping surface a smattering of applause from people on and off the ice followed her and she smiled but didnt otherwise acknowledge the acclaim or look anybody in the eye she passed only a couple of metres away from me and i swivelled to watch her her expression was diffident almost embarrassed a blush of rose glowed beneath the lightbrown skin of her face a body leaned alongside me rubbing against my side shes good jo said putting her arm through mine again yes was all i could find to say celia went with the circulating people for a while serene and smooth and steady huh got all the gear too jo said looks okay on her yeah fancy a glühwein hmm i said oh yeah yeah good idea my round you going to stay here ah yeah okay back in a mo when she came round the next time celia was looking at the spectators as if watching out for somebody she saw me and did a brief doubletake but her expression barely wavered she skated past me not looking at me scanning the crowds further round the boundary then waved to somebody there and came to a stop at the edge of the ice about twenty metres away round the perimeter mr merrial was standing there the giant blond guy id assumed was his bodyguard when id seen them leaving sir jamies party back in april stood at his side i was amazed i hadnt noticed him mr merrial was talking to his wife he looked right at me for a moment and nodded though not in a way that meant hello i felt like an ice sculpture frozen fragile ultimately doomed celia took the briefest of looks in my direction my mouth had gone very dry as if the saliva had frozen to my gums and teeth the ground the whole huge courtyard seemed to tip beneath my feet i gripped the metal rail tighter in front of me a girl almost doubledover on the ice felt her way past me laughing creasing the plastic canvas as she pulled herself along mr merrial was still looking at me his pale pinched face looking very white above the thick black coat he wore his face was all there was to see he wore gloves a thick scarf and a politburo hat celia was shaking her head the big blond guy was looking at me too now oh shit i looked away trying to appear relaxed i watched the other skaters some other people were quite good too doing jumps and spins where they could find the space i brought my right elbow in just reassuring myself that my mobile was still on my belt had i turned it on this morning i didnt always on a sunday i couldnt remember for sure i suspected i hadnt i shook my left wrist feeling the suddenly reassuring weight of the big watch i risked a sideways glance celia was still shaking her head looking from her body language as if she was arguing or pleading with her husband he was nodding then shaking his head celia spread her arms in what looked like a gesture of defeat tipped her head to one side was greeted with a nod and then skated quickly away pushing towards the far side of the rink i quickly looked back at the other skaters oh fuck we hadnt been discovered had we he didnt know did he oh fuck why did we have to come here why couldnt we have caught a bus or a taxi back home from the embankment why hadnt i thought that of course celia skated so she might be here i might see her and of course if she was here she would probably be with her husband why hadnt i just slunk away the instant id noticed her why did i have to stand like a lovestruck adolescent staring at her why did she have to see me and do that tiny fatal doubletake why did merrial have to be so fucking observant oh shit why the fuck wasnt life a computer game where you could go back and relive the last few minutes and make a different choice i looked back again the big blond guy had disappeared i looked round as frantically as anyone can without actually moving their head i couldnt see him anywhere how the hell could i miss him jesus they wouldnt try anything here would they too many people and there were cops around id seen two lots at least merrial had gone too he mr nott said a voice at my back i froze staring down at the ice a pale flash of blue somewhere out there i turned john merrial the man put his hand out i shook it his face was slim almost delicate close up he looked slightly sad and infinitely wise his eyebrows were thin and very black lips thin and very pale eyes bright blue contained by the coat the scarf and the fur hat his face looked unreal somehow like something twodimensional seen upon a screen hello i said my voice sounded very small that was my wife there in blue he said his voice was quiet almost accentless i saw a massive blond head over the crowds behind him very good i said gulping the words isnt she thank you yes she is he narrowed his eyes i think we were both at a party jamie werthamley threw werent we back in the spring limehouse tower we were never introduced but i think i saw you now youve been pointed out to me i believe we were i said im fucking your wife im fucking your wife im fucking your wife i kept thinking some suicidally insane bit of my brain wanting to blurt it out to just say it to get this over with to make the worst that could happen actually happen and not have to keep imagining it how is jamie he smiled fine last time i saw him which was at that same party come to think of it the party where i met your wife and snogged her and felt her up and agreed to this patently suicidal affair in the first place good pass on my regards will you oh you mean youre not going to kill me right now ah happily certainly yes he looked past me out to the ice my wife listens to you on the radio he said yes and that hand you just shook has been inside her sweet cunt see this tongue these lips think of her ears her nipples her clitoris really im im very flattered he gave a thin smile she doesnt want me to ask you this but i know shed be very happy if you played a request for her sometime well we dont really do requests i heard some fuckwit part of my brain say what oh he said looking down for a moment was i fucking crazy his coat looked thick and very dark and glossy did i really want to die that fucking much he wore narrow black highly polished brogues and very fine black leather gloves though hed taken off the right one to shake my hand but i said clapping my hands together and smiling for for for somebody im shagging the fucking arse off for hours on end whenever i get the opportunity for a friend of sir jamies and and for such a beautiful ah iceskater i think we can make an exception i nodded merrial was smiling now in fact im certain we can i told him because you see i have absolutely no principles whatsoever when it comes right down to it and ill do anything anything at all to save my miserable lying hypocritical hide thats very kind mr nott he said evenly i appreciate it oh ah not at all i love doing favours for people i hate he twisted from the waist about two degrees as he said heres my card and the big blond guy with the metrewide shoulders was suddenly there at merrials side and presenting me with a plain white business card which i took quickly so they wouldnt see my trembling fingers call me if i can ever do you a favour ah right well you could die conveniently how about that i put the card in a pocket thank you mr merrial nodded slowly well we have to go now good to meet you and you you fucking nasty murdering gangster bastard mr merrial turned to go then stopped oh he said he smiled his bladethin smile again fucking hell you crime lord cunt i was just about getting my jangling nerves back into some sort of order and now youre giving me a fucking colombo moment i should tell you her name shouldnt i of course you shouldnt you dickhead theres no fucking need its celia ceel babe babe babe sometimes when im coming deep inside her oh well yes it might help its celia jane celia jane i blurted well done kenneth put plenty of emphasis in there clearly you do still want to die he nodded celia jane he reached out and patted my elbow once before turning away they moved off through the crowd the blond dude leaving a spacious wake celia sorry celia jane left the ice at one of the rinks access points and they met her there the blond guy produced a coat and a pair of shoes for her she didnt look at me and she held on to her husbands arm while she changed from the skates to the shoes i wiped my eyes with my hands when i opened my eyes again mr and mrs merrial and their bulky minder had gone i was still shivering when jo arrived back with two little polystyrene cups of steaming mulled wine here look like you need it too youre very pale you okay just fine thanks you fuckin spoke to the guy he shook hands wif you his wifes a fan what of kneecappings of mine you buffoon youre fuckin kiddin me man eds voice went very high the speaker in my mobile struggled to cope i filled in the details of meeting mr m at somerset house aow yeah they used to register stuff there didnt they

owes you a favour well thats what he implied but ask him to find out whos got it in for you then fuckin ell dedicate a whole show to his bitch an hell fuckin rub them out for you as well i think that might be a little excessive hes an excessive geezer mate yeah well i think ill keep him well away from whatever messes im already in wisdom kennif i drummed the fingers of my left hand on my right arm i was standing on the deck of the temple belle looking out at the dark waters jo was below opening some korean takeaway containers just delivered from a restaurant in chelsea id felt i just had to tell somebody at least something of what had happened that afternoon and ed had been the obvious choice or do you think maybe i should ask him for help i said i know hes a villain but he did seem quite friendly helpful almost i mean maybe na i dont really fink you should i was kiddin just you keep your skinny white ass away from people like that you sure im sure man yeah but he didnt seem that bad i mean listen im gonna tell you sumfink about your mr merrial what its a bit orrible but i fink you need tellin what then right i heard ed take a deep breath or possibly a toke hes got this really big fucker works for him right blond geezer built like a fuckin nuclear bunker ive seen him he handed me mr ms card this afternoon right well this is wot i heard from somebody wot was there when this appened once when mr merrial wants to find sumfink out from somebody wot does not want to tell him or if hes upset wif somebody right he has them tied to a chair wif their legs straight out an their feet tied to another chair and then the big blond guy comes an sits on their legs an bounces up and down wif increasin force until either they talk or their knees bend the wrong way and their legs snap oh for fucks sake oh jesus christ thats fucking sick an i eard this from a bruvver who is definitely wot youd call a usually reliable source too mate an not given to tellin milky whites he was taken along to see wot would happen to him if he ever crossed mr merrial actually i fink the bruvver must have tried on sumfink very slightly dodgy himself an mr m wanted to give him a ever so mild

reason anyway thanks for the warning no probs ill see you yeah you take care strenf bruvver bye i didnt look properly at mr merrials card until the following morning just before doing my undervehicle bombcheck and heading for work the merrials lived in ascot square belgravia i stopped at the side of the landy and wondered about putting their home number into my phone then decided i ought to i placed it in location overwriting celias mobile number i never had got round to removing it i still liked scrolling through to look at it sometimes but entering her home phone there seemed fitting somehow id barely finished doing this when the phone buzzed in my hand phil at the office it was another dull december day and the rain had just started i dealarmed and unlocked the landy and climbed in out of the rain as i said yup breaking news i put the keys in the ignition what about it its starting on jan fourteenth what next year kind of rushing things a bit arent they its a month away but its definite this time of course it is philip no its firmly scheduled and youre in it not the worlds most reassuring phraseology theyve started doing publicity and everything everything well the pr people are mentioning your name theres a buzz a sound so often associated with dead decaying things dont you find will you stop being so sodding cynical probably shortly after i stop being so damn alive i thought youd want to know youre right it was the uncertainty that was killing me if all you can do is be sarcastic then it should be a good show today i heard him laugh i went to start the landy then sat back again and waved my hands even though phil couldnt see me oh for christs sake i said why do tv people have to make such a big deal about everything its one fucking item on a minority interest telly show not an unknown play by shakespeare written on the back of the missing bit from the unfinished symphony i put my hand on the keys again phil said you on your way in better than being on the way out save it for the show safe journey its chelsea to soho phil not the parisdakar rally so well see you soon take care yeah bye i put the phone away i looked at my hand resting on the landys keys dangling from the ignition people kept telling me to take care i looked out across the landys battered bonnet still not twisting the key in the ignition it was raining quite hard now i sighed then got out and did the checkingforbombsunderthevehicle bit nothing there im all for globalism i mean if youre talking about the sort of globalisation that says stuff whatever you people voted for youll let us privatise your water and hike the prices five hundred per cent or else then no exclude me in what im for is the globalism of the united nations imperfect though it may be the globalism of arms treaties the globalism of the geneva convention possibly the next suspect piece of internationalism dubya and his chums will want to withdraw from the globalism of the international court of justice the us refuses to sign up for the globalism of antipollution measures and dyou know why phil because the winds know no boundaries the globalism of the the ground what the ground and the sea and space those are boundaries for the wind i hit the fx of a lonely desert wind blowing through a longabandoned ghost town tumbleweed rolling across the dust between the creaking wooden ruins what like that i said glaring at him possibly he was grinning back at me over his wall street journal i was just possibly on a roll there ive interrupted your flow havent i you are a veritable stopcock philip ubend beg pardon i thought id get that in before you did youre just a trust fund of straight lines this morning arent you its a living listen phil if i may be allowed to put on my serious voice for a moment oh no not another charity announcement no but philip as you know we dont tend to do requests phil looked surprised well we cant most of those you receive are anatomically impossible anyway i think youll find theres a small private clinic in tangier that would happily prove you wrong for a price philsywillsy but thats as maybe keep going na yesterday i bumped into somebody i met at a party once and i said id play a request for his wife phil blinked at me i raised the dead air stopwatch threateningly is that it he said sometimes phil its just banality all the way down is this a new spot on the show guess the relevance nope so for the lovely celia jane heres have a nice day from the stereophonics i hit play and swept the faders phil looked nonplussed he looked at the faders and listened to the song play in his headphones youre not even talking up to the vocals he said more to himself he spread his arms whats all this about i eased my cans down round my neck to give my ears a rest what you hear is what you get i told him i nodded at the unit spinning the cd we were going to play it anyway no extra paperwork involved the skin around his eyes crinkled you trying to get into this womans knickers phil i told you shes married phil laughed loudly since when has that ever stopped you you can be so cynical sometimes philip you want to watch it the windll change and youll stay that way its protective coloration around you chum whats wrong with playing a request we never do it so its a change there has to be an ulterior motive somewhere will you just leave it theres nothing going on i know the way your mind works ken there has to be youre more a creature of habit and ritual than you think you are i shook my head okay i confess i was put in a slightly awkward situation by a a friend of sir jamies i said glancing at the tracks run time on the play list and then at the studio clock ahhah theres no bleedin ahhah to it look the guys some sort of big shot he knows the dear owner we met unexpectedly yesterday and i sort of stumbled into promising id play a song for his missus who is a looker i bet phil said hes a big shot like i say they usually are see people like that with a plain or ordinarylooking woman and you know it must be love will you stop looking at me like that well this was unexpected i wanted to say thank you jesus what sort of christmas box do you tip your postman ceel smiled also i wont be able to see you again until after the new year im sorry ah well you had something planned this afternoon didnt you i shook my head nothing appointment with some lawyers they can wait youre not in trouble are you no i said its not my own lawyers just a statement about an accident i witnessed a month or two back so what are you doing over the holidays going home to the island yes mr m too yes and what about you staying here in london almost a year earlier it had been agreed id spend xmas with jo and her family in manchester but now jo would be abroad over christmas and new year dutifully helping addicta strike while the iron of fame was hot i couldnt even go back to see my own parents theyd decided long ago they were fed up with scottish winters and the whole seasonal rigmarole and had spent the last few holidays and would be spending the one upcoming in tenerife anyway im glad we could meet up now it was just luck that john had to leave this morning amsterdam again she looked at her watch which was all she was wearing a flicker of a frown had passed across her face as shed pronounced the word amsterdam however we only have until two thirty i levered myself up on one elbow and looked at her in the soft light spilling from the bathroom and a reading light above the scrolltop desk she lay luxuriantly legs spread browngold hair strewn across the white sheets and one plump pillow like a fabulously braided river delta one arm drawn up underneath her head the fernprint of the longago lightning a fabulous marquetry on her dark honey skin i had no idea youd be there yesterday i told her i shook my head you looked so so beautiful i should have ducked away but i couldnt take my eyes off you she stroked my arm its all right i was worried when i realised hed seen me recognise you but he thought he knew you already from the party or perhaps a photograph in the papers he has a very good memory so he left early this morning and didnt hear me play your record yes but i heard it i looked around and decided on here we were back at the dorchester where our affair had begun the big tree outside the one wed stared at from the suite a couple of floors above in the mix of moon and flood light back in may was leafless now no silence this time i said i confess i had been wondering what youd do when you ran out of posh hotels we hadnt already been to one scenario i imagined had us going steadily downmarket until we ended up sharing a bottom bunk in a dormitory in a backpackers hostel in earls court she gave a small laugh that would be an awful lot of assignations even restricting ourselves to central london im an optimist so what did make you decide to come back here well i had thought to return on our first anniversary really i said smiling broadly there is romance in your trim little soul after all celia jane she pinched my arm making me yelp and have to rub the site there might be a bruise this was especially mean of course because i was not allowed to leave a mark on her ah she said holding up one finger but then i thought that that would be a kind of a pattern in itself and so dangerous you would have made such a great spy and also it felt like something had changed now that our different worlds have become entangled again a wee cowering terrified part of me imagined that it had changed utterly and you would never want to see me again i confessed spell broken you know did you really imagine that oh yes im thankful i only had one night to lose sleep over it but yes i did you have this thing about separation and entanglement and a set of beliefs i find perfectly bizarre and that i cant comprehend or anticipate the results of for all i knew to you yesterday was some sort of sign a bolt from the heavens that absolutely meant without argument or appeal and according to a kind of faith i dont even begin to understand we were over she looked almost sleepy as she said you think im irrational dont you i think you behave like the most rational person ive ever met but you claim to have this completely crackpot belief in your own half lifehalf death and a spookily entangled twin in another universe maybe that is profoundly rational in some deep sense that has eluded me until now but i dont feel any nearer seeing it than i was when you sprang this frankly wacko ideology on me in the first place she was silent for a moment those almond amber eyes gazed up at me steady flames in a deep well you are a globalist arent you hey you were listening she smoothed her fingers through my chest hair then gently took a fist of it and let her hand hang there caught up you make such a big thing she said of developed countries rich countries not being allowed to impose their ways of life and their way of thinking and of doing business on smaller or poorer countries and that extending to religions and customs and the like and yet you want to make everybody think the same way youre like most people who have to fulminate about things you want everybody to think the same way you do doesnt everybody but it is true isnt it you want the one way of thinking spread everywhere throughout the world replacing all the different ways of thinking that have grown up in all the different places and peoples and cultures you are a colonialist of the mind you believe in the justified imperialism of western thought pax logica that is what you believe in you wish to see the flag of your rationalism planted firmly in every brain on the planet you say you dont care what people believe in that you respect their right to worship as they wish but you dont really respect the people or their beliefs at all you think that they are fools and what they believe in is worse than useless i flopped onto my back i let out a deep breath okay i said do i want people to think the way i do i suppose i do but i know its never going to happen do i respect other peoples beliefs shit ceel i dont know theres this saying about how you should respect a mans religious beliefs the same way you respect his belief that his wife is the most beautiful woman in the world casual and hopefully nonmalicious sexism aside i can see that i do accept i could be wrong maybe the the abrahamists are right maybe their cruel womanhating womanfearing unholy trinity of megacultism is spoton after all maybe even some tiny tiny little strand of it like for example the wee frees who are part of the presbyterian movement in scotland which is itself part of the protestant franchise which is part of the christian faith which is part of the abrahamic beliefset which is one of the monotheistic religions maybe they and only they all few thousand of them are absolutely bang on the money in what they believe and how they worship and everybody else has been wrongdiddlywrongwrong all these centuries or maybe the one true way has only ever been revealed to a oneman cult within the outer fringes of guatemalan highland sufism reformed all i can say is ive tried to prepare myself for being wrong for waking up after ive died and finding that uhoh my atheism was actually like a really big mistake i got up on one elbow again and do i think reason should replace irrationality well yes yes i do guilty as charged and bless it society really is to blame society and education and enquiry and doubt and argument and disputation and progress all the schools and libraries and universities all the scholars and monks and alchemists and teachers and scientists faith is fine for poetry for images and metaphors and art and for telling us who we are who weve been but when faith tries to describe the world describe the universe it just plain gets it wrong which wouldnt matter if it admitted it was wrong but it cant because all its got is its unwavering certainty in its own infallibility the rest is smoke and mirrors and admitting imperfection brings the whole lot tumbling down there are no crystal spheres and the planets are not the result of some sky gods wetdream if that is supposed to be taken literally then its a lie plain and simple if its a metaphor then it has bugger all to do with the way things really work reason works the scientific method works technology works if people want to respect their environment by believing that the fish they eat might have been an ancestor or learn to lower toilet seats because their chi is leaking out im happy to accept and even honour the results even if i think the root of their behaviour is basically barmy i can live with that and with them i hope they can live with me she spread her hand flat against my chest i could feel my heart beating hard i shouldnt let this sort of thing get to me like this but i had no choice this stuff was important to me i couldnt help it sometimes she said quietly looking at her own hand or perhaps at my skin sometimes i think we are like different coloured bishops on a chess board you and i bishops after all ive just said she smiled still spreading her hand on my chest as though trying to span the distance between my nipples better to be a queen she agreed youll just have to take my word for it that id rather be a pawn than a bishop at least they can transcend their origins i believe you or a knight ive always liked the fact a knight has what is basically a threedimensional move on a twodimensional surface and the castle theres something about the bluff blunt power of the rook that attracts me as well and it does do a potentially threedimensional thing too just once come to think of it castling bishops are more devious somehow sliding in between pieces like a knife through ribs the king of course is simply a liability i was thinking she said of bishops on opposing sides and of different colours as well just the two of them there on the chess board with no other pieces present i nodded i saw now what she meant they could never connect i said they could slide past each other for ever but never affect they appear to inhabit the same board but really they dont not at all she looked up at me with heavylidded eyes her head tipped fractionally to one side dont you think perhaps and is that us maybe maybe all men and women maybe all people for ever without exception without hope i tried to say it lightly she took my cock in her hand then brought her other hand out from underneath her head and cupped her sex we connect here she smiled a smile it seemed to me just then fit to light up the universe inside the skull a smile indeed to light up two a smile to illuminate infinities that will have to do for now seven sexual pique nikki oh my god what have you done verhoeven underrated i thought about this how hendrie aston villa separated at birth wanking why the bad press knockknock you know all mouth and no trousers the hell with you grounded on mount arafat craig was having a hogmanay party at his place in highgate ken hi what oh i cut my hair like it no its shorter easier to wash different yeah and sort of brownyblack are you mad you sound like my dad but you had beautiful hair i still do thanks fink about the endin of total recall i sniggered zactly what dyou mean zactly you cant just say zactly and look all justified and smug like that explain yourself man wot was that reaction of yours there then what was that all about it was about a totally preposterous ending featuring the pyramid mine a biggish hill but still less than a pimple on a planetary scale emplacing an entire martian atmosphere at what appeared to be standard temperature and pressure in about half a minute complete with milky clouds and everything in time to put arnie and the ingenues eyes back into their sockets about a minute after they started haemorrhaging all with no lasting ill effects whatsoever to bodies either planetary or human i thought about what id just said or arnies for that matter ed nodded zactly youre doing it again will you stop with the fucking zactly shit already hee hee hee yeah and the hee hee hee thing is no great improvement i took ed by the shoulders and through gritted teeth said what the fuck do you mean wot i mean is ed said giggling right is that it is basically so fuckin preposterous a endin that it can only mean right that arnie is character that is must still be in a virtual reality dream none of the endins been real azit i opened my mouth i took my hands off his shoulders i wagged a finger at him hmm i said an that therefore like that verhoeven geezer is a subversive genius i stood there nodding trying to recall more of the earlier parts of the film course ed said its only a feery hendrie who hendrie plays for villa you must have seen him no i mustnt why he looks like robbie williams craig you need to get out more i was out i went to the match thats where i saw him okay you should stay in more phil wanking why the bad press is not funny now button pushers why the bad press that has a modicum of comedic value only a modicum not enough to actually use in the show or anything but i employ it purely as an example i was thinking of a new phonein feature right well there are ladies on the end of premiumrate phone lines dedicated to ensuring this sort of thing is already well catered for im told that wasnt what i was thinking of well what then a sponsored wankothon no no no right itll be called get a hold of yourself uhhuh youve always been jealous chris evans had that breakfast show feature where a girl got her boyfriends lollipop in her mouth and recited lyrics havent you nooo look phil no just leave it really yes you dont think i think you should go and talk to craig whos there tijuana tijuana who gary glitter what tijuana be in my gang my gang my gang oh i understand the meaning its meant to have i told amy leaning closer to her we were on the decking in craigs garden near midnight id just tried to talk to jo in barcelona with addicta but without success its just not the meaning i took from it the first time i heard it thats what im saying what fur coat and no knickers yeah i always thought damn that sounds great that sounds like really sexy she laughed putting her head back to show a long wintertanned neck and perfect teeth her blond hair glowed softly in the light falling from the lit windows of the house yes well you would witty but unfair look i you dont know what it feels like you just have no idea all youve got is your theory just your precious onemanparty line as usual you have no concept what its like you havent been there you havent felt the atmosphere were surrounded by people who hate us ah excuse me this is me youre talking to here im all too well acquainted with the telltale tingle on the temple that indicates the crosshairs of antipathy have locked on to me once more but just just back up a bit there whos this we when the hell did you become a daughter of the zionist revolution when i realised it was them or us ken oh fuck you mean you really are jeez i was just they all hate us every nation on our borders would like to see us destroyed our only way outs the sea and thats where they want us ken just look at the map were tiny and then inside our own nation these people murder and bomb and shoot us inside our own borders on our own streets in the shops on the buses in our homes weve got to stop them we have no choice and you you have the gall to claim that weve become the nazis and cant see youve become just another bloody antisemite oh fuck jude look i know you feel really deeply about this no you dont thats what im saying you cant well im trying to look please please dont put words into my mouth or beliefs into my mind that arent there they are there ken you just wont accept it i am not antisemitic look i like the jews i admire the jews im positively prosemitic for fucks sake ive told you this well some of it ive been this way since i was a kid since i heard about the holocaust and since i realised that the scots and the jews were so alike the scots are smart but we get accused of being mean same with the jews its culture not race but weve both punched way above our weight for civilisation the jews are the only people i ever put ahead of the scots in terms of their influence on the world given the size of their population pool this is so bullshit im serious i loved you guys from when i was a kid so much i was embarrassed to tell you how much dont bullshit me its true you were just so fearsomely far to the left i never dared ken im serious i used to love israel this was true when i was thirteen id fallen deeply in love with a girl called hannah gold her parents lived in giffnock one of the more leafy parts of glasgow s suburban southern hinterland they took a dim view of our friendship and my obvious infatuation with their daughter but i charmed them plus i did my research within six months mr g was expressing his pleased surprise at how much i knew about israel and the jews the golds moved to london shortly after hannahs fourteenth birthday and we were pen pals for a while but then they moved again and we lost touch id been heartbroken when they left but i recovered and went on going from desolation to something shamingly close to indifference in about three weeks my new interest in israel proved rather longer lasting and at the time i didnt see how anybody could not love israel it was the worlds most charismatic brave buccaneering nation defying all these bullies around it the six day war dayan and his eyepatch a woman prime minister the kibbutzim when i was a kid i was so proud it was britishbuilt tanks that had gone sailing across the sinai with the star of david flying from the whip aerials i used to get books out the library about israel great jewish generals can you believe trotsky was in there i even knew that the israeli army had improved their centurions by putting petrol engines in place of the british diesels i knew all that adolescent wargeek stuff i loved it yom kippur triumphing against the odds nicking their own boats from under the noses of the french the raid on entebbe it was breathtaking cinematic how could anyone not admire all that but that was before the invasion of lebanon before sabra and shatila that was done by christian militias jude protested oh come on it was ariel sharon who let them off the leash and you know it but that was the start i began to wake up to what had happened to the palestinians to all the un resolutions that israel had just ignored that it was uniquely allowed to ignore then to the history the bride is beautiful but she is already wed and to the illegal settlements and the secret nukes i heard what rabbi kehane believed what his followers still believe i saw the bodies lying bleeding in the mosque and i felt sick and now civilians are just killed without any legal process whatsoever and ive heard israelis as good as talk about a final solution for the palestinian problem ive listened to a cabinet minister say without irony that if they can just round up all the terrorists and get rid of them there wont be any left and i cant believe im hearing an educated person suggest anything as monumentally stupid as psychologically obtuse as that look i dont want anyone hurt i dont believe in suicide bombings or attacking any civilians and of course youve every right to defend yourselves but oh god look can we just agree on this that the holocaust wasnt evil and horrific and the single most obscene and concentrated act of human barbarism ever recorded because it happened to the jews it was all that because it happened to anybody to any group to any people because it did happen to the jews and there had been nowhere for them to escape to i thought yes of course they did deserve a homeland it was the least that could be done the world felt that partly guilt but at least it was there but it wasnt a moral blank cheque for fucks sake if any people should have known what it was to be demonised victimised and oppressed and suffer under an arrogant militaristic occupying regime and possess the wit to see what was happening to them and what they were doing to others they should have so when palestinian youths use slingshots against tanks and the tanks put high explosive into tents where mothers are nursing when every arab village has its orchards razed its houses dynamited and roads dug up i mean cant you see what youre doing there those are ghettos youre creating when the israeli army seriously claims that mohammed aldurrah and his father were shot by palestinian gunmen as though this isnt the same shit in microcosm as claiming the death camps were built by the allies after the war im im im tearing my fucking hair out here jude and then letters appear in the papers talking about appeasing the palestinians and comparing israel to czechoslovakia just before the second world war and thats just absurd czechoslovakia was not the bestarmed state in europe at the time it was one of the weakest it was not the only regional superpower with a monopoly on weapons of mass destruction it was not the tooledup victor of three earlier wars sitting on the occupied territory of others but they kill us step on a bus go for a pizza drive back from worship walk down the wrong path in your own city and youve both got to stop i know that but you have the most control in this youre the ones coming from a position of strength its always the one with the most power who has to give up the most who has to exercise the most restraint who has to take the final few blows before all the blows stop jude was shaking her tearstained face at me you are so full of shit youll never understand youll just never understand so were not perfect who is were fighting for our lives all you do and all you say just gives succour to those whod drive us into the waves youre with the enemy youre with the exterminators we havent become the nazis you have i buried my face in my hands and when i surfaced looking at judes angry reddened face all i could say was i never said you had and there is an israeli peace movement jude there are people jews in israel who oppose sharon and whats been done whats being done to the palestinians who want peace peace for land if thats what it takes but peace reservists whore refusing to fight in the occupied territories thats who im with thats who i respect these days ive escaped my adolescent crush on israel but ill never stop respecting loving the jewish people for all theyve done its just that i cant stand to see whats being perpetrated in their name now by that fat whitehaired warcriminal bastard fuck you sharon was democratically elected hes said he will trade land for peace so fuck you fuck you jude no goodbye ken i wont bother to say ill see you because i hope i dont and dont bother to call in fact dont ever bother again not ever jude im ashamed i ever let you so much as touch me and with that my exwife threw her drink over me turned on her heel and walked off happy new year bit later drunk and maudlin and time to go to bed i was crashing at craigs place in the second spare bedroom some people had been using it as an unofficial cloakroom dumping their coats and jackets on the bed i gathered them up and took them next door to the box room which was the official cloakroom oh hi nikki ken nikki said taking something from her jacket she was dressed in a fluffy pink sweater and tight black jeans how are you doing tired i said dumping the coats and jackets onto the pile on the bed music sounded pumping from downstairs and i could hear people whooping the box room was devoid of furniture apart from an old desk also piled with coats and stuff and the narrow mounded bed lots of shelves with books and assorted junk a collapsible wallpaper table and a stepladder against one wall the rooms bulb was bare unshielded nikki stood grinning at me even with the short hair she looked great she held up the slim silvery thing shed taken from her jacket large orange lozenges got a cold she said through her smile almost smugly under the direct light of the rooms single bulb her hair showed spiky highlights of glossy red and deep ochre i narrowed my eyes and looked at her as though over some glasses what are you on oh is it obvious uhoh she giggled she put her hands behind her back and stood there staring up at the ceiling and swivelling back and forth her jaw was working from side to side in time i shook my head you young whippersnapper youre loved up arent you fraid so uncle ken well have fun but remember leah betts dont drink too much water i love you uncle ken she said leaning forward and smiling broadly i laughed yeah i love you too nikki she brandished the throat lozenges in my face like some sort of treat would you like a strepsil thanks im trying to give them up okay i stepped to one side and grasped the handle of the door which had swung shut after you maam i said opening it thenkyuh she said stepping forward then bumped into the edge of the door and thudded into my chest happy new year ken she raised her face to mine still grinning true enough i thought wed managed to miss each other somehow in the hours since the bells happy new y i said she pushed her mouth against mine and gave me a big wet sloppy kiss then pulled away smiling happily then did a little sidetoside thing with her head made a noise that might have been mmhmm and came forward again and kissed me once more with a certain amount of openness it has to be said though no tongues oh my god oh shit oh fuck part of me was thinking i mean another part was thinking well yesss but most of me was thinking bad things of one sort or another i put my arms around her and kissed back tasting and smelling her sucking in her sweet breath as though desperate for some transfusion of youth she squirmed in my arms pressing herself against me and slipping her arms round my sides and back something dropped to the floor the lozenges then she pushed back blinking and i had to let her go the smile was gone for a moment then she shook her head and started laughing gently she wiped her mouth delicately with the back of one hand what am i doing she breathed still shaking her head i thought of the way her hair would have moved when she did that if it had still been long well i said swallowing making an old man very happy obviously but um i dont think no i dont think either she said softly then laughed loudly then started coughing she shook her head and looked down at the floor i stooped and handed her the packet of throat lozenges nikkis hoarse laugh echoed in the room oh uncle ken im sorry i didnt mean to im sorry i held up one hand no problem and please stop apologising it was fine for me believe me but ah nikki coughed the harsh sound echoed in the barewalled room she made a visible effort to pull herself together yes she said and cleared her throat noisily we probably better just pretend that none of this happened yeah i nodded she nodded too just until you know we die she suggested agree completely i said she shivered sorry ken but this is all just a bit weird i suggested yeah weird id opened the door again oh hi emma mum hi nikki waved her smile broad across her face whats weird emma said walking into the room and looking gloweringly suspicious little black number hair in pearled black alice band like a soft tiara black pearls round her throat already holding a dark coat over her arm i waved one hand dismissively and nodded at the pack of throat lozenges in nikkis hand i was trying to proposition your daughter by offering her drugs but she wasnt having it i smiled sadly and let my shoulders sag while emma glared into my eyes just trying to get to bed actually em dogtired this you off too emma wavered but then clearly decided id been just casual enough nothing going on nothing youd want to think about certainly yes she said then looked at her daughter nikki you ready nikki popped a lozenge flicked it into the air and stepped forward with her mouth open teeth clacking shut she stepped back again with the throat sweet displayed between her teeth regy she said she turned and rummaged in the pile of coats until she found her jacket night ken she said pulling on her jacket and kissing me lightly on the cheek night kid ill be down in one minute emma told nikki okeydoke nikki said as the door started to swing closed again ill say bye to dad emma looked at me ohoh i thought now what great kid i said to emma nodding towards the closing door love her to bits you all right em said she looked genuinely concerned i relaxed tired i said honestly i heard jude gave you a hard time it was mutual but yes i sighed yawned oh dear sorry sorry its all right jude and i agreed to disagree i said although come to think of it im not sure we even agreed that emma nodded looked down at my chest briefly she put one hand out and touched my arm patting it you get some sleep best idea ive heard all night i held the door open for her night ken you take care she kissed me lightly on the cheek just like her daughter had she turned at the top of the stairs as i was opening the door to my bedroom and gave me a small brave smile she raised one hand hesitantly then went quickly down the steps i stripped to my underpants and got into the bed i went to sleep thinking about celia hoping she was well and safe with her family on martinique i did this quite often these days part of me hoped that by going to sleep thinking of her id see her in my dreams but so far this hadnt happened i slept well for about half an hour until some people piled into the room turning on the light and looking for their coats i told them where they were then once theyd gone i got up pulled on my trousers and went through to the official cloakroom and pulled all the coats and jackets off the bed and hung them over the banister rail outside this didnt stop another group of drunks coming into the room turning on the light and looking for their coats i took the bulb out of the central light fixture and the next time somebody came in muttering about coats and clicking the light switch about ten times i snored very loudly until they went away when i wake up im dressed as an ss officer with my cock hanging out im handcuffed to the bed and theres gaffer tape over my mouth and jos they rape her slit her throat and leave her lying on me theyve taken stuff to make it look like a robbery gone wrong and the boats been holed so when the tide rises ill drown ah ken fuck shit fuck fucking hell ken come on just a dream whatever it was just a dream a nightmare hey come on dear fucking jesus christ almighty i flopped back down onto the bed my heart was hammering like an engine i was breathing like id just run a marathon oh god jo took me in her arms and cradled me its okay everythings all right calm down calm down oh thats not like you fuck okay now yeah okay okay now only i wasnt okay at all jo fell quickly asleep again but i spent a long long time looking round the darkened slightly tilted bedroom swallowing hard catching the occasional whiff of sewage and decay coming from the mud outside listening for ominous gurgling noises from the bilges searching for heavies hiding in the shadows and shivering as the sheen of sweat dried on my skin i lay waiting for the dawn to come up and the tide to come in waiting for the waters to raise us again bring the temple belle level once more smother the faint smell of death and restore balance hello hey mrs c ooh is that that man from the radio kennit how are you doin ma darlin got a bit of a cold but apart from that fine and all the better for talking to you mrs c and how are you beautiful and sexy as ever beautiful and sexy as the last time i saw you on the big wheel wasnt it oh hell honey im more so more so you a terrible man i tell me son on you you see if i dont do juss that mrs c you mustnt my unbridled passion for you has to stay a deep and terrible secret otherwise ed would be terribly hurt i mean suppose you seduced me and then fell pregnant what at my age oh lissen to you you rogue man ha id have to marry you id be eds father hed never forgive me stop ill bust meself wheres me hanky oh you surely are a terrible man id get the boy himself to give you a serious talkin to but hes in france or rome or some damn place like that honey so youll have to call his mobile no problem mrs c actually i knew he was away i just wanted an excuse to hear your voice there see now you bein terrible again i just cant help myself its the power you have over me terrible man terrible terrible rogue of a man okay mrs c ill try eds mobile it was good talking to you oh i did want to have a word with a friend of his too ah robe yeah robe would you have his number there at all robe what you want to talk to him for hon sorry just blowing my nose there mrs c excuse me you excused hon so whats this you wantin to talk to robe for ah yeah i was talking to somebody in a record company ice house theyre pretty big apparently the company the record label its looking for security people bodyguards that sort of thing for artists rap artists when they come over from the states i just thought robe could do that maybe i mean these are often pretty serious people themselves exgangsta a lot of them they wouldnt have any respect for the average white kid with broad shoulders whos used to turning people away from clubs because theyve got the wrong footwear robe however theyd relate to but its straight work and well paid i know he could do it could lead to well who knows be a lot more respectable than what he usually gets up to what i hear robe is yardie kennit he dangerous too many guns hes not welcome in this house no more ed dont see him that i know of i realise that ed and i were talking about him not long ago thats why i thought maybe this could be a way to get him out of that sort of life i thought maybe if i could have a word with him well i dont tink i got his number here but i can get it i suppose itd be great if you could mrs c of course id understand if you didnt want to say anything to ed nothing might come of this we have to accept that but you know nothing ventured and all that well you probably on a wild goose chase here honey but bless you for tinkin of it i call you back that okay you are a saint and sexy i adore you ah stop it now id decided i might be developing a crush on my dentist of course i wasnt and i knew i wasnt but the idea seemed nice there was something oddly relaxing and carefree about it maybe it was some very mixed up freudian thing given that my dad was a dentist maybe it was because mary fairley bds was scottish from nairn and had the most wonderfully soft burring accent id heard since id moved to london maybe it was the whole thing about lying almost flat with my mouth open entirely at this womans mercy while some gentle music played and she and her almost as attractive assistant spoke quietly professionally to each other but whatever it was i had almost convinced myself i felt something for her mary was chunky of build but delicate of movement and touch she had sandy hair greygreen eyes a sprinkling of freckles across her nose and breasts that got ever so slightly in her way sometimes necessitating a quick twisting movement the bodily equivalent of a hairflick while she was leaning over me i gazed up into her eyes wishing we didnt have to put these safety visor things on these days although given that i seemed to have picked up nikkis cold that was probably no bad thing i had to raise my hand and stop the dental work a couple of times to have a good sneeze amazing how safe i felt in a dentists surgery always a little on edge waiting for a twinge but very safe mary was polite but not chatty despite our caledonian connection very professional having a crush on a disinterested dentist might appear frustrating and sad but it also struck me as being innocent and pure and even healthy certainly a lot healthier than falling hopelessly in love with a gangsters wife and planning to go tooled up into a telly studio mary drilled through an old filling into decay and the air in my mouth filled with a smell like death our client maintains strongly that he was not using his mobile at the time of the accident then your client is lying mr ah mcnutt with respect you could only have gained the most fleeting of glimpses of our clients car when tell you what excuse ahchoo bless you thank you excuse me yes as i was saying the young lady i was taking home made a phone call to report the accident to the police that was about five ten seconds max after the crash happened why dont we talk to her mobile network and your clients and compare the times when his call ended and hers began because now i think about it he was still holding the phone when he got out of the car and i suspect he hadnt hung up lets see if that call and ms verrins overlap shall we the lawyer and her articled clerk looked at each other you lucky lucky people not only has my cold gone into my throat so that i sound even huskier and sexier than ever but we just played you the hives the white stripes and the strokes three in a row with nary a syllable of nonsense to dilute the fun damn we spoil you now then phil yeah you cant just leave an accusation hanging like that you mean my broad hint that a fully functioning brain might be a liability in a footballer yes so what are you saying all football club changing rooms should have a sign saying you dont have to be stupid to work here but it helps and how witty that would be if they did philip but no but youre saying that footballers have to be stupid no im just saying that it might help why think about it youre playing tennis whats the one shot that looks easy that people get wrong all the time the one that even the professionals make an embarrassing mess of every now and again happened at least once that i saw this wimbledon we may phil said have located the source of the footballers seeming stupidity if they think theyre playing football but youve apparently changed sports to tennis you can see how having a single net in the middle instead of one at each end would be confusing but thats not what i mean just stick with me here phil in tennis what looks like the easiest shot there could be but people still get hopelessly wrong come on think the good people of radio listenerland are depending on you ah phil said the overhead smash when the balls gone way up in the sky and you seem to spend about half an hour at the net waiting for it to come down correct now why do people get that shot so wrong when it looks so easy theyre crap weve already established that even the best players in the world do this so no not that phil shrugged i was making a onehanded waving motion at him across the desk as though trying to waft the aroma of a dish towards my nose sometimes we sort of half rehearsed these things sometimes we didnt and i just landed stuff like this on him and trusted to luck and the fact we knew each other pretty well by now phil nodded they have too much time to think preflippingcisely phil like most sports tennis is a game of rapid movement fast reactions skilful handeye coordination well footeye coordination in the case of football but you get the idea and people often play their best when theyve got no time to think think service returns against somebody like sampras or rusedski same in cricket scientists reckon it shouldnt be possible for a batsman to hit the ball because there just isnt enough time between the ball leaving the hand of a good fast bowler and it getting to the bat of course a decent batsman will have read the bowlers body language same applies to a tennis player whos good at returning against a big hitter they can tell where the balls going before the server hits it the point is that it all happens too quick for the cerebral bit of the brain to get involved theres no time to think theres only time to react right uhhuh now football oh good were back in football you often have quite a lot of time to think certainly often you dont a ball comes flying in you raise your leg and firsttime it and its away and youre already running down the touchline doing the shirtoverthehead bit with your arms outstretched but if youre on a breakaway get the ball in midfield theres only one defender to beat and nobody up to support youve got what will seem like a long long time to run and think and im certainly not accusing footballers of not being able to do both at the same time so you beat the defender theres only the goalie left and now youve got time to think again and this is where you see some guys even at the very top make a mess of it because theyve had time to think their full frontal cortex or whatever it is has had time to go hmm well we could do it this way or this way or that way or but by that time its too late because the goalies come out and youve hit it straight at him or skied it to the ironic cheers of the opposing fans or decided to go for a lob and hesitated and hes had time to dive at your feet and grab the ball off you this happens to perfectly good highly paid professional footballers and in a way its no disgrace its just being human however if you get a particularly thick footballer youre going to be horrible about that nice gascoigne boy again i can tell oh come on this is a man so daft he couldnt even play airflute without making a mess of it but yes gazza is my best example he is well was a great gifted footballer but he was so intellectually challenged that even in all those seconds running in on the goalkeeper he still hasnt had time to think or if he is thinking hes thinking wuyaye thats a fitlookin bird behind the goal there man and thats the difference the longer you can go without really thinking the better a footballer youll be phil opened his mouth to speak but i added thats also why golf and snooker are so profoundly different theyre games of nerve and concentration not reactive skill phil scratched his head i hit the appropriate fx button well that was a compendium rant he said id already started the next track playing the intro faded down we had fifteen seconds to the vocals we started on football phil said diverted to tennis then on to cricket and finally came back to the beautiful game but then bodyswerved into golf and snooker at the last minute there all very confusing really i glanced at the seconds ticking away yes you sound a bit stupid have you thought of becoming a professional footballer so its definite debbie asked yes phil said how definite well definite phil said awkwardly yes but how definite is it is it fairly definite very definite totally one hundred per cent certainly definite well no its not that definite phil conceded jesus christ i said i thought only films suffered from this onoffstopgoredlightgreenlightredlight bullshit its only a fucking telly programme not lord of the fucking rings parts one to three its delicate phil said sos my head on a saturday morning i muttered i dont make this fucking song and dance about it debbies new temporary office was almost as far down the lightwell as ours i gazed out at the white glazed bricks it looked like it might be raining but it was hard to tell this was friday the breaking news thing was scheduled for monday again my great confrontation with the beastly holocaust denier larson brogley or whatever his name was was back on again in fact it had been on for over a month now without being cancelled which was probably some sort of record it might actually be going to happen i felt nervous of course i felt nervous i thought as station manager debbie and producer phil argued the toss about how definite was definite like a pair of bishops trying to settle how many angels could dance on the head of a pin it was okay for these guys they thought the only danger was me making a fool of myself or bringing the station or by extension sir jamie into disrepute they had no idea what i was planning to do if they had they would of course have been appalled and either tried to argue me out of it and maybe warn the breaking news production team or just cancelled the whole deal and threatened me with the sack if i insisted on going ahead without their blessing thats what id do if i was ever in a situation like this if that is the talent concerned had been daft enough to tell me what he was thinking of doing fucking typical usually these tv things came up and happened really quickly if id had my brilliant but dangerous idea for any other appearance or even proposed appearance it would all have been over months ago and id long since have been dealing with the consequences whatever theyd turned out to be for various reasons but especially september this one was running and running and so i was being given plenty of time to stew follow it up with a phone interview on the show hmm i dont think yeah let the poor deluded fools debate they didnt know how lucky they were not knowing only i knew about my great idea my great risky probably mad certainly criminal idea i hadnt shared it with jo craig ed anybody id started dreaming about it though and worried that i might say something in my sleep that jo would hear this was certainly better than dreaming about death squads raping jo and leaving me dressed like a nazi waiting to drown but it still wasnt much fun id got used to having pretty mundane even boring dreams over the years and the last run of nightmares id suffered had been in the runup to my lastyear exams at school so i wasnt psychologically prepared for having bad dreams about nazis in tv studios and being tied to a chair and people waving guns about on the other hand id probably crap out at the last minute id do the planning take the equipment but fail to follow through some imperial guard of good sense still loyal to the idea of keeping me in a job and out of court and prison or whatever would storm the gates of the occupied palace of reason and effect a counterrevolution a coup for common sense and decent standards of behaviour that was if i was being totally honest with myself the most likely outcome not by far the most likely outcome but still the most likely one all the same oh for gods sake i said interrupting debbie who was faffing on about shared legal insurance against slander and who should pay what proportion i almost wanted to tell her that me only saying something outrageous and criminal was the least of her worries but i didnt lets just do it cant we okay phil said but were holding out for an afternoon recording whatever i dont care i just want it over and done with they both looked at me as though surprised at something like this getting to me whoops possible security breach here i spread my hands slowly oh im just getting fed up with the hanging around i explained calmly okay then debbie said monday it is halleblinkinlujah listen and thats enough here we go jesus got enough wee funny lights in here rough innit oh totally rough it was the friday night ed and i were due to be limod to a gig in bromley in an hour but hed wanted to show off his newly redecorated and refitted place so id come to the family house a much knockedthrough and creatively muckedaboutwith complex taking up two terraced houses in brixton one of them an endterrace incorporating what had been a small supermarket on the ground floor ed could have afforded a mansion in berkshire if hed wanted and i suspected he still kind of hankered after one but i respected the fact hed chosen to stay here with his mum and extended family adapting the house hed grown up in and buying the one next door too plus the shop underneath rather than get the hell out of his old hood the instant the money had started rolling in id been slightly worried that ed had heard from his mum that id been trying to get hold of his yardie pal robe guessed that i was still after a gun and wanted to shout at me or something but nothing like this had happened so far wed met up in the big main livingroom on the ground floor and been suddenly surrounded by a chaotic laughing crowd of eds aunts cousins and sisters several of them pretty damn attractive and a couple of male relations and boyfriends his mum hadnt been there because she was attending some night class which had saved any potential embarrassment ed had made our apologies and wed got away upstairs but he still hadnt said anything about robe eds own place within the communal house ran the length of the two lofts the big dormers just looked out onto other roofs but the views inside were more striking a long mostly open space in warm ochres and deep reds with splashes of yellow trust me it was a lot more tasteful than it sounds it all smelled very new the only certifiable stylelapse was in eds moderately vast impressively uncluttered bedroom mirrors edward yeah wicked eh mirrors i mean on both sides theyre wardrobes but on the ceiling oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear wot just cos nobodyd want to watch your sorry white ass when youre bangin some bird me im a picture if i wasnt straight as a bleedin die id fall in love wif meself id folded my arms taken a step back and looked at him eventually id just shaken my head wot no id said you got me im lost for words fuck me hold the showbiz page come on im off duty now we were in eds studydenstudio and hed turned on all his music gear i gazed round the six stacked angled keyboards the three manhigh nineteeninch racks and a mixing desk youd struggle to touch both ends of even with your arms outstretched and your face jammed against the pots there was a bunch of other bits and pieces too muchbebuttoned units lying on desks a set of drum pads and at least three pieces the functions of which i could not even begin to guess at most of the gear was twinkling in the heavily curtained darkness hundreds of little leds in broad constellations of red green yellow and blue plus dozens of softly glowing pastel screens with dark blocky writing on them two widescreen monitors bigger than my tv flickered into life as eds mac powered quietly up eds monitors were giant nautilus jobs thirty grands worth of gleaming shoulderhigh spiked blue ammonites with bright yellow cones sitting on the far side of the room and aimed at the big black leather chair poised in the epicentre of all this cooltech gizmology what exactly does all this do ed makes music man i thought you just played the stuff yeah well im branching out inni you mean youre actually going to start composing i picked up a dark red asized manual for something called a virus and flicked through it squinting in the low ambient light yeah i fot itd be a laugh an anyway just look at this stuff i looked at it again you know youre absolutely right ed it doesnt have to produce a fucking note to justify its total glorious gorgeousnesshoodicity please dont tell me all youre going to produce on it will be nchih nchih music nchih nchih music yeah you know the sort of music you hear from some brothers blackedout astra passing you in the street it always goes nchih nchih nchih na mate well yeah some maybe but na one day im gonna write a bleedin symphony a symphony yeah why not i looked him up and down again you dont lack for ambition do you edward certainly fucking not lifes too short mate i leafed through the manual for the virus thing i mean do you actually understand all this course not you dont need to to get good sounds out of it but the deep stuffs there if you need it extended panic functionality i quoted ha how can you not love something with extended panic functionality uvverwise known as the all notes off command brilliant i said putting the manual back on its bookshelf with the others my phone vibrated on my hip i glanced at the screen jo i told ed better answer it shes in i dont know berlin or budapest or somewhere ill fire up the software let you hear some nchih nchih tunes hello i said and distantly i heard yes yes yes come on fuck me fuck me do it do it there yes there there there fuck me fuck me harder fuck me really hard right there right there yes yes yes this was accompanied by what sounded like clothing rubbing on clothing a series of slaps and then a mans voice saying oh yeah oh yeah it didnt stop either went on for some time i stood there and listened for long enough to entirely convince myself that this was not a joke not any sort of an attempt at humour at all and also not in any way meant this was about the time when ed turned round from the bewilderingly complicated displays on his two giant monitors and looked at me just a glance at first then back again frowning eyebrows rising i handed him the phone he listened for a while as well the frown was replaced by a smile even a leer for a moment or two but then he must have read something from my face because the smile disappeared and he handed the phone back to me and looked down clearing his throat and turning back to the screens sorry bruv i heard him say i listened a little while longer then jos phone must have fallen because there was a loud but softsounding thump and the noises became very muffled incoherent i folded the phone off well i said i think the choice phrases involve sauces for ganders and geese and petards whatever the hell one of those is ed knew well enough i wasnt faithful to jo blimey wed been able to watch each other at it with those two argentinian girls that night on the beach at brighton during early may ed looked round chewing his bottom lip fink that was a windup no deliberate i shook my head i doubt it ive had jos accidental calls jam my phone for hours at a time before usually her and her girlfriends in a bar or a club i released a deep breath plus ah that is the way she expresses herself during the act i dont think shes a good enough actress to fake that woh right then so you two have one of them open relationships then do ya looks like it i said just neither of us ever bothered to tell the other ed looked concerned you still want to hear some tunes man or would you ravver ave a drink or a smoke or sumfing na play some tunes ed bangin tunes in fact play some bangin tunes i gave a small not funny laugh jo said listen and i said ohoh what these days people our age okay my age and also your age dont say listen like that without it meaning something pretty fucking serious jo looked down yeah well here we go i thought we were in the london aquarium housed in the old glc building on the south bank of the thames beside the london eye mouth corp records were having a bash and id been invited so had jo shed pretty much just arrived coming straight from heathrow off the flight from budapest the aquarium was a slightly spooky place for a party i thought especially a music industry party sharks in abundance as above so below the light was kind of freaky too apparently the fish wouldnt take kindly to lots of flashing discostylee lights strobes and shit so all you had was this blueygreen wash of underwater luminescence making everybody look slightly sick the light slid off jos facial metalwork visual echoes of the green and blue diodes on eds music gear the night before id asked her how she was and been told okay id thought the better of asking her if shed made any accidental phone calls twentyfour hours earlier but now with virtually no preamble i was getting a listen look jo said people passed on either side somebody said hi and great sleek grey bodies moved sinuously behind and above her oh i said now its look were covering the senses one by one are we whatll your next exhortation be sniff jo sucked her lips in and looked at me you dont want to make this easy on either of us do you make what easy jo why dont you tell me ken i think we should ah you know split up she said this and drew herself straight putting her shoulders back and her head up as though defiant i thought of the night we met and the way her stance had shown off her nipples through her tshirt now she wore a big ribbed yellow jumper with a roll neck black jeans only the dms were the same i stared at her of course id known that this was the most likely thing she was going to say after listen but somehow it still came as a shock and i was left temporarily speechless for the second time in two days and this time not in a good way id thought that maybe she was going to say she knew what had happened with the phone and she was sorry or that she was pregnant always a good standby that one if unlikely as we always but always used a condom or maybe something else entirely like she was taking a job in la or kuala lumpur or had decided to become a nun or something but id known at least since last night in eds studio that maybe whatever it was we had had going was near the end still i found myself feeling kind of crushed and surprised i opened my mouth she was still sucking in her lips making her nose look longer she had taken a sort of halfstep away from me almost bumping into people standing talking behind her in front of the thick distorting glass of the aquarium windows i wondered if she thought i was going to hit her i never had id never hit any woman never would oh well apart from raine of course but i reckoned i could claim massively extenuating circumstances there oh well i said i looked down at my bottle of pils i supposed i could throw that in her face like jude had thrown her g t in my face at craigs during the first hour of the new year but then jude had had the forethought to arm herself with a nice wide tumbler i had a narrownecked bottle to achieve a satisfactory soaking of my intended victim id have to ask jo to wait a second or two while i jammed my thumb in the bottle and shook it up before emptying it in her face that would be inelegant somehow anyway i didnt really want to do it so shed cheated on me probably not the first time but well so what to that too id done more than my own fair share of cheating is that all you can say she said oh well is that it i heard you fucking somebody last night jo i told her on the phone your mobile it did that thing again she stood blinking i didnt know she said she nodded found it on the floor this morning batteries flat she took a deep breath woh she looked down at the floor nodding then up to me she spread her arms im sorry i didnt want you to find out that way well i did were you going to say anything hadnt decided i thought in the meantime you might have realised what had happened and whose mobile yours had rung and when and youd be all contrite or come up with some embarrassingly unlikely explanation were you getting ready to dump me not particularly jo it had occurred to me in the past that well all those foreign trips the nights away the rock n roll lifestyle drugs and drink and stuff i kind of suspected you might have had the occasional adventure and so and what about you she asked raising her head again the underwater lights glinting on the studs and bars barnacling her face you mean i said have i been playing away too yes well wait a minute i said starting to feel angry now im being far too fucking reasonable here i heard you fucking somebody else last night you didnt hear me and now youre dumping me and youre looking for some sort of justification after the fact well no fucking way you have no fucking right to start asking me questions yes yes i was going to dump you as a matter of fact actually in my heart in my head id already dumped you before you dumped me dont be so childish fuck off jo dont you even want to know why i want out of this relationship i dont know and i dont care maybe your new guys got a bigger cock than i have who fucking gives a damn oh ken for fucks sake look i hope youre both very fucking happy okay now just get the hell away from me and get your stuff off the belle as well this was more like it i thought this was taking the initiative i deserved to after all dammit i was the injured party here ill give you till monday morning to clear your shit off my boat then it all goes over the side goodbye i turned and walked away the effect barely spoiled by bumping into somebody and accidentally spilling a little pils over their sleeve and having to mumble an apology as i stalked off i half expected jo to follow me and remonstrate and by golly this seemed to me to be a situation where a person could reasonably employ a word like remonstrate or even inveigh rather than just object or argue or something but she didnt i spent the remainder of the party getting profoundly hammered on an exciting variety of alcoholic beverages and i didnt see jo for the rest of the evening this was probably because shed taken me at my word about chucking her stuff in the drink and didnt trust me to wait as long as monday morning because when i did eventually roll home in the wee hours and poured myself out of the taxi and into the temple belle shed already been and gone her clothes and bits and pieces had been cleared out and on the mat under the letter box lay her key i stared at it for a while picked it up after only four or five attempts took it out onto the deck and threw it wildly into the dark receding waters it was always going to happen you werent right for each other craig christ almighty you sound like my mother we were sitting on a bench near the top of parliament hill hampstead heath looking out over the city submerged beneath the watery sun and drifting showers of a cool january afternoon craig had walked here id taken the tube i was probably still too hungoverdrunk to drive but i couldnt have even if id wanted to at least not in the landy somebody had slashed a couple of its tyres and smashed both headlights last night id reported it to the police and they said yes they knew theyd been round during the night after the trembler alarm in the landy noticed the list to one side and informed the mouth corp security centre which in turn had alerted the cops theyd tried my door for ten minutes and my phone for half an hour before they gave up and left me to snore the sleep of the truly drunk the cctv tapes would be studied probably kids thats all yeah right i thought just when id been hoping that maybe whatever bad shit had been going on it wasnt any more oh well aye craig said in response to my accusation of sounding like my mother and what do mothers know best i shook my head people always give you this you werent right for each other stuff afterwards course they do if anybody ever tells anybody before when it could do some good they get accused of being jealous or something and then when the relationship does break up they get accused of causing it you cant win best just keep quiet until its over did you not like jo i didnt dislike jo i thought she was all right this wasnt one of those occasions where youre waiting for it to end so you can tell your friend what you thought of his or her ex i just meant in theory jo was all right but she was nearly as daft as you and shes more ambitious you need somebody wholl steady you a bit not a fellow nutter you can fuck i dont think jo was as crazy as you seem to think she was craig tipped his head once well she was pretty off the rails at times im amazed you lasted as long as you did i sighed yeah kulwinder said he was surprised wed lasted as long as we had at the nineeleven party i watched the slow procession of big jets angling in around the distant scape of clouds settling onto the gentle invisible slope that would slide them west into heathrow she tried to get off with me you know once craig said i looked at him youre kidding now this could be awkward na it was one time shed lost you or something during the summer youd had an argument and youd stormed off and left your mobile behind and she assumed youd come to mine so she turned up on the doorstep i invited the lass in impolite to do anything else specially as she was in tears offered her a drink did the agony aunt thing agreed what a bastard i was excuse me i trod the fine line between masculine solidarity and lending a sympathetic ear to a distressed female so one thing led to another i said oh shit what if he had fucked her even if he wasnt going to admit to it here what if he had think ken was i bothered well was i not particularly i mean i had no right to be jealous or upset not with craig anyway given what had happened with emma but that sort of logical quidproquo consideration wasnt the kind of argument that carried much weight with the set of instincts and partprogrammed reactions that constitute the human heart well no not one thing leading to another craig said she just grabbed me out of the blue jesus wed had about a halfbottle each wine yeah of course wine i wasnt feeding the girl whisky sorry id got up to uncork another oh yeah yes i was still being polite and supportive fuck off with the suspicion and innuendo will you sorry sorry just wrapped herself around me i turned round surprised you know and she slapped her mouth over mine and grabbed my balls fucking hell i looked up at the clouds then back at craig you did the decent thing though no kenneth he said stretching his long legs out he was wearing grey trackie bottoms under a jacket last fashionable ten years ago the decent thing would have been to have shown her how wonderful the act of love can be when you do it with a real man but i didnt do that bet you snogged her for a while you bastard she was a good kisser craig considered this hmm id been putting that down to shock but youre right you didnt fuck her did you no i did the selfsacrificing youre beautiful and im flattered but if we do well both regret it in the morning thing god help us we even agreed it wouldnt be right to betray you it was worth depriving ourselves of some pleasure for your sake oh fuck now what just had a terrible thought what who are you calling she went looking for me at eds once wuhoh yeah craig made as if to get up off the bench want me to na if youre going to see me humiliated we might as well get it over with now you fucked her didnt you no i didnt look ed she told me shed gone to yours once she went to craigs once too and she threw herself at him hey said craig i resent the implication i ignored him you trying to tell me jo didnt try it on with you ah ah ah is that what youre fucking giving me fucking ah well you did fuck her you shite she fuckin jumped me man it was practically rape fuck off ed an anyway she said shed never done it wif a black guy wot was i supposed to do deprive her dont bring race into it for fucks sake and dont give me this big black stud bullshit either i didnt bring race into it man she did aw ed fuck off how could you i couldnt help it man well fucking try learning you overgrown adolescent look man i am sorry i felt terrible the next day an it never appened again yeah youd had your fun fucked your friends girl and added another notch to your fucking ceiling mirrors why bother ken listen if i could go back in time an make it that it nevvir appened believe me i would i nevvir told you because i didnt want to hurt you or do anyfin against you an jo i wish it just adnt appened i truly do but it did an im sorry man i really am sorry im asking you to forgive me right well just im not i spluttered just let me fucking be angry at you a bit longer i said you bastard i added rather ineffectually sorry man and i thought yeah were all sorry everybody is so fucking sorry it should be the fucking species middle name homo s sapiens maybe we could change it by misdeed poll listen ed said something cold seemed to land in my guts oh good grief a listen from ed now what what i said you got this telly fing tomorrow avent you oh fuck hed heard about robe after all and worked out that i might want a gun to take into the studio yes i said best of luck wif it all right hope it goes well you give this nazi geezer wotfor yeah yeah i said you can go back to bein mad at me now if you want or you can wait till we meet up next weekend an shout at me then if were still meetin up we still meetin up i suppose im sorry man yeah still bruvvers yeah i suppose so still bruvvaz craig invited me to supper i suspected it was a sympathy thing nikki was staying and emma was coming round and i think what they really wanted was a quiet evening meal with just the three of them what i really wanted was to see nikki again just to be sure that we were okay and that nothing had changed at least not for the worse after the new year party because that kiss those two kisses had left me worried id let her kiss me and id kissed her back and the more id thought about this over the intervening period the more ashamed id become and i felt a terrible urge to tell her that it had changed nothing and of course it would never happen again and that i was sorry too for the time in the land rover in the rain on the day of the crash when id tried in what now felt like a deeply sad and desperate way to persuade her to have lunch with me and that id always always be a good friend and a good uncle for her for the rest of her life though at the same time i also wanted not to have to say anything at all and to have everything be just the same as it had always been between us with no awkwardness or distance the trouble was that emma would be there too and if craig mentioned what had happened with jo id asked him not to say anything to nikki or emma and especially not to mention jo and ed but still then it might get awkward given the history i had with emma it was a very slim sliver of history i kept on telling myself but it was no less potentially lethal for my relationship with craig for that i was in danger of losing one girlfriend two best friends and tomorrow maybe my job and liberty all in one insane fortyeighthour period screw the nut i thought batten down supper would have been nice and i had such a bad hangover id probably not want to drink very much and so it would actually constitute quite a sensible measured preparation for the big day tomorrow but i decided to say no other plans ken hi amy kid how are you brilliant you ah kinda you know darling no i dont what is there a problem jo and i are over oh im sorry to hear that you seemed so close well i said did we i thought i wouldnt have said so but then maybe that was just the sort of thing you said when somebody told you something like this yeah i said its its ah very finished with kind of saw it coming but hit me a little harder than id expected must confess gosh you poor thing yeah nearly two years really yeah feels like longer right felt quite a lot for her i have to say well of course all gone now oh dear anyway hmm are you going to be all right amy ill live oh dear you sound so sad ah ill get over it one day oh is there anything i can do well i supposeyou could let me take you out to dinner tonight even how does that sound that sounds like a totally bloody marvellous idea ken i was at a bit of a loose end myself actually i looked at the mobile thinking well you might have got onmessage a bit earlier there woman amy for goodness sake there are two lies here one is that private management is automatically better than public but it is have you ever dealt with a local authority ken those useless bloody people wouldnt last two minutes in the real world neither did railtrack once the government subsidy was whipped away ha i bet they got their people from local government oh dont be look the other great lie is that private can be cheaper it brings in extra money but thats bullshit just treasury accounting rules infrastructure costs no matter who builds it you have to invest in it so invest as cheaply as possible pay the least you can in interest payments and thats even before you factor in the profits a private investor expects too that comes on top so ask yourself who or what can borrow money cheaper than any commercial concern answer the state i think youll find that depends on which state actually ken okay the british state can borrow money cheaper for a smaller interest rate than any commercial concern yes because it doesnt go wasting it on things the private sector can do better amy thats ridiculous no it isnt and what about risk what risk if it all goes wrong the poor bloody taxpayer ends up paying theres always a risk ken amy said smiling thinly at me life is full of risk i sat back in my seat we were in la eateria an achingly trendy new restaurant in islington wooden garden furniture for tables and chairs and walls lined with that perforated orange plastic stuff builders use to create instant fences menu pretentious food barely adequate staff surly i was amazed it wasnt busier still it was a sunday night amy looked great with her fine now straight blond hair glowing in the light of what looked like car headlights dangling from the ceiling she was dressed in black tights and skirt and a clingy black longsleeved top with a gold chain lying on the tanned skin revealed by a square low neck so she looked superb and shed dressed up if shed appeared in paintspeckled jeans and an unironed tshirt id have known there was no way anything was going to happen and yet suddenly for the first time in all the times wed met to eat shed turned into little miss capitalist lobby girl until now all our lunch and dinner datesthatwerenotreallydates had consisted of eating drinking and flirting dammit theyd been great fun certainly no arguments about fucking pfi and ppps i mean i knew that the lobbying firm she worked for was involved in promoting that sort of crap but jeez shed never started pushing it at me id made one offhand remark about railtrack and the forthcoming attractions of postrack and tubetrack and shed jumped down my throat feet first you know what really gets me i said putting my fork down i hadnt eaten much of my main course the chef here seemed obsessed with height and apparently chose his ingredients and cooking methods to ensure the maximum altitude and stability of the towers of material the kitchen created with edibility and taste coming way down the list of priorities probably somewhere between the grid of soggy rosti and the layer of gluelike mustard mash acting as a holdfast no i dont know what really gets you ken amy said levering a forkful of her lamb and figs towards her mouth but i have the awful feeling youre just dying to tell me dying to shit i hadnt even told her about the whole raine thing my inadvertent trip to the east end the threatening phone call and the slashed tyres on the landy yet id told craig ed and jo and sworn them all to secrecy but with amy id been holding it in reserve for later in the evening now i was starting to think there was no point yes i said what i want to know is why put what is basically greed above the urge to serve whats wrong with wanting to help people isnt that what politicians say they want to do they say they just want to serve society they tell us thats why they became politicians in the first fucking place so why dont they side with the nurses and the teachers and the fire brigade and the police and all the other people who really do serve they do side with the police kenneth oh so they do but what about everybody else so are they lying about wanting to serve and just want power or have they just not made the connection yet amy sat back too breathing deeply and flexing her shoulders i tried to keep eye contact and appreciate her breasts by peripheral vision only but it was almost an insult to them on the other hand maybe i should make the most of the view because it looked like what i was seeing now was all i was ever going to see amy shook her head and said you really are quite naïve arent you ken am i yes you seem so cluedup and clever but really you just scratch the surface of everything dont you if you say so amy she looked at me for a bit her eyes were greenyblue and her irises had that overdefined look you get with contacts sometimes she was still breathing fairly deeply and i just let my gaze fall to her chest which was pleasant in a regretful sort of way youre just sir jamies little performing monkey but you think youre some sort of cool radical type isnt that right ken i thought about this on a good day i conceded with a following i suppose you think youre mouth corps conscience or something dont you oh no jester maybe bladder bit of string that sort of thing you know amy sat forward think about this ken she said i sat forward too eager to be given something to think about you let sir jamie get away with more amy told me by employing you and allowing you to do your little rants and letting you criticise bits of the mouth corp empire and the people and the organisations it gets into bed with sir jamie can give the impression of being evenhanded and fair and able to tolerate criticism whats actually going on is that the bad corporate stuff which mouth corp does as much as anybody gets a lot less publicity than it deserves thanks to you she sat back so did i but she wasnt finished you cost the radio station the occasional ad placement and mouth corp loses the odd contract but sir jamie gets his moneys worth out of you ken dont think he doesnt youre part of the system too you help make it work we all do its just that some of us know it and some of us dont she dabbed at the corner of her mouth with her napkin i looked at her for a moment her eyes were bright she was smiling i thought about ceel and wondered suddenly what the hell i was doing here so i said do i get to fuck you or not she laughed and leaned forward again which was a good thing in itself voice lower this time have you got any drugs ken any e or charlie it actually occurred to me to lie and say no can you believe that not on me get some okay so we did but it wasnt very good the drugs or the sex eight denial maybe jos right i hate so many things im a media person and theres so much media stuff i just despise from comics who make fun of their audience ah the masochism of paying good money to be insulted in public to crap like big brother hours and hours of boring selfobsessed dimwits trying to be zany while performing pointless stupid tasks that would be an insult to anyone with half a brain ali g dennis pennis mrs merton trigger happy tv shows that make me squirm with embarrassment and sometimes feel the beginnings of sympathy even for people who deserve nothing but my unalloyed hatred god i hated so much tv these days and the terrifying thing was it was this stuff that was popular i who was out of step numty tv we called it on the show part of our longterm and deeply insidious campaign to bring more scottish words into daytoday english usage the only aspect of numty tv i liked was the notobviouslysetup entries on youve been framed but part of me was ashamed of that because i couldnt help feeling there was an edge of cruelty watching this stuff you see a clip begin with some bozo on rollerblades wobbling towards the camcorder at high speed or perched precariously on a still shiny mountain bike and tearing down a rutted path between the trees or almost anything to do with jet skis high winds people on a rope swing over a muddy puddle or weddings or wedding reception dances and you could feel yourself thinking oh goody thisll be a laugh it was fun watching people making fools of themselves but the question is should it be better to watch the truly despicable suffer which was why i was here i supposed here was a victorian warehouse in clerkenwell converted into a tv studio and the place where winsome productions would be making their new if muchdelayed and rescheduled lateevening news magazine and analysis show breaking news most of it would be live but the bit id be doing was being recorded sensibly after id had my mad bad idea for what to do here id felt really deflated when id learned that the piece with the holocaust denier would be taped rather than shown live id wanted the buzz of it happening for real but then i also started to feel relieved thinking well no point in doing it at all then before i caught myself and thought oh yes there is no chickening out though i might still chicken out there was a heavy metallic lump in the right pocket of my jacket reminding me that i had something to do here something nobody was expecting but i knew that when it came to the moment i might still ignore it play along do what everybody expected me to do and do nothing more than shoot my mouth off it was late afternoon i felt overbriefed phil had gone through the obvious stuff with me and so had yet another young attractive breathless awfully wellspoken researcher our presenter would be cavan luttonjames a slim darkly handsome and energetic guy with a quick clipped but clear delivery and a natty interview style which could veer from emollient to biting in the turn of a phrase he was irish so id already stockpiled one or two remarks about ireland s inglorious part in the great war against fascism to keep in reserve just in case any misguided ideas about balance caused him to start siding with the bad guy a bad guy i hadnt seen yet they were keeping us apart the only person id met in the green room apart from a couple of attractive but breathlessly awfully production assistants at least one of whom was called ravenna was a young comedian called preston wynne who came across as a bit of a fan boy and was supposed to record a topical robust cuttingedge irreverent yadayada piece on something or other after wed done the big holocaust denial discussionconfrontation he was still working on his script while he sat in the green room clattering quietly on his ibook staring at a plate of gourmet sandwiches and drinking too much coffee i almost felt like telling him to let the piece run longer than hed been told and even be prepared to pad a little because the bit i was going to be on might not have quite the runtime the producer was expecting but of course i didnt i didnt even have a drink in the green room i really wanted one but i kept myself sober because i wanted to be sharp and fully alert for what was going to happen phil and i had spent a sober lunch in the corner of the black pig another basic soho boozer similar to the bough phil was obviously worried i was going to make a mess of things lose my rag freeze rant incoherently and start foaming at the mouth whatever hed really wanted to come along with me but id told him weeks ago he wasnt going to partly this was for the stated reason that he wasnt my dad and i didnt need my hand held but partly also it was because he might a guess just from my look or behaviour closer to the event that i was going to get up to something seriously offpiste and so give the game away and b catch a little less flak from our mutual bosses after id done what i intended to do if i had the guts to actually do it umm what else oh yeah and obviously the whole thing about the second world war not happening too thats obviously a brilliant line to take its so basically ludicrous yet its not intrinsically any more so than claiming the holocaust didnt happen i know phil i sighed we have kind of been through this i know i know but youve got to get this rehearsed no i dont actually rehearsed is the last thing i want it to be too risky what if you make a mess of it look i dont make a mess of it in front of a million radio listeners five days a week why should i make a mess of it in front of a latenight channel four audience of probably fewer people when its taped for fucks sake oh yeah and you wont swear will you phil have i ever fucking sworn on air phil looked like a man with severe diarrhoea sitting in a land rover heading quickly down a bumpy jungle path towards extremely distant toilets well no he admitted but i still dont know how you do it i mean it doesnt seem possible youve managed to avoid it all these years well i have what even on inverclyde sound strathclyde sound the radio station where the creatives typist missed the space bar rather than accidentally hit the exclamation mark key and no not even there its because even though it might not sound like it i do have a pretty accurate idea exactly what im going to say the instant before i say it i never forget the context am i in the pub or the studio and theres just sufficient time for my onboard censor to step in and make the relevant if not always perfectly elegant or sometimes even grammatical amendments right well anyway its latenight channel four for christs sake not blue peter if they can say fuck on sex and the city i dont see why i cant christ i heard a cunt on larry sanders once phils eyes went wide oh no i really dont think you should look will you just calm down a bit i told him im not going on intending to swear okay he said okay but he still looked worried of course what i wanted to add was dammit man i wont have time to swear itll probably all be over in about five seconds and i really wouldnt worry your ugly big head about what im going to say again though i didnt i was plumbed in id half expected it would be radio mikes always attached to you with a warning not to visit the loo with them switched on in case you want to cause the sound engineers ooh seconds of hilarity but they were using hard wire instead what appeared to be a clone of one of the attractive but awfully assistants slipped the wire beneath my jacket under the button of my shirt just above the waistband of my trousers and then once id worked it upwards attached it between the top two buttons of my shirt i was going for the relaxed casual opennecked look besides they take your tie off you in the nick along with your belt and laces the awfully assistant smiled as we were negotiating the cool black wire up between my chest and the fabric of the shirt and i smiled back but while wed been doing this her bare arm had swung against my jacket and made the pocket clunk off the seat and i was secretly terrified she was going to see the sweat prickling up underneath my makeup and ask hey whats that hard heavy metallic thing in your jacket pocket paranoia the terrible thing about paranoia is you always have the sneaking suspicion that the moment it passes is when youll be at your most vulnerable they tested for sound and then the black microphone wire was taped to the arm of the plastic and chrome chair i was sitting in below desk level and therefore out of sight for the cameras that would be trained on me on the blackpainted floor the mike cable snaked away almost invisible save for the lengths of silver gaffer tape securing it there i looked about the rest of the studio cavan would be in between us a couple of metres away from me round the giant commashaped wooden desk his seat was bigger and higherbacked than mine or the bad guys which was another two metres past cavans round the curve lots of bright overhead lights kept the place very warm somebody sat in the chair across the desk from mine and for a moment i wondered what was going on it was one of the awfully assistants not the scumbag holocaust denier i was expecting then another assistant plonked herself in cavans seat in the middle and i realised they were just sitting in for the real people while they got the cameras sorted out in front of cavans position was a big camera with on the front the downwardangled hood and attached upwardfacing monitor of an autocue a little bearded guy looked almost lost behind the camera minutely adjusting its position according to instructions through his headphones there were two surprisingly small unmanned cameras on heavy tripods one for me and one for the bad guy plus an umbilicalled handheld manned by a plump guy who at this point was muttering into his own headmike as he crouched back and forth rehearsing where he could go within the curve in front of the big desk without getting in shot from the other cameras everybody was listening on their headphones and earpieces to the people in the production suite and for a while it was actually very peaceful sitting there in what was more or less silence feeling pleasantly politely ignored while everything else was sorted out somebody rolled a big monitor screen on a trolley to a position a couple of metres behind the cameras and turned it on it showed a blue screen with a big white clock face on it and the programme id it sat static unchanging in the midst of a semihush punctuated with murmurs i found myself thinking about ceel i remembered the feel of her body the precise touch of her fingers the satiny sensation of running my hand across her back the deep musky smell of her hair the taste of her lips after a mouthful of champagne the taste of her sweat from the hollow formed by her collar bone and most of all the sound of her voice that measured softness with the faint ghost of accent a calmly sinuous stream of quiet amusement breaking into sudden rapids when she laughed the monitor flickered the blue and white display replaced with a view of the assistant sitting in cavans chair then the clock and ident display flicked on again i was missing her it had been a month now since id seen her and a long month at that i supposed time seemed to stretch over the xmasnew year holidays for everybody but i felt id been particularly busy which made the interval seem longer id spent an unhealthy amount of time over the holidays checking that there had been no crashes of air france flights bound for or coming back from martinique or sudden unseasonal hurricanes or fresh volcanic eruptions in the eastern caribbean things were falling apart around me and it felt like it was all because ceel wasnt here there was no logic to this feeling whatsoever and it wasnt as though ceel and i spent very much time in each others company when she was around we saw each other for about half a day once a fortnight so she shouldnt really have felt like any great influence on my life but nevertheless with her away i felt adrift and disconnected my life tumbling chaotically there wasnt even the promise or at least the possibility that we might meet up in a day or two steadying me from a distance coping with my breakup with jo with the ramifications of that touching ed and craig with everything that had happened at the new year party with this continuing campaign of damage and threat some bastard was mounting against me not to mention the chilly contemplation of what i was thinking of doing here left me feeling dangerously exposed and at risk it was like trying to control a skid on a bike on a rainy street that same feeling of cold gutclenching panic while wrestling desperately with something powerful but suddenly wild and out of control id had a few skids like that in my courier days id always managed to stay upright and i was proud of that but id never kidded myself that on each occasion it had been anything other than luck mostly that had kept me out of the gutter or from under the wheels of a bus at least those incidents were over in seconds this was going on for weeks months everything i might have hung onto for support seemed compromised i needed ceel i needed to access her calmness secure myself to that perverse rationality of hers i looked at the seat straight across from me where the bad guy would be sitting i glanced at my watch i hated the way they kept you hanging around for tv i just wasnt cut out for this medium paul my agent despaired of me because id been offered tv stuff in the past plenty of times but the proposals always read like shit and id turned them down they all seemed gimmicky strained and overly elaborated but that was almost not the point on radio you just go in and do it you can talk about stuff in the pub or the office beforehand effectively rehearsing bits and you can script little exchanges and sketches and therere always trailers and prerecorded stuff to work painstakingly over until its note perfect but most of it the best of it i think is just stuff that happens words that come out of your mouth almost as you think allowing for the onboard censor which i was not bullshitting phil about on radio that fresh stuff is the norm on tv its very much the exception and most of its recorded reheated so you sit there and make some really funny or cutting point and then discover there was a glitch on a camera feed or somebody backed into a bit of the set and knocked it over and they have to start again and you have to either try to say something about the same thing which is totally different but just as witty or say the same again and pretend its spontaneous i hated that shit come to think of it some of that had been the gist of phils little laidback rant in the capital live canteen a month or so earlier i seemed to have appropriated it oh well that wouldnt be the first time my mouth was dry there was a very small plastic cup of still water in front of me which i drained i looked around holding it out and one of the awfully assistants came and topped it up with evian i wanted to sink the lot right there but i put it back on the desk i suspected theyd take it away before we started recording ken a very smooth irish voice said from behind me nice to ah now no dont you get up cavan good to meet you i couldnt have got up anyway not with the mike wire securing me to the chair i shook hands from a seated position cavan hi i smoothed down the flap over my right jacket pocket making sure he couldnt see into it cavan perched one fawn armaniclad buttock on the desk between my seat and his he looked tanned underneath the makeup and there was a hint of shadow where his beard would have been that probably no amount of shaving would remove his blue eyes were deep set brows dark and full and shaped a sharp ledge of black hair sat over his forehead its very good of you to come in my pleasure cavan a translucent wire coiled up from inside the rear collar of his jacket and ended in a discreet fleshcoloured earphone in his right ear where his soft beige jacket fell open against his hip i could see the radio transmitter clipped to his belt no hardwiring for cavan youve been booked in for a while ken is that right for what has on occasion felt like a significant part of my life cavan yes he laughed soundlessly yes well sorry about that he sighed and looked off into the shadows weve all been kept hanging around while winsome have been getting themselves sorted out im sure its been a lot worse for you than it was for me ah yes its been a frustrating old time to have a current affairs show waiting in the wings while all this historys been happening but hopefully well be making up for ah excuse me will you sure lawson brierley that was the name of the man who walked out of the darkness blinking in the light my age green cords fogey jacket yellow waistcoat farm managers shirt and a cravat i almost smiled tall mediumheavy build verging on beefy hair like grey sand not a badlooking face in a bland sort of way except his nose was a little bulbous and he had the peering scrunched look of a vain man on a date trying to do without his glasses exfederation of conservative students one of the hang nelson mandela brigade later thrown out for being too rightwing exnational front quit when they moved too far to the left and ex a few other extremeright groups and parties claimed to be a libertarian racist now i knew one or two people whod come to libertarianism from the left and people like lawson brierley had them spitting blood monetarist fundamentalist might be a more accurate description of his views with the racist bit never very far away according to lawson evolution was the ultimate free market in which the white races were proving their innate superiority through money science and arms threatened only by the perfidious guile of the jews and the hordes of dark and dirty untermenschen breeding like flies thanks to the misguided beneficence of the west wed got all this off the mans own website he ran he basically was something called the freedom research institute lawson genuinely didnt approve of democracy he believed in getting rid of the state and in reply to the point that doing so would leave companies corporations multinationals or whatever you would call multinationals when there were no more nations in complete control of the world he would have said yes so these corporations would be owned by shareholders and money was the fairest way to exercise power because as a rule stupid people would have less of it and therefore less influence than more intelligent people and it was the more intelligent and successful people you wanted controlling things not the great unwashed id decided my considered reply to all this would have been something on the lines of fuck the fucking shareholders you ghastly fascist cunt i watched him sit down and get miked up he was being wired in taped to the seat like id been good i couldnt make out what he was saying to the production assistant and the sound engineer as they helped him get settled in he didnt look over at me cavan had spoken a few words to him and then nodded and gone to sit in his own big seat in the middle getting its position just so clearing his throat a few times patting his tie down and running a hand over the air above his hair my heart was beating hard now somebody came to take away the little cup of water but i had them wait a moment while i drained it my hand trembling my bladder seemed to think i needed to pee but i knew i didnt really it felt like i was listing to the right with the weight in my jacket pocket to the right how very very inappropriate i thought the monitor behind the cameras flicked to the headon waistup shot of cavan coming from the big camera with the autocue the floor manager announced we were doing a taped rehearsal of the intro cavan cleared his throat a few more times okay quiet in the studio the floor manager said then turning over she did the five four three thing with the two and the one shown only on her fingers cavan took a breath and said the vexed issue of race now and the provenance or not of the holocaust in the first of a series of breaking news special features pitching two people with profoundly different views against each other im joined tonight by lawson brierley a selflabelled libertarian racist from the free research institute and ken nott from londons capital live doyen of the socalled sorry no problem the floor manager said she was a tall gangly girl with closecut brown hair she wore big headphones and held a clipboard and a stopwatch she listened to her phones again okay she said you all right cavan cavan was squinting towards the camera ahead of him shading his eyes from the overhead lights ah could you just move the autocue up a tiny little bit he asked the man with the big camera adjusted it fractionally was i really a doyen i wondered that meant old didnt it more senior rather than ancient if i recalled the dictionary definition correctly but still i was sweating badly now theyd probably notice and have to stop and bring one of the makeup girls in to touch up my face i felt a pain in my guts and wondered if i was giving myself an ulcer cavan nodded fine now he cleared his throat again okay said the floor manager everybody okay she looked around at us everybody seemed to be okay i wasnt going to say anything about sweating lawson brierley sat blinking looking from cavan to the monitor still avoiding my gaze the little bearded guy with the big camera adjusted it back to where it had been before but cavan didnt notice were going again quiet in the studio turning over said the floor manager and five four three the vexed issue of race now and the provenance or not of the holocaust in the first of a series of breaking news special features pitching two people with profoundly different views against each other im joined tonight by lawson brierley a selflabelled libertarian racist from the freedom research institute and ken nott from londons capital live doyen of the socalled shock jocks and as hes described himself unrepentant postlefty cavan raised his eyebrows for effect first though this report by mara engless on the undeniable existence of deniers i looked over to lawson brierley he was smiling at cavan good the floor manager said nodding good perfect cavan cavan nodded gravely okay were going for how longs the video bit cavan asked the floor manager looked away for a moment then said three twenty cavan right right and were just going straight into the interviews the ah discussion bit now right thats right cavan fine fine cavan cleared his throat a few more times i found myself wanting to clear my own throat too as though in sympathy everybody ready to go it looked like we were all ready to go okay quiet in the studio i put my hand in my pocket turning over in my pocket the plastic coating the metal felt cold and slick in my right hand and five four three i leaned forward slightly to hide my hand coming out of my pocket two my other hand was at my belly holding steadying one click cavan took a breath and turned to me ken nott if i can turn to you first youre on record as id snipped the mike cable with the pliers i had tried to think all this through weeks and weeks earlier and id guessed they might wire us up that was why id brought the pliers in my jacket pocket but that wasnt the clever bit i let the pliers fall as i kicked the seat back and jumped up on the big desk id have settled for three seats in an arc but the desk was better id reckoned as long as i didnt take too long getting myself up there it would provide a highway so far so good seat falling backwards out of the way and a clean leap up onto the wooden surface though that wasnt the clever bit either cavan had time to shut his mouth and jerk back lawson brierleys eyes were going wide i ran at him across the desk id worn a pair of black trainers for purchase so i wouldnt slip just for this that too was not the clever bit lawson had his hands on the desk edge tensing to push himself backwards cavan was falling off his seat as i passed him from the corner of my other eye i thought i saw the big camera and the guy with the handheld both tracking me from the shadows behind cavan somebody threw themself forward and grabbed at my feet but missed i threw myself down too my left hand out to grab brierleys cravat if i could my right hand coming back in a fist lawson was moving backwards but he hadnt started pushing away in time plus the mike wire would be slowing him down i hit the desk on my belly and slid my left hand missed his cravat catching him by the padding in the left shoulder of his hacking jacket instead but my right fist smacked satisfactorily and painfully for my fingers into his left cheek just below the eye my momentum and his push carried us both back over his seat falling in a flailing tangle to the floor behind where i landed another couple of lighter blows and he managed to thump me once on the side of the ribs and once on the back of the head with weak painless punches before we were pulled apart by security guards and production people that obviously wasnt the clever bit either brierley was ushered away shouting about communist violence and intimidation surrounded by headphoned staff while i was held the backs of my thighs against the desk by two uniformed security guards i was smiling at lawson and not struggling at all i was highly gratified to see that lawson already looked like he was developing what we used to call back where i came from a keeker a nice black eye a door closed softly in the darkness and brierleys shouts were silenced its okay guys i told the security guards promise i wont run after him they kept holding me but their grip might have relaxed a little i looked around cavan seemed to have disappeared as well i grinned at each of the two security guards as the floor manager came over she looked professional and unruffled ken mr nott would you like to go back to the green room fine i said though ill want my pliers back or a receipt i smiled ill pay for a new mike cable still not the clever bit ken cavan came into the green room the two guards were in there with me and two of the awfullies i was watching news on the rooms tv and relaxing with a scotch and soda not something id normally countenance but hey it was only a blend and besides i felt a certain refreshing desire to get drunk quickly cavan i said he looked a little flushed there was a smile on his face that looked unhappy to be there well that was a bit of a surprise there ken what was that all about what was what i asked cavan sat on the edge of the table with all the sandwiches and drink bit of a rush to the head there ken cavan i said i have no idea what youre talking about the door opened again and the exec producer came in a small bald harassed sullenlooking guy id met briefly earlier whose name id forgotten the instant id been told it ken he said throatily ken what what what was that i mean we just cant allow i mean that was just that was really just i mean what what on earth cavan old son i said i mean i mean what you cant just cant are you calling the police no respect professionalism ah the police ashamed of yourself quite i mean i dont yes are you calling the police in my entire career eh ah now disgrace just a disgrace have you called the police do you intend to call the police what you could be thinking of ive no idea ken your man here might know mike we calling the police what i ah i i dont know should we mike looked at cavan who shrugged he looked at me guys i laughed i cant tell you i returned my attention to the telly and said i think you should find out whether the feds are to be involved because otherwise im about to leave ah leave said mike the exec producer mmhmm i said sipping my drink and watching shots of camp xray but well we thought we could maybe still do the discussion i mean if you would agree cavan crossed his arms and appeared innocently bemused i was looking at the two of them shaking my head listen guys i have no fucking intention of even beginning to take that nasty little rightwing shitheads diseased ideas seriously to debate them for fucks sake i looked back at the tv never did i muttered i looked back at the producer he was standing with his mouth open i frowned you did get it all on tape didnt you yes of course we did good i said very good i watched the tv a moment longer so i said to him when he still hadnt gone if you could just find out if the boys in blue are going to be involved or not okay thanks i nodded at the door and then went back to watching the guys in orange shuffling between the cages in guantanamo he shook his head at me and left i smiled at the two attractive awfullies who grinned back nervously cavan chuckled and got up to leave well he said if im not mistaken ken youve totally fucked us he opened the door but it was elegantly done he nodded as he left look after yourself i just smiled at him actually at that point id quite happily have settled for whacking a fascist and getting away with it but in theory according to the mad bad plan at least what had to happen next was that somebody did take the matter further and the cops did become involved and i was formally charged with assault because then despite all the witnesses despite the cameras and the videotape and the thing being replayable in slow motion from two or three different angles and certainly despite what i hoped would develop into a splendid black eye for lawson brierley i had every intention in front of the police in front of the lawyers in front of a judge and in front of a jury if it came to that of denying it had ever happened and that was the fucking clever bit nine big guns i knew you were up to something fuck off you did not i did why do you think i was so nervous earlier in the pig youre always nervous when im doing something you cant control phil made a noise you could only call a gasp now thats not true ken thats unfair he seemed genuinely hurt i put a hand on his shoulder it was still true mind you but i said sorry you didnt really hit him did you yup biffed the blighter on the phizog a proper punch a proper punch look at them bunch a fives i held my right hand out to show him the grazes on the knuckles my hand still hurt youre really proud of this arent you i thought about it yes i said we were in the bough phil had said hed hang about capital live until the recording for breaking news was finished expecting a debriefing hed been suitably surprised when id walked into the office barely ninety minutes after id left him for the studio in clerkenwell you attacked him kayla had said sitting back in her chair in her winter camos and chewing on a pen id nodded and shed got up and kissed me brilliant ken phil and his assistant andi had looked aghast at each other andi had said pub now id suggest but they didnt call the police not so far they spent most of their time trying to persuade me to stay and continue with the debate i dont know what put them off eventually me stonewalling or the makeup girls running out of foundation to cover up lawsons black eye eventually i just walked out and got a taxi do you think brierley will press charges no idea i drank my london pride and smiled widely at phil dont fucking care youve been planning this for weeks havent you months actually since it was first brought up in debbies office back in september i had that classic dilemma thing going where you dont want to give these people a platform but on the other hand you want to get them in public and grind the grisly fuckers into the dust and i actually really thought i could do it because im a fucking militant liberal not the wishywashy sort that would try to understand the bastard or just be appalled but then i thought na just give the piece of shit a taste of his own medicine phil was silent for a while so i looked at him he was sitting sideon looking at me what maybe i dont know you as well as i thought i did yeah i grinned good eh if he does press charges though you could be in serious trouble first offence no weapon involved i dont think ill be going to prison i did have a doomsday scenario going on in my head about getting carried away once i got my hands on the fuck and beating him to a pulp leaving him paralysed or dead or something or with a telefunken ub rammed up his arse but in the end it played out pretty well i can stand a fine and being bound over to keep the peace or whatever i was thinking more about your job i glanced at him yeah in theory not just in theory i thought i was pretty safe there we havent had a dressing down for shit weeks ken for goodness sake we exist on a knifeedge all the time whether or not we get a formal warning or even just a quiet word ive had the ads department on to me about cancellations from american airlines the israeli tourist board and one or two others ive managed to repress obviously theyre hurting there are few enough big campaigns going as it is at the moment losing those that are on offer is giving them sleepless nights and im pretty sure news of the pain is being passed up the corporate structure i frowned well maybe the israeli tourist board will come back now ive beaten up a horrible holocaust denier i glanced at phil he wore a suitably sceptical expression or maybe he said this could be the bale of hay that breaks the camels back id check your contract never mind vague stuff about bringing the station into disrepute ill bet any criminal proceedings even pending threatened ones means they can pull you off air without pay shit i had a horrible feeling he was right id better phone my agent so mr mcnutt would you like to describe what happened in the studio of winsome productions in clerkenwell london on the afternoon of monday the fourteenth of january in your own words oh shit it was the same ds whod interviewed me about the east end trip when id broken the taxis windscreen and punched raine in the face id had the choice of coming to my local nick to give a statement and id stupidly taken it the ds was a young white guy sharpfaced but a little jowly with brown hair starting to recede at the temples he smiled in your own time mr mcnutt he patted the big clunky wooden cassette recorder sitting on the desk in the interview room i didnt like the relish with which he pronounced my name for about the five hundredth time in my life to date i cursed my parents for not having changed their name by deed poll before i was born it never happened i said a pause what the entire afternoon no whatever im being accused of i said assault mr mcnutt yes that it didnt happen they made it all up i was starting to sweat this had seemed like such a great plan right up until i had to start following through with it they made it all up yes so what did happen sir i went along to do an interview and it was cancelled i see the detective sergeant thought for a moment he looked at his notes at what point was it cancelled i never left the green room i said feeling suddenly inspired the what sir the green room the hospitality suite its where they put you before they need you in the studio i see i never left it they came and told me the interview the discussion was being cancelled the ds looked at me through narrowed eyes you are aware sir that you will be asked to repeat what youre saying under oath in court oh shit perjury why hadnt i thought of that id been too busy congratulating myself on my own cleverness and blithely assuming that everybody would just play along once they saw what i was up to i had thought this through a hundred times but somehow it always ended with me modestly accepting man of the year awards not being sent down for perjury i gulped i may well choose to say nothing under oath now the ds was looking at me as though i was simply mad i cleared my throat i think i should talk to my lawyer before i say anything else so i definitely get to be tried by a jury if you insist mr nott yes however id strongly advise that you take the option of going before a magistrates court instead the lawyer was called maggie sefton she worked for the criminal department of my own lawyers firm she had deep brown skin and beautiful eyes behind the tiniest most lowprofile glasses id ever seen but i need to plead not guilty i protested im trying to make a political point here this could make the news dammit wont that mean it has to go to a higher court not really no and it is usually best to avoid going before a judge but why because magistrates cant impose custodial sentences i frowned ms sefton smiled the sympathetic worldlywise smile adults lay on children sometimes when the poor darlings just totally fail to understand the way things actually happen in the big bad world they cant send you to jail kenneth whereas a high court judge can shit i said id sent amy some flowers at her office but she sent them back after our rather unsatisfactory bout of going through the motions on the sunday night shed said shed call me but she hadnt so after two days id headed for the nearest florist id thought a dozen red roses would be just the right gesture for the sort of retro goodtime semiposh girl id had her characterised as it certainly wasnt something id normally do but obviously id got it completely wrong the dozen roses arrived back before i set off for work on the thursday three days after the breaking news fracas the note accompanying them said ken interesting but hardly worth commemorating see you sometime a bitch i said to myself even though i had to admit she was right i took the wrapping off the flowers and threw them into the river it was a flood tide so as they drifted slowly upstream sped on their way by a stiff northeasterly i reflected ruefully that if i came back at the rightwrong time this afternoon i could watch them all come sailing back down again come to think of it a timely combination of tides and winds could conceivably keep their bedraggled distributed sorriness within sight of the temple belle for days even weeks i shrugged stuffed the wrapping paper into the bin and headed for the car park and the car capital live had sent for me the landy was still in the garage it had been fitted with its two new tyres three in fact as the spare on the back door had been stabbed as well but they hadnt replaced its headlights yet my phone went as soon as i turned it on walking up the pontoon towards the car park debbie youre up and running very early how are you come straight to my office when you get in all right i took a couple of steps im fine too debs thanks for asking just be there okay ah okay i said ohoh i thought why whats happening see you soon she hung up the motorola vibrated again as i got to the lexus waiting at the kerb a lexus it had been a mondeo yesterday good job something was looking up i waved to the driver who was reading the telegraph nott i asked unfolding the buzzing phone as he folded the paper i thought it was best to ask id once jumped into another houseboat dwellers limo waiting to take them to heathrow for capital live thats me boss the driver said i got in belted up and into the phone said yes phil the papers have got it what i asked as the car pulled smoothly away lawson brierleys institute for fascist studies or whatever its called released a press statement this morning basically saying they can see what youre trying to do here but blah blah blah the full majesty of english law and common anglosaxon justice must take precedence over arrogant and theatrical pseudointellectual cosmopolitan political machinations youre not paraphrasing there i hope no weve just had the mail on the phone followed by the sun followed by the standard and then itn the eye and the guardian im expecting to collect the rest of the set before the hour is out why is your landline down i pulled it out last night some fucker rang about one in the morning and kept ringing but not leaving a message on the machine plus their identity was withheld so i got annoyed and wheeched it probably a journo favoured by mr brierley getting wind of it early you werent doorstepped this morning were you no you were lucky you in the car yup well if you want to avoid questions at this end have the driver take you down into the car park here and take the lift okay yeah shit okay i sighed oh fuck here we go courage mon brave yeah right see you soon yeah in debbies office damn shes heard has she oh yes thatll be whos jamming my internal line here better talk to you when you get here meet you down in the car park see you there i put the phone away the driver looked at me in the mirror but didnt say anything i sat and watched the traffic go past shit what if they were going to fire me id taken heart bizarrely from the profoundly noxious ninas remarks about publicity id thought that no matter how messy everything got with the assault in the studio at least it would be great publicity for me and the show and the station and that because of that everybody would be happy good grief had i actually been insufficiently cynical maybe amy was right maybe i was naïve i thought back to the night in soho during the summer with ed and craig and me not dipping far enough down into the cess of human motivation with my imagination being so innocent as to think that the worst reaction towards somebody who was helpless and vulnerable was indifference not something worse how personally and professionally embarrassing i got lost in the traffic for a while submerged in memories a dispatch rider swept past on his panniered bandit oh well i thought if i did get fired and i couldnt get in anywhere else i could always get a job being a bike courier again or maybe ed would take me seriously if i said i finally really really wanted to be a proper clubtype dj fuck yeah the money was good and just because id been dismissive about it in the past and gone along for the fun drugs and women didnt mean i couldnt try to make a go of it as a career now boy george could do it why couldnt i we were drawing to a stop in the mall pulling in to the side near the ica whats the problem i asked the driver glanced in the mirror pressed the hazard warning lights killed the engine and turned round handing the keys to me i looked at them lying in my hand wondering what the hell was going on id like a word mr nott he said this was itself enough to have me tense up and check that the doorlock buttons were in the unlocked position but i dont want to alarm you he nodded at the keys in my hand thats why ive given you them if you want to get out you can he was about fifty a balding slightly overweight guy with the sort of largeframed glasses last fashionable in the early nineties and a pinched concernedlooking face sadlooking eyes otherwise fairly nondescript his accent sounded vaguely midlands like a brummie born and raised whod lived in london most of his life he was neatly dressed in a lightgrey suit that only now was starting to look a little too well cut to be that of your standard limo driver uhhuh i said ill just test the door right be my guest the door opened easily enough and the sound of traffic and the chatter of a passing gaggle of japanese tourists entered the cabin i closed it again ill just keep my phone open here too i said warily the driver nodded he offered his hand chris chris glatz we shook hands so whats going on chris i asked him like i say mr nott id like a word about what a matter that has umm fallen to me to try to resolve i screwed up my eyes im kind of looking for specifics here he looked around on the broad pavement under trees in front of the colonnaded white splendour of the ica a couple of cops were walking slowly along eyeing us here isnt perfect frankly he said apologetically you suggest somewhere i looked at my watch an hour and ten before the last possible time i could get to the studio for the start of the show tell you what i said ill drive if hed taken too long or said no id have walked but he just looked a little surprised nodded and opened his door i made sure the two cops got a really good look at us waving at them and saying morning officers they nodded professionally i rang the office en route but the lines were busy instead i left a message with debbies secretary to say id be late i parked the lexus behind the imperial war museum we got some coffees from a mobile stall and walked round to the front under the barrels of two colossal naval guns mr glatz pulled some gloves from his coat pocket and put them on the air had an easterly tang to it and the clouds were grey as the paint on the giant artillery pieces above us nice car i said yours yes it is thanks should have known i wouldnt rate a lexus from the radio station ha ha so mr glatz chris well mr nott call me ken please right ken well ill come straight to the point oh well first id better say this is all off the record right im not a journalist mr glatz but yes all right right good now then youll remember you witnessed a road traffic accident a few months back mmhmm guy in a blue beemer compact talking on his mobile came out thats the one thats the one he sipped his coffee see he said mark the gentleman involved mr southorne is a an occasional business partner of mine i see you havent heard of him no should i have glatz teetertottered one hand hes fairly well known in the city one of these flamboyant types you know well no i thought but i could imagine he hadnt looked very fucking flamboyant standing holding his mobile in the rain looking down at a still stunned biker lying in the gutter but maybe that had just been shock thing is you see glatz said looking pained hes sitting on ten points on his licence i nodded the poor soul twelve and hes banned sure you know how it is of course and well the thing is mark really needs his car he loves his car loves his cars but he does a lot of driving which he enjoys and id held up one hand hold on chris that was a bogstandard twoyearold compact he was driving if he loves cars so much yeah that was just a courtesy car his m was being serviced ahhah i said ahhah indeed served me right i thought there id gone making assumptions about the man just because hed been driving the sort of car people bought because they wanted to say theyd got a bmw rather than because of what it actually did in fact he had an m that was different id test driven an m about a year ago a sleek brute with four hundred horsepower a brilliant motor but wasted in london look ah ken glatz said smiling awkwardly at me frankly i think this has been mishandled i think that the whole way this has been approached was pretty fucking stupid another stilted smile excuse my vernacular well obviously i am shocked but all right he smiled im going to level with you ken thing is you see wed like you to retract your witness statement especially the bit about mark using the mobile at the time of the accident oh i said i sipped my coffee actually i hated this new coffee culture people wandering around with these pintsized cartons full of a mild warm watery drug it takes about twenty words and five questions just to fucking order turning some streets in london into nothing but a procession of starbucks aromas coffee republics costas and but enough mr glatz was making his point well get a good brief well suggest that the biker guy was going too fast and with a bit of luck and a following wind like they say well get mark off but we do need you to retract that statement you see ken because thats the really damning bit without that there we might be able to swing it with it the prosecution can walk all over us i nodded right i said a very strange disturbing but oddly relieving idea had occurred to me it seemed grotesquely unlikely but then when had that ever proved a problem for reality when it was determined to serve up a squid in your custard this occasional business relationship you have with this guy mark yes ken in terms of aboveboardness whereabouts would we be talking here chris glatz chuckled youre catching on here ken frankly pretty well below the waterline right and when you say i started slowly that this has been mishandled what exactly are you referring too ah he said well when and i hasten to add here ken that i was not personally involved at this point he said holding up one hand when it was decided that my colleagues might be able to help mark with this problem a hows best to put this a rather extreme plan was formulated to well to attempt to impress upon you the fact we were serious in our commitment to aid our friend and colleague wed been strolling round the big circular path in front of the museum now i stepped round and stopped in front of him and said is this about my trip to the east end in a certain taxi to fucking haggersley street i almost shouted the last bit my new pal chris looked around and patted the air with one hand now i can see why you might be upset about that ken but you fuckers were trying to drug me and kidnap me because of a fucking traffic violation again i had trouble keeping my voice modulated for maximum mellifluousness glatz did the airpatting thing again he sighed and put a hand to one side of his face then nodded forward and we set off again walking slowly round the big circle ken im not going to lie to you he said in a tired voice that was an overreaction but he said holding up one hand before i could respond to this the need was felt to impress on you that we are serious people and that we have the necessary resources and the will to follow through with any whats the best way to put this incentivisation framework we might wish to implement you can back up threats because youre crims chris actually laughed quite loudly at this well basically yes if were being frank with each other i see and the threatening phone call and the tyres on my land rover and the headlights he nodded all a bit messy a bit unrequired frankly ken thats why im here thats why im approaching you as one reasonable man to another i gave a small laugh you obviously dont listen to my show he smiled sipped some more coffee ken wed like to compensate you for the damage and distress youve suffered i see you mean bribe me frankly yes how much two grand and well settle the bill with the garage and what if i say no he looked round at me frankly frankly then i go back to mark and say that weve done our best gone out on a limb for him even and it hasnt worked weve tried money and that hasnt worked either and unless he wants to raise the offer to something youd accept im not poor or greedy enough chris and i am easily proud enough not to i smiled fair enough he said dumping his coffee in a bin id have followed his example except id remained just worried enough to be keeping the stilljustaboutscaldinglyhot coffee to use as a weapon if things suddenly turned nasty again so he said id tell mark that maybe he should just take his punishment like a man and take more care driving in future and get a chauffeur for however long his ban lasts and unless he does something very stupid which i shall try to persuade him not to do thatll be the end of the matter really i looked into the mans eyes i formed the distinct impression that actually mr glatz wouldnt be at all averse to his business associate having to swallow his pride and accept his punishment he shrugged you have to have a sense of proportion about these things ken he said reasonably otherwise people end up getting hurt which is messy and messy generally is not good for business so i said if i say im not going to retract my witness statement thatll be that it should be i know it should be but will it ken glatz sighed heavily i am not here to threaten you i am here to make you an offer which ive done you seem to be rejecting it thats the end of the matter as far as im concerned and as far as my colleagues are concerned in so far as youre concerned if you see what i mean i think so go on i cant speak for mark who may wish to approach you himself and what the fuck does that mean ken ken he said holding up both hands dont get upset it means just what it says its not a threat he gave what was probably meant to be an encouraging smile mark is not hes not the physical sort know what i mean thats why we make a good team hes very good with money and contacts and charm and well but with us washing our hands of the case the direct action side of things is pretty much off the agenda good i said i thought i pointed a finger at glatz just in case he does get any ideas you tell him theres a man called john merrial who owes me a favour all right glatz looked very surprised for a vanishingly brief interval of time then he looked slightly surprised mr merrial he asked really really i said and if he doesnt know who john is i think maybe you ought to enlighten him dont you glatz was looking away from me nodding we were back almost under the big guns again which felt like a shiveringly appropriate place to be when invoking the name of mr m to another palpably lesser villain i see ken he said still nodding glancing at me well that is interesting id no idea a favour eh thats what he said last time i saw him i told glatz he looked at me and nodded i can rely on your discretion here cant i ken off the record as we agreed obviously all of this is strictly between you and me obviously providing your friend mark doesnt do anything stupid ill have a word thatd be nice he smiled right well i think were finished here ken would you agree i grinned i think i would chris okay he clapped his hands lets get you back to your radio station do you want to drive or shall i allow me i said we started walking back to the car mr glatz nodded at my left wrist by the way nice watch mmhmm oh the sheer bliss of it when we arrived at capital live i got to do the old ronnie reagan thing cupping my hand to my ear pretending i couldnt make out what the press were saying of course rather than doing this across the white house lawn on the way to my helicopter with the press fifty metres away behind a rope guarded by marines i was about ten centimetres away from the journos separated from them only by the thickness of a window i could have lowered with a single click of a button this made it all the more fun ken ken is it true you kicked this guy ken whats the truth tell us what happened ken is it true he hit you first ken these pliers did you throw them intending to hit him it was great seeing so many journos here id expected one or two but this was real celeb stuff must be a quiet news day in the capital i did the handear thing shook my head smiled broadly and mouthed icanthearyou as i nudged the car slowly forward and angled it towards the car park ramp they were trying the door handles but id locked all the doors somewhere round trafalgar square two snappers were standing right in front of the car aiming straight through the windscreen i let the car trickle forward in drive brakes creaking slowly forcing the photographers backwards in the passenger seat mr glatz had looked puzzled when hed seen the small crowd of reporters gathered round the office entrance when theyd spotted me driving the car through the traffic towards the underground car park and come running over to hammer on the windows tape recorders aimed flashes flashing heck there was even a tv crew there hed been horrified but by then it was too late hed picked up his newspaper and hid behind it this was of course entirely the wrong thing to do because now the ladies and gents of the press were starting to think hold on whos mr shy in the passenger seat a couple of the snapperistas took photos of mr gs hands and the torygraph they were clutching sorry about this chris i said jesus he said what the fucks all this about oh i was on a telly programme with this guy who deserved a good slap so i duly whacked him one bit of a fuss about it for some reason did i not need this glatz breathed as i nodded at the security guy in the booth at the top of the ramp the striped pole rose and we roared away down the slope i stamped on the brakes and got a very satisfying squeal out of the tyres at the bottom mr glatz left looking unhappy resigned to facing down the crowd of muttering rotters still milling at the top of the car park ramp i bumped into timmy mann in the lift timmy i said cheerfully youre in early uh yeah ah hi ah ken timmy said displaying the incisive wit that has made him such a hit on the lunchtime show he looked down as the lift doors closed timmy was something of a throwback older than me an exradio one breakfast show presenter dark hair worn in a style dangerously close to being a mullet he was short even for a radio dj i felt my good mood evaporate as the lift whined into action and my stomach seemed to drop oh yeah of course i said youre here to do my show arent you ah just half he said maybe well dont forget to apply for overtime um yeah where the fuck have you been talking to a man about a fucking death threat i told station manager debbie throwing myself into a couch the couch was on the far side of debbies redecorated office a pale mauve oval carpet away from her new ash and chrome desk where producer phil and guy boulen mouth corps legal geezer were sitting hi phil guy i didnt say you could sit over there good debbie because i didnt fucking ask to the sofa was big and plump and cerise without actually looking like a pair of lips it smelled very new whats this about a death threat phil asked quickly while debbie was still opening her mouth to say something its been resolved it was all a hideous mistake an overreaction i know what it was all about and its almost certainly been taken care of phil and boulen looked at each other boulen cleared his throat you met whoever it was whos been behind all this it was an organisational thing guy i met the guy whose desk this landed on after people below him didnt get the results theyd wanted and arguably took it all too far who was it who is it phil asked cant tell you i said sworn to secrecy is this boulen began can i just point out that weve a decision to make about a radio show due to start in twenty minutes debbie said loudly swinging our attention back to her debs i said the breaking news lawson brierley thing im denying everything it didnt happen its all a lie they made it up i looked at boulen and smiled thats the line im taking he nodded then smiled too uncertainly but youve been charged debbie said yup we can take you off air i know so going to debbie looked at me as though id just crapped on her new couch her desk phone warbled she glared at it grabbed it dont you fucking understand english i said no her eyes closed and she put a hand to her brow making her glasses slip down her nose she took them off and stared at the ceiling with tired eyes yes of course sorry lena put him on each of us chaps looked at the other two debbie drew herself up in her seat sir jamie chumbawumba and tubthumping good to hear the old signature tune all the way through there bit of comfort music in these trying times dont you think phil knock people down and they just jolly well get back up again phil agreed ms nutter mr prescott and i would all agree but what makes you mention knocking people down phil oh nothing phil waved one hand airily just the lyrics of the song splendid time for some vitally important advertisements back in a mo if we havent been removed in the meantime for gross moral turpitude back in fact with ian dury and the blockheads and hit me with your rhythm stick just kidding its actually cornershop and lessons learned from rocky one to rocky three stop that phil i fxd the squeaky noise for phils head shaking what are you like he sighed just keeping things topical phil i despair i laughed yeah i know it sounds pretty crap now but just you wait till later it wont even be pretty hit the ad cart ken it are hitted we both sat back and put our cans round our necks as the ads played so far so good phil said getting away with it i agreed all my life phil glanced up at the portrait of sir jamie on the wall wonder if himselfs listening in on the internet feed sir jamie had called station manager debbie from the archipelago he owned in the caribbean hed just heard about the press getting hold of the breaking news story and called to say he thought it was vitally important that i should do my show unless the station had no legal choice but to pull it i did believe it was the first time id actually felt a mild glow of affection for the man hed even had debbie pass me the phone and spoken a few words to me he told me he was right behind me right behind me hundred and ten per cent i can only hope and trust i told phil that i am living up to the faith placed in me by our dear owner are we really going to take calls i think we must philip we owe it to our public yeah right ken whats this about you hitting some bloke on the telly then sir you have been grievously misinformed so its not true then actually i was just talking in general stan you have the sound of a man who takes the tabloids so you have undoubtably been grievously misinformed for well years i imagine come on ken did ya hit him or not at this point i have to resort to the old diplomatic service thing of saying that i can neither confirm nor deny whatever it is you may have heard but is it true what is truth stanley one persons truth is another persons lie one persons faith is anothers heresy one persons certainty is anothers doubt one persons bootlegs are anothers flares know what im saying you aint gonna tell nobody are ya stan im like the egyptian freshwater carp im in denial what the matter i believe you might be referring to is sub judice stan or soon will be the exact technical legal status it holds at the moment is not entirely clear but lets just say its better to treat it as definitely not to be talked about all right so hows that rubbish football team of yours up there in jockland going to do then i laughed now were talking stan which aspect of the profound awfulness of the bankies did you wish me to elaborate upon stanley the choice is wide and the show is long dont really give a toss mate ah indifference good choice now stan stanley hello id cut him off ah how oddly pointed was stanleys casual but cutting dismissal just there though in fact i have to point out that actually the bankies are currently doing remarkably well in the league and are strong promotion contenders however im sure normal service will be resumed in due course i glanced at the callers screen the girls were doing their best to weed out journalists the system was flagging numbers of newspapers and if kayla or andi were suspicious they asterisked the name though in kaylas case as well as it could equally well be u or i one name and subject snagged my gaze instantly ohoh name ed subject robe ah toby youve a beef about airport security yeah hi ken its about glasses glasses you cant take nail clippers onto a plane nowadays not even little ones but people wearing glasses no probs your point being glasslensed glasses right not plastic right break a glass lens and youve got two perfect blades right really sharp take them on no probs but nail clippers i mean nail clippers no way whats all that about then i saw eds entry on the screen disappear hed rung off point made i guessed what a fine point tobias i said there should be a sinbin for spectacles and a choice of soft contact lenses for these astigmatic miscreants at every airport security scanner ed wot the fuck were you doin tryin to get old of robe oh come on guess i told you not to i told you to leave it i was desperate but listen its all right now its not all right it is he wouldnt sell me a you know wouldnt even meet up and fot you were a cop didnt he fot you was filf tryin to set im up i did kind of get that impression but now hes givin me grief cos you got is number froo me froo me mum kennif froo me mum i am not amused ed im sorry i was trying to hold off from saying something like come on ed its not as bad as fucking your pals girl i was scared and i panicked but i really am sorry so you should be but i dont need the article in question any more thats the good news you dont why not it turns out it was something of a misunderstanding i met with somebody whos in the process of resolving the matter youre soundin like an accountant as somebody got a gun to your ead now i think its going to be all right almost certainly right so now you only got to worry about fascist boot boys comin round in the middle of the night an kickin your ead in in retaliation for fumpin this holocaust geezer on telly oh youve heard it had taken me most of the afternoon to get hold of ed his phone had been either off or engaged and i hadnt wanted to leave a message id started trying as soon as the show ended wed had yet another meeting with debbie and guy boulen got some sandwiches sent down from the canteen for lunch in the office and then got round to some routine but necessary work for the middle part of the afternoon when we were ready to leave phil had walked round to a corridor with the appropriate view and seen that there were still some press waiting outside so wed called a taxi and a minicab to the underground car park phil kayla and andi took the cab they piled their coats and bags on the floor in a big mound that might just about have been big enough to hide a person and were duly followed i left in the minicabs boot ten minutes later id already cleared it with craig to stay with him for a day or two until all the worst of the fuss died down the minicab stopped as arranged on park road and i got out of the boot and into the front seat i finally got through to ed after id settled in at craigs course ive eard youre in the standard mate really which page wot you avent got one not yet ill get one ill get one which page which page um five above the fold or below the what the middle of the page it doesnt matter so much on a tabloid but youve got the whole page mate well part from a advert for cheap flights the whole page wow says they reckon you did it cos you was under such stress from avin a def fret made against you an bein kidnapped an stuff what well yuh i shook my head ridley scott has a lot to answer for what asked craig making black hawk down hells teeth yeah but no i was thinking more of introducing the concept of gratuitous steam craig glanced over at me we were a bit drunk and a bit stoned watching alien on dvd after an early meal of a homedelivered pizza wed eaten it while watching the london local news programmes on the tv in case i was mentioned but i wasnt i wondered who the camera team had been this morning outside the office in that case then decided that probably they had been from one of the tv stations but they hadnt got enough good footage maybe i should have got out said something or the story just hadnt been judged important enough by the tv news editors craig was significantly less drunk and stoned than i was plus hed only eaten one slice of the pizza he had a mystery date he wouldnt tell me about at nine in the meantime alien craig was exactly the sort of guy who would gradually replace all his treasured videos with dvds he was also exactly the sort of guy whod ration himself buying one old film on dvd whenever he bought a new one being released for the first time alien was the latest oldie craig looked at me gratuitous steam yeah i said gesturing at the screen look how fucking steamy it is in the old nostromo there who the hell decreed spaceships dozens of generations after the shuttle the modelt of spacefaring craft as it will doubtless prove to be and not itself notoriously watervapourprone would be so full of steam i mean why and its been grotesquely overused in practically every sf film and nobrain thriller ever since craig sat and watched the film for a while designer what set designer he said authoritatively because it looks good makes the place look lived in and industrial and hides stuff menacingly which is what you want in a horror movie or a thriller plus it gives people like you something to complain about which is patently an added bonus do i complain a lot i didnt say that yeah but come on thats the implication do i you have all these problems with films ken i do take science fiction what according to you is the only technically credible sf film craig sighed why because kubrick doesnt allow noises in space and because he was a genius he knew how to use the nosound thing so you get the brilliant bit where whatshisname blows himself out of the wee excursion pod thing and into the airlock and bounces around inside the open airlock until he hits the doorclose and airin controls and its only then you get the sound feeding in magnificent and every other space movie is that bit less credible because you see an explosion in space and next thing you know theres a fucking teethrattling sound effect so though it has to be said virtually every movie with an explosion in it gets the timedelay thing wrong anyway not only do film directors seem not to understand that sound doesnt travel in a vacuum they also seem not to understand how it does travel in an atmosphere you see an explosion half a fucking klick away but the sound always happens at exactly the same time not a second and a bit later when you should hear it but though there are signs of improvement band of brothers had proper explosions i mean that was the least of its brilliance but it was a sign they were taking the whole thing seriously that the special effects people were making the explosions look like real highexplosive explosions look with just maybe a single flash and stuff flying everywhere rather than all this vaporised petrol or whatever it is these great big rolling fiery clouds of burning gas thats so bullshit why why yeah why does all this matter its only the goddamn movies ken because it isnt fucking true thats why i said waving my arms for emphasis so craig said what happened in that tv studio ive told you yeah you have told me and youve told me that what you told me is the truth but it isnt what youve told other people it isnt what youre putting in your sworn statement is it i turned on the couch to face him ignoring sigourney and her doomed chums what the hell has that got to do with anything ken youre always banging on about truth and just sticking to the facts but here you are telling lies in public but theres a point to all this havent you understood anything i understand exactly what youre doing ken craig said reasonably i even applaud it i think he stretched back in the couch hands behind his neck i mean its resorting to violence which is more your bad persons stockintrade reaction but i see what youre doing all im saying is that in trying to make this point youre having to compromise this thing about telling the truth even when it hurts craig shit come on im no better than anybody else i tell lies all the time mostly in the context of relationships god id love to be a dear sweet faithful onewoman man but im not ive lied to most of the women ive known ive lied to my employers to the press to and me that drew me up short i sat back thinking well there are well they used to be called white lies didnt they relatively unimportant untruths necessary to spare peoples feelings or to prevent people becoming complicit in well either complicit or i do kind of know what a white lie is thanks ken yeah stuff that you need to tell people even friends if youre being untruthful to somebody else the onboard online onmessage censor that was usually employed looking a few words or phrases ahead to make sure i didnt swear on air was here doing something similar so that i didnt actively lie to craig even as i was carefully not telling him the whole truth which would have involved admitting id lied to him a lot about the night id spent with his wife i wouldnt tell you the truth when i was off fucking somebody else if i thought that jo might ask you if you knew where i was come on man you do it too youre doing it now where are you going later who are you meeting thats not the same im just not telling you you cant compare refusing to tell at all with deliberately telling a lie yeah but its still not being open is it so fucking what you dont have a right to know everything about my private life but im your best friend i looked at him amnt i best male friend definitely whos your best female friend well what about nikki nikki yeah hey ive known her all her life for one thing yeah but weve had too many great times together to count been through tough things too plus shes great fun to be with shes caring funny a great listener understanding what i was shaking my head you have to let the girl go craig okay shes a great pal and all that but ive let her go craig protested shes at oxford shes loving it she hardly comes home any more shes got more friends than she knows what to do with for all i know shes already had more sexual partners than ive had in my fucking life ken believe me im pleased for her about all this and i dont want to smother her in affection or anything but shell always be a best friend okay i said okay but you have to be a bit funny about the sex thing ken i had umpteen years to prepare myself for the fact my child would have an independent sexual existence credit me with some forethought and some understanding weve talked about this stuff ken the three of us nikki takes precautions we didnt raise her to be an idiot he prodded me on the knee with one finger anyway thats all beside the point the point being that im being truthful in telling you im not going to tell you something im not all right already i said distinction taken and conversational direction subtly changed you lying hypocritical dissembling louse i told myself anyway its not just stuff like that i said wanting to move swiftly on and away from all this lying and relationship stuff or stuff like using a parsec as a unit of time like they did in the original star wars and didnt even take it out in the new edition its the whole way movies hollywood movies are put together ive been thinking about this imagine if paintings were produced the way hollywood films are craig sighed and i suspected he suspected there was a protorant coming up which was true the mona lisa as we know it would be just the first draft in the second shed be blond in the third smiling happily and showing some cleavage by the fourth thered be her and her equally attractive and feisty sisters and the landscape behind would be a jolly seaside scene the fifth draft would get rid of her and keep the sisters lose the seaside for a misty mountain and make the girls both redheaded and a bit more like ethnic looking and by the sixth or seventh the mountain would be replaced by a dark and mysterious jungle and thered just be the one girl again but shed be a dusky maiden wearing a lowcut wrap and with a smouldering alluring look and an exotic bloom in her long black tresses bingo la giaconda would look like something you were embarrassed your elderly uncle bought in woolworths in the early seventies and never had the wit to get rid of in subsequent redecorations so what craig asked if films were all made the way paintings are every one would look like an andy warhol movie he gave a sort of stage shiver which whatever it does for you surely scares the hell out of me he looked at his watch anyway id better get ready he stood up youve nearly an hour i said yeah but i need a shower and everything he headed for the door help yourself to stuff okay thanks i said i tipped my head to one side in a way that i knew looked cute and hard to resist when ceel did it who is she craig anyone i know not telling you it is somebody i know its not emma is it he just laughed so its somebody new ken this isnt any of your business yeah i know but it is somebody new isnt it could be he said the in retrospect bastard with a small smile is she our age younger older children howd you meet he shook his head as he opened the door youre like a fucking journalist yourself so you are hope shes worth it i called as he left the livingroom and headed upstairs i will freely confess that what i helped myself to while he was out after a lonesome j and a bottle of rioja were the and lastnumber redial functions on his phone but all i got was fucking pronto pizza come on now i could have started rifling through his itemised telephone bill or something the lastnumber thing was small beer even if i did feel just the tiniest bit of guilt at abusing my host and official best friend scottishs trust like he was going to care he still hadnt reappeared next morning when i left for work ms boysert is working from home today fine can you give me her home number im sorry she doesnt want to be disturbed not really work then is it im sorry look can i have her home number or not im sorry mr nott may i take a message yes tell her shes a bitch i see do you really want me to pass that on mr nott i shall if you insist but ah forget it noon on the friday of the week celia was due back in town came and went but there was no package and no phone call id never felt so crushed at knowing i would have to wait longer to see her i started to wish id done something a bit sad during one of our earlier afternoons and asked her for a pair of her knickers or something at least then id have something i wondered if there was some internet newsgroup or some website that would steer me to the old magazines and catalogues shed appeared in as a model there probably were of course i had long since hit the realisation which comes to most users sometime that there was almost nothing you could imagine that was not on the internet somewhere but almost as soon as i thought of this i decided that on second and third thoughts i really didnt want to know craig spent the weekend away with his mystery woman ed was away emma was engaged all the time amy id given up on and phil was busy decorating i watched a lot of dvds ken whats your side of the story are you really claiming that none of it happened ken ken did you send those death threats to yourself would you say lawson brierley got what he deserved ken ken is it true them def frets were from someone wif a muslim accent ken is this all about publicity is it true the shows being cancelled ken straight to the point straight to the point well pay you for an exclusive and you get approval pictures too ken is it true you punched and kicked two security guards and a girl production assistant as well ken they might get you for contempt of court any thoughts kenneth would you say your actions last monday and your position since constitute more of a contextchallenging metagenristic art work rather than a simple act of political media violence oy ken didya biff the cant or not hi chaps chapesses fine morning isnt it that was me ken is your stance on this anything to do with your renowned antipathy towards israel could you be said to be overcompensating ken come on ken youre one of us play ball for fucks sake answer a fucking question cant you you know whatll happen if you dont did you thump this bloke or not ken is it true you have a conviction for assault already in scotland mr nott youve frequently criticised politicians for refusing to answer straight questions from the media dont you feel in any way or sense hypocritical here love to answer all your questions really would just flippin well dying to as a matter of fact and you can quote me on that but i cant aint life a pain sometimes that would be me again ken ken ere ken over ere come on mate give us a smoile na mate i said thats not my best side then wot the fuck is whatever it was ive put it behind me see you guys kenneth has entered the building i waved my pass at reception and the security guard and had the lift to myself to the second floor in the lift i let out a whoop then relaxed slumping briefly against the wall id decided to brave the press on the oneweek anniversary of my now nearmythical tussle with the beastly fascist holocaust denier and allround rotten egg lawson brierley id walked tubed and walked from craigs to the capital live offices and seen the waiting press pack ahead on the broad pavement outside the main soho square entrance id squared my shoulders reviewed one or two preprepared responses id thought might come in handy and gone sailing in amongst the fuckers if they knew they werent going to get anything out of you even when they could confront you facetoface they might give up a bit earlier than they would if you just plain avoided them because if you just plain avoided them they could still hope that if they ever did get you alone youd crumble and blab and basically come up with the goods they wanted not of course that that would stop them just making stuff up including supposedly direct quotes what the guy meant whod said you know whatll happen if you dont but at least your own conscience would be clear the trick had nothing to do with not answering the sensible reasonable questions the trick was all about not responding to the ridiculous ones the overthetop ones had i sent death threats to myself had i hit some girl assistant had i a conviction for assault already if i had theyd have known all about it theyd have had a photocopy of the fucking charge sheet these probably werent even rumours the press had heard from anybody else these would be questions the journos had made up themselves hoping that id react to at least one of them saying of course not but the trouble was that answering one question would be like opening a vein while treading water in a pool full of sharks itd be a fucking feeding frenzy after that start answering start denying and it was very hard to stop but it had been very hard a muslim accent indeed and was the show being cancelled the devious unprincipled fucks what the bampot who thought it was a work of art was on about i had no fucking idea did the philosophical review have doorstepping ratpackers in these postpostmodern days i had to suppose that there was every chance they did still in a bizarre leavingmoralityasideforamoment sort of way you couldnt help but be impressed by their ingenuity and dedication i felt privileged to have been verbally roughedup by such consummate experts and i was doing well those had to be the premier league newshounds out there not cub reporters cutting their teeth life and the show went on craig announced he would be out on the monday night as well so i thought i might as well move back to the temple belle i did and nothing bad happened the landy came back from the garage and spent a night outside in the car park without being attacked or set on fire or kidnapped or anything having braved the journos once it became easier and easier to keep on doing so the trick was to respond to nothing at all ken your dad says hes ashamed of you whats your response my response was to phone my mum and dad whod been doorstepped by the fucking mail on sunday of course they hadnt said they were ashamed of me at all theyd responded to some hypothetical question the journalist had put to them about people hitting defenceless other people and this had somehow spookily been extrapolated into a direct quote on the other hand the guardian had done some digging on lawson brierley and found that he did have convictions for assault two in fact one with a racial element not to mention having done time for fraud and embezzlement some of the other papers were sounding just a little more sympathetic to me though the telegraph and the mail still thought i ought to be hung up by the thumbs and the mail made a big thing about withdrawing its advertising from capital live meanwhile i turned down a couple of tv appearances and several exclusive interviews i think the offers topped out at eleven grand which was mildly flattering without amounting to so much that id ever entertain actually succumbing i suppose it must be a bit weird having to defend somebody you know is guilty i said to my lawyer maggie sefton looked at me with what looked like an are you serious expression i looked back at her and she obviously decided i was just as naïve as i appeared ken she said shaking her head ask any defence lawyer most of our clients are guilty she gave a soundless laugh civilians always seem to think it must be really hard defending somebody you know is guilty it isnt thats what you do practically all the time defending somebody you know is innocent that is weird she hoisted one eyebrow and opened an already fairly stuffed box file that can cause you sleepless nights so tell me straight maggie i said am i being really stupid here she looked up sharply you want my professional or personal opinion both professionally youre entering a minefield riverdancing i had to smile at that she smiled too then the smile went ken youre risking charges of perjury and being in contempt of court happily if it comes to it your employers are able to afford a good brief but i suspect he or she is going to spend a lot of their preparation time impressing upon you the fact that youll have to be very very controlled and careful in what you say if you go shooting your mouth off in court or out of it you could be in serious trouble the judge can send you down for contempt right there and then without any extra procedure and perjury is rightly regarded by judges as being a lot more serious an offence than simple unaggravated assault what about your personal opinion maggie smiled personally ken id say bully for you but then what i think personally doesnt matter a damn and the good news she looked away for a while in your own time i said she clapped her hands lets crack on shall we fending off journalists and ordinary callers interested in the matter during the phoneins became a game for that week the crowd of journos shrank rapidly until by the thursday i got to work completely unmolested i got it into my head that ceel would be listening that day and that there would be a package and a phone call from her when i finished the show but again nothing that left friday there had to be something from ceel on the friday otherwise it would just be too long an interval shed forget what i looked like shed fall in love with her husband again shed find somebody else jeez suppose she already had oh my god suppose she was some sort of seriesserial sexual adventurer and i was just one of a dozen or so guys she met up with for sex every couple of weeks what if she was fucking a whole male harem of guys one a day even two a day one in the morning before me maybe she was never out of those five star hotels maybe she practically lived in them serviced by a steady stream of sadly deluded lovers maybe shit i was going crazy i had to see her again i had to talk to her hey thats your old girlfriend isnt it we were in the office after the thursday show kayla had grabbed our copy of the february edition of q as soon as it had arrived she was holding it up across the desk from me phil looked up from his computer screen i frowned what who jo kayla said look she passed the magazine over it was in the news section a small colour photograph and a couple of paragraphs brad baker of addicta pictured postgig in montreux with current squeeze jo lepage la lepage part of addictas management team has been spotted on stage helping to provide backing vocals for the band definitely a better voice than yoko ono or linda mccartney comparisons to courtney love not invited hate mail from female teenage brad baker fans probably in post already shes fucking that bastard i said she told me she hated him that old trick kayla muttered she was holding her hand out towards me she clicked her fingers back please and she was doing pr for ice house i said not helping manage addicta fucking useless fucking journalists bastards ahem kayla clicked her fingers again have it i said shoving it into her hand youre blushing kayla said whos blushing andi said coming through the door with a tray of coffee and cakes ken is look said kayla his old girlfriends shagging brad baker what the addicta guy yeah lucky cow yeah its in q see oh yeah andi tutted looking at the magazine as she put the tray down she glanced at me thats a shame i looked at phil am i really blushing i felt that i could have been i certainly felt embarrassed to still be so affected just because jo was pictured with somebody else pathetic phil looked at me carefully ta he said absently as andi handed him his cup and a doughnut his eyes narrowed behind his glasses and he nodded maybe a little i think thats sweet andi said looking at me with a rueful sympathetic smile in return i managed a mouthtwitch that might from a distance with the light behind it have been interpretable as a smile by somebody partially sighted reminds me phil said clattering at his keyboard bit of gossip on the office email he clattered some more yeah he said nodding at the screen mouth corp might be buying ice house ice mouth kayla said mouth house andi suggested oh fuck i said eloquently the friday show ended no package i felt utterly depressed i was walking along the corridor to the office when my newly switchedon phone vibrated yes i pulled the motorola from its holster shit my lawyer again maggie i said sighing good news i perked instantly lawyers dont go bandying about phrases like that without very good reason what lawsons been found in a child abuse ring better hes dropped the charges youre kidding i stopped in the corridor no he had some backers who were going to bankroll him in any resulting civil action and i think they decided if they saw it through theyd just give you a platform and let you make the point youre so obviously trying to make so theyve pulled the plug mr brierley has come to the same conclusion that was rich lawson and his rightwing pals concerned about giving me a platform so is that it theres the matter of costs we could go after them right well youd better talk to the money or the legal people here about that but what about any sort of court case i mean is that it for that as i say a civil action appears to have been ruled out and given that the police didnt choose to suggest a prosecution themselves yes i think its highly unlikely theyll change their minds now looks like youre in the clear ya fucking beauty i said loudly so weve won well you could put it that way but technically we never fought did we lets say theyve withdrawn from the field and left it to your good self brilliant maggie thanks for everything youve done i appreciate it i really do thats incredible yes well the bill will be in the post but for what its worth congratulations it was nice to meet you ken likewise mags superb job thanks again okay enjoy the champagne damn right hey were off soon here do you want to come round for a drink thank you but im very busy some other time maybe okay yeah okay thanks again cheers now bye bye ken i walked the last few steps and threw the office door open on a surprisedlooking phil kayla and andi i threw my arms wide tafuckingra craig brilliant ive been trying to get you ken i was standing outside the bough looking down the street behind me the pubs cd box was playing outkasts ms jackson it was moderately loud in there wed persuaded landlady clara to turn the volume up to levels commensurate with serious celebration it was about half six and the sky was as dark as it ever gets in london the dark of a cloudless night after a clear day an unseasonal smell of drains wafted in from some grating briefly faecal before the light breeze flushed it away i got off i yelled into the mobile there isnt going to be a court case lawson fucking brierley caved in isnt that fucking brilliant yeah im very happy for you his voice chilled me craig whats wrong i asked moving further out of the pubs doorway further into the street away from the noise and cheery beery smell of the pub well craig said theres some good news and some bad news ken what what is it is nikki okay nikkis fine this is not about nikki that at least was some sort of relief well what then the good news is that emma and i are getting back together you are i stopped and thought well that is fucking superb well done thats great i am so pleased for you i am really so happy for the two of you honestly yeah craig said and i could hear him take a deep breath the bad news is that when we decided we were going to get back together we thought we ought to have a sort of clearing of the decks about other relationships ohoh i thought uhhuh i said i had one or two episodes to report yeah i said feeling suddenly cold good for you glad to hear it i leaned back against the stonework by the side of one of the pubs windows emma had one or two little dalliances to put on the table too and one just a onenight thing she didnt want to tell me about we were supposed to tell each other everything but she still didnt want to name names or name the name in fact she never did tell me directly but after a bit well eventually i just realised who it had to be ken there was a long pause yes i said it was you wasnt it oh fuck oh fuck fuck fuck oh fuck you still there ken im still here man so it was you wasnt it craig i it was you look man i it was you yes it was me another long pause i cleared my throat shifted my position against the wall smiled briefly thinly at a guy walking past who glanced at me and seemed to recognise me well come on ken craig said softly how do you think that makes me feel i took a deep breath and released it i love both you guys i love nikki too i had to clear my throat again it was just something that happened craig not something we planned or or meant in advance or anything it was one of those comforting things just got a bit ah just went on a bit beyond well you know no i dont know ken craig said the only time i was in a remotely similar situation like a mug i agreed with jo that it wasnt worth jeopardising our relationships with you for a quick shag i have to say i kind of regret that now you must have been laughing your head off inside when i told you that mustnt you of course i wasnt craig for fucks sake i was cringing look for gods sake man i am sorry i never wanted you to get hurt i so did not want you or emma to get hurt it just happened it was one of those things oh jesus i thought listen to me one of those things was that really the best i could do i just thought we could get away with it if you like just just have it be a noloss thing god man it wasnt me getting one over on you or anything or any sort of macho shit it was just trying to be a friend to em to help her through what she was going through it was all tears and well you know drink had been taken and and so there were like i say a lot of a lot of tears and hugs and and and you fucked my wife ken i closed my eyes turned in towards the stonework of the pub no i said no no thats not what happened that just isnt what it was all about two people whod known each other and been friends and had somebody in common that they loved or had loved and still loved two people like that were together and one was very lonely and vulnerable and needed a shoulder to cry on and the other was a bit lonely too and weak the way most men are and was so glad to be able to offer some support and flattered that the other person felt comforted being held and hugged and shushed by him and neither of them could stop just a sort of natural response happening when they held each other and they both felt guilty but they both felt reassured validated no not validated thats such a crap word they both had clung to another human being and though there was another person involved another person they both loved in the background it was just that it was not about not about fucking my wife ken i kept my eyes closed no it wasnt that just wasnt it if thats the way it feels im sorry i am so so sorry craig i did not want to hurt you or her i am so sorry i have i paused i mean it he was silent for a while the sad thing is ken you probably do mean it you are still getting back together what i mean is this isnt going to were still getting back together ken craig said its you whos the problem not me or em look man i ken ken ken what could you just leave us for a bit just the two of us we need time to to settle in together know what i mean i wanted to be sick i opened my mouth very wide i swallowed sure yes of course i yeah of course well maybe be well need well need time to think yeah of course you will i found id bitten my lip i could taste blood i ah i hope youre both really happy i hope it all works out i really do yeah well ah thanks for being honest at least im glad your court thing came out well yeah thanks yeah goodbye ken and oh christ just the way he said that i felt tears on my cheeks as i said bye craig the phone clicked off i folded it holstered it i stood looking at the gutter for a while listening to the sound of the music coming from the pub eventually i pulled myself upright wiped my nose and dabbed my cheeks squared my shoulders and went back to the door of the bough i half thought of just walking away then going home and crying into my pillow or something but i still had a legal letoff to celebrate and what better way to drown the pain of having hurt and maybe lost for ever my best pal than by getting disgustingly drunk pints whiskies a cigar much pointed nattering and nonsense with phil and kayla and andi then the girls went and phil and i were left alone for the last hour before chuckingout time we talked about going to clout or some other club then settled on the groucho i bumped into an ad creative i knew usually carried excess gear and scored some reasonable quality coke off him to sober myself up a little mainly so i could get drunk all over again but then i spilled most of it on the toilet floor just because i was so fucked on booze i didnt remember getting a taxi or saying goodbye to phil or leaving the groucho all i remembered was getting home to the temple belle and standing on the deck looking out at the waters and having to close one eye so as not to see double and then deciding that it was absolutely necessary that i phoned ceel i hadnt seen her for far too long id just escaped a court case and i might have lost one of my two best friends and i needed to talk to her badly i even considered very briefly going round to the merrials house and staring up at each window in turn hoping she was in hoping she was there just so that i could feel i was close to her maybe i could even ring the bell and no id phone her i had to use both hands on the phone and keep one eye closed but i found my way to location on the menu and immediately hit ok when it said call number and then heard her voice i heard her voice it was recorded but it was her i found my eyes filling with tears a message i could leave a message ha dirty why not maybe shed like that oh lady i want to fuck you sooo much i said slurring its been far too long ceel and thats not just my cock im talking about ha ha please get in touch i need you i miss you so much i need to lick that lightning yeah lets get together again soon real soon love you night night ceel oh oh its me me ken ken the naughty ha night night night night ceel love you want to fuck you night night love you night night i got indoors and to bed somehow some bit of my brain must still have been working though because when i woke to the light of morning it was not just to a total bastard of a hangover but to the full awful blooddraining bowelloosening heartconstricting realisation of what id done ten location location location oh shit eleven extended panic functionality oh dear holy fucking christ almighty oh my fucking god oh fuck upon fuck upon total fuck to the power of fuck i hadnt had i oh dear god let it be a dream let it be a nightmare let it not have happened let me have called a different number let it be anybody elses phone anybody my mum and dads craigs eds the office anybody anybody anybody just please please please not that one not the number that id overwritten where ceels mobile number had been i fell off the bed still fully clothed the phone wasnt in its little holster on my hip i looked around where the hell was it oh my god oh my god where was it i threw back the duvet looked under the bed searched the tops of the bedside cabinets the dresser the table in front of the couch what had i done with it i had to find the little fucker had to check had to make sure that what i was terrified i had done i hadnt really done oh fucking hell they could be on their way now they might be parking walking down the pontoon treading on the gangplank setting foot on the decking theyd have the two seats set up the big blond guy would be looking forward to the sound and feel of knees bending the wrong way and snapping then theyd castrate me then theyd torture me to death or maybe theyd be quick merciful and just put a bullet through my head oh but dear god ceel what would merrial do to her what would he do to make her talk then once she had what would he do to her for what shed done with me oh no no no this couldnt be happening i stumbled through to the livingroom it had to be here it had to be oh fuck this just could not be happening this had to be a dream this right now i wasnt really awake at all i was having the motherfucking greatgranddaddy of all nightmares i had to be i hadnt done that i just hadnt i could not be that drunk nobody could it was not physically possible to drink so much that any human being could forget that hed overwritten his lovers mobile number with her home number not when the home number was that of not just her but her husband a major league fucking gangster notorious for having his giant bodyguard bounce up and down on the legs of people he disliked until their knees cracked or their ankles snapped or their femurs popped out of their hip sockets or whatever fucking horrible thing or ghastly combination or succession of things happened when they did this to you i turned the livingroom upside down i threw cushions lifted rugs left drawers hanging open this had to be a dream this had to be a nightmare i couldnt have done what i thought i had there was not enough booze on the fucking planet to make a man do something so fucking stupid there had never been in the whole history of the species sufficient drink fermented distilled or brewed to make anybody anybody anybody at all no matter how stupid how thoughtless how much of a total fucking complete and utter fuckwit of the first water do something that suicidally imbecilic there were physical laws immutable rules written into the very warp and woof of the fabric of reality itself which would prevent any supposedly sentient creature doing anything a tenth as cretinously murderously insane as that a dream a nightmare the worst one ever a new lowwater mark in the sump of human fright and terror i must still be asleep and my heart was probably about to stop out of sheer horror i had to wake up i really did i stumbled into the bathroom turned on the cold tap and splashed my face splashing and slapping my cheeks and staring at myself in the mirror at the white terrorstruck face of a man who was not going to wake up from his nightmare because it was the worst sort of nightmare the kind thats real the kind you can die from but never wake from the face of a man whod killed the one woman he really loved in all the world consigned her to a horrific slow painful pitiful death because hed got drunk and been stupid because he just hadnt thought because hed selfishly wanted to talk to her because hed thought it would somehow be funny or sexy to leave a totally shite dirty message on her phone because he couldnt read a fucking display and see that it was a different number a landline number because he couldnt hear the difference between a mobile message service and a commonorgarden domestic answering machine why had it been her why the fuck couldnt the fucking man of the house have recorded the fucking answering machine spiel why had that cunt merrial made his wife record the message the pathetic useless disgusting inadequate piece of shit i looked down at the shelf above the sink the phone was there i grabbed it but i must have left it on last night because it was dead no power i screamed at it no words just a scream yes scream i thought get in some practice for later because youre probably going to be doing quite a lot of screaming in the very near future scream when you see the two chairs drawn up just a leglength apart when you see the big blond guy smiling at you and bouncing up and down on his toes scream when they tie you in scream when they bring out the knives or the pliers or the blow torch yes screaming now was a very good idea might even energise the phone in some spooky way jar its battery into life because i had to check i needed the fucking useless silvery little piece of shit on and working so i could hit the last calls made list and find that hey of course i hadnt called ceel even though i could still hear her voice still remember standing on the deck in the darkness and listening to her beautiful voice no id called somebody else anyfuckingbody else ceel i had to phone her i ran out put the phone into the recharging unit on the livingroom desk and lifted the boats own landline phone nothing oh jesus theyd cut the phone line they were the dialling tone sounded i hesitated right thing was i doing the right thing yes of course right to check just in case this was somehow as stupid as what id done last night but the right thing definitely the right thing i called her mobile number the number i knew by heart oh please be there please have it switched on no please dont be there at your house please be somewhere else anywhere else somewhere you can run hide get away from him oh sweet jesus christ answer ceel answer please please answer hello oh christ yes celia hi its ken kenneth ken nott oh god i was going to have to tell her going to have to admit i was an imbecile that id put her in the most fucking awful danger all through my sheer drunken stupidity yes listen ive done something really unbelievably stupid you need to get away you need to run yes she said calmly im in scotland behind her voice i could hear what sounded like a car engine scotland i yelped but then that was good anywhere away from london was good unless she was with him unless she was with him and he was going to access their answering machine remotely from wherever they were in scotland oh shit oh youre breaking up im afraid she lied ill call you back when ive got a clear oh no gone well i heard her say to somebody else that was unusua and she was gone i picked up the mobile hoping it had recharged sufficiently no i sat down shaking ceel was alive in scotland shed had a warning of sorts and she was going to call back when she wasnt with whomever she was with if i had done what i feared i had and i had to accept i probably had because i could remember her voice and something of the words shed used on the answering machine message then what could i do i looked at my watch the massive breitling said it was shit half ten had to give it back i thought go back to my more elegant spoon what was i thinking of fuck the watch fucking thinking about the watch or anything else apart from the fucking suicidal murderous position id put myself and celia in think maybe merrial was with her maybe probably they were away for the whole weekend that gave me a day and a half to do something what could i do burn their house down break in hope there was a maid or a butler or somebody but then why the answering machine and try to impersonate a i didnt know gas man cop jehovahs fucking witness could i access the tape or the chip from outside somehow what if i rang again and just left an immensely long message would it overwrite the one from last night no of course not no answering machine id ever encountered would do that nobody would design one like that well nobody with any sense a fuckwit like me would obviously set fire to the fucking place heave a petrol bomb through a window pour lighter fluid through the letter box when the fire brigade came ring them first ring them just beforehand but not the police let them break down the door and then go in with them pretend to be a plainclothes cop or from special branch or find a fancy dress shop and hire a police uniform oh please let it still not have happened please let it be a really vivid false memory syndrome thing id imagined her voice on the answering machine message it hadnt been her id put the wrong number in from merrials card misplaced a digit and it had been there all the time and the first time i used it i got some female who happened to live at the house that had the phone with the onedigit difference from the merrials and so id left this filthy sexually abusive message on the answering machine of a total stranger oh god it had to be that it had to be but if it wasnt if i really had done it what could i do i felt sick i felt really sick my head was spinning i was getting the tunnel vision thing roaring in ears i got up and stumbled to the loo ten minutes later still getting the occasional dry heave my throat raw my mouth vile despite the mouthwash my teeth with that stripped stickiness that comes from having recently been bathed in stomach acid i sat back at the livingroom desk and tried the mobile again my face had still been white in the mirror my hands were shaking uncontrollably i had to rest the mobile on my lap so that i could hit the right buttons i started crying with the awkwardness and the hopelessness of it all the little phone buzzed awake on my thigh it only had a single bar of battery capacity showing but that was all id need just keep going for a minute or two you little piece of shit you could have fucking died on me last night before i made the call that might get me tortured and killed and my beloved too you silvery bebuttoned turd yes i know youre fucking searching just fucking stop it and get on with it menu phone book ok voice dialling personal numbers last ten calls my mouth went dry ok last calls made select ok here we go i stared at the number i jumped up and got my wallet where merrials card still was i checked one number against the other i checked again and again willing one just one just one lousy single fucking little digit to be different for fucks sake it wouldnt have been difficult to make a mistake i made mistakes all the time even when im sober constantly just this one time let this be a mistake call said the little bit of script at the bottom of the screen no no i dont fucking want to call it again you worthless stupid piece of crap i want to undo i want to press f or go to the relevant menu with a mouse arrow and undo totally fucking undo what i did last night rewind the tape oh yes wipe the chip reformat the disk rewind that fucking little deadly tape or whatever the hell it was sitting in a house less than a mile away from here rewind and erase better still take it out and fucking burn it and mash the ashes into a fine paste and flush it all down a waste disposal unit somewhere in outer fucking mongolia i read the numbers out from the phones screen comparing them to the numbers on merrials card they were identical they werent going to change now i closed the phone maybe he wouldnt guess who it was id said it was ken i remembered that i thought but maybe he wouldnt think to link that drunken ken with the guy hed met once in the courtyard of somerset house oh shit what was i thinking of id said naughty ken or something equally pathetic and incriminating hadnt i or had i it didnt matter i was a fucking radio dj i was proud i had a distinctive voice even if merrial didnt ever listen to the show and had missed my high tv and radio presence over the last few weeks or never heard an ad with my voiceover somebody he knew would recognise me and anyway i didnt bar my mobile number his answering machine would have remembered the number the way they all did didnt they or maybe his didnt maybe merrial was one of those early adopters and he had a really old machine hed never got round to replacing and it didnt keep a note of the incoming numbers yeah right but even if he had the number how would he know it was mine i hadnt given him my number he couldnt yes and of course as a big crime lord hed have absolutely no way of finding who a mobile number belonged to of course he would i know i thought he owed me a favour merrial hed said to call him if there was ever a favour he could do for me id phone and phone and phone until i got an answer or go over there and slip a note through the door ask him to just not listen to his messages as a favour to me just trust me heavens yes that was bound to work and oj was innocent and almegrahi was guilty phone now i thought of course phone now and find out if the fucking answering machine was still switched on why hadnt i thought of that first because i was still drunk hungover and panicking under the influence of the most catastrophically fuckwittish mistake ever made in the long history of catastrophically fuckwittish mistakes i reached for the landline oh fuck what if he answered what if he said something like ah kenneth you again i received your earlier message very interesting ive just sent some of my colleagues round to your place to invite you for a little chat oh fuck oh fuck i took three attempts to press the number into the phone my hands were shaking so much ceels voice recorded her beautiful clear calm perfect voice leave a message after the tone then a series of beeps signifying the message or messages already left mine mine was there that dirty drunken rambling shite being spooled past right now then the beep i didnt leave another message i put the phone down so probably nobody had listened to the message the worst had not yet happened unless of course merrial was being clever and only pretending that he hadnt listened but that was even more paranoid than reality demanded and fuck knew that was bad enough maybe i could sort of half own up i could say id become obsessed with celia after seeing her on the ice that day i was living out this fantasy where we were lovers stalking her no no hed still do something horrible to me just for that and more likely hed want to check that nothing had been going on so hed still have me tortured to get at the truth and i had no illusions about my ability to hold out under severe pain not for ceel not for myself not for anybody my palms were very sweaty my mouth was so dry i couldnt swallow i got up unsteadily and went to the kitchen for some bottled water the landline phone rang on the second swallow and i sprayed water over the carpet yes kenneth it was her thank fuck her still alive still not screaming in agony still able to talk now able to talk whats wrong i told her in all my life and there might not be much more of it to come i had never known anybody stay so calm in the face of a disaster as utter and unmitigated she had every right to scream and cry and bawl but she just asked a couple of sensible measured questions to clear up some of the holes id left in my semihysterical account of what had happened then i heard her sigh right she said well im in scotland staying with some friends near inverness john is caving in the peak district hes due back tonight or tomorrow tonight oh jesus christ depends on the weather if theres been too much rain the system will be flooded and they wont be able to do much it was touch and go last i heard i ran a hand over my face can you access the messages on your answering machine from outside from a different phone no john specifically did not want one which could do that in case somebody else found out how to access it okay okay well that gives us until he gets home at least i closed my eyes and stood there shaking my head oh ceel i am so so sorry i cant i just cant begin to tell you kenneth stop we have to think right bien i can claim an emergency and ask to be run straight back to the airport ill get on the next flight i can get home before him wipe the tape oh please yes please please id better let my hosts know i heard her exhale this should be interesting ill call you back as soon as i know whats happening ceel what i love you this time it was an intaken breath yes she said well talk to you soon and off i drank from the bottle of water hands still shaking i stared ahead seeing nothing still alive both of us still alive so far so good so far no torture and painful death shed get back shed return in time brilliant calm resourceful ceel would clear up the pigs diarrhoea of a mess her idiot lover had made shed make it all well again bless that smart sexy wonderful gorgeous fantastic woman she might never talk to me again she might write me out of her life forevermore and curse me ritually every night before she went to sleep for the rest of her hopefully long life for the ignorant scumbag dickhead that i so surely was but at least shed be alive to do it at least wed both live we wouldnt suffer for my stupidity i drank some more water and told myself that one day id see the funny side of all this ceel rang back forty minutes later with the news that inverness airport was out of action for the day fogbound you have to run i said my mouth had gone dry again thats all we can do run you have to get away further away oh god ceel nono she said crisply ill find out when theres a flight next to london from aberdeen edinburgh or glasgow then hire a car to whichever one ill charter a plane or helicopter if i can the timing will be tighter but it ought still to be possible but there is another possibility what you could get into the house how does anybody else have a key is there anybody in the house no there shouldnt be the staff have the weekend off so how theres a key in the back garden inside an artificial stone there is this sounded a bit lowrent and risky for such a posh address yes then once youre inside youll have to switch the alarm off okay okay right ill give you the number for that however there is a problem shit what getting into the back garden from the lane theres a high wall so whats the point of theres a garage off the lane youre supposed to be able to get into the garage with the remote control in the car and then use the spare key or theres an ordinary door but its locked too right okay i had an idea how high is the wall exactly well not ex three metres perhaps three and a half any razor wire or anything no not even broken bottles no okay i think i can get into the back garden i suppose its overlooked by other yes but its usually quiet its a deadend off the mews further down this artificial stone how do i find it counting from the rear wall of the garage there are two lanterns on the west garden wall then the third one the stone with the key inside is directly under the third lantern and two stones out from the wall once you see it it looks almost obvious west wall garage rear wall third lantern two stones out i rubbed a hand over the back of my neck all this was just what i needed in the condition i was in what about the alarm is it linked to a security firm hq or anything yes and to the local police station the local police station really you might be surprised at the arrangements john has with the metropolitan police kenneth yeah i dare say i might i agreed what about surveillance cameras no well none that i know of right heres the alarm code shoot write it down will you okay i lifted merrials card go i wrote the code down on the back of merrials card then repeated it and where is the answering machine its in johns study on the first floor oh now what the study might be locked locked but its a gun room too its supposed to be locked a gun jeez right so if it is then what i have a key in my bedroom thats on the second floor john doesnt know about it youll have to go there first if the study door is locked you couldnt just have the damn thing where people usually have answering machines by the front door could you i thought and ceels bedroom id fantasised about something like this for months but not exactly in these circumstances okay wheres the key in my bathroom there is a cabinet above the sink inside the box of tampons smart thinking i guessed right when you get to the answering machine you wipe the tape by pressing function and then clear got that function and clear id rather tear the whole tape out or take a big magnet and wipe it of everything but thatll have to do maybe ill do it twice function and clear should do it okay keep in touch will do please be careful kenneth oh i will best of luck getting a flight thank you goodbye bye i put the phone down i wasnt shaking so much now i drank some more water at least we had a plan of campaign at least i had something i could do rather than just wait for celia to come and fix things god what sort of man was i of course i should be doing something id got us both into this grisly mess it should be me that got both of us out of it or even only her if i could just save ceel id have done something good something to make up for my gross incompetence my own miserable behind was patently not worth the saving attached as it so obviously was to a spine with a lump of barely solidified porridge at the other end where a normal person would have a functioning brain but hers her glorious ass was entirely and utterly worth saving even at the expense of my own think id have to park the landy in the lane what if people saw me going over the wall theyd call the cops or at the very least they might take the land rovers registration number how could i get new numbers for it you could get rear number plates from any halfords people did all the time for trailers and there was no check on whether you really had a vehicle with that number but you couldnt get white front number plates that easily maybe i could make false ones using the computer print out a couple of sheets of a with the relevant sized numerals and then wrap them in clingfilm or something and tape them over the real ones should fool the casual observer wouldnt even need exactly the right font because people had weird fonts on their plates sometimes id seen them better i could phone the garage that had repaired the landy and get some old plates off them they were bound to have some it would just be a shortterm loan anyway i had about three hundred quid in an emergency stash at the back of my sock drawer and i could pick up another twofifty from a cash machine that should hire a set of plates for an hour wouldnt it how likely was i to find the only small london garage that would shake their heads at my proposed criminality and promptly phone the cops surely not on the other hand it would take time delay things supposing merrial came back early detouring via the garage might make all the difference and it would introduce another variable into the equation one more source of potential leaking supposing the garage people knew people who knew merrial if the landy was spotted and the false numbers were traced to them who knew what might happen what theyd do what theyd be persuaded to say how theyd jump so i couldnt risk it but meanwhile id sat here slugging water and thinking about it and wasted a few minutes well done kenneth ten past eleven get going traffic was relatively light it was a pleasantly mild winter morning high cloud and a watery sun breezy why the fuck couldnt it be breezy in fucking inverness and dry in the peak fucking district i could have gone faster but i stuck to between thirty and thirtyfive this would be no time to be caught speeding especially with god knew how much alcohol still sloshing about in my system ascot square was quiet bunches of silver balloons tied to railings indicated thered been a party in one of the grand townhouses on the other side of the square from the merrials maybe a twentyfifth anniversary or something lots of mercs jags and bmws plus range rovers and a brace of rollers or bentleys audi as and a couple of smarts too the merrials lived in number eleven near the centre of the imposing fourstoreysplusbasement terrace no obvious signs of life at number eleven tall limes and beeches in the private gardens in the centre of the square i drove on through into eccleston street then into chester square i parked in a residents only space for a couple of minutes climbing into the back of the landy and pulling on my overalls brand new basically id got them when i bought the landy thinking id do my own repairs and a size too small my shirt sleeves and the bottom of my s protruded from the green overalls by a good two or three centimetres great so now i looked stupid as well as villainous i had an old sony music awards baseball cap i put that on too bit of a giveaway industrywise but what else was i supposed to do sunglasses from the cubby box between the front seats gloves of course i needed gloves i was going to break into a house or make an illegal entry or whatever the legally nice definition was i didnt want to go leaving fingerprints all over the fucking place gloves i had some somewhere i rummaged behind the bench seats on either side feeling down between the seat cushions and the back rests blimey you could hide a complete fucking tool kit along here gloves got them they were thick padded things for pulling out bramble bushes or hauling on winch wires or some such manly shit as that not at all the sort of fine thin things youd want for the delicate business of letting yourself into somebody elses house but shit theyd just have to do i jumped back into the front and set off again back past ascot square proper and round into the mews behind it on the south side lots of closepacked but very expensive mews properties with differing treatments of the old architecture a jumbled variety of windows large and small balconies awnings and outside steps lots of plants too hanging baskets big pot plants and trailing vines oh shit and a family loading up their landy discovery young couple and three kids getting their cool boxes and child seats sorted for a day out shit what sort of time was this to be setting out for the day it was practically noon best bit of the day gone dammit couldnt the miserable fucking curs have got their shit together a bit closer to breakfast the man looked up when he saw my battered shortwheelbase approaching down the cobbles took a good look at me hmm dont recognise that beatenup old wreck or the shifty looking weirdo with the sunglasses driving it not a resident ive ever seen before and thats not a power or gas company van you could practically see the thought bubbles i wound the window down and stopped by the disco scuse me mite zis ascot mews norf ah na said the man this is siythe actually sarf i said ah roight i looked over at the other seat as though there was something there i was consulting roight ta mite i said and reversed out again i parked up near the corner of eccleston street and eaton square pretending to study an a to z the disco swung out into the traffic and headed for the river ten long long minutes later i pulled back into ascot mews south drove on past the mews cottages into the last part of the lane where the garages and tall garden walls began i counted my way along to number eleven but i neednt have bothered there was a number eleven on the gleaming green pedestrian door that gave out onto the lane beside the equally freshly painted garage doors id rehearsed this in my mind already best done quickly given it had to be done at all ignore the rear windows of the houses on the other side of the lane and those next door to number eleven i killed the engine got out locked the door climbed onto the roof via the front bumper and bonnet the aluminium roof flexed under my feet which i actually had the reserve brain power to feel slightly disappointed by then i jumped up onto the rounded top of the tall stone wall japanese garden raked gravel forming dry round lakelets with big smooth boulders forming islands in the frozen ripples of greyness small tidily clipped bushes and shrubs a still pool with another big boulder decking under green awnings something about its calm organisation told me this was celias garden more than her husbands i looked down i was going to have to drop the whole way into more gravel it was easily three and a half metres i swung one leg over then the other and let myself dangle as far to the ground as i could in scotland as kids wed called this dreeping i had no idea what it was called down here i couldnt get any real handhold on the smooth round top of the wall so just had to keep as much friction as i could on my forearms and gloved hands until gravity took over and i dropped to the gravel bed it was mercifully deep i hit and rolled and didnt break anything id have to do some remedial work on the gravel bedwork with a rake though i looked up at the wall id worry about getting out again later i smoothed the gravel out a bit now while i thought of it just in case i forgot later it didnt look perfect but it might pass as the result of a cat coming into the garden i checked the door in the garden wall the lock was some sort of ruggedised outdoor chubb i tried to open it but it looked like you needed a key even from the inside my phone went as i was walking up the path towards the stone with the key inside there was a sort of slit on each side of the overalls so you could get at the pockets of whatever you were wearing underneath i hauled the motorola out through one of those ceel im in the back garden i said good ive just had a thought john should have the car use the keys just to the right of the back door once youve got in to open the garage and put your car in it might look less suspicious i hadnt paid much attention to the garage doors i had the impression they were pretty tall but i might have been wrong its a land rover i said two metres tall at least might not fit no it should its an old coach house okay then good idea i stopped opposite the third lantern and looked down at a neat arrangement of smooth varied stones hold on what if he comes back seeing a land rover parked outside your back wall might be a little puzzling finding the thing sitting inside his own garage hmm youre right also i phoned the weather centre the peak district has had more rain than expected overnight i think its very likely he will be back later today oh shit what about you how are the flights looking aberdeen is out its a three or fourhour drive to edinburgh or glasgow im trying to arrange a charter from a smaller airport closer to here but its not proving easy well im in here already anyway hold on i stooped to the stones the thick gloves meant i took a couple of attempts but after a few seconds and some muttered curses i was able to announce ive got the key you have the alarm number memorised and written down the door in the garden wall back into the mews into the lane where would i find the key for that to the left of the back door in the utility room looking out it has a green plastic tag can i lock the door without it im trying to get out without having to climb the wall let me think ceel was silent for a couple of seconds yes use the key open the door put the key back put the little button down on the lock and then close the door from outside that will do it dont forget to put the house backdoor key back inside the stone first christ i said putting one hand over my eyes do i so not need all this with a serious fucking hangover i took a deep breath straightened up okay never mind right ive got all that thanks good luck kenneth you too kid the back door swung closed and relocked i walked quickly through the utility room the kitchen and along the hall an insistent beeping noise was sounding from the far end near the front door i punched the code into the alarm unit but the thick gloves meant i must have pressed the wrong buttons i felt sweat prick on my brow as i started again the beeping went on i was going to run out of time i whipped my right glove off and entered the code properly the noise stopped my heart was thudding my hands still shaking i took a few deep breaths i used a paper handkerchief to polish the keys id touched then i put the glove back on god i was hot i took off the stupid baseball cap and shoved it into a pocket something made me think that i should keep doing things while i thought of them so i went to the back door left it unlocked on the catch and wedged with a welly boot while i went out to the garden and replaced the key inside the artificial stone i closed the back door again as i walked along to the foot of the stairs near the main door i realised i seriously needed to visit the toilet this was ridiculous for all i knew a suspicious neighbour was already on the phone to the local nick telling them shed just seen a guy in badly fitting overalls jumping into a back garden but i really was going to have to get to a loo in the next minute or so or basically i was going to soil myself partly i guessed it was the result of my colossal alcohol intake from the previous night but partly it was simple fear i recalled reading something about this how burglars who left crap in the middle of their victims carpets werent necessarily just being shits themselves they just couldnt help themselves breaking into somebody elses house was a scary thing to do most people would be scared shitless and as a rule they werent invading the privacy of fucking london crime lords i ran up the stairs and started looking for a toilet opening doors into a sittingroom a library a small cinema another sittingroom and a walkin cupboard before finding one that wouldnt open which must be the study where the answering machine was oh my god i was going to shit my pants i could feel my bowels loosening a muscle down there starting to spasm as i tried to hold things in no loo here that i could see upstairs i knew there was a toilet up there that was where celias bedroom was with its en suite bathroom i did a weird kneeknocking sort of walk to the stairs leading up to the next storey then minced up the steps sucking in my belly as though this would stop the disaster i was expecting any second even as i got to the next floor i was thinking what was i doing running up here had been stupid there must be a loo downstairs on the ground floor where the kitchen and diningroom would be too late now i ran along to a door whose room probably looked to the rear of the house overlooking the japanese garden i was sucking my cheeks in i mean my cheeks on my face as well as the cheeks of my bum as though in sympathy my whole body was trembling now i nearly fell as i stumbled through the door and into the room bedroom big dark behind darkgrey vertical blinds shielding two tall windows there was a door to each side of the wide black and white bed i pulled the left one open a fucking dressingroom jesus fucking christ what was it with these rich fuckers couldnt they just have fucking wardrobes like fucking normal people the selfindulgent sons of bitches i hobbled round the bed trying to keep my legs together and yet still walk and actually putting my right hand to my backside trying to press upwards help keep things in oh christ oh christ if this door didnt lead to a loo i was going to shit my fucking pants the door swung open and i was looking straight at a beautiful white china loo with a rich dark wooden seat and lid i quickly pulled both gloves off my whimper of relief turned to a terrible keening of frustrated rage and despair as i had to waste a few seconds i hadnt been accounting for and which i might not have to spare as i had to tear at my stupid fucking undersize overalls before i could even get to my jeans and pants i only just remembered to lift the lid of the loo before i turned round i started shitting even before my backside hit the wooden rim of the toilet it was a ghastly splattery and appallingly malodorous experience but i believed id just succeeded in keeping within the bounds of social shitting behaviour sitting back i closed my eyes breathing through my mouth to escape the putrid smell of what was going on down below and for a few brief fleeting moments just let myself surf along the wave of animal relief surging through my body fucking hell i breathed cleaning up took a while id nearly finished when i realised that id just taken a seriously fucking rancid dump in what looked like john merrials own bathroom not ceels the toiletries spread about the shelves were all masculine and there was a shaving mirror and an electric razor on a shelf above one of the two big washhandbasins when i thought about it i realised that the clothes in the dressingroom id looked in earlier had indeed been male clothes in the wideeyed terror of the moment i hadnt even noticed flushing a couple of times extra and using a loo brush to make sure there were no marks left seemed like a good idea i left the place as id found it apart from the smell i used an airfreshener more in deference to my mothers early bathroom training than because it would make any difference alpine glade would be every bit as suspicious as fetid faeces if merrial happened to come home in the next hour or so and decided the first thing he needed was a nice shower to freshen up after a hard days caving the perfectly folded towels in the bathroom intimidated me so after id washed my hands i just wiped them dry on my overalls rather than sully those snowy white expanses i did some more wiping down of touched surfaces with the paper hanky a few more deep breaths and a drink of water from the cold tap and i was just about steady and calm enough to continue i found another large bedroom across the hall also with a view to the rear this bedroom was all pale greens and blues from ceiling and walls and carpets to the furniture and fittings bursts of tropical colour on the walls were provided by paintings of riotous jungle scenes all profuse abstractions of flowers leaves sky and rocks shot through with what looked like squadrons of parrots or cockatiels racing across the scenes caught in blurs of chromatic chaos thick black venetian blinds covered windows of a similar size to those in the room across the hall maybe everybody hereabouts kept their blinds closed all the time i thought allowing hope to blossom again maybe nobody would have seen me make the leap over the garden wall pale furniture a large dressing table with combs and bottles and a small ring tree with a few rings on it all tidy neatly arranged it was very warm definitely ceels room i thought the bathroom was on the opposite side to the room across the hall i had to take the damn stupid big gloves off again why hadnt i thought of this if id only taken a minute to look ahead id have realised back on the fucking temple belle that id need a good thin pair of gloves for this oh well the yale key was secured to the floor of the little box of tampons by a piece of doublesided tape i confess i held a few of the tampons looking at them then still holding them looked round the bathroom at her bath and alongside it a big steamcabinet shower with a seat i found myself smiling as i looked at the loo oh god what sort of poor pathetic loon was i caressing the womans tampons and staring fondly lovestruck at her toilet seat for fucks sake get fucking real kenneth and get fucking moving fuckwit i put the tampons back and replaced the box then did the wipingfingertouchedsurfaces bit again i went down to the locked door on the first floor i had a little more time to look around the house was furnished in a slightly dated respectable style that was probably about right for the building actually it looked a lot like some of the slightly more modern hotel suites ceel and i had been in she must have felt at home not as stiflingly hot though the study door opened with the key and i let it close behind me the study was more oldfashioned than what id seen of the rest of the house the big desk was unironic retro with a goldtooled burgundy leather top and a brass lamp with a green glass shade the computer was a hewlett packard with a big plasma screen ha id just known merrial wouldnt be a mac guy i couldnt see any sign of a gun safe but i guessed it might be hidden the answering machine was on its own little table near the door i looked at it accusingly as though this was all its fault you see the trouble youve put me to you nasty little piece of officebeige shite i moved towards it that was when i heard the siren it must have been on the fringes of my hearing for a couple of seconds id been feeling a general unease which seemed at odds with the fact i was now within sight of the thing id spent so much effort angst and sweat getting to then i realised a siren the emergency services you stop hearing the sound in a big city after a while if youre driving and providing youre not the sort of cackbrained bozo who can have a fucking twentytonne fire engine right behind him with its lights flaring and its siren screaming and still not realise its time to get the fuck out of the way then you do still take notice when you hear a siren you start looking at side streets checking the rearview every few seconds watching for people pulling out of the way or bumping up onto kerbs or swerving into bus stops to clear a path for the vehicle with the blue lights otherwise you hear it but you pay no attention unless it signifies something youre waiting for or it keeps getting louder all the time until it gets very loud and then stops i listened to the siren get closer and closer doppler you fuck i thought fucking doppler your fucking woopwooping arse on past dont stop dont pull up here in the mews or in the square outside keep on going let it be an emergency somewhere else let it be a cop car en route to a robbery on the kings road or an ambulance heading for a boating accident on the river or a fire engine attending a false alarm at a shop let it be anything at all but not a patrol car coming to check on a suspected breakin at the rear of ascot square i stood there staring at the answering machine knowing that i should keep going knowing that the sensible per centageswise course of action was to keep doing what i was doing get at the tape wipe the fucker wipe the fucker twice make sure it was clean and i and celia were in the clear but i couldnt i had to hear what was going to happen with that damn siren there would still be time to wipe the tape even if the sound did stop right outside anyway but i just couldnt move couldnt do anything until i knew closer closer did they use a siren in such a situation would that not be like the stupidest thing to do if you were hoping to catch the crims in the act give the fuckers plenty of warning give them time to scarper with their bags of swag and their stripy jumpers and their eye masks before the rozzers caught them bang to rights and they went to chokey so fast their feet didnt touch my own phone went vibrating against my hip i jumped as though zapped with a cattle prod then pulled my righthand glove off and held it in my mouth while i withdrew the mobile from its holster i was whimpering again i was getting good at whimpering my hands were shaking so much i almost dropped the phone i flipped it open phil i clicked no dont answer and put it away again trembling fingers missing the holster three or four times the siren was still coming closer i put my glove back on go past go past oh just fucking go past saint doppler i appeal to thee to intercede on my behalf oh fuck off what a load of fucking shite next id be appealing to the patron saint of atheists the sirens note started to deepen i let out a breath i must have been holding for a minute or more a roaring noise in my ears began to fade and the room took on more colour and stopped looking like the view down a pipe jeez i must have been close to blacking out there never mind a candle would be lit at the shrine of saint doppler after all red shifted of course i walked over to the skinny table and the answering machine it had a little blackongreen lcd display which was in message counter mode at the moment five messages i was still staring at the machine when it rang i jumped fuck i screamed then you fucking bastarding little cunt at the time this seemed only reasonable the machine clicked after four rings theres nobody here right now ceels calm beautiful voice said yes there fucking is i screamed hoarsely shaking my fists in front of my chest please leave a message after the tone no i yelled dont fucking bother whoever the fuck you are just fucking fuck off another click and a hum as the machines tape wound itself forward then aow hullo yes my name is sam im calling on behalf of bt we would just like to check that you know of our latest offers for domestic customers ill call again at a later time and hope to discuss these offers with you thank you goodbye fuck off i screamed as the phone clicked again and the tape started to wind itself back to ceels announcement at the beginning fucking typical i thought go exdirectory because youre fed up getting junk calls from fucking doubleglazing salespeople and what happens you get fucking junk calls from b fucking t at least i ought to find it reassuring that even metropolitan crime lords werent immune from that sort of shit when the machine had gone quiet again i carefully identified the function and clear buttons they were big enough to use with the heavy gloves still on i pressed one the black and green display asked clear all messages followed by the second button nothing happened id been stooping now i stood up actually something had happened the display now read no messages but there was no more clicking no humming no other sounds at all was that it it didnt seem right was that all there was to it shouldnt it wind forwards and wipe the tape after ceels introduction i guessed not it would just forget about the messages sitting there already recorded and record over them when there was another incoming call was that good enough it should be that was the way the machine worked as far as it was concerned there had been no messages if you tried to play the tape youd get nothing just no messages but the message id left was still there the words were still printed there in patterns of magnetised stripes on the little brown ribbon of oxidecoated plastic if you took the microcassette out of the answering machine and put it in an ordinary dictation machine youd still hear what id said i pressed function again rerecord message no i pressed function again a few times until i got to the no messages screen again i was sweating now i couldnt decide what to do in theory it was all fixed now mission accomplished definitely time to get to fuck but the message was still there was it worth the risk of leaving it there even though it wasnt likely that anybody would take the necessary steps to access it what if merrial had called his own phone for some reason and knew there was a message or messages there or somebody said theyd left a message what would happen in that case if he came home and saw it said no messages wouldnt he investigate take the cassette out try it in another machine maybe ceel would still beat him back and be able to say there was nothing on the tape or only junk calls but what if he was first back jesus what was i thinking of i took off my glove again got out my mobile and started walking to the door id call the fucking answering machine myself and just leave a soundless call that would last long enough to overwrite my incriminating message from last night maybe not soundless maybe the machine would sense that and switch off id rub my hand over the microphone on the mobile so it would pick up some sound and lay that down on the tape first though i had to set up my mobile to ban its caller id on the next outgoing call i pressed menu as i opened the door to the firstfloor hall i walked towards the stairs to the ground floor phone book ok i got to the top of the stairs oh jesus i hadnt locked the fucking study i turned back from the stairs no wait a minute the studys yale had locked itself i didnt need to actively lock the damn thing i got to the top of the stairs again call related features ok oh fuck i had to put the key back in ceels bathroom i was going the wrong way i turned round to head for the stairs leading up show battery meter no next restrict my phone number ok i walked upstairs this was stupid i was trying to do two things at once when i was barely capable of doing one with any degree of competence restrict id on next call at last ok crossing ceels bedroom i clicked back until i could make a call then rang the number here i still jumped when the landline extension in the bedroom rang the study key went back in the box of tampons and i listened to ceels voice inviting me to leave a message after the tone there were no beeps in between just the tone immediately i held the mobile clumsily in my gloved left hand and rubbed it with my thumb while i closed the cabinet and wiped it with the paper hanky again i was closing ceels bedroom door and still enthusiastically rubbing the phones mike with the glove fabric and thinking hey this must sound a bit like when i got that unmeant call from jos mobile when distantly down the stairwell two storeys below i heard the sound of the front door opening i froze no not happen not to happen no happening of such like thing just fucking like no maybe id mistaken the sound it went quiet was that a very quiet clicking i could hear from down there then a tiny beeping noise of course the alarm that should have been on when somebody came into the house the alarm theyd be expecting to be on but then discovered was not oh fuck celia said a voice my bowels suddenly felt like they were up to their old tricks again like there was unfinished business needing attention in there oh my god it was him back even earlier than wed been expecting oh fucking hell now what was i supposed to do i looked down at the mobile phone in my gloved hand my thumb was over the microphone shit it wouldnt be picking all this up would it retransmitting it back to the answering machine in the study celia again louder maria i took a couple of steps back to celias bedroom door id take sanctuary there it was right the natural place the slim straw it was proper to clutch at that of my loves inner sanctum well that was a load of bollocks assuming that was him and he was looking for her where would be the first place hed try well yes kenneth i stepped further back to another door i could hear footsteps down below the door led to a shallow cupboard not enough room to hide in that was it there was his room hers and to access any others id have to walk past the stairwell and be visible from below for a certain amount of time the footsteps were hard to make out was that somebody walking up the stairs to the floor below the first floor or somebody walking along the hall on the ground floor i was quaking i gripped the mobile so hard i was in danger of breaking it my jaw was grinding like id taken twenty e an hour earlier it felt like i was right slap bang on the verge of a heart attack sweat was trickling from my brows i could taste it on my upper lip jesus christ id been on the piss from midafternoon yesterday slept in my clothes got up without changing or washing suffered at least one fullon panic attack per hour since i woke up and now i was sweating like a paedophile in mothercare even if i found the perfect hiding place the fucker was going to smell me i walked as fast as possible past the stairwell towards the rooms at the front of the house i did that walk where you step quickly but put each foot down very gently trying not to cause any creaks or other noises i stared wideeyed down the stairwell no obvious signs of anybody coming up to this floor or the one below maria more distantly this time he must be through in the kitchen or thereabouts three doors ahead one to the side that one led to another narrower staircase heading steeply for what would have been the servants or the childrens rooms when the house was designed i closed it so far no comedy doorcreaking noises from the wellmaintained hinges thank fuck central door another cupboard not as shallow as the one along the landing but nowhere to hide if he did look in righthand door jesus was this his bedroom big enough grand enough masculinelooking enough i thought id vaguely assumed they both had their bedrooms at the rear because it would be quieter but maybe the one opposite hers was somebody elses the bodyguard the big blond guy and this was merrials it looked livedin somehow i closed it maybe a little too quickly there was a distinct click the third door revealed a gym a very wellequipped gym with a polished blondwood floor and lots of machines some of which i recognised a couple i didnt two more tall windows and translucent vertical blinds there were footsteps coming up the stairs i was starting to hyperventilate what did it feel like when you had a heart attack heart thrashing pains in chest headache sore arms that would be e all of the above then i slipped into the gym heck the smell of stale sweat might even be less conspicuous in here i still needed somewhere to hide two more doors the first led to another en suite the second belonged to a large deep cupboard oh shit i could hear somebody on this floor now out on the landing the cupboard held old bits of fitness equipment plus various items of sports gear including some scuba apparatus this would have to do i closed the door and made my way through the darkness as rapidly as i could banging one shin and barking a hand on something hard and metallic when i hit the rear wall i got into a corner and squatted down the place smelled musty i decided that was good a door opened was it the door to the gym oh fuck what the hell had i been thinking if merrial had just come back from caving what was he likely to do put the gear away where was he likely to put it where would he come straight to right here this cupboard this door right here where mister fuckwit was hiding squatting like a frightened schoolboy at the back of a hideyhole well done kenneth top fucking marks son take a good feel of your knees while they still fold the same way as everybody elses steps a tread coming closer shoes on polished wood oh fucking hell i wanted to cry i was going to cry i put my head down bowing to the darkness hide your face dont let the whites of the eyes show maybe the footsteps werent coming this way you couldnt always tell in unfamiliar houses maybe he was walking upstairs maybe the door to the cupboard opened light sensed through the eyelids i stopped breathing how long what would happen would he smell me would he see me how long how long before i knew would he say something would he just look squint then shout or take out a gun or go for a gun from his gun safe in the study or call the big blond guy light there had to be a light fixture in a cupboard this size i hadnt thought to look or feel for one but there must be a switch hed turn on the light and see me hunched here fucking imbecile no light clicked on maybe he could see me without it anyway the smell was sure to do it animals could smell fear and were all just animals especially in situations like this the oldest basest most deeply wired sense was going to betray me and the more i panicked about it the more fear pheromones id be giving out and so the more likely it was to happen oh fuck i was going to lose control of my bowels again something clattered making the floor under my backside thump i came very close to both jumping and yelping then the door closed and the light went steps sounded going away again i breathed again of course merrial might still have seen me but thought the best thing to do was to pretend he hadnt so he could go and get a gun or call the cops or the blond guy yes celia i heard him say im home yes there was too much rain but listen the alarm wasnt on when i got in i heard a rhythmic metallic tapping noise as he spoke then as i looked at the thin frame of light around the closed door one edge of that glowing boundary started slowly to widen and enlarge the fucking door was opening the house alarm it wasnt switched on the door opened silently and very slowly bits of gleaming fitness equipment came gradually into view then merrial himself was revealed standing by one of the polished chrome machines looking out through the opened blinds of one tall window he was dressed in jeans and a dark leather bomber jacket of course im sure he said dont ask stupid questions he was resting one hand on the fitness machine tapping one of the wirehung weights against the chrome metal support that was the tapping noise id heard he hadnt noticed the cupboard door still slowly opening i dont even have kaj here with me i now he must have noticed the door from the corner of his eye he started and his head shot round as he jumped and made a small involuntary noise fucking door he said quietly he was staring it seemed straight at me oh fuck if i shifted now hed see the movement but if he kept looking at me hed surely see my pasty white face in the darkness i kept still but closed my eyes then opened them a touch because i could hear him walking towards me across the wooden floor of the gym no just the door to the cupboard in the gym swung open there gave me a moment he said putting one hand to the edge of the door and closing it the light faded again i took another breath so were you last out or what he said voice muffled again by the closed door well somebody forgot to set the fucking alarm celia oh just fucking leave her alone you fuck it wasnt her shes ceel she would never make a mistake like that shes the calm infallible one her only fault is a certain weakness for villains and idiots maybe if i rushed the bastard and smacked him over the head with something heavy kill the fucker murder the man he was a fucking peoplesmuggling liferuining kneesnapping crime lord for fucks sake id be doing society a favour then ceel and i could run away together or better still say just hide here in the darkness and hope well im calling kaj get him to have a look at the alarm well he helped install it im going to take a look round make sure theres nobody in here its not being paranoid celia im not taking a shower thinking there could be some smackhead on the loose in here looking for your jewels or something these types are unbalanced capable of anything yes that sort of remark is amusing around the dinner table celia standing here right now thinking there could be some junkie hiding behind a door with a knife irony is the last thing on my mind im not suggesting a junkie could defeat the alarm im suggesting that somebody forgot to turn the alarm on and that therefore there could possibly be somebody in the house who got in without the alarm going off as it would have otherwise im not discussing this with you you seem in a very strange mood no i dont want to know how your weekend is going do what you want there was a soft snapping noise like a phone being closed perhaps then steps a pause more steps a door opening off the room then closing then another door and then silence my hand was getting sore i was still gripping my mobile it was still i guessed connected to the answering machine in the study on the floor below i closed the phone then opened it again so that the back light would come on duration of call end call that had to cover the message id left last night it must have been recorded over by now i clicked ok to end the call the phone vibrated almost immediately making me panic again i dropped the phone grabbed at it while it was still in midair and succeeded only in batting it across the dark cupboard off a wall with a loud thud and against some unidentified piece of metallic equipment with a resounding clang then it fell to the floor with another thump fuck would he have heard that and where was the phone lying on the floor somewhere if i was lucky the fucker would have been smashed by the series of impacts but if i wasnt then it was about to exhaust the three or four vibrations it went through in the mode i had it in and start ringing normally i had to get to it before it did merrial was probably standing stopped in the hall outside listening intently and thinking did i hear a couple of thuds with a clang inbetween there if he heard the piercing warble of an unfamiliar mobile phone coming from the room hed just left hed be right back in here or more likely hed dash down to his study grab a gun and then come storming back i levered myself forward feeling along the unseen floor for the little phone why did they have to make the damn things so fucking small nowadays old mobiles were the size of a brick id have found the thing by now instead of whimpering as my hands fanned out across the wooden floor banging into bits of gear and failing totally to find the phone which i couldnt even hear now the ringing would start any second not that that would matter because thanks to my panic and subsequent whacking of the phone about the place like it was a fucking squash ball merrial had almost certainly realised there was somebody hiding in his gym store and probably already had his shotgun or whatever and was walking calmly upstairs chambers full and hammers cocked green glow to one side quietly flicking off the phones screen i found it bashing my forehead off something metal as i did so i closed then opened the phone again the display looked normal nothing wrong with the little fucker so how come it hadnt gone from vibration to ring then i saw the little envelope symbol of course it had registered an incoming text message and so had vibrated once only i neednt have panicked i certainly neednt have started bouncing it off the walls like a bluebottle in a fucking jam jar still no sounds from outside maybe id got away with it i squatted there in the darkness and accessed the message ok call c i looked to the door of the cupboard there was an oldfashioned keyhole there halfway up one edge i swivelled over to it to put my eye to the bright slit my forehead banged off the door handle i sat back blinking through the tears a doorknob just above a keyhole whod have thought that fucking fucking idiot it had hurt so much i hadnt really registered how loud the sound had been jesus h for all the stealthiness i was showing here i might just as well march out singing a medley of slipknot numbers and slide down the fucking banister rail yodelling i looked carefully through the keyhole most of the gym was visible including the door to the hall outside the door was closed nobody in the room i wedged myself against the wall and dialled celias mobile number yes im in the cupboard in the gym i whispered can you hear me yes i just had a call from john i know i heard whos this kaj johns bodyguard swedish youve met him at somerset house the big blond guy oh fuck have you cleared the tape on the answering machine thoroughly get out quick as you can that was my intention he said hed have a look round and call kaj to get him over also he might have a shower if he does shower you should hear it its a power shower and the pump is in a cupboard off the secondfloor hall it makes a fair amount of noise on that floor at least where will this kaj person be coming from i dont know im surprised he wasnt with him unless they were together and he gave him the rest of the day off wait kaj has a girlfriend who lives somewhere off regents park he may be there john could have dropped him on the way down from yorkshire he didnt say anything about seeing your land rover in the mews so hes probably parked out the front but you must get out as soon as possible i know i hissed glancing through the keyhole again regents park to belgravia how long would that take by car potentially several hours if you made the journey during a rainy weekday rush hour while there was a tube strike but this was a sunny saturday lunchtime ten minutes no maybe on a sunday twenty minutes longer always assuming that was where this kaj guy was in the first place maybe the fucker was only five minutes walk away shoulders taking up half the pavement as he searched the kings road for a trendy outsize shop ill give it a couple of minutes more i told ceel if hes searching the place he probably reckons he neednt look in here because hes already taken care of it why dont i phone him again celia suggested i can try to find out what hes going to do and how far away kaj might be i might even try to convince him he should go out until kaj gets there visit some friends or go to a café i thought good idea i said call me back all right be ready to move oh i am i said ceel rang off i was about to close the phone when the display faded of its own accord oh no i closed the phone and opened it but the phone had turned itself off i tried turning it back on again and it got as far as vibrating once and beginning its startup procedure showing zero bars out of three of available battery power before confirming this by going dark again out of power i supposed id been lucky to get what i had out of it after such a short chargeup time on the temple belle this morning i sat there breathing almost normally with the little phone a dead lump in my hand then i holstered it and sighed so i was on my own now poor ceel she would worry not being able to contact me shed guess the phone was out of juice i hoped the keyhole again still nothing happening in the gym i supposed i ought to put on my other glove ah the other glove now then where would that be i shook my head at the darkness swivelling and sliding back to where id been squatting earlier in the rear corner of the store i banged another shin on something very hard at this rate it wouldnt need kaj to jump up and down on my knees to wreck my fucking legs i felt around on the floor i felt the glove and some relief one more tiny hurdle accidentally set up but then cleared oh christ i was getting very tired i was going to spend the rest of my life in this fucking posh house just trying to get the hell out of it maybe i could just lie here and go to sleep and nobody would ever find me i could squat here stow away live secretly here in the house like a sort of soft hermit celia would discover me and bring me something to eat each evening like a child sent to their room by a strict father brought food by a forgiving mother or younger sister my knees were getting sore from all this squatting sore knees think about that think of that pain hold that image kajs big face and short blond hair as he smiles at you and goes boingyboingy on your fucking leg bones man a surprisingly large part of my brain really did seem to want to do nothing a significant and very vocal minority of my brain cells seemed to think that just resting here in the darkness was actually quite a good idea it had proved all right so far i hadnt been discovered it was quiet and unthreatening maybe if i stayed here everything would somehow be okay i knew this was nonsense obviously but that was the temptation stay put leaving my dark mustysmelling sanctuary meant going out into the light braving the landings and stairs and floors and halls and doors of a house whose owner was present and suspicious and potentially and very possibly by now armed and who was anyway a crime boss and who had just ordered his personal dolph lundgrenonsteroids bodyguard here to investigate what was going on oh yes staying here in the darkness and hiding quietly seemed like a seductively good idea or maybe i could go back to ceels bedroom and hide there and our intense sexual karma would spookily protect me even from a determined and thorough search until she got back and could smuggle me out when the coast was clear no out get the fuck out now get back to the door look through the keyhole confirm nothing happening and nobody there take hold of the door handle twist handle and slowly open door rise feel knees complain as though theyre anticipating what might happen to them later if this all goes horribly wrong take deep breath close door again walk quietly to door of gym no keyhole so cant look out to hall stop and listen can you hear a power shower pump operating no so what to do go back to the cupboard and wait there keep an ear to the keyhole so you could hear when the pump did start up but then what if the pump couldnt be heard from inside the cupboard wait here at the door leading to the hall but then what if merrial took another look inside the gym before taking his shower hed already been in here but he might want to check again a house this size was probably well in excess of some mathematically provable topographical limit that defined when a space became too big for one person ever to search perfectly you could confirm that there was nobody on a certain floor but then while you were in the depths of one of these large rooms checking in an en suite loo or whatever the person doing the hiding could slip out of a notyetsearched room and creep up to one of the alreadysearched rooms without the searcher being able to spot them so checking a room twice would make some sort of sense oh fuck i didnt fucking know i looked behind me opened blinds the window merrial had been standing at while hed been talking to ceel on his mobile i could see the house on the far side of the square visible through the leafless trees of winter probably too far away for it to be a problem i wondered if there was any way to get out of the window and down to the ground without causing a fuss or making it to the upper storey to the loft and then out onto the roof and then finding a way down if i still had a working phone i could call and ask for the fire brigade because there was a major fire in the place and hope to get away in the confusion no all of these just led to more complications and more opportunities for things to go appallingly wrong footsteps outside in the hall coming closer oh shit did i have time to get back to the cupboard probably not and certainly not quietly i shrank back behind the door if merrial did open the door and he was daft enough not to look behind it as soon as hed opened it then i might still escape the footsteps went past a door closed closed and locked i thought i waited for the sound of a shower i looked around the gym if there was a phone extension in here did i dare phone ceel in case there was something vital she now knew that i needed to but then what if merrial was already on the landline bit of a giveaway hearing that old otherextension click i waited but how long did i have where was kaj coming from kings road regents park somewhere else and how fucking long did it take merrial to get ready for a fucking shower for fucks sake come on man stop fucking about and get your fucking clothes off and jump into the fucking thing twist that dial and lather up maybe ceel had been exaggerating about how loud the pump was maybe she had more acute hearing than i did maybe some eccentricity of the way sound was transmitted through the house meant that right here where i was standing in the gym was the one place you couldnt hear the goddamn pump i tried to listen really carefully was that the sound of a pump jesus if my phone still had power i could phone ceel and hold the phone up and ask her is that the sound of the pump that barely audible hum way in the distance or is that the central heating or the fucking drinks fridge in the study or something maybe merrial was using a mainspressure shower over his bath instead for some reason i could only guess at ha maybe he was showering as quietly as he could specifically because he didnt want to let his supposed junkie with a knife know where he was even if he had locked the bedroom and presumably the bathroom door when the pump did start up i jumped again it sounded like it was just through the wall from where i was standing i thought about that phrase about somebody being as nervous as a kitten and thought what a load of crap it really was id never seen a kitten as nervous as id been over the last couple of hours okay signal to go i put my hand on the door handle but what if merrial had started the shower going as a ruse and was no no no fuck it just fucking well fucking go for fucks sake you overcautious fuck i went quickly but quietly out into the hall gently closed the door and went along to the stairwell treading on the sides of the steps as i descended to keep down any creaking noises i did the same on the next set of stairs i was right at the bottom stair facing the front door and about to make the turn to head back along the long hall to the kitchen and the rear door when i heard the sound of a key in the front doors lock i didnt freeze i didnt even start to think that hey maybe i can brazen it out dressed in my incredibly convincing overalls there was no time to dash back upstairs or get to the kitchen there was maybe just enough time to get to the door to the right of the main door i lunged for it leaping from the bottom stair grabbing the handle and pulling the door open to fall into a cloakroom as i hauled the door closed behind me managing to damp its closing just enough to stop it slamming an instant before i heard the front door open oh no i was going to sneeze i was panting close to wheezing worried that i was going to make so much noise that whoever it was kaj probably would hear me anyway but now i felt the tingle in my nose that meant i was going to sneeze i shoved my tongue up into the top of my mouth and forced the edge of a finger up into the base of my septum under my nose the urge to sneeze faded i tried to work my way back into the coats and jackets the smell of waxed material always did make me want to sneeze for some reason and hoped that kaj didnt need to put a coat in here the front door closed boss a deep male voice boomed john then silence i crouched down behind and underneath the thickest clump of coats it was winter not exactly freezing but not exactly warm either so there was every chance kaj would have a coat he wanted to deposit in here oh no dont oh no please dont please be a really hard swedish guy who just totally scorns the very idea of coats and jackets until the temperature is a good ten below and the wind chill doubles that the door opened oh god this is it this must be i didnt think i could be seen but my luck just had to run out sometime and i suspected it was long overdue for departure all i could see as i was buried under and behind the coats were two very large timberland boots and the broad shins of a pair of jeans could he see anything of me there was a swishing noise the sound of fabric on fabric then the door closed i stayed where i was give the big blond bastard time to do a doubletake yoost a meenoot whose were those shoes that i saw yust there then i heard heavy footsteps going rapidly upstairs my mouth had gone all dry once more when i tried to stand up my legs collapsed under me and i had to sit down breathing heavily i levered myself up i put my ear to the door i was a metre from escape id use the front door and the hell with getting out the way i came in thank fuck id replaced the key inside the stone earlier silence no keyhole here either i risked cracking the door and looked out nobody about the door opened and closed almost silently upstairs i could still just hear the sound of the shower pump a door closed up there sounding faint i turned to the wide front door please dont let there be a returning maid or an investigating copper standing outside the front door was heavy but it too swung open without a sound and i went out the fresh cool air of a bright winters afternoon hit my face as i skipped down the steps to the square breathing deeply it tasted like freedom two left turns and i was in the mews there was nobody at the land rover i got in and reversed out i whooped and hollered most of the way back to the temple belle i parked on a double yellow by a phone box on buckingham palace road to phone ceels mobile message service i licked my lips trying to think what to say its all okay i said i blew a kiss at a parking warden already starting to take the landys details then when i got back to chelsea creek i could hardly move once i reached the car park it felt like the front wheels were ploughing through halfmelted tarmac and my legs almost buckled underneath me as i got out i had to support myself with both hands as i went down the narrow gangway to the boat i got the door closed half fell down the steps and for the second time in twelve hours and in the overalls even more fully clothed collapsed onto the bed like a dead weight i was asleep before the second bounce twelve dead cat bounce theres this thing called the dead cat bounce its a stock market term i believe what its talking about is the fact that even a stock that is essentially worthless and really going nowhere but down for ever can register a slight upward movement just for a bit because there is generally a floor for almost everything the comparison rests on the fact that even when a cat hits the pavement from forty storeys high and dies instantly itll still bounce back up a little now may be a good time to think of something happy inside here when i first came to london in it wasnt as a dj id lost my job with strathclyde sound after a series of disputes the last straw absurdly had been a campaign id called dont rubbish our stations to bring back litter bins to scottish railway stations because the ira had never carried out any terrorist attacks anywhere in scotland and so there was no need to ape the english safety precaution of removing bins because they were potential places to leave a bomb so i decided to make the move down south to the big smoke like generations of scots before me in london id got nowhere with the few contacts i had and the dozens of demo tapes id sent off so i got a job as a bike courier whizzing through the crowded streets on an already wellused bandit that had cost me the last of my savings weaving in and out between the cars and trucks and buses and going the wrong way round the occasional traffic island to get documents and disks and drawings from one office to another as quickly as possible then i got a job with a firm of motorcycle chauffeurs somehow convincing the manager that i was a good responsible and above all smooth driver miraculously id held on to a clean licence in all the mayhem of london dispatch biking though i had been knocked down twice the idea was that the london traffic had become so congested there was an almost literal gap in the market for getting people from one bit of the capital to the other quicker than a taxi or a limo could a big bike was the answer a honda pan european or a bmw tourer complete with panniers to carry an extra helmet and an oversuit for the client and a tall enough screen so that the worst of any weather was kept off them providing you were moving though of course being on a bike you should be able to even in a serious jam the company did well enough but then ran into cashflow problems and was taken over by a limo firm they lost half the drivers but i was one of the lucky ones one late spring morning at the start of an early shift i was called to an emergency job taking somebody from islington to langham place a car hadnt shown and i was nearest i pulled up at a nice semiposh terraced house in cloudesley square one of the districts leafier bits and this elfin blonde in jeans and a rumpled tshirt appeared running down the steps pulling on a pretend bikers jacket and waving goodbye to a sleepylooking guy standing in the doorway wearing what looked like a very small womans dressinggown hi she said pulling on the helmet i had held out to her she had a small friendly looking face profoundly unkempt short curly hair and crinkly eyes that were about as wideset as they could be in such a thin face cheekylooking somehow i was sure i recognised her come to think of it the guy in the toosmall dressinggown had rung a bell or two as well morning i said helping her with the buckle under her chin this wasnt as easy as it ought to have been because she was bouncing from one foot to the other all the time youll have to stop jumping up and down i told her gently sorry she waggled her eyebrows the helmet was a bit big for her but i did the strap up as tight as i could i got the buckle fastened and she swung her leg over and jumped on behind me broadcasting house langham place she yelled helmet banging against mine fast as you can if thats okay i nodded and we set off it was about ten to six we didnt quite make it in time but her producer filled for her and played a couple of records back to back and parked up by a wee café on cavendish street and listening on my fm earpiece i heard her start her show and smiled when breathless giggling apologising she said thanks to the bike guy whod helped her get there almost on time sorry i forgot to ask your name she said but if youre listening mate well done right samantha coghlan was something very close to being the nations darling at the time sam had presented various shows on childrens tv been a big hit there tried some more serious tv without any great success one of those deals where they keep adding zeros to the money on offer until the talent has to say yes then the execs stand around scratching their heads wondering what exactly to do with the star theyve bought and then made the move to national radio in what at first looked like an act of desperation by both her and radio one as it turned out though she was perfect for the breakfast show well perfect apart from sleeping in all too often with her celeb filmstar boyfriend after showbiz parties and general late nights with their famous friends breezy and pally but sharp and funny too sam added a million and a half listeners to the show and reinvigorated a career that might just have been starting to stutter within a year she was winning awards fronting a tv rock and pop show to even more acclaim and helping a couple of major retailers lift their profile with a generation of customers theyd been losing touch with i became biker ken her preferred mode of transport for most of that summer id made a decision right at the start to keep quiet about my own dormant radio career sam started to mention me on air more often and over a couple of months i became one of the disparate cloud of friends acquaintances hangerson and well parasites she would mention always funnily never bitterly during the course of her show a cast of characters she built up apparently without thinking about it until we became part of a sort of reallife soap opera the listening public followed avidly five mornings out of seven after a while once the bike hire company equipped us with twoway intercoms so that we could if the client wanted to communicate with each other she started asking me en route about what id done before id become a bike chauffeur finally i couldnt keep my old career quiet without either being rude or lying so i confessed all brilliant really really great come on the show look i told her im not going to say no sam but you may want to recon na come on itll be fun so i did and found i hadnt lost my radio voice or my touch and was suitably humbly funny for a fiveminute spot with her one morning when i was off duty that afternoon i got a call from one of the stations id sent a demo tape to a year earlier would i like to come in and do an audition so sam gave me my big break the lovely samantha parted company with her listeners one tearful morning that autumn leaving to go off and have babies in la with her actor fiancé whose career had taken off in serious style we all missed her but by then i had my own latenight show on a new commercial london station called m i sent her flowers she sent a gracious funny affectionate note that i still had she was a happily married mother of twin girls and a big hit on the hollywood social scene last id heard but what i remembered most was not her leaving or those five generous minutes on her show that kickstarted my own stalled career or even that morning when i first met her what i remembered most what i remembered now was charging down the sleepy streets in the light of a new summers morning heading south for langham place through the sparse fivethirty traffic with the big bike humming beneath us she held onto the grab handles at first then after a couple of weeks asked if it would be okay to put her arms round my waist id said of course and so about three mornings out of five and usually by the time we got to caledonian road shed clasp her gloved hands in front of my belly and put her helmet against mine and then fall comfortably asleep for the rest of the journey when we started wearing the intercom units i could hear her snoring sometimes ever so gently as we thrummed smoothly down the quiet sidelit streets towards the heart of the slowly waking city in all my life to that point i had never been happier since then only when id been with ceel and im thinking about her now because now im in a box all trussed bound up blind in the darkness and petrified that something gruesome is going to happen to me because all that i did earlier all the business with the getting into and getting out of merrials house was somehow not enough and the bad men have come for me and taken me away and im terrified for myself and for celia because i have the awful gutchurning bowelchilling feeling that when they take me out of here im going to see her and shell be in just as much trouble as i am they came in the depths of night and the bottom of the tide when the whole ship was tilted out of true and out of kilter sloping away to one side on the dark slope of ancient mud where the smell of cold death rises from i woke up panicking again but this time because i thought id heard something i lay there across the bed in the darkness not daring to move had i heard something sometimes i used to be sure i heard a great banging noise the instant before i woke but jo would always say that i must have been dreaming had that happened this time i heard another noise somewhere above me i started to move my hand towards the head of the bed where the big black maglite torchclub lay maybe i was dreaming or maybe it was jo come back shamefaced unable to live without me maybe better it was ceel id left the door unlocked or shed learned how to pick a lock from her husbands crim pals another noise oh sweet jesus forget the maglite activate the fucking breitlings emergency satellite signalling gizmo dickhead i started to bring my hands together the light clicked on my eyes hurt i spun round turning over in the bed in time to see a tall wellbuilt white guy i didnt recognise standing above me another big guy stood at the door to the bedroom some sort of large box just behind him they looked like i had overalls and baseball caps my right hand moved to my left wrist where the big breitling was but it was all happening too slowly the first guy punched me hard in the belly and the wind whooshed out of my lungs he grabbed my wrist and tore the watch off my hand released i curled up gasping and mewling bunched round the pain and the wheezing vacuum formed by the punch and they bound me in that position before i could do anything about it quickly and efficiently sticking silver gaffer tape over my mouth and tying my hands and ankles all together with the same plastic ties the cops use they both wore latex gloves like surgeons they frisked me quickly efficiently taking everything out of my pockets then they roped my neck to the same fourway knot securing my wrists and ankles so that i was trussed into a fetal position that way i fitted into the foamlined metal shell of a washing machine in the big cardboard box id glimpsed earlier which they must have lifted down the stairs they lowered me into it sitting me on my buttocks and feet and then secured the lid cutting out all light i heard the cardboard flaps slap down above me and the tearing noise of more gaffer tape being applied then i felt myself being lifted up the steps i was on my side now lying on and surrounded by what felt like thick expanded polystyrene i tried to move tried to scream down my nose tried to kick or punch or do anything but all that happened was i produced a pathetic keening noise through my snotty nostrils and got myself all hot in the tiny insulated space i felt myself carried up the gangway along the pontoon up the slope to the car park and then heard the faint noise of what sounded like a pair of van rear doors opening i was placed down the doors closed with a muffled thud and a few seconds later the van engine unheard within all the foam padding around me started off swinging into the main road and accelerating away oh god oh fuck oh shit the very very best i could hope for now was that this was still something to do with that wanker and his dangerous driving case mark whatever he was called maybe he was still trying to get away with a functioning driving licence maybe he had persuaded my new pal mr glatz that after all and despite our little word outside the imperial war museum i still needed to be leaned upon maybe hed found new crim pals willing to do the job for him maybe he had more villainous resources of his own than mr glatz had credited him with maybe all this was just to get me utterly fucking petrified if so hey mission accomplished guys so id agree to change my witness statement except i didnt think so it was all so fucking easy and efficient and well thoughtout somehow too practised these fuckers had done this before it was merrial but maybe not maybe when we got to wherever we were going and it was always possible we were going somewhere really terminally and immediately godawful like a crusher or an incinerator or just the edge of an old dock maybe id see this guy southorne not john merrial maybe i started to cry the pain in my abdomen was receding now but i started to cry the van swung smoothly through the citys nighttime streets this way and that all the things ill never get to say all the rants ill never get to rant there was one shaping up about context about blindness about selectivity about racism and our intense suckerhood when it came to reacting to images and symbols and our blank glazed inability to accept and comprehend reality in the form of statistics its because there was a reliablesources statistic phil discovered the other day that every twentyfour hours about thirtyfour thousand children die in the world from the effects of poverty from malnutrition and disease basically thirtyfour thousand from a world a worldsociety that could feed and clothe and treat them all with a workably different allocation of resources meanwhile the latest estimate is that two thousand eight hundred people died in the twin towers so its like that image that ghastly greybillowing doublebarrelled fall repeated twelve times every single fucking day twentyfour towers one per hour throughout each day and night full of children we feel for the people in the towers we agree with almost any measure to stop it ever happening again and so we should but for the thirtyfour thousand each day given our behaviour and despite the idea were supposed to love our children you could be forgiven for thinking that most of us just dont give a damn so maybe not such a terrific world to be contemplating leaving then a straw caught in the undertow heading downwards into the darkness to clutch at at least i said i loved ceel i told her in the conventional three words thats something not much perhaps and she never did return the sentiment but its something that i got to say maybe the last unforced thing ill ever say it seems like a long time before the van stops then it starts again moving slowly it jiggles over what feels like some roughish ground or badly pitted roadway then angles down one left corner taken slowly then a series of them as though were on a spiral ramp heading downwards then we stop it feels like my heart is thrashing against my ribcage desperate to escape a rat in an already humming microwave sweat pours off me in the tightly insulated confines of the box then im lifted set down and theres the sound of tape being ripped from the cardboard above me the lid comes off and a little light seeps in im hoisted out easily by the two overalled guys who had put me into the box they undo the rope holding my neck down to my ankles and wrists then cut a plastic tie holding my wrists and ankles together im opened out like a penknife and stand precariously between them ankles still tied to each other and wrists the same im in a big rectangular concrete tunnel its quite dark lit only by a couple of armoured glass ceiling fixtures the van we came in was a white astramax and a little part of my brain that doesnt believe all this is really happening to me thinks ah of course its an astramax what else ahead there are two wire mesh gates and distant ceiling lights forming a grid in a larger space beyond the air smells dank and filthy like raindiluted sewage it feels cold on my sweatbeaded skin they drag me to the mesh gates and push them open were on a slight slope beyond the slope disappears into darkness black as night the darkness of an infinite pit lights come on across the black gulf the mainbeams of a car blinding the blackness is water we splash into it raising a smell of something dead and rotten into the air the water is only a couple of centimetres deep barely more than a film the toes of my shoes are dragged through the thin covering over old but still smooth concrete about fifteen metres in from the shallow ramp we entered from we get to the place where the car is its a big dark modern bentley by its offside there is a little island of pallets about two dozen squares of anaemic yellowwhite undressed wood arranged to provide a sort of crude pontoon above the shallow sheet of dark water the bentley sits beside the pallet island for all the world like a liner tied up to a quayside in the centre of the pallets a single metal column comes down from the roof there are two piles of bricks on each side of the column about sixty centimetres high bound to the black iron column with thick black insulating tape a metre away facing this there is a single big plain wooden seat sturdy and armless the sort of thing you might find at the head of a farmhouse table when i see it i try to struggle but its almost comically ineffective i suspect the two guys holding me dont even notice they put me in front of the seat when i resist being sat in it the one who hit me before whacks me with one fist crunching into my cheek i lose it for a moment and when im fully aware again im already tied and taped into the seat and theyre just finishing taping my feet to the iron column my heels are resting on the piles of bricks one on either side of the metal post i cant believe this my head feels like its revolving and somersaulting and vibrating like its a fairground waltzer and my brains the single hapless helpless passenger when im quite secure and unable to move much beyond a twitch my head is the only part of me i can really control at all the drivers door of the bentley opens and john merrial gets out hes dressed in a black threepiece suit with a highnecked waistcoat black gloves the two guys one to each side of me straighten fractionally so there goes my last hope it is him and not mark southorne i am here because of yesterday because of the message because of ceel and not because of some idiotic pointsdodging scam mr merrial looks small and dark and regretful as though he isnt going to enjoy any of this either i lose control of my bowels and shit myself i really cant help it im a passenger in my own body now and i just sit there and listen and feel and then smell it all happen and im astonished how quickly and easily it takes place mr merrial wrinkles his nose the shit fills my underpants nothing i think im to be spared nothing the guy who hasnt hit me goes to merrial and offers him the stuff theyve taken off me merrial takes a large pair of latex gloves from one pocket puts them on over his black leather gloves and then accepts the big breitling hefting it he smiles nice watch he hands it back to the guy he tries to turn my phone on but of course its dead then he looks in my wallet taking out my various credit cards and bits and pieces and inspecting them he pauses at his own white calling card the one id written on from here because im sitting down and so looking from a lower perspective i can see the back of the card where i wrote down the code celia told me over the phone the code that turns off the burglar alarm in the merrials house ive been sitting here desperately trying to work out what to say and i do have an idea but it all depends on the fucker not looking at the back of that little white card if he does theres nothing i can think of that might save celia let alone me if he doesnt then the slenderest of chances remains the moment seems to freeze in that instant im suddenly with ceel and her absurd entanglement theory in one universe merrial flips the card over in his fingers and sees the alarm code written there in the other he just looks at the one already printed side and thats all maybe i deserve what might happen here i know im not a particularly good person ive lied and ive cheated and its no consolation that little of it was illegal its not illegal to lie to your best friend to fuck his wife to lie to your partner to cheat on her smashing car windows hitting somebody in the face smoking dope burglary that sort of things illegal and ive done all that too but none of that means very much compared to betraying the people youre closest to thats the stuff really to be ashamed of so maybe id have no real cause to complain if im made to suffer here but nothing ive done deserves the death penalty or even having my legs broken does it ive told lies on a small scale but ive tried to tell the truth on a larger scale ive tried to be true to what i believe in rather than make as much money as i could have doesnt that count for something and who the fuck are these people to judge me anyway im a liar and im weak and im certainly no hero because ive filled my fucking pants but even sitting here in my own stench in greasy sweatstained twoharddaysliving clothes im a fucking better man than these vindictive shitheads for all their crisply ironed shirts if only deserving something was all there was to it actually it doesnt matter a damn i am in the realm of pure luck here even if ceels crazy ideas are true which they just damn well arent so roll the dice let the universe do the fucking maths merrial slips the card back into my wallet without looking at the other side he hands everything back to the man in the overalls then slowly removes his latex gloves and gives those to the guy who comes and stands behind my shoulder again merrial says take the tape off his mouth would you alex the guy whos hit me twice so far does that tearing it off casually it hurts a bit i swallow cold sweat trickles down my face and into my mouth good evening kenneth merrial says for a while i just breathe unwilling to trust myself to come out with anything coherent merrial hoists himself a little and sits on the wing of the bentley well he says with a hint of a smile thank you for coming i expect youre wondering why ive invited you here this evening this is probably meant to be funny i keep on breathing not willing to say anything i stare into his eyes dark under his brows and the shadows of the small overhead lights i keep swallowing trying to get some saliva into my mouth i look about the place squint into the bentley at least theres no sign of celia maybe she got away in time maybe shes not been linked to this oh lord a straw to grasp at a stillfloating one do you like being underground kenneth merrial asks i dont think he really wants an answer so i dont give him one i do he says smiling looking around at the darkness i dont know just makes me feel he stares up safe i suppose im a single nervefiring away from hysterical laughter at this point at that particular word but i dont think that laughing in mr merrials face right now would be a very good idea at all and sense prevails a series of small horrible bubbly farts announce my bowels have completed their evolutionary duty and prepared me for fight or flight by getting rid of the excess matter theyd been holding inside my body very helpful i think sat here immobile and helpless yes merrial says looking round too i like it here useful old place this he gestures down at the floor where the water has already stopped rippling and gone back to its impression of pure blackness again flooding now he shakes his head lips pursed wont be able to use it in a year or two he looks at me water table you see kenneth water table of the whole of london is rising again it was going down for years centuries apparently while they were taking water out for industry tanning breweries that sort of thing now its rising again they have to keep pumps going all the time in the deep tube lines and some multistorey underground car parks he smiles thinly youd think they could use some of it as drinking water instead of flooding nice valleys in the home counties but apparently its too polluted shame really dont you think mr merrial i say voice quivering i honestly dont know why merrial raises one hand to me and looks towards the ramp i was brought down lights and the sound of a big car engine a range rover trundles down the slope it edges between the opened v of the wire mesh gates and into the water it comes hissing slowly towards us on small inky bowwaves then loops away into the darkness and curves back in again stopping on the other side of the little palletisland from the bentley a series of miniature wakes rippling and gurgling against the wood beneath us the range rover kills its lights the air smells of exhaust on the far side the drivers door opens and kaj gets out he comes splashing round steps up onto the pallets and puts one hand to the passenger doors handle i know it might be her i know whos probably going to be there behind the smoked glass merrial is watching me intently i can feel it i stare at the range rovers door for as long as i can im going to do what i can to protect her that might not be very long but its all i can do the only control over anything i have here when the door opens and i see its celia i look surprised no more i stare at her then look round briefly at merrial ceel appears uninjured she looks at merrial then kaj still holding the door open for her she steps out wrinkling her nose at the smell shes dressed in blue jeans a thick red shirt and a yellow and black hiking jacket hair down spread hiking boots she looks calmly angry what do you think she starts to ask merrial then she seems to see me properly for the first time oh jesus dont blow it so soon kid she frowns at me thats thats ken nott the dj she glares accusingly at merrial what the hells he supposed to have done the question ends on what is almost a laugh merrial stays where he is sitting on the wing of the bentley kaj quietly closes the door of the range rover and stands beside celia with his hands folded over his crotch bouncer style eyes flicking about the scene the two guys who kidnapped me stand still one at each of my shoulders lets ask him shall we merrial said pleasantly he looks at me so ken why do you think youre here mr merrial i say i dont know i dont know what you think ive done but merrial shakes his head ah no ken you see youve started lying already now havent you he looks genuinely disappointed in me i thought you were always saying on your show how people had to be truthful how they had to be truthful even when it hurt but there you go you see the first proper answer weve had from you so far and its a flat lie isnt it if if if i stammer for the first time since i was four i suck in a deep breath if ive done something you dont like im sorry mr merrial i really am merrial shrugs raising his eyebrows and making a pouting motion with his lower lip well everybodys sorry when they get caught kenneth he says reasonably but i think you do know why youre here his voice is quite soft nothing useful i can say at this point i suspect i stick to swallowing the shit is starting to go cold around my backside on the front of the seat im tied to jesus i stink oh celia i wish you didnt have to see smell experience all this i wish youd run got away just kept on heading north or anywhere as long as it was away from this man kaj merrial says you have exhibit a do you kaj nods and opens the range rovers rear door john celia says i dont know whats going on here but i dont want to be part of it i want to go home now she sounds composed unflustered but still distinctly pissed off id like you to stay a while yet celia merrial says i dont want to stay she says through clenched teeth im sure you dont merrial tells her he swings one foot a couple of times gently tapping the flank of the bentley with his heel but i insist kaj is holding an opened laptop computer celia narrows her eyes she takes a breath there had better she says slowly be a very good reason for this john she looks about the place sparing me a brief pitying slightly disgusted look youve kept me away from this sort of thing until now i always assumed that was because you knew how i might react if i was brought into contact with it her gaze snaps back to merrial this changes things between us john she tells him you cant go back from this i hope you realise what youre doing merrial just smiles show kenneth the evidence would you kaj the big blond guy holds the laptop open a metre away from me from this angle celia can see the screen too kaj presses return and a big greyblue window already open on the desktop flickers into life oh shit if i hadnt already crapped myself i would now its the interior of the merrials house one of the landings daylight first floor i can see down the stairwell to the front door and the loo i hid in later only the first quarter metre of each door is visible the alarm controls arent visible theres me coming up the stairs in jerky everyfewseconds lofi slomo the sort of thing you see on tv reallife crime programmes when theyre showing a recording of a raid on a bank or building society or a subpost office no sound looks like the shot is taken from the ceiling the cameras are inside smoke sensors merrial tells me casually in case you were wondering he glances at his wife celia takes in a deep breath puffing herself up i had ah merrial says quickly one or two suspicions about things this was a way of you put surveillance in my home celia says rage overflowing you didnt even think to ask me tell me merrial looks almost awkward security is my concern celia not yours he says not looking at her but at me its only in the hall and landings not anywhere else have you lost your senses man celia breathes almost more to herself than to her husband how could you how could you merrial doesnt answer meanwhile on screen in living grainy rubbish colour i try various doors then disappear upstairs the clip switches to the next floor up and me ascending the stairs i go into the bedroom across from celias not exactly good portraitquality pictures but good enough easily sufficient to convince a jury that that was me all right especially as im still wearing the same fucking clothes now as i was then okay kaj merrial says softly kaj closes the laptop and puts it back in the range rover so kenneth merrial says what were you doing in my house i look at him swallow i say i was wiping the tape on your answering machine he tips his head he looks mildly surprised were you now and why would you want to do that because i left a message on it that i regretted the instant i woke up the next morning a message i thought would get me into trouble if you heard it i look around at the two gleaming cars the pallet island the black unseen waters i gulp this sort of trouble merrial nods for a moment what did the message say kenneth it was insulting to you mr merrial what exactly did it say kenneth i honestly cant remember the exact words i say closing my eyes for a few seconds i swear i cant i was i was very drunk when i made the call very drunk indeed id had a bit of an emotional sort of day to be honest i attempt a hopefully infectious smile but it seems mr ms empathic immune system is proof against this a friend found out that id been ah seeing his estranged wife i tell him struggling manfully on but i also discovered id just got out of a court case i hadnt exactly been looking forward to so there was ah a sorrow to be drowned and something to be celebrated as well i did both and got very drunk indeed obviously i wouldnt have been stupid enough to have made the call if i hadnt been extremely drunk but i was ah i lick my cold dry lips i clear my throat listen i say trying to look appealing i dont suppose i could have some water could i mr merrial nods his head you suppose correctly kenneth go on i swallow on my dry throat grimacing what happened was that id found out from another of my friends what you what you were involved in i tell merrial what your ah profession was what it involved i shrug look away i felt angry that id played you your wife a record i felt um complicit dirtied up you might say i called you to tell you this and got ah a little carried away you might say i called you things i would not call you to your face now mr merrial i ah im sure you can fill in the blanks yourself mr merrial nods slowly and my wife i let my brows tremble i glance at celia who is looking aghast at her husband in a small voice i say i ah may have referred to her as a gangsters moll or something i have half a hope this might get a laugh or at least a smile but merrial looks quite serious and so you thought youd burgle my house he says not sounding completely convinced not sounding at all convinced in fact i realised what id done when i woke up i tell him so i called your house again the answering machine was still on so i guessed you were away for the weekend i drove to your place climbed into the garden from the roof of my land rover found a key to the back door in one of those artificial stone things realised the alarm wasnt switched on and thought hey the gods are with me here i shift in my seat this is a mistake the shit feels like some disgusting jelly inside my pants and jeans and is already seeping through to my overalls then i really really needed to take a dump so i started looking for a toilet i finally found one then i went back down to the study wiped the tape and youre leaving my wifes bedroom out of all this merrial said he glanced at celia then smiled i cant help noticing celia glared at me and crossed her arms id thought earlier that if there was any sign id anybody had been in then i should try to make it look like a robbery i tell him so i took a couple of rings from mrs merrials dressing table then after id got the tape cleared i realised taking the rings would just draw attention to the fact that somebody had been in the house so i went back to her room and put them back where id found them i look at merrial he looks sceptical i shrug as best i can id never done this sort of thing before mr merrial id talked to people i knew about artificial stones and fake campbell s soup tins and pretend mains sockets for hiding valuables in and stuff like that but i didnt think id get in and out without an alarm going but it didnt matter i was going to get in no matter what it took smash a window break down a door anything because even if i was caught by the cops whatever sentence i got whatever fine i was hit with or time i had to serve it had to be less less unpleasant than what would happen to me if you heard that answering machine tape and if my friends in the met had caught you what were you going to claim was your purpose in breaking into my house i shrug again my ah first thought was to claim that id become obsessed with your wife but then i thought youd probably be pretty upset about that too so i decided id claim that id become a vigilante or something that i was looking for evidence of your criminality or just wanted to give you a taste of your own medicine subjecting you to crime it didnt matter how stupid it sounded how lame as long as i got that tape wiped but the study was locked kenneth merrial says reasonably how did you get in there i frown just lie i think deny the video the recorded evidence pretend its lawson brierley were dealing with here trust to the graininess of the image the awkward angle the camera has of that door and the big gloves i was wearing to obscure the fact i used a key no it wasnt i tell him the study was open kenneth merrial says gently he nods at the range rover where kaj put the laptop we can see it was locked it wasnt i protest i stuck my head in saw it wasnt a bedroom caught a glimpse of the answering machine and kept going i look at kaj i did it took about two seconds i was desperate i was about to i let my voice fall away and look down at my lap i was about to do what ive just done for christs sake i took a very quick look closed the door and kept on going im breathing deep and hard there are tears in my eyes i look at merrial god man what im telling you is bad enough what more could make it worse merrial looks slowly from me to celia he looks thoughtful thats what ive been asking myself kenneth he switches his gaze to kaj that possible what he just said he asks kaj shrugs massively perhaps he says his voice is deep but not as swedish as id been expecting the frame capture rate is about one per three seconds he might have had time to open and close the door between frames merrial looks at me the study was locked when i got back yesterday he says i shrug again well i dont know i say almost wailing maybe i put the sneck down merrial looks puzzled the what scottish word i say desperately the the the catch thing down on the lock inside the door anyway i was about to leave when you came back so i hid in the cupboard in the gym i heard you on the phone to your wife saying you were calling somebody called sky or kyle or something then when you were showering i almost made it to the front door when when i gesture at kaj when he came in so i hid in the cloakroom by the front door once hed gone upstairs i just walked out i let out a deep juddering breath thats it whole truth nothing but mr merrial purses his lips he looks at me for a few moments and i grit my teeth and return his stare he nods and i realise then that there is just the hint of a chance theres a hint of a chance because complicit in the conspiracy ceel and i are involved in here attempting to deceive mr merrial there is surprisingly a third person and that third person is merrial himself the man doesnt really want to find out hes been cuckolded he knows he has to be suspicious suspicion is sensible suspicion is safe suspicion is how he lives his entire professional life but ultimately hed rather not discover his wife and another man have made a fool of him he will go so far to make sure it looks like nothings happened as far as is reasonable as far as he must to establish the truth beyond something like reasonable doubt but he wont pursue the matter as doggedly and as determinedly as he might a debt or an insult from another crook his own pride puts him on the same side as ceel and me none of us wants him to know the truth merrial makes a sort of huffing noise that might be a laugh and gets down from the bentley walking slowly over to me his hands raised in front of his chin as though in prayer he stops and looks at celia maria was last out apparently he says i think we need a new maid celias frown deepens merrial comes up to me he sits down gently on my right knee oh shit oh shit oh shit totally fucking wrong about all the above oh fuck here it comes he smiles at me this is on account kenneth he says easily in a pleasant voice nothing compared to whatll follow i should think but this is personal from me for invading my privacy he takes a good back swing and punches me hard in the balls id forgotten how much it hurt school playground last time this happened id forgotten the lights the nausea the waves and waves of subtly differing types of pain that course through your body when this is done to you not being able to double up properly just makes it worse it was as though your brain had stored up all the orgasms youd ever had in your whole life to that point then paid them back all in one go with the polarity reversed so that what had been ecstasy became agony and what had been over in seconds each day was lumped together over five or ten consecutive minutes of pure grisly pulsating pain i screamed loud and high and shrill then sucked and wheezed and gasped in the slowly slowly ebbing aftermath merrial had gone back to the bentley how fucking dare you celia said her voice sounded more menacing and cold than merrials had at any point so far i blinked through the tears and looked at her she was looking levelly gravely at merrial merrial looked back yes dear he said but it already sounded weak something in the way ceel had spoken had given her the initiative here how fucking dare you do that to him and make me watch it she breathed she walked across the pallets towards merrial kaj followed a step behind looking wary celia stopped a metre from her husband you have no right to do that she said her voice was shaking with controlled fury you have no right to make me witness it no right to make me part of it no right to make yourself the law and me no better than one of your fucking thugs she spat the last word out like a broken tooth merrial looked down briefly you know i dont like you using that sort of language celia he said calmly i am not one of your fucking gang she shouted at him he looked up blinking oh for christs sake he yelled back what do you think buys your jewellery your dresses the holidays im not stupid celia exploded im not a fool i know damn well mon dieu i thought i stupidly thought until tonight that i didnt get involved in this sort of thing she gestured behind towards me in return for me staying with you even though i know what you do what youve become merrial shook his head and pulled down his cuffs looking awkward but recovering his composure it was always like this ceel and as some further little part of me died along with hope i thought oh no oh no he calls her ceel he uses the same name for her that i do she clenched her fists in front of her shaking her head i did not marry this she said a sort of tumultuous control infecting her voice i married you i married a man who took me from a bad place and bad people and a bad thing inside myself a man who made me feel protected as well as desired she stood back and straightened up she looked down at him i will not stand for this john he looked down again youve been having an affair he told her quietly what she said and with that one word somehow and for only about the third or fourth time since id met her sounded like a frenchspeaker speaking english we have photographs more video he said looking down again he glanced to me then kaj she stared at him she shook her head slowly you have nothing she said quietly a silence followed i realised that somewhere in the black hollow distance somewhere through the ambient smell of decay there was a slow dripdripdrip noise nothing she repeated except paranoia he looked up at her she shook her head again my girlfriends she said slowly have boyfriends husbands brothers sometimes when we meet up one of them will get there just before or just after me before the others do dont think that a photograph of me sitting in harvey nics with a man you dont know constitutes an affair leave those people out of your sordid imaginings merrial looked from her to me celia frowned then glanced back at me with him she said and laughed she turned to look at me and stopped laughing looked serious mr nott no offence but i could do better none taken i managed to wheeze round the pain celia whirled round to face her husband again show me then show me what this evidence is merrial just smiled at her but the smile was strained and by then even i could see what shed sensed instantly he really didnt have any evidence on her hed been hoping to force a confession out of her with the accusation alone if a confession had been due celia fixed her gaze upon her husband then and took on a frosty look actually frosty didnt even start to cover it it was more of a shavingofadegreeaboveabsolutezero look it put the fear of god into me and i was only caught in the backwash of its baleful focus merrial withstood it somehow must have built up some sort of immunity over the years theyd been married i supposed but you could see he was affected some fuckwit part of me patently not in any way connected to my horribly bruised and still jangling testes almost felt sorry for the bastard i have been a faithful wife to you celia said in a measured contained utterly sure and certain voice i have always been faithful to you she said her voice breaking and sitting there right then goddammit even i believed her id have stood up in court or on any field of honour to insist with my last breath that this woman had been an utterly faithful wife and was being sorely grievously wronged and defamed by being accused of being anything else part of me found the time to wonder how the hell she was doing this and that was when it occurred to me that just possibly ceels patently lunatic ideas about entanglement were making a real and crucial difference here maybe at this moment she genuinely believed that she had been a faithful wife because in that other reality she claimed to be linked to she actually was she was speaking not so much for herself but for the celia on the other side of that divide the celia who was a perfectly unimpeachably good wife who had never cheated the celia who could rightly claim as she just had that she had always been faithful to her husband can you say the same to me john her voice was hollow as a vast canyon and as sad as the sound of earth hitting a tiny coffin merrial met her gaze drip drip drip in the distance i was breathing hard swallowing on a dry parched throat the smell of death and shit didnt seem quite so bad in the air around us now but maybe it was just something you got used to eventually merrial said of course i can say it celia that last shaving above zero kelvin vanished with a whimper into the darkness surrounding us do not treat me like a fool john celia said and her voice was like the voice a glacier would have if it could speak the voice of the oldest steepest widest most powerful mountaingrindingup glacier in all the fucking world after it had thought good and hard in glacier terms about precisely what it wanted to articulate merrial cleared his throat i didnt realise he must have looked away until he brought his gaze up to meet hers again with what looked like an appalling abysmally draining amount of effort you i want a divorce john she said fucking bombshell just like that merrial blinked the two of them stayed that way for a few moments him swinging one foot without realising it thunking against the trailing edge of the bentleys wheel arch her glaring down at him perfectly savagely still merrial glanced at kaj me and the other two guys before looking back to her i dont think here is really we talk about it here now celia said quickly you brought me here to see this you changed our rules you put cameras in my home her voice almost broke and she took a quick controlling breath so business and marriage are the same now she told him they are in the same arena i said i want a divorce merrial ground his teeth no he said she didnt react dear god this woman had perfected threatening stillness to a high art indeed merrial might be good but ceel would have made a brilliant crime boss merrial cleared his throat and lifted his head up to her again actually i want a divorce celia she tilted her head a little you do do you her voice was neutral now but sounded ready to slip into menace or accusation at any moment yes i need a divorce merrial gave an unhealthy looking little smile i dont like the term widower celia so i hope youll be as accommodating as i require you to be she laughed a quick convulsive laugh and what does that mean merrial looked just plain nasty now it means dont expect any money she gasped really gasped genuinely astonished i dont want your money john she told him there was a hint in her tone as though she had just realised she had been dealing with a child all along i didnt marry you for money i didnt want it then and i dont now keep the money have your divorce she was breathing hard now shoulders rising and falling in the yellow and black jacket her voice had quivered over the last few sentences barely under control so she said shaking her head once regaining command has one of them insisted you make an honest woman of her you might say that merrial said you could see he was having to force himself to keep looking at her battling against the pressure of that remorselessly selfpossessed gaze the one in amsterdam she asked evenly the one in amsterdam there was a strange sort of defiance in his tone and is she younger than i am john celia asked quietly is she more beautiful is she as young as i was when you met me or younger is she as exotic is she as foreign is she better connected has she a famous name has she money is she fertile merrials gaze might have flickered a little ceel relaxed her stance she stood back her weight went more on one foot than the other as she nodded ah she said she is pregnant is she merrials eyes went wide just for a moment then he gave a small laugh you always were good like that werent you celia he looked past his wife to the big blond guy isnt she kaj kaj just looked awkward and nodded well congratulations celia said bitterly she seemed suddenly to collapse inside then looking quickly away and putting one hand up to her eyes silently her shoulders wide inside the thick yellow and black hiking jacket shook spasming once twice three times merrial looked even more awkward and uncertain he seemed to be about to go to her and hug her but he didnt he tried to find something to do with his hands and then folded his arms and looked at kaj and did a sort of pathetic women eh look and gesture at the bigger man kaj sort of twitched which was probably as close as he was going to come to waxing eloquent on the matter you beautiful brave intelligent fabulous woman i thought staring at her with tears in my eyes i had to look away in case merrial saw the way i was gazing at his wife i was still having to remind myself that the extraordinary exquisite immaculately righteous ire she was displaying here was all in fact a complete fake that she was lying through her perfect delicious teeth when she told merrial shed been a faithful wife but she had successfully so far anyway shifted the focus of all that was going on here away from me and onto herself onto her marriage shed gone nuclear with the big d word and duly been nuked in return but it looked like she was actually getting away with it this was a woman fighting for her own life and that of her lover but she wasnt settling for just the result she seemed determined to accomplish the task with audacity bravura and style i didnt think id seen a more resourceful and courageous piece of acting in all my life in person on stage or on screen even if it still all went horribly painfully lethally wrong from here on in at least i could suffer and die knowing i had been in the presence of genius celia dried her eyes with one hand then fetched a handkerchief from one of the pockets in her jeans and dabbed at her nose and cheeks she sniffed and put the hanky away again she drew herself up i dont want any money and i wont say anything to the press the police to anybody i never have i never will but i want to be left alone afterwards i want to live my own life you live yours i live mine and nothing must happen to any of my family any of my loved ones she raised her chin to him after she said this as though defying him to object to any of it merrial nodded then said softly fair enough he made a small gesture with his hands im sorry it had to end like this celia im sorry it had to be so bloody undignified in front of kaj and these guys and she gestured vaguely in my direction this poor clown merrial looked at me like hed forgotten i was there he sighed i thought he began then he shrugged he fixed me with a stare i shrank back from one word on your show about this mr nott one word to anybody at all friends or family or police or public and ill make sure you die slowly do you understand i swallowed nodded i didnt trust myself to say anything sensible the fuckwit bit of me with its thumb seemingly superglued to my personal selfdestruct button wanted to say something like yeah yeah yeah fucking omertà or i die in drawnout agony yada yada yada big man but your wifes just worked you over and we both fucking know it and this compensatory macho threat stuff isnt convincing anybody eventually though under that gaze i had to give way and croak yeah yes i understand nothing nobody merrial kept looking at me for a moment longer then nodded to the two guys standing at my shoulders give him back his stuff and take him back to where you found him in the box mr m said the guy whod hit me merrial looked upset no not in the fucking box in the back of the van put some tape over his eyes thatll do i thought yes but just a tad too soon kaj stepped past celia lowered his mouth to his bosss ear and muttered something merrial smiled that thin thin smile of his and quietly said all right one little one then as i thought no no no we got away with it this isnt supposed to happen please no merrial looked at celia and sighed and said maybe youd best look away celia rolled her eyes and did so kaj stood in front of me this is for crapping in my loo he said i had just enough time to think now the cunt sounds vaguely swedish then he punched me so hard across the face i didnt wake up until i was in the back of the astramax again eyes taped over and hands tied together but otherwise unrestricted my head and my balls hurt like fuck blood was bubbling from my nose my pants were full of chilled shit and i was very cold indeed a bitter winter breeze was whipping through the van from the open front windows i didnt blame the guys it was reeking in here thirteen the scottish verdict what the fucking hell happened to you i walked into a door right would some stairs be involved at any point thats right then i fell down some stairs and after that then somebody beat the shit out of me craig that must have taken a while were they working shifts now that has got to smart philip if i live for a thousand years smart is not a word i will ever choose to associate with how i came to acquire this little lot good your brain and tongue are still working debbie wants to see us after the show and the first record up is addictas new one with jo on joint lead vocals na looking for sympathy doesnt get any more efficient with a black eye good try though oh my good lord almighty get yourself in here kennit you need tendin to fackin ell man you white guys go brilliant colours anonymous yes dont forget to wipe your phones last calls made and received memories just in case ive tidied everything at this end already done id destroyed the calling card with the incriminating code number on it too though now ill have to do this one of course celia what kenneth thank you you were brilliant you saved my miserable life it was my pleasure i love you still are you sure i do i mean it well thank you kenneth what happens now i have to pay the woman who was our maid some money to compensate her for her dismissal thats not what i meant i know so so well wait for what for a package and a phone call so ill see you again i can hear you are smiling as you say that yes ditto kid and will i see you again after this next time i would hope so you know it will not be the same though dont you it can never be the same again i know but maybe it can be better john has started divorce proceedings he is in amsterdam most of the time now so can we meet up soon i need to be very careful still but i hope so soon i must go im sorry ceel about getting us both into that mess good came of it never do its like again i pro i must go my love mise hey wait did you say there is this verdict which is unique as far as i know to the scottish legal system and remained distinct from the english one even for the three centuries of the full union with the rest of the uk its called not proven it means that the jury isnt going to go as far as pronouncing the defendant not guilty but that the prosecuting authorities simply have not proved their case its a funny verdict because you still leave the court a free man or woman with no criminal record well unless you had one before of course though people friends and family the community at large may remember and the implications of that neitheronethingnortheother verdict might well live with you for the rest of your life there have been moves to get rid of it to adopt the binary choice of guilty or not guilty but i think thats a mistake if i was on a jury i would never agree to a not proven verdict for somebody i basically thought was guilty but i would go as far as not proven for somebody i would otherwise have found just plain not guilty and who i thought ought not to be punished beyond the implications of that debatable verdict itself because thats what it is a semipunishment a sort of warning a conditional discharge that is remarkably in the gift of the jury not the judge i think its worth keeping for that alone ive wondered for many months now if that was the judgement john merrial recorded in the personal courtroom he kept in his head if he still suspected there was something more going on somewhere just with me or even between me and celia i dont know i cant decide not proven it would do its one of those odd concepts that the more you think about it the more it seems applicable within all sorts of other contexts besides the one it originated in my whole radio career for example feels like it has been not proven actually its been guilty loads of times whenever i got fired again but overall im still claiming the not proven thing scotland the uk devolution more british more european not proven and celia and me not proven i never did get that package and that phone call instead she decided we ought to start meeting in public she suggested the british museum the first time the room that held the pergamum altar this was in march in front of that vast white towering edifice of imperial plunder we met nodded shook hands then went for coffee in the museums café she asked how i was and i said i was recovering she apologised for her husbands behaviour hurting me as he had and i apologised for mine entering her home without permission we talked as though playing parts then parted with another handshake i slipped the folded piece of paper shed passed during the handshake into my pocket and met her in the sanderson the next afternoon the sex hurt me not her obviously but it was still great we started to meet up more often through the spring and into the summer while mr m set up his operating base in amsterdam and the divorce proceedings slid smoothly along and his new fiancée blossomed we met in public as friends in private less often as the lovers we had always been one day in june she kissed me on the cheek as she left the bar and the following week brushed her lips with mine as she got out of the taxi after dinner a fortnight later we went to clout dancing and kissed on the dance floor and later in a shady booth in the retox bar it was late july before she came to the temple belle and stayed overnight so that i finally got to spend a whole night with her and wake up with her we never did discover if anybody had been watching but the risk had not been worth taking i still worry that one day merrial will wake up and just somehow know that of course celia and i had been lovers back then when it seemed he had suspected we might be and still take his revenge but ceel seems quite sanguine about this john thinks i am too proper and too concerned with fairness she told me paying off maria and meeting you to apologise for all that happened appear like symptoms of an amusing obsession to him he thinks that i am going out with you to spite him that i am deliberately or subconsciously taking what he suspected wrongly and making it true just to punish him so he believes that what you and i have together is about him not us which pleases his ego and he thinks that i am deceiving myself over my motives in seeing you in the first place which he also finds a comfort i frowned you sure about this but of course i can see what he thinks and i know how to make him think certain things i thought about this and an appalling thought occurred to me you cant do the same with me can you celia laughed lightly squeezed my hand and said what could possibly make you think that i had no real answer so anyway i think were safe but still not proven another of my worries was that what we had between us would all have changed too much that we had only ever existed as the fervently coupled entity we had been as a sort of twoperson sexual freak exquisite and fine in the rarefied hothouse atmosphere of those episodically connected lilyscented hotel rooms but utterly unsuited to the rest of life to the daytodayness of mundane existence where such a delicate bloom would shrivel and die in the light of the commonplace maybe we had nothing more to say to each other than what we had already said with our minds and our bodies in those intense darknesses perhaps we both had habits idiosyncrasies that the other had never experienced because until then in the erratically dispersed and limited intervals wed been able to claim inside those tropically lush realitydivorced suites wed been too busy having sex to exhibit any other behaviours so she discovered that i snored if id been drinking and then slept on my back im sure theres a lot more but i trust her to tell me what i found was that try as she might she could not resist slipping into rapidfire martiniquestyle french patois whenever she was with her relations or talked to them over the phone oh and when she had a cold once she was a rotten patient she whined and overdramatised like a man she claims this is because she practically never gets ill and so has had no practice thats about it well that and the craziness about being entangled her twentyeighth birthday had come and gone without incident or appreciable change and she had seemed vaguely distractedly disappointed for a day or so then had shrugged it off and got on with things how can you just give up on all that id protested how can you just let it drop i thought you really believed in all that crap ceel had shrugged i think perhaps that the crossover point came earlier than it was meant to shed said frowning in that underground car park it was meant to happen on my birthday but it happened then instead that was a strong event it pulled matters towards it distorting things sufficiently shed nodded as if coming to a decision and smiled at me radiantly yes id shaken my head the ironic thing was that now sometimes i had dreams and nightmares in which i was the entangled one and caught terrifying glimpses into another reality where i hobbled round on crutches a broken man and never saw celia again or id wake panting from images of my own decaying body a space of rotting flesh curled fetal within a concrete mould inside a waterlogged packing case resting on the bottom of the thames downstream and in any case celia still thought she was entangled provisional so one of us both of us neither me id tick option c there but who the hell really knew not proven if you liked i never went back to the house in ascot square celia slept aboard the temple belle maybe once a week craig and i became friends again though we were kind of starting from scratch emma was probably the most okay about it nikki found out about me and her mum and gave me a glare i will remember to the end of my days ken she said relenting and shaking her head ruefully what are you like they all think ceels wonderful ed does too the first time he laid eyes on her he immediately said leave im be mine ill give up all the uvvers an i mean for ever plobly celia smiled and said you must be edward how do you do later that evening when she was out of earshot i asked him you like her then think i should stick with this one i was trying to be funny but he looked at me pityingly and said mate i dont fink its a question of you decidin to stick wif er even now sometimes hell just stare at the two of us and shake his head and look at me and say ow i suppose hes right i dont make a big thing of it but i have told ceel i love her while she doesnt so much tell me as let it slip rarely about the only time i ever see her get flustered or embarrassed is when she says something like she said that first time over the phone and calls me my love or something similar i asked her about this one night when we were particularly relaxed and easy with things and she just smiled and suggested that love was a word that had become cheapened where love is concerned she told me you must be a behaviourist i thought about this and decided well i feel loved so not proven maybe no relationship that is not over is ever really proven one way or the other perhaps thats all we can ever hope for in this fractured fallen world weve constructed for ourselves and our heirs addicta became very big indeed and jos face seemed to be everywhere but thankfully then they or their management decided they had to crack the states and they did the risingwithouttrace thing and effectively disappeared off most peoples nearspace radar screens i kept my job amazingly the month before we were due to go to martinique we flew to glasgow all celia had really seen of scotland was this fucking bleak estate and draughty castle near inverness and closeups of the heads of stags and hinds through a telescope before some other bugger shot them and i wanted to start showing her the rest of the place in all its latesummer glory we had a week would hire a car stay in b bs we spent some time shopping and wandering around glasgow during that first day before we went back to my parents place for dinner and in a sudden shower dodging traffic we ran across renfield street holding hands iain banks
