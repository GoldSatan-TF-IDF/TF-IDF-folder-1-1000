robin cook blindsight to david and laurel and their new life together acknowledgments i would like to thank the dade county medical examiners office for putting up with me for a week and particularly dr charles wetli whose patience talking with someone trained in ophthalmology and surgery instead of forensic pathology was extraordinary i would also like to thank dr charles hirsch chief medical examiner for the city of new york for his hospitality and dr jackie lee for her willingness to share a glimpse into the more personal side of forensic pathology last but not least i would like to thank jean reeds whose intuitive sense of psychology makes her support advice and criticism inordinately valuable the cocaine shot into duncan andrews antecubital vein in a concentrated bolus after having been propelled by the plunger of a syringe chemical alarms sounded immediately a number of the blood cells and plasma enzymes recognized the cocaine molecules as being part of a family of compounds called alkaloids which are manufactured by plants and include such physiologically active substances as caffeine morphine strychnine and nicotine in a desperate but vain attempt to protect the body from this sudden invasion plasma enzymes called cholesterases attacked the cocaine splitting some of the foreign molecules into physiologically inert fragments but the cocaine dose was overwhelming within seconds the cocaine was streaking through the right side of the heart spreading through the lungs and then heading out into duncan s body the pharmacologic effects of the drug began almost instantly some of the cocaine molecules tumbled into the coronary arteries and began constricting them and reducing blood flow to the heart at the same time the cocaine began to diffuse out of the coronary vessels into the extracellular fluid bathing the hardworking heart muscle fibers there the foreign compound began to interrupt the movement of sodium ions through the heart cells membranes a critical part of the heart muscle contractile function the result was that cardiac conductivity and contractility began to fall simultaneously the cocaine molecules fanned out throughout the brain having coursed up into the skull through the carotid arteries like knives through butter the cocaine penetrated the blood brain barrier once inside the brain the cocaine bathed the defenseless brain cells pooling in spaces called synapses across which the nerve cells communicated within the synapses the cocaine began to exert its most perverse effects it became an impersonator by an ironic twist of chemical fate an outer portion of the cocaine molecule was erroneously recognized by the nerve cells as a neurotransmitter either epinephrine norepinephrine or dopamine like skeleton keys the cocaine molecules insinuated themselves into the molecular pumps responsible for absorbing these neurotransmitters locking them and bringing the pumps to a sudden halt the result was predictable since the reabsorption of the neurotransmitters was blocked the neurotransmitters stimulative effect was preserved and the stimulation caused the release of more neurotransmitters in an upward spiral of selffulfilling excitation nerve cells that would have normally reverted to quiescence and serenity began to fire frantically the brain progressively brimmed with activity particularly the pleasure centers deeply embedded below the cerebral cortex here dopamine was the principal neurotransmitter with a perverse predilection the cocaine blocked the dopamine pumps and the dopamine concentration soared circuits of nerve cells divinely wired to ensure the survival of the species rang with excitement and filled afferent pathways running up to the cortex with ecstatic messages but the pleasure centers were not the only areas of duncan s brain to be affected just some of the first soon the darker side of the cocaine invasion began to exert its effect phylogenetically older more caudal centers of the brain involving functions like muscle coordination and the regulation of breathing began to be affected even the thermoregulatory area began to be stimulated as well as the part of the brain responsible for vomiting thus all was not well in the middle of the rush of pleasurable impulses an ominous condition was in the making a dark cloud was forming on the horizon auguring a horrible neurological storm the cocaine was about to reveal its true deceitful self a minion of death disguised in an aura of beguiling pleasure prologue duncan andrews mind was racing like a runaway train only a moment ago hed been in a groggy drugged stupor within seconds his dizziness and lethargy had evaporated like a drip of water falling onto a sizzling skillet a rush of exhilaration and energy consumed him making him feel suddenly powerful it was as if he could do anything in a glow of new clarity he understood he was infinitely stronger and smarter than hed ever realized but just as he was beginning to savor this cascade of euphoric thoughts and this enlightened view of his abilities he began to feel overwhelmed by intense waves of pleasure he could define only as pure ecstasy he would have shouted for joy if only his mouth could form the proper words but he couldnt speak thoughts and feelings were reverberating in his mind too rapidly to vocalize any fear or misgivings he had been feeling only minutes ago melted in this newfound rapture and delight but like his torpor the pleasure was shortlived the blissful smile that had formed on duncan s face twisted into a grimace of terror and panic a voice called out that the people he feared were returning his eyes darted around the room he saw no one yet the voice continued its message quickly he looked over his shoulder into the kitchen it was empty turning his head he looked down the hallway toward the bedroom no one was there but the voice remained now it was whispering a more dire prediction he was going to die who are you duncan screamed he put his hands over his ears as if to block the sound out where are you how did you get in here his eyes again raced searchingly about the room the voice didnt answer duncan didnt know it was coming from inside his head duncan struggled to his feet he was surprised to realize hed been on his living room floor as he rose his shoulder bumped against the coffee table the syringe that had so recently been in his arm clattered to the floor duncan stared at it with hatred and regret then reached for it to crush it between his fingers duncan s hand stopped just short of the syringe his eyes opened wide with confusion mixed with a new fear all at once he could feel the unmistakable itch of hundreds of insects crawling on the skin of his arms forgetting the syringe duncan held out his hands with his palms up he could feel the bugs squirming all over his forearms but no matter how hard he searched he couldnt see them his skin appeared perfectly clear then the itch spread to his legs ahhhhhh duncan screamed he tried to wipe his arms guessing the insects were too small to be seen but the itching only got worse with a shiver of profound fear it dawned on him that the organisms had to be under his skin somehow they had invaded his body perhaps they had been in the syringe using his fingernails duncan began to scratch his arms in a frantic attempt to allow the insects to escape they were eating him from within desperately he scratched harder digging his nails into his skin until he drew blood the pain was intense but the itching of the insects was worse despite the terror of the insects duncan stopped his scratching as he became aware of a new symptom holding up his bloodied hand he noticed that he was shaking looking down at himself he saw that his whole body was shaking and the tremors were getting worse for a brief instant he thought about calling for help but as the thought crossed his mind he noticed something else he was warm no he was hot my god duncan managed when he realized that sweat was pouring from his face with a trembling hand he felt his forehead he was burning up he tried to unbutton his shirt but his tremulous hands were incapable impatient and desperate he ripped the shirt open and off buttons flew in all directions he did the same with his pants throwing them to the floor but it was to no avail clad only in his undershorts he still felt suffocatingly hot then without a moments warning he coughed choked and vomited in a forceful stream spattering the wall below his signed dali lithograph duncan staggered into his bathroom through sheer force of will he got his shaking body into the shower and turned on the cold tap full force gasping for breath he stood beneath the cascade of frigid water duncan s relief was brief involuntarily a pitiful cry escaped from his lips and his breathing became labored as a whitehot pain stabbed into his left chest and ripped down the inside of his left arm intuitively duncan knew he was having a heart attack duncan clutched his chest with his right hand blood from his abraded arms mixed with water from the shower and swirled down the drain halffalling and halfstaggering duncan stumbled from the bathroom and headed for the door of his apartment never mind that he was near naked he needed air his broiling brain was about to explode using his final reserve of strength he gripped the knob to his front door and yanked it open duncan sara wetherbee cried she couldnt have been more startled her hand was poised inches from duncan s door she had been about to knock when duncan yanked it open and confronted her he was clad in nothing but soggy jockey shorts my god cried sara whats happened to you duncan did not recognize his lover of two and a half years what he needed was air the crushing pain in his chest had spread throughout his lungs it felt as if he were being stabbed over and over again blindly he lurched forward reaching out to sweep sara from his path duncan sara cried again as she took in his near nakedness the bleeding scratches on his arms his wild dilated eyes and the grimace of pain on his face refusing to be thrust aside she grabbed his shoulders and restrained him whats the matter where are you going duncan hesitated for a brief moment saras voice penetrated his dementia his mouth opened as if he were about to speak but no words came instead he uttered a pitiful whine that ended in a gasp as his tremors coalesced into spasmodic jerks and his eyes disappeared up inside his head mercifully unconscious duncan collapsed into saras arms at first sara struggled vainly to hold duncan upright but she was unable to support him especially since duncan s jerks became progressively more violent as gently as possible sara let duncan s writhing body fall across the threshold half into the hall almost the moment he touched the floor duncan s back arched up and his jerks rapidly coalesced into the rhythmical throes of a grand mal seizure help sara screamed as she glanced up and down the hall as she might have expected no one appeared aside from the noise duncan was making all she could hear was the percussive thump of a nearby stereo desperate for help sara managed to step over duncan s convulsing and incontinent body a glimpse of his bloody and foaming mouth appalled and frightened her she desperately wanted to help but she didnt know what to do save for calling an ambulance with a trembling finger she punched on duncan s living room phone as she impatiently waited for the connection to go through she could hear duncan s head repeatedly thump against the hardwood floor all she could do was wince with each sickening sound and pray that help would be there soon pulling her hands away from her face sara checked her watch it was almost three oclock in the morning shed been sitting on the same vinyl seat in the waiting room of the manhattan general hospital for over three hours for the umpteenth time she scanned the crowded room that smelled of cigarette smoke sweat alcohol and wet wool there was a large sign directly opposite her that read no smoking but the notice was roundly ignored the injured mixed with those whod accompanied them there were wailing infants and toddlers battered drunks others clutching a towel to a cut finger or slashed chin most stared blankly ahead inured to the endless wait some were obviously sick others even in pain one rather well dressed man had his arm around his equally well dressed female companion only minutes before hed been arguing heatedly with a rather intimidatingly large triage nurse who hadnt been ruffled by his threats to call his lawyer if his companion were not seen immediately resigned at last he too stared vacantly into the middle distance closing her eyes again sara could still feel her pulse hammering at her temples the vivid image of duncan convulsing on the threshold of his apartment haunted her whatever happened tonight she knew she would never banish the vision from her mind after having called the ambulance and given duncan s address sara had returned to duncan s side somewhere in the back of her mind shed remembered that something should be put in a convulsing persons mouth to keep him from biting his tongue but try as she might shed not been able to pry apart duncan s clenched teeth just before the emts arrived duncan finally stopped convulsing at first sara had been relieved but then she noticed with renewed alarm that he was not breathing wiping the foam and a bit of blood from his mouth she tried to give him mouthtomouth resuscitation but she found herself fighting nausea by then some of duncan s hallway neighbors had appeared to saras relief one man said hed been a corpsman in the navy and he and a companion graciously took over the cpr until the emts arrived sara could not imagine what had happened to duncan only an hour earlier hed called her and had asked her to come over she thought hed sounded a little tense and strange but even so shed been totally unprepared for his state once she got there she shuddered again as she saw him standing before her in the doorway with his bloodied hands and arms and his dilated wild eyes it was as if hed gone insane saras last glimpse of duncan came after theyd arrived at the manhattan general the emts had allowed her to ride in the ambulance throughout the whole hairraising trip theyd maintained the cpr the last shed seen of duncan was when hed been rolled through a pair of white swinging doors disappearing into the inner recesses of the emergency unit sara could still see the emt kneeling on top of the gurney and continuing the chest compressions as the doors swung closed sara wetherbee a voice asked rousing sara from her reverie yes sara said as she looked up a young doctor sporting a heavy five oclock shadow and a white coat slightly splattered with blood had materialized in front of her im dr murray he said would you mind coming with me id like to talk with you for a moment of course sara said nervously she got to her feet and pulled her purse high on her shoulder she hurried after dr murray whod turned on his heels almost before shed had a chance to respond the same white doors that had swallowed duncan three hours before closed behind her dr murray had stopped just inside and turned to face her she anxiously looked into the mans eyes he was exhausted she wanted to see some glimmer of hope but there wasnt any i understand you are mr andrews girlfriend dr murray said even his voice sounded tired sara nodded normally we talk to the family first dr murray said but i know you came in with the patient and have been waiting im sorry it has taken so long to get back to you but several gunshot victims came in right after mr andrews i understand sara said how is duncan she had to ask even though she wasnt sure she wanted to know not so good dr murray said you can be sure our emts tried everything but im afraid duncan passed away anyway unfortunately he was doa dead on arrival im sorry sara stared into dr murrays eyes she wanted to see a glint of the same sorrow that was welling up inside of her but all she saw was fatigue his apparent lack of feeling helped her maintain her own composure what happened she asked almost in a whisper were ninety percent sure that the immediate cause was a massive myocardial infarction or heart attack dr murray said obviously more comfortable with his medical jargon but the proximate cause appears to be drug toxicity or overdose we dont know yet what his blood level was that takes a bit more time drugs sara said with disbelief what kind of drug cocaine said dr murray the emts even brought in the needle hed used i never knew duncan used cocaine sara said he said he didnt use drugs people always lie about sex and drugs dr murray said and with cocaine sometimes it only takes once people dont realize how deadly the stuff can be its popularity has lulled people into a false sense of security be that as it may we do have to get in touch with the family would you know the telephone number stunned by duncan s death and the revelation about his apparent cocaine use sara recited the andrews phone number in a dazed monotone thinking about drugs allowed her to avoid thinking about death she wondered how long duncan had been on cocaine it was all so hard to understand shed thought shed known him so well november am monday new york city the alarm of the old westclox windup never failed to yank laurie montgomery from the depths of blessed sleep even though shed had the clock since the first year of college shed never become accustomed to its fearful clatter it always woke her up with a start and shed invariably lunge for the cursed contraption as if her life depended on her getting the alarm shut off as soon as humanly possible this rainy november morning proved no exception as she replaced the clock on the windowsill she could feel her heart thumping it was the squirt of adrenaline that made the daily episode so effective even if she could have gone back to bed shed never have gotten back to sleep and it was the same for tom her oneandahalfyearold halfwild tawny tabby who at the sound of the alarm had fled into the depths of her closet resigned to the start of another day laurie stood up wiggled her toes into her sheepskin slippers and turned on the tv to the local morning news her apartment was a small onebedroom affair on nineteenth street between first and second avenues in a sixstory tenement her rooms were on the fifth floor in the rear her two windows faced out onto a warren of overgrown backyards in her tiny kitchen she turned on her coffee machine the night before shed prepared it with a packet of coffee and the right amount of water with the coffee started she padded into the bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror ugh she said as she turned her face from side to side viewing the damage of another night with not enough sleep her eyes were puffy and red laurie was not a morning person she was a confirmed night owl and frequently read until all hours she loved to read whether the book was a ponderous pathology text or a popular bestseller when it came to fiction her interests were catholic her shelves were crammed with everything from thrillers to romantic sagas to history general science and even psychology the night before it had been a murder mystery and shed read until shed finished the book when shed turned out the light shed not had the courage to look at the time as usual in the morning she vowed never to stay up so late again in the shower lauries mind began to clear enough to start going over the problems that she would have to address that day she was currently in her fifth month as an associate medical examiner at the office of the chief medical examiner for the city of new york the preceding weekend laurie had been on call which meant that she worked both saturday and sunday shed performed six autopsies three one day and three the next a number of these cases required additional followup before they could be signed out and she began making a mental list of what she had to do stepping out of the shower laurie dried herself briskly one thing she was thankful about was that today would be a paper day for her meaning that she would not be assigned any additional autopsies instead she would have the time to do the necessary paperwork on the autopsies that shed already done she was currently waiting for material on about twenty cases from either the lab the medical examiner investigators local hospitals or local doctors or the police it was this avalanche of paperwork that constantly threatened to overwhelm her back in the kitchen laurie prepared her coffee then carrying her mug she retreated to the bathroom to put on makeup and blowdry her hair her hair always took the longest it was thick and long and of an auburn color with red highlights she liked to burnish with henna once a month laurie was proud of her hair she thought it was her best feature her mother was always encouraging her to cut it but laurie liked to keep it beyond shoulder length and wear it in a braid or piled on top of her head as for makeup laurie always subscribed to the theory that less is more a bit of eyeliner to line her bluegreen eyes a few strokes with an eyebrow pencil to define her light reddish blond eyebrows and a brief application of mascara and she was nearly done a dab of coral blush and lipstick completed the routine satisfied she took her mug and retreated to the bedroom by then good morning america was on she listened with half an ear as she put on the clothes she had laid out the night before forensic pathology was still largely a mans world but that only made laurie want to emphasize her femininity with her dress she slipped into a green skirt and matching turtleneck eyeing herself in the mirror she was pleased shed not worn this particular outfit before somehow it made her look taller than her actual height of five foot five and even slimmer than her hundred and fifteen pounds with her coffee drunk a yogurt eaten and dried cat food poured into toms bowl laurie struggled into her trench coat she then grabbed her purse her lunch which she had also prepared the night before and her briefcase and stepped out of her apartment it took her a moment to secure the collection of locks on her door a legacy of the apartments previous tenant turning to the elevator laurie pushed the down button as if on cue the moment the aged elevator began its whining ascent laurie heard the click of debra englers locks turning her head laurie watched as the door to the front apartment opened a crack and its safety chain was pulled taut debras bloodshot eye peered out at her above the eye was a tousle of gray frizzy hair laurie aggressively stared back at the intruding eye it was as if debra hovered behind her door for any sound in the hallway the repetitive intrusion grated on lauries nerves it seemed like a violation of her privacy despite the fact that the hallway was a common area better take an umbrella debra said in her throaty smokers voice the fact that debra was right only fanned lauries irritation she had indeed forgotten her umbrella without giving debra any sense of acknowledgment lest her irritating watchfulness be encouraged laurie turned back to her door and went through the complicated sequence of undoing the locks five minutes later as she stepped into the elevator she saw that debras bloodshot eye was still watching intently as the elevator slowly descended lauries irritation faded her thoughts turned to the case that had bothered her most over the weekend the twelveyearold boy hit in the chest with a softball lifes not fair laurie muttered under her breath as she thought about the boys untimely death childrens deaths were so hard to comprehend somehow shed thought medical school would inure her to such senselessness but it hadnt neither had a pathology residency and now that she was in forensics these deaths were even harder to take and there were so many of them up until the accident the softball victim had been a healthy child brimming with health and vitality she could still see his little body on the autopsy table a picture of health ostensibly asleep yet laurie had had to pick up the scalpel and gut him like a fish laurie swallowed hard as the elevator came to a bumping stop cases like this little boy made her question her career choice she wondered if she shouldnt have gone into pediatrics where she could have dealt with living children the field of medicine shed chosen could be grim in spite of herself laurie was grateful for debras admonition once she saw what kind of day it was the wind was blowing in strong gusts and the promised rain had already started the view of her street that particular day made her question her choice of location as well as her career the garbagestrewn street was not a pretty sight maybe she should have gone to a newer cleaner city like atlanta or a city of perpetual summer like miami laurie opened her umbrella and leaned into the wind as she trudged toward first avenue as she walked she thought of one of the ironies of her career choice shed chosen pathology for a number of reasons for one thing she thought that predictable hours would make it easier to combine medicine with having a family but the problem was she didnt have a family unless she considered her parents but they didnt really count in fact she didnt even have a meaningful relationship laurie had never thought that by age thirtytwo she wouldnt have children of her own much less that shed still be single a short cab ride with a driver whose nationality she could not even guess brought her to the corner of first and thirtieth shed been shocked to get the cab under normal circumstances a combination of rain and rush hour meant no taxis this morning however someone had been getting out of a cab just as she reached first avenue yet even if shed not been able to get one it wouldnt have been a disaster that was one of the benefits of living just eleven blocks away from work many a day she walked in both directions after paying her fare laurie started up the front steps of the office of the chief medical examiner for the city of new york the sixstory building was overshadowed by the rest of the new york university medical center and the bellevue hospital complex its facade was constructed of blueglazed brick with aluminum windows and door casements of an unattractive modern design normally laurie paid no attention to the building but on this particular rainy november monday it wasnt spared her critical review any more than her career or her street the place was depressing she had to admit that she was shaking her head wondering if an architect could have been genuinely pleased by his handiwork when she noticed that the foyer was packed the front door was propped open despite the morning chill and cigarette smoke could be seen languidly issuing forth curious laurie pushed into the crowd making her way with some difficulty toward the id room marlene wilson the usual receptionist was obviously overwhelmed as at least a dozen people pressed against her desk as they plied her with questions the media had invaded complete with cameras tape recorders tv camcorders and flashing lights clearly something out of the ordinary had happened after a brief pantomime to get marlenes attention laurie managed to get herself buzzed into the inner area she experienced a mild sense of relief when the closing door extinguished the babble of voices and the acrid cigarette smoke pausing to glance into the drab room where family members were taken to identify the deceased laurie was mildly surprised to find it empty with all the commotion in the outer area she thought shed see people in the id room shrugging her shoulders she proceeded into the id office the first person laurie confronted was vinnie amendola one of the mortuary techs oblivious to the pandemonium in the reception area vinnie was drinking coffee from a styrofoam cup and studying the sports pages of the new york post his feet were propped up on the edge of one of the gray metal desks as usual before eight in the morning vinnie was the only person in the room it was his job to make the coffee for the coffee pool a large commercialstyle coffeemaker was in the id office a room that served a number of functions including an informal morning congregation area what on earth is going on laurie asked as she picked up the days autopsy schedule even though she wasnt scheduled for any autopsies she was always curious to see what cases had come in vinnie lowered his paper trouble he said what kind of trouble laurie asked through the doorway leading to the communications room she could see that the two dayshift secretaries were busy on their phones the panels in front of them were blinking with waiting calls laurie poured herself a cup of coffee another preppy murder case vinnie said a teenage girl apparently strangled by her boyfriend sex and drugs you know rich kids happened over near the tavern on the green with all the excitement that first case caused a couple of years ago the media has been here from the moment the body was brought in laurie clucked her tongue how awful for everyone a life lost and a life ruined she added sugar and a touch of cream to her coffee whos handling it dr plodgett vinnie said he was called by the tour doctor and he had to go out to the scene it was around three in the morning laurie sighed oh boy she muttered she felt sorry for paul handling such a case would most likely be stressful for him because he was relatively inexperienced like herself hed been an associate medical examiner for just over a year laurie had been there for only four and a half months wheres paul now up in his office nope vinnie said hes in doing the autopsy already laurie questioned why the rush beats me vinnie said but the guys going off the graveyard shift told me that bingham came in around six paul must have called him this case gets more intriguing by the minute laurie said dr harold bingham age fiftyeight was the chief medical examiner of new york city a position that made him a powerful figure in the forensic world i think ill duck into the pit and see whats happening id be careful if i were you vinnie said struggling to fold his paper i was thinking of going in there myself but the word is that bingham is in a foul mood not that thats so out of the ordinary laurie nodded to vinnie as she left the room to avoid the mass of reporters in the reception area she took the long route to the elevators walking through communications the secretaries were too busy to say hello laurie waved to one of the two police detectives assigned to the medical examiners office who was sitting in his cubbyhole office off the communications room he too was on the phone after going through another doorway laurie glanced into each of the forensic medical investigators offices to say good morning but no one was in yet reaching the main elevators she pushed the up button and as usual had to wait while the aged machine slowly responded looking down the hall to her right she could see the mass of reporters seething in the reception area laurie felt sorry for poor marlene wilson as she rode up to her office on the fifth floor laurie thought about the meaning of binghams early presence not only at the office but also in the autopsy room both occurrences were rare and they fanned her curiosity since her officemate dr riva mehta was not yet in laurie spent only minutes in her office she locked her briefcase purse and lunch in her file cabinet then changed into green scrub clothes since she wasnt going to do an autopsy herself she didnt bother putting on her usual second layer of protective impervious clothing back in the elevator laurie descended to the basement level where the morgue was located this was not a basement in the true sense because it was actually the street level from the buildings thirtieth street side a loading dock from thirtieth street was the route bodies arrived and left the morgue in the locker room which she rarely used as such preferring to change in her office laurie got shoe covers apron mask and hood thus dressed as if she were about to perform surgery she pushed through the door into the autopsy room the pit as it was lovingly called was a mediumsized room about fifty feet long and thirty feet wide at one time it had been considered state of the art but no longer like so many other city agencies its muchneeded upkeep and modernization had suffered from lack of funds the eight stainless steel tables were old and stained from countless postmortems oldfashioned springloaded scales hung over each table a series of sinks countertops xray view boxes ancient glassfronted cabinets and exposed piping lined the walls there were no windows only one table was in use the second from the end to lauries right as the door closed behind laurie all three gowned masked and hooded doctors grouped around the table raised their heads to stare at her for a moment before returning to their grisly task stretched out on the table was the ivorycolored nude body of a teenage girl she was illuminated by a single bank of bluewhite fluorescent bulbs directly overhead the lurid scene was made worse by the sucking noise of water swirling down a drain at the foot of the table laurie felt a strong intuition she should turn around and leave but she fought the feeling instead she advanced on the group knowing the people as well as she did she recognized each despite their coverings which included goggles as well as masks bingham was on the opposite side of the table facing laurie he was a stocky man of short stature with thick features and a bulbous nose goddamn it paul bingham snapped is this the first time youve done a neck dissection ive got a news conference scheduled and youre mucking around like a firstyear medical student give me that scalpel bingham snatched the instrument from pauls hand then bent over the body a ray of light glinted off the stainless steel cutting edge laurie stepped up to the table she was to pauls right sensing her presence he turned his head and for an instant their eyes met laurie could tell he was already distraught she tried to project some support with her gaze but paul averted his head laurie glanced at the morgue tech who avoided looking her way the atmosphere was explosive lowering her eyes laurie watched what bingham was doing the patients neck had been opened with a somewhat outdated incision that ran from the point of the chin to the top of the breastbone the skin had been flayed and spread to the side like opening a highnecked blouse bingham was in the process of freeing the muscles from around the thyroid cartilage and the hyoid bone laurie could see evidence of premortal trauma with hemorrhage into the tissues what i still dont understand bingham snapped without looking up from his labors is why you didnt bag the hands at the scene could you please tell me that lauries eyes again met pauls she knew instantly that he had no excuse she wished she could have helped him but she didnt see how she could sharing her colleagues discomfort laurie stepped away from the table despite having made the effort to get dressed to observe laurie left the autopsy room there was just too much tension to make it worth staying she didnt want to make the situation any worse for paul by giving bingham more of an audience returning back upstairs after peeling off her outer layer of protective clothing laurie sat down at her desk and got to work the first order of business was to complete what she could on the three autopsies that shed done on sunday the first of the cases had been the twelveyearold boy the second case was clearly a heroin overdose but she reviewed the facts drug paraphernalia had been found with the victim the victim had been a known heroin addict at autopsy his arms had showed multiple sites of intravenous injection old and new on his right upper arm hed had a tattoo born to lose internally hed shown the usual signs of asphyxial death with a frothy pulmonary edema despite the fact that laboratory and microscopic studies were still pending laurie felt comfortable with her conclusion that the cause of death was drug overdose and the manner of death was accidental the third case was far from clear a twentyfouryearold woman flight attendant had been discovered at home in a bathrobe having apparently collapsed in the hallway outside her bathroom shed been found by her roommate shed been healthy and had returned home from a trip to los angeles the previous day she was not known to be a drug user laurie had done the autopsy but had found nothing all her findings were completely normal concerned about the case laurie had one of the medical investigators locate the womans gynecologist laurie had spoken with the man and had been assured the woman had been entirely healthy hed seen her last only months before having had a similar case recently laurie had instructed the medical investigator to go to the womans apartment and bring back any personal electrical appliances found in the womans bathroom sitting on lauries desk was a cardboard box with a note from the medical investigator saying that the enclosed was all she could find using her thumbnail laurie broke through the tape sealing the box lifted the flaps and peered inside the box contained a blow dryer and an old metal curling iron laurie lifted both devices from the box and laid them on her desk from the lower righthand drawer of the desk laurie lifted out an electrical testing device called a voltohmmeter examining the blow dryer first laurie tested the electrical resistance between the prongs of the plug and the dryer itself in both instances the reading was infinite ohms or no current flow thinking that perhaps she was again on the wrong track she tested the hair curler to her surprise the result was positive between one of the prongs and the casing of the curler the voltohmmeter registered zero ohms meaning free current flow taking some basic tools from her desk including a screwdriver and a pair of pliers laurie opened the hair curler and immediately found the frayed wire that was making contact with the devices metal casing it was now clear to laurie that the poor flight attendant was the victim of low voltage electrocution as was often the case the victim had been shocked but had had time to put the offending device away and walk from the room before succumbing to a fatal cardiac arrhythmia the cause of death was electrocution and the manner of death accidental with the hair curler autopsied on her desk laurie got out her camera and arranged the pieces to show the aberrant connection then she stood up to shoot directly down as she peered through the viewfinder laurie felt pleased about the case she couldnt suppress a modest smile knowing how different her work was from what people surmised shed not only solved the mystery of the poor womans untimely death but had potentially saved someone else from the same fate as well before laurie could take the photo of the curler her phone rang because of the degree of her concentration the ringing startled her with thinly veiled irritation she answered it was the operator asking laurie if she would mind taking a call from a doctor phoning from the manhattan general hospital she added that hed requested to talk with the chief then why put him through to me laurie demanded the chief is tied up in the autopsy room and i cant find dr washington someone said hes out talking with the reporters so i just started ringing the other doctors numbers you were the first to answer put him on laurie said with resignation she sank back into her desk chair she was quite confident it would be a short conversation if someone wanted to talk with the chief they certainly would not be satisfied talking to the lowest person in the hierarchy after the call had been put through laurie introduced herself she emphasized that she was one of the associate medical examiners and not the chief im dr murray the caller said im a senior medical resident i need to talk to someone about a drug overdosetoxicity doa that came in this morning what is it that youd like to know laurie asked drug deaths were a daily phenomenon at the me office her attention partially switched back to the hair curler she had a better idea for the photograph the patients name was duncan andrews dr murray said he was a thirtyfiveyearold caucasian male he arrived with no cardiac activity no spontaneous respiration and with a core body temperature that we recorded at one hundred eight degrees uh huh laurie said equably holding the phone in the crook of her neck she rearranged the pieces of the hair curler there was massive evidence of seizure activity dr murray said so we ran an eeg it was flat the lab reported a serum cocaine level of micrograms per milliliter wow laurie said with a short laugh of amazement dr murray had caught her attention thats one hell of a high level what was the route of administration oral was he one of those mules who try to smuggle the stuff by swallowing condoms filled with cocaine hardly dr murray said with a short laugh of his own this guy was some kind of wall street whiz kid no it wasnt oral it was iv laurie swallowed as she struggled to keep old unwanted memories submerged her throat had suddenly gone dry was heroin involved as well she asked in the sixties a mixture of heroin and cocaine called speedball had been popular no heroin dr murray said only cocaine but obviously a walloping dose if his temperature was one hundred eight when we took it god only knows how high it had been well it sounds pretty straightforward laurie said whats the question if youre wondering if its a medical examiner case i can tell you that it is no we know it is an me case dr murray said thats not the problem its more complicated than that the fellow was found by his girlfriend who came in with him but then his family came in as well and i have to tell you his family is connected if you know what i mean anyway the nurses found that mr duncan andrews had an organdonor card in his wallet and they called the organdonor coordinator without knowing that the case was an me case the organdonor coordinator asked the family if they would permit harvesting the eyes since that was the only tissue besides bone that might still be usable you understand that we dont pay much attention to organdonor cards unless the family agrees but this family agreed they told us that they definitely wanted to respect the decedents wishes personally i think it has something to do with their wanting to believe their son died of natural causes but be that as it may we wanted to check with you people as a matter of policy before we did anything the family truly agreed laurie asked im telling you they were emphatic dr murray said according to the girlfriend she and the decedent had talked about the problem of the lack of transplant organs on several occasions and had gone together to the manhattan organ repository to sign up in response to the repositorys tv appeal last year mr duncan andrews must have given himself some dose of cocaine laurie said was there any suicide note no suicide note dr murray said nor was the man depressed at least according to the girlfriend this sounds like a rather unique circumstance laurie said i personally dont think honoring the familys request would affect the autopsy but im not authorized to make such a policy decision what i can do is find out for you from the powersthatbe and call you back immediately id appreciate it dr murray said if were going to do something we have to do it sooner rather than later laurie hung up the phone and with a degree of reluctance left her disassembled hair curler and returned to the morgue without donning the usual layers she stuck her head through the door immediately she could see that bingham had departed the chief left you to carry on by yourself laurie called out to paul paul turned to face her thank god for small favors paul said his voice slightly muffled by his mask luckily he had to get upstairs to the news conference hes scheduled i suppose he thinks im capable of sewing up the body come on paul laurie said by way of encouragement remember bingham treats everyone like an incompetent at the autopsy table ill try to keep that in mind paul said without conviction laurie let the door close she used the stairs at the far end of the morgue to go up to the first floor there was no sense waiting for the elevator for a single flight the firstfloor corridor was crowded with media people and it was all laurie could do to get to the double doors leading into the conference room over the heads of the reporters she could see binghams shiny bald pate reflecting the harsh lighting set up for the tv cameras he was taking questions from the floor and perspiring copiously laurie knew instantly that there was no way shed be able to discuss manhattan generals problem with him standing on her toes laurie scanned the crowded room for dr calvin washington the deputy chief medical examiner as a sixfootseven twohundredandfiftypound black man he was usually easy to pick out of a crowd laurie finally spotted him standing near the door that led from the conference room into the chiefs office by going out into the main reception area then cutting through the chiefs office laurie was able to approach calvin from behind when she reached him she hesitated dr washington had a stormy temperament between his physique and his moods he intimidated most people including laurie marshaling her courage laurie tapped him on the arm immediately he spun around his dark eyes swept over laurie he was not happy that much was apparent what is it he asked in a forced whisper could i speak to you for a moment laurie asked theres a question of policy regarding a case over at manhattan general after a glance back at his perspiring boss calvin nodded he stepped beyond laurie and closed the door to the conference room he shook his head this preppy murder ii is going sour already god i hate the media theyre not after the truth whatever that is theyre nothing but a bunch of gossip hounds and poor harold is trying to justify why the hands werent bagged at the murder site what a circus why werent the hands bagged laurie asked because the tour doctor didnt think about it calvin said disgusted and by the time plodgett got there the body was already in the van how come the tour doctor allowed the body to be moved before paul got there laurie asked how should i know calvin exploded the whole case is a mess one screwup after another laurie cringed i hate to bring this up but i noticed another potential problem downstairs oh and what was that calvin demanded what i imagine were the victims clothes were in a plastic bag on one of the countertops damn calvin snapped he stepped over to binghams phone and punched the extension in the pit as soon as the phone was answered he shouted that someone would be on the autopsy table himself if the preppy murder ii victims clothes were in a plastic bag without waiting for an answer calvin slammed the receiver down onto the cradle then he glared at laurie as if the messenger were responsible for the bad news i cant imagine a fungus would have destroyed any evidence so quickly laurie offered thats not entirely the point calvin snapped were not out in the boondocks someplace screwups like this are not to be tolerated especially not under this glare of publicity it seems as if this whole case is jinxed anyway whats the problem at manhattan general laurie told calvin about duncan andrews as succinctly as possible and about the attending physicians request she emphasized that it was the familys wishes to respect the deceaseds desire to be a donor if we had a decent medical examiner law in this state this wouldnt even come up calvin growled i think we should honor the familys request tell the doctor that in this kind of circumstances he should take the eyes but photograph them prior to doing so also he should take vitreous samples from inside the eyes for toxicology ill let him know immediately laurie said thanks calvin waved absently he was already reopening the door to the conference room laurie cut back through the chiefs secretarial area and got marlene to buzz her through the door into the main hall she had to weave her way among the media people stepping over cables powering the tv lights binghams news conference was still in progress laurie pressed the up button on the elevator ahhhh laurie squealed in response to a deliberate jab in the ribs laurie swung around to chastise whoever had poked her she expected to see a colleague but it wasnt before her stood a stranger in his early thirties he had on a trench coat that was open down the front his tie was loosened at his collar on his face was a childlike grin laurie he said laurie suddenly recognized him it was bob talbot a reporter for the daily news whom laurie had known since college shed not seen him for some time and out of context it had taken a moment to recognize him despite her irritation she smiled where have you been bob demanded i havent seen you for ages i guess ive been a bit asocial of late laurie admitted lots of work plus ive started studying for my forensic boards you know the expression about all work and no play bob said laurie nodded and tried to smile the elevator arrived laurie stepped in and held the door open with her hand what do you think of this new preppy murder bob asked it sure is causing a fuss its bound to laurie said its madetoorder tabloid material besides it seems that weve already messed up i suppose its reminiscent of what happened with the first case a little too reminiscent for my colleagues what are you talking about bob asked for one thing the victims hands werent bagged laurie said didnt you hear what dr bingham was saying yeah but he said it didnt matter it matters laurie said besides that the victims clothes ended up in a plastic bag thats a nono moisture encourages the growth of microorganisms that can affect evidence thats another screwup unfortunately the medical examiner on the case is one of us junior people by rights it should be someone with more experience apparently the boyfriend already confessed bob said isnt this all academic laurie shrugged by the time the trial rolls around he might have a change of heart certainly his lawyer will then its up to the evidence unless there was a witness and in this type of case theres seldom a witness maybe youre right bob said with a nod well have to see meanwhile id better get back to the news conference how about dinner sometime this week maybe laurie said i dont mean to be coy but i do have to study if i want to pass those boards why dont you call and well talk about it bob nodded as laurie let the elevator door close she pressed five back in her office she called dr murray at manhattan general and told him what dr washington had said thank you for your trouble dr murray said when laurie was finished its good to have some guidelines to follow in this kind of circumstance be sure to get good photos laurie advised if you dont the policy could change no need to worry dr murray said we have our own photography department it will be done professionally hanging up the phone laurie went back to the hair curler she took a half dozen photos from varying angles and with varying lighting conditions with the curler out of the way she turned her attention to the only sunday case remaining and the most disturbing for her the twelveyearold boy getting up from her desk laurie returned to the first floor and visited cheryl myers one of the medical investigators she explained that she needed more eyewitnesses of the episode when the boy was hit with the softball without any positive finding on the autopsy she would need personal accounts to substantiate her diagnosis of commotio cordis or death from a blow to the chest cheryl promised to get right on it returning to the fifth floor laurie went to histology to see if the boys slides could be speeded up knowing how distraught the family was she was eager to put her end of the tragedy to rest she found that families seemed to come to some sort of acceptance once they knew the truth the aura of uncertainty about a death of unknown cause made grieving more difficult while she was in histology laurie picked up slides that were ready from cases shed autopsied the previous week with those in hand she went down several flights of stairs and picked up reports from toxicology and serology carrying everything back to her office she dumped all the material on her desk then she went to work except for a short break for lunch laurie spent the rest of the day going over the slides from histology collating the laboratory reports making calls and completing as many files as possible what fueled lauries anxiety was the knowledge that the following day shed be assigned at least two and maybe as many as four new cases to autopsy if she didnt stay abreast of the paperwork shed be swamped there was never a dull moment at the office of the chief medical examiner for the city of new york since it handled between fifteen and twenty thousand assigned cases each year that translated to approximately eight thousand autopsies each day the office averaged two homicides and two drug overdoses by four oclock in the afternoon laurie was beginning to slow down the volume of her work and its intensity had taken its toll when her phone rang for the hundredth time she answered with a tired voice when she realized it was mrs sanford dr binghams secretary she straightened up in her chair by reflex it wasnt every day that she got a call from the chief dr bingham would like to see you in his office if it is convenient mrs sanford said ill be right down laurie answered she smiled at mrs sanfords phrase if it is convenient knowing dr bingham it was probably mrs sanfords translation of get dr montgomery down here asap en route she vainly tried to imagine what dr bingham wanted to see her about but she had no idea go right in mrs sanford said she looked at laurie over the tops of her reading glasses and smiled close the door bingham commanded as soon as laurie was in his office he was sitting behind his massive desk sit down laurie did as she was told binghams angry tone was the first warning of what was to come laurie immediately knew that she wasnt there for a commendation she watched as bingham removed his wirerimmed spectacles and placed them on his blotter his thick fingers handled the glasses with surprising agility laurie studied binghams face his steel blue eyes appeared cold she could just make out the web of fine capillaries spread across the tip of his nose you do know that we have a public relations office dr bingham began his tone was sarcastic angry yes of course laurie replied when bingham paused then you must also know that mrs donnatello is responsible for any information being given to the media and the public laurie nodded and you must also be aware that except for myself all personnel of this office should keep their personal opinions concerning medical examiner business to themselves laurie didnt respond she still didnt know where this conversation was headed suddenly bingham bounded out of his chair and began pacing the area behind his desk what im not sure you appreciate he continued is the fact that being a medical examiner carries significant social and political responsibilities he stopped pacing and looked across at laurie do you understand what im saying i believe so laurie said but there was still some significant part of the conversation that eluded her she had no idea what had precipitated this diatribe believing so is not adequate bingham snorted he stopped his pacing and leaned over his desk glaring at laurie more than anything laurie wanted to remain composed she didnt want to appear emotional she despised situations like this confrontation was not one of her strong points furthermore bingham snapped breaches in the rules pertaining to privileged information will not be tolerated is that clear yes laurie said fighting back unwanted tears she wasnt sad or mad just upset with the amount of work that shed been doing of late she hardly thought she deserved such a tirade can i ask what this is all about most certainly bingham said toward the end of my news conference about the central park murder one of the reporters got up and began asking a question with the comment that you had specifically stated that the case was being mishandled by this department did you or did you not say that to a reporter laurie cowered in her seat she tried to return binghams glare but she had to look away she felt a rush of embarrassment guilt anger and resentment she was shocked that bob would have had such little sense much less respect for her confidentiality finding her voice she said i mentioned something to that effect i thought so bingham said smugly i knew the reporter wouldnt have had the nerve to make something like that up well consider yourself warned dr montgomery that will be all laurie stumbled out of the chiefs office humiliated she didnt even dare exchange glances with mrs sanford lest she lose control of the tears shed been suppressing hoping she wouldnt run into anyone laurie sprinted up the stairs not bothering to wait for the elevator she was particularly thankful that her officemate was still apparently in the autopsy room locking her door behind her laurie sat down at her desk she felt crushed as if all her months of hard work had been for naught because of one foolish indiscretion with sudden resolve laurie picked up the phone she wanted to call bob talbot and tell him what she thought of him but she hesitated then let go of the receiver at the moment she didnt have the strength for another confrontation instead she took a deep breath and let it out slowly she tried to go back to work but she couldnt concentrate instead she opened her briefcase and threw in some of the uncompleted files after collecting her other belongings laurie took the elevator to the basement level and exited through the morgue loading dock onto thirtieth street she didnt want to take the risk of running into anyone in the reception area befitting her mood it was still raining as she walked south on first avenue if anything the city looked worse than it had that morning with a pall of acrid exhaust fumes suspended between the buildings lining the street laurie kept her head down to avoid the oily puddles the litter and the stares of the homeless even her apartment building seemed dirtier than usual and as she waited for the elevator she was aware of the smell of a century of fried onions and fatty meat getting off on the fifth floor she glared at debra englers bloodshot eye daring her to say anything once inside her apartment she slammed the door with enough force to tilt a framed klimt print shed gotten from the metropolitan even feisty tom couldnt elevate her spirits as he rubbed back and forth across her shins as she hung up her coat and stashed her umbrella in her narrow hall closet going into her living room she collapsed into her armchair refusing to be ignored tom leaped to the back of the chair and purred directly into lauries right ear when that didnt work he began to paw lauries shoulder repeatedly finally laurie responded by reaching up and lifting the cat into her lap where she began absently to stroke him as the rain tapped against her window like grains of sand laurie lamented her life for the second time that day she thought about not being married her mothers criticism seemed more deserved than usual she wondered anew if shed made the right career choices what about ten years from now could she see herself caught in the same quagmire of lonely daily life struggling to stay ahead of the paperwork associated with the autopsies or would she assume more administrative duties like bingham with a sense of shock laurie realized for the first time that she had no desire to be chief up until that moment shed always tried to excel whether it was college or medical school and aspiring to be the chief would have fit into that mold excelling for laurie had been a kind of rebellion an attempt to make her father the great cardiac surgeon finally acknowledge her but it had never worked she knew that as far as her father was concerned shed never be able to replace her older brother whod died at the tender age of nineteen laurie sighed it wasnt like her to be depressed and the fact that she was depressed depressed her she never would have guessed that shed be quite so sensitive to criticism maybe shed been unhappy and hadnt even realized it with her workload laurie noticed that the red light on her answering machine was blinking at first she ignored it but the darker the room got the more insistent the blinking became after watching the light for another ten minutes curiosity got the best of her and she listened to the tape the call was from her mother dorothy montgomery asking her to call the moment she got home oh great laurie said out loud she debated about calling knowing her mothers capacity to grate on her nerves in the best of circumstances she wasnt feeling up to another dose of her mothers negativity and unsolicited advice just then laurie listened to the message a second time and after convincing herself that her mother sounded genuinely concerned she made the call dorothy answered on the first ring thank god you called she said breathlessly i dont know what i would have done if you hadnt i was thinking of sending a telegram were having a dinner party tomorrow night and i want you to come were having someone here i want you to meet mother laurie said with exasperation im not sure im up for a dinner party ive had a bad day nonsense dorothy exclaimed all the more reason to get out of that dreadful apartment of yours youll have a wonderful time it will be good for you the person i want you to meet is dr jordan scheffield hes a marvelous ophthalmologist known all over the world your fathers told me and best of all he was recently divorced from a dreadful woman im not interested in a blind date laurie said with irritation she couldnt believe that not only was her mother oblivious to her mental state but she wanted to fix her up with some divorced eyeball doctor its about time you met someone appropriate dorothy said i never understood what you saw in that sean mackenzie that boy is a shiftless hoodlum and a bad influence on you im glad you finally broke up with him for good laurie rolled her eyes her mother was in rare form today even if there was a certain truth in what she was saying she didnt feel like hearing it just then laurie had been dating sean on and off since college from the start their relationship was a rocky one and though he wasnt exactly a hoodlum he did hold a sort of outlaws appeal for her between his motorcycle and bad attitude there was a time when his artistic personality excited laurie back then shed even been rebellious enough to try drugs with him on several occasions but she hoped this last breakup would be their last be here at seventhirty dorothy said and i want you to wear something attractive like that wool suit i gave you for your birthday in october and your hair wear it up id love to talk longer but ive got so much to do see you tomorrow dear bye laurie took the phone from her ear and looked at it in the darkened room with disbelief her mother had hung up on her she didnt know whether to swear laugh or cry she replaced the receiver on its cradle finally she laughed her mother was certainly a character as she played the conversation back in her mind she couldnt believe it had taken place it was as if she and her mother talked on different wavelengths walking around her apartment laurie turned on the lights then closed the curtains shielded from the world she took her hair down and stepped out of her clothes for some reason she felt better the crazy conversation with her mother had shocked her out of her depressive thoughts climbing into the shower laurie admitted to herself that she tended to be more emotional in business situations than she would like the realization irritated her she didnt mind dressing femininely but she didnt want to lend credence to the stereotype of a fragile fickle female in the future she would try to be more professional she also realized what a mistake she had made in confiding in bob she would have to be sure to keep her opinions to herself particularly where the press was concerned she was lucky bingham hadnt fired her standing under the jet of water laurie thought about making herself a salad and then doing some studying for her forensic boards then she thought about dinner the following night at her parents although her initial reaction had been overwhelmingly negative she began to have second thoughts maybe it would be an interesting break in her routine then she wondered how insufferable the newly divorced ophthalmologist would be she also wondered how old hed be pm monday queens new york city i gotta do something tony ruggerio said he was antsy and he shifted in the passenger side of the front seat of angelo facciolos black lincoln town car weve been sitting here in front of dagostinos grocery store for four nights i cant stand this doing nothing you know what i mean ive got to have action something anything his eyes nervously darted around the rainglossed street scene in front of him the car was parked next to a hydrant on roosevelt avenue angelos head swung slowly around his lidded eyes regarded this youthfulappearing twentyfouryearold kid whod been foisted on him tonys nervousness and impulsiveness were enough to try the patience of angelo he thought the kid whose nickname was the animal was a liability in angelos line of work and hed said as much to cerino but it didnt matter angelo might as well have been talking to the wall cerino said that the kids asset was that he had no fear he was wild and ambitious and had no qualms and little conscience cerino said that he needed more people like tony angelo wasnt so sure tony was short at fivefootseven and wiry what he lacked in intimidation through stature he tried to make up for in muscle he worked out regularly at the american gym in jackson heights he told angelo he took protein supplements and occasionally steroids tonys features were rounded ethnic southern italian and his hair was shiny black and thick his nose was slightly flattened and angled to the right thanks to some amateur boxing hed grown up in woodside and never finished high school where hed had frequent fights over his stature as well as his sister mary who was in his vernacular a looker hed always been protective of his sister thinking that all males had the same goals as himself when it came to females i cant sit here any longer tony said ive got to get out of the car he reached for the door latch angelo put his hand on tonys arm relax angelo said with enough threat in his voice to restrain tony cerino had been right to pair them up in a way angelo the dude made an excellent foil for brash tony he looked older than his thirtyfour years where tony was short angelo was tall and gaunt his features sharp and hatchetlike if tony was sensitive about his height angelo was sensitive about his skin his face bore the scars of a nearlethal case of chicken pox at age six and severe acne from thirteen to twentyone where tony was wild and impulsive angelo was cautious and calculating a seemingly calm sociopath whose character had been molded by an endless series of foster homes and a final stint of hard time in a maximum security prison both men were rather vain when it came to their wardrobes yet tony never quite cut the figure for which he aimed his suits no matter how expensive were always illfitting on his disproportionately muscled body on the other hand angelo gave even dapper john gotti a run for his money where sartorial elegance was concerned he wasnt flashy just meticulous he wore exclusively brioni suits shirts ties and shoes as tonys muscle building was in response to his short stature angelos fastidious attire was in response to his complexion a subject about which he did not brook any reference tony leaned back in his seat he glanced in angelos direction angelo was one of the few people tony feared and respected even envied angelo was connected a made man whose reputation was legendary paulie told me that frankie depasquale would show up at this grocery store angelo said so were going to spend the next month waiting here if need be christ tony muttered instead of getting out of the car he reached into his baggy jacket and extracted his caliber beretta bantam releasing the springloaded catch in the butt he slid out the magazine and counted the bullets as if one of the eight shells could have disappeared since he last counted them half an hour ago when tony pulled the empty guns trigger angelo rolled his eyes put the gun away he said whats the matter with you all right all right tony said pushing the magazine home and returning the pistol to its shoulder holster take it easy will you he glanced at angelo who stared back at him for a moment tony held up his hands he knew angelo well enough to know he was irritated the guns away relax already angelo didnt say anything he resumed looking toward the entrance of dagostinos watching the people coming and going tony sighed heavily its been a freaking month since the mothers threw the acid in paulies face maybe the bums have split skipped town thats what i would have done the next day i would have been outta here gone down to florida or out to the coast we might be sitting here for nothing have you thought of that frankie has been seen angelo said hes been seen here at dagostinos so how did it happen tony asked howd they get close to cerino in the first place it wasnt complicated angelo said vinnie dominick called the meeting with cerino there were to be no weapons everybody had to leave his piece in his car we even used a metal detector that cerino had taken from kennedy airport when terry manso started to serve coffee he threw a cup of acid in pauls face the reason we know frankie was involved was because he came with manso howd frankie get away tony asked the moment paulie got the acid the lights went out angelo said then the place went crazy with paulie screaming and everybody diving for cover in the dark i was by the front window i threw a chair through it and dove outside that was when i saw manso come out the front door frankie was already climbing into a car it all happened so fast few people could react how did you manage to get manso tony asked it was a race angelo said manso lost my car was directly in front of the restaurant with my piece on the front seat where i could get to it fast if something went wrong i got off two shots as manso tried to get into his car he never made it both slugs went into his back how many people were involved tony asked hed been curious about the acid episode since hed heard about it but hed been afraid to bring it up the way i figure it at least two more besides manso and depasquale angelo said knowing for sure is one of the reasons we want to talk with frankie god it blows my mind tony said with a shake of his head i cant imagine how much the lucia people promised to pay for this kind of hit nobody knows for sure angelo said in fact word has it that the punks did it on their own thinking theyd be rewarded by the lucia people for their balls but as far as we can tell the lucia people havent even acknowledged it so disrespectful tony muttered acid in the face christ that reminds me angelo said did you get that battery acid yeah sure tony said its in doc travinos old doctors bag on the backseat good angelo said paulie is going to like that its a nice touch tony stretched he was quiet for a minute then he cleared his throat what do you say to my getting out of the car for just a second id like to do a set of pushups my shoulders are tight angelo swore under his breath and told tony that being in the car with him was like being locked up with a twoyearold kid im sorry tony said with arched eyebrows im used to more activity than this locking his hands together he did a series of isometric exercises in the middle of one of these maneuvers he stopped and stared out the side window holy crap isnt that frankie depasquale coming along beside us tony said excitedly angelo leaned forward to see around tony it sure looks like him finally tony exclaimed as he fumbled to withdraw his gun and reach for the door latch he felt angelos hand on his arm he looked at his mentor in surprise not yet angelo said we have to make sure the kids alone we cant screw this up it might be our only chance and paulie doesnt want more trouble like an eager hunting dog restraining himself with difficulty from some flushed prey tony watched as frankie depasquale disappeared into the crowded grocery store to his surprise angelo started the car where are you going he demanded im just backing up a bit angelo explained it appears that frankie is alone well take him when he comes out again angelo angled back to the curb at a bus stop he left the engine running they waited twenty minutes later frankie came out of the store with bundles in both arms angelo and tony watched as he walked directly toward them he looks like a teenager angelo said he is tony said hes eighteen he was in my sisters class before he started hanging around with the wrong people and dropped out of school now angelo said in a flash both angelo and tony got out of the car and confronted the surprised frankie depasquale frankies eyes opened wide and his jaw dropped hello frankie angelo said calmly we need to talk frankie responded by dropping his groceries the bags split when they hit the wet sidewalk and a number of cans of tomato paste rolled into the gutter frankie turned and fled tony was on him in a flash he grabbed him roughly from behind knocking him to the pavement holding him down he frisked him quickly coming up with a small saturday night special tony pocketed the gun then turned the terrified boy over up close frankie looked even younger than eighteen in fact it didnt look as if he shaved yet dont hurt me frankie pleaded shut up tony snapped the kid was such a drip it was disgusting angelo pulled the car up alongside them with the engine running he jumped from the car a few pedestrians had stopped beneath their umbrellas to gawk at the spectacle angelo pushed through them all right move on angelo commanded were police angelo flashed an old police department badge that he kept in his pocket for just this sort of occasion the fact that it said ozone park when they were currently in woodside made no difference it was the shape and the glint of metal that caused the desired effect the small crowd started to disperse theyre not police frankie yelled tony responded to frankies outburst by putting his beretta bantam to the side of frankies head one more word and youre history kid in the car angelo commanded with angelo on one side and tony on the other they stood frankie up and dragged him to the car opening the rear door and pushing his head down they shoved him inside tony climbed in after him angelo ran around and jumped into the drivers seat with a screech of rubber they headed west on roosevelt avenue what are you doing this for frankie asked i havent done anything to you guys shut up angelo said from the front seat he was keeping his eye on the rearview mirror if there had been any sign of trouble he would have turned on queens boulevard but everything was quiet so he kept going straight roosevelt became greenpoint and angelo began to relax all right punk angelo said glancing in the rearview mirror time to talk he could just see frankie cowering in the corner keeping as far from tony as possible tony was holding his gun in his left hand with his arm draped over the back of the seat tonys eyes never left frankie what do you want to talk about frankie asked the job you and manso did on paulie cerino angelo said im sure you guessed that we work for mr cerino frankies eyes darted from tonys face to tonys gun then up to the image of angelo in the rearview mirror he was terrified i didnt do it he said i was just there it was mansos idea they forced me to go i didnt want to do it but they threatened my mother whos they angelo asked i mean terry manso frankie said he was the one with a sudden wicked slap tony cracked frankie across the face with the barrel of his gun frankie screamed and pressed the palms of his hands against his face a trickle of blood oozed between his fingers what do you think we are stupid tony sneered dont hurt him yet angelo said maybe hell be cooperative please dont hurt me anymore frankie pleaded between sobs tony swore contemptuously and forced the barrel of his pistol between frankies fingers and into his mouth your brains are going to be all over the inside of this car if you dont smarten up and stop screwing around with us who else was involved angelo asked again tony withdrew the barrel of his gun so frankie could talk it was just manso frankie sobbed and he made me go along angelo shook his head in disgust obviously you are not cooperating frankie remember about the lights at the same time manso threw the acid the lights went out that wasnt a coincidence who was screwing around with the lights and the car who was driving the car i dont know anything about the lights frankie sobbed i dont remember who was driving somebody i didnt know somebody that manso got angelo shook his head in disgust nothing was easy anymore he hated this kind of dirty stuff he had entertained vague hopes that frankie would have spilled his guts the moment they got him into the car obviously that was not to be the case glancing up into the rearview mirror angelo caught a glimpse of tonys face in the flickering light of the passing streetlamps tony was sporting one of his contented smiles that told angelo tony was enjoying himself even angelo thought tony could be scary on occasion once they got to the greenpoint pier area in brooklyn angelo turned right on franklin then left on java the area was rundown especially the closer they got to the water abandoned warehouses lined the street seventyfive to a hundred years ago the area had been a thriving waterfront but that had long since changed save for a few isolated enterprises like the pepsicola plant up toward newtown creek in the cul de sac where java street deadended at the east river angelo drove through a chainlink gate a sign over the gate said american fresh fruit company the car began to vibrate on the rough cobblestone surface but angelo didnt slow down when he could drive no farther he parked everybody out angelo said they were parked in the shadow of a huge warehouse built out over the pier that stuck out almost a hundred yards into the east river just across the river was the monumental mass of manhattan s glittering skyline tony got out holding doc travinos little black bag and motioned for frankie to get out too angelo unlocked an overhead door to the warehouse pulled it up and motioned for frankie to enter frankie hesitated on the dark threshold ive told you everything i know what do you want from me tony gave frankie a shove that sent the boy stumbling forward the click of the lightswitch echoed in the cavernous warehouse as angelo threw the switch activating the mercury vapor lights at first the lights merely glowed but as they walked out the pier dragging a reluctant frankie they became progressively brighter soon it was enough to illuminate the huge stacks of green bananas that filled the warehouse please frankie moaned but angelo and tony ignored him they walked to the very end unlocking a paneled door angelo found the lightswitch that activated a single bulb suspended by a bare wire the room contained an old metal desk missing its drawers a few chairs and a large hole in the floor below the hole the water of the east river looked more like oil than water as it swirled around the piers piling flowing with the tide im telling you the truth frankie wailed it was all manso i was forced to go along i dont know anything else sure frankie angelo said turning to tony he added tie him to one of the chairs tony put doc travinos bag on the desk and unsnapped it open from within he pulled out a length of clothesline then with a depraved smile he told frankie to sit in one of the wooden side chairs frankie did as he was told while tony tied him up angelo lit himself a cigarette tony gave the rope a couple of yanks to test his knots satisfied he stood up and nodded to angelo once more frankie angelo said who else was involved with the acid trick who besides you and manso nobody frankie sobbed im telling the truth angelo derisively blew smoke in frankies face glancing at tony he said time for the truth serum tony pulled a small glass bottle and an eye dropper from doc travinos bag he handed both to angelo angelo unscrewed the cap and gingerly sniffed the contents when he got a whiff he pulled his head back quickly geez powerful stuff he blinked a few times and wiped tears from the corners of his eyes any chance you want to change your story angelo asked calmly after walking over to frankie im telling you the truth frankie persisted angelo looked at tony hold his head back tony grabbed a handful of the boys hair just above the forehead and yanked frankies head back tell me frankie angelo said as he bent over the boys upturned face have you ever heard the expression an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth only then did frankie realize what was happening but despite his attempts at clamping his eyes shut angelo managed to empty the eye dropper into frankies lower right lid a slight spattering noise like water hitting a hot skillet preceded an earpiercing shriek as the sulfuric acid ate into his delicate eye tissues angelo glanced at tony and noticed that tonys smile had swelled to a grin angelo wondered what the world was coming to with this new generation this kid tony was having a ball for angelo this was not entertainment it was business nothing more nothing less angelo set the sulfuric acid bottle on the desk and took a couple more puffs on his cigarette when frankies screams had abated to choking sobs angelo leaned toward him and calmly asked if frankie wanted to change his story talk to me angelo commanded when it seemed that frankie was ignoring him im telling the truth frankie managed chrissake angelo muttered as he went back for the acid over his shoulder he called to tony hold his head back again wait frankie croaked dont hurt me anymore ill tell you what you want to know angelo put the acid back on the desk and returned to frankie he looked at the tears streaming out of the kids shut eyes especially the one where hed put the acid ok frankie angelo began who was involved you have to get me something for my eye frankie whined its killing me well take care of it as soon as you tell us what we want to know angelo said come on frankie im losing my patience bruno marchese and jimmy lanso frankie muttered angelo looked at tony tony nodded ive heard of bruno he said hes a local kid where can we find these guys if we want to talk to them angelo asked thirtyeight twentytwo fiftyfifth street apartment one frankie said just off northern boulevard angelo took out a piece of paper and wrote the address down whose idea was it he asked it was mansos frankie sobbed i was telling the truth about that it was his idea that if we did it wed all become lucia soldiers part of the inner circle but i didnt want to do it they made me go along why couldnt you have told us this in the car frankie angelo asked you would have saved us a lot of trouble and yourself some grief i was afraid the others would kill me if they found out id talked frankie said so you were more worried about your friends than us angelo questioned as he stepped behind frankie it was enough to hurt angelos feelings thats curious but no matter now you dont have to worry about your friends because well take care of you you got to get me something for my eye frankie said sure angelo said in a smooth motion and without a seconds hesitation angelo pulled out his walther tph auto pistol and shot frankie in the back of the head just above the neck frankies head snapped forward then slumped down on his chest the suddenness of the final act surprised tony who winced and stepped back anticipating a gory mess but there wasnt any why didnt you let me do that he whined shut up and untie him angelo said were not here for your entertainment were working remember once tony had frankie untied angelo helped carry the limp body over to the hole in the floor on the count of three they heaved him into the river angelo watched just long enough to make sure that the running tide took the body out into the river proper lets head back to woodside to pay the others a social call angelo said the address that frankie had given was a small twostory row house with an apartment on each floor the outer door was locked but it had a mechanism amenable to a credit card they were inside in minutes positioning themselves on either side of the door to apartment one angelo knocked there was no answer from the street theyd seen that the lights were on bust it angelo said nodding toward the door tony took several steps back then kicked the door the jamb splintered on the first kick and the door swung in in the blink of an eye both angelo and tony were in the small apartment with their guns gripped in both hands the apartment was empty save for several halffilled bottles of beer on the coffee table the tv was on what do you figure tony asked they must have got spooked when frankie didnt come back angelo said he lit a cigarette and thought for a moment what next tony questioned you know where this brunos family lives angelo asked no but i can find out tony said do it angelo said am tuesday manhattan it was a glorious morning as laurie montgomery walked north on first avenue nearing thirtieth street even new york city looked good in the cool crisp air scrubbed clean from a day of rain it was definitely colder than the previous days and in that sense a disturbing reminder of the coming winter but the sun was out and there was enough breeze to disperse the exhaust of the vehicles jostling their way in lauries direction lauries step had a definite spring to it as she approached the medical examiners office she smiled to herself as she thought how differently she felt this morning as compared to how shed felt when shed left for home the night before binghams reprimand had been unpleasant but deserved shed been in the wrong if shed been chief she would have been equally as angry as she approached the front steps she wondered what the day would bring one aspect of her work she particularly enjoyed was its unpredictability all she knew was that she was scheduled to be on autopsy she had no idea what kinds of cases and what kinds of intellectual puzzles shed encounter that day just about every time she was on autopsy she dealt with something shed never seen sometimes something shed never even read about it was a job that meant continual discovery this morning the reception area was relatively quiet there were still a few media people hanging around for more word on the preppy murder ii case yesterdays central park murder had made the front page of the tabloids and the local morning news just shy of the inner door laurie stopped over on one of the vinyl couches she spotted bob talbot deep in conversation with another reporter after a moments hesitation laurie strode over to the couch bob id like to talk to you a moment she said then to his companion she added pardon me for interrupting bob eagerly got to his feet and stepped aside with laurie his attitude surprised her she would have expected him to be more sheepish and contrite seeing you two days in a row must be some sort of record bob said its a pleasure i could get used to laurie started right in i cant believe you didnt have more respect for my confidence what i told you yesterday was meant for your ears only bob was clearly taken aback by lauries rebuke im terribly sorry i didnt think what you were saying was a secret you didnt say so you could have thought about it laurie fumed it doesnt take a rocket scientist to guess what such a statement would do to my standing around here im sorry bob repeated it wont happen again youre right it wont happen again laurie said she turned and headed for the inner door ignoring bob as he called out to her but although she ignored him her anger had lessened after all she had been speaking the truth the day before she wondered vaguely if she shouldnt be more uncomfortable with the social and political aspects of her job that bingham had referred to than with bob one of the attractions for laurie of pathology in general and forensics in particular was that they tried to deal with the truth the idea of compromise for whatever reason disturbed her she hoped she would never have to choose between her scruples and the politicking after marlene wilson buzzed her through laurie went directly to the id office as per usual vinnie amendola was drinking coffee and perusing the sports pages if the date on the paper hadnt been that days she might have sworn hed never left if he noticed laurie he didnt give any indication riva mehta lauries officemate was in the id office she was a slight indian woman with a dark complexion and a soft silky voice on monday theyd not crossed paths looks like todays your lucky day riva teased she was getting herself some coffee before heading up to the office tuesday was to be a paper day for her how so laurie questioned vinnie gave a short laugh without looking up from his paper you got a homicide floater riva said a floater was a body that had been in water for a period of time they generally were not desirable cases since they frequently were in advanced stages of decomposition laurie looked at the schedule calvin had made up that morning listed were that days autopsies and the people to whom theyd been assigned after her name were two drug overdoses and a gsw homicide the gsw stood for gun shot wound the body was hauled out of the east river this morning riva said an attentive security man had apparently seen it bobbing past the south street sea port lovely laurie said its not so bad said vinnie it hadnt been in the water long only a matter of hours laurie nodded in relief that meant she probably wouldnt have to do the case in the decomposing room it wasnt the smell that bothered her on such cases as much as the isolation the decomposing room was all by itself on the other side of the morgue laurie much preferred to be in the thick of things and relating to the other staff there was a lot of give and take in the main autopsy room often she learned as much from other peoples cases as she did from her own laurie looked at the name of the victim and his age frank depasquale poor fellow was only eighteen she said such a waste and like most of these homicides the case will probably never be solved probably not vinnie agreed as he struggled to fold his newspaper to the next page laurie said good morning to paul plodgett when he appeared at the door he had dark circles under his eyes she asked him how his famous case was progressing dont ask paul said its a nightmare laurie got herself a cup of coffee and picked up the three folders for her days cases each folder contained a case worksheet a partially filledout death certificate an inventory of medicolegal case records two sheets for autopsy notes a telephone notice of death as received by communications a completed identification sheet an investigative report a sheet for the autopsy report and a lab slip for hiv antibody analysis as she was shuffling through all the material laurie noticed the names of the other two cases louis herrera and duncan andrews she remembered the name duncan andrews from the day before that was the case you asked me about yesterday a voice said from over lauries shoulder she turned and looked up into calvin washingtons coal black eyes hed come up behind her and put a finger by andrews name when i saw the name i thought youd want the case fine by me laurie said each one of the medical examiners had his own way of approaching his autopsy day some grabbed the material and went directly downstairs laurie had a different modus operandi she liked to take all the paperwork up to her office to plan her day as rationally as possible with her coffee in one hand her briefcase in the other and the three new files under her arm laurie set out for the elevator she got as far as communications when sergeant murphy one of the policemen currently assigned to the medical examiners office called her name he bounded out of the police cubicle dragging a second man behind him sergeant murphy was an ebullient redfaced irishman dr montgomery id like you to meet detective lieutenant lou soldano murphy said proudly hes one of the brass in the homicide department at headquarters downtown happy to meet you doctor lou said he stuck out his hand he was an attractive darkcomplected man of medium height with welldefined features and bright eyes that just then were riveted to her face his hair was cropped short in a style that seemed appropriate for his stocky muscular body happy to meet you as well laurie said we dont see too many police lieutenants here at the medical examiners office laurie felt a bit nervous under the mans unblinking stare they dont let us out of our cages too often lou said im pretty much glued to my desk but i still like to sneak out once in a while especially on certain cases hope you enjoy your visit here laurie said she smiled and started to leave just a moment doctor lou said i was told that you were assigned to autopsy frank depasquale i wonder if you would mind if i observed the post ive already cleared it with dr washington not at all laurie said if you can tolerate it be my guest ive seen a few autopsies lou said i dont think there will be any problem fine laurie said there was an awkward pause for a moment no one spoke finally laurie realized the man was waiting for some directions im on my way to my office laurie said i usually go over the paperwork first would you care to come along id be delighted he said in the elevator laurie looked at soldano more closely he was a square athletic appearing man of obvious intelligence whose rumpled appearance vaguely reminded her of colombo the tv detective made famous by peter falk the crease in his suit pants had long since disappeared despite the fact that it was only a little after eight in the morning he had a heavy five oclock shadow as if reading lauries mind lou selfconsciously ran a hand up and down the sides of his face i guess i look a wreck lou said ive been up since fourthirty when the depasquale body floated to shore didnt have a chance to shave hope it doesnt offend you im not trying for the don johnson miami vice look i didnt notice laurie lied but why is a detective lieutenant so interested in an eighteenyearold homicide victim is there something special about this case that i should know not really lou said its more personal before i got promoted to lieutenant and switched to homicide id been with the organized crime unit for six years with depasquale the two areas overlap depasquale was a young hoodlum on the fringes of the lucia crime family organization he might have been only eighteen but he already had a long sheet the elevator stopped on the fifth floor and laurie motioned for them to get off as youve probably already guessed lou continued following laurie down the corridor depasquales death was an obvious execution it was laurie questioned as of yet nothing was obvious to her absolutely lou said youre going to find that he was shot from close range with a small caliber bullet into the base of the brain its the usual proven method no mess no fuss they went into lauries office laurie introduced lou to riva who was already hard at work laurie got a chair for lou and put it next to her desk they both sat down youve seen these ganglandstyle execution cases before havent you lou questioned im not sure laurie said evasively from medical school training she knew how to be vague when asked a pointed question she didnt want to give the impression she was inexperienced they usually mean friction between rival organizations lou said and in this case it would mean friction between the lucia and the vaccarro crime families they are the major players in the queens area and their respective interests are controlled by midlevel bosses vinnie dominick and paul cerino my guess would be that paul cerino had a hand in poor frank depasquales murder and if he did id like nothing better than to nail him with an indictment i was after the guy for the entire six years i was assigned to organized crime i could never get an indictment to stick but if i could link him to a capital offense like whacking depasquale id be in fat city that puts the burden on us laurie said as she opened depasquales folder if you or your lab could come up with something id be eternally grateful lou said we need some kind of break the problem with guys like cerino is that they keep so many layers between themselves and all the crime committed in their name we seldom get any charges to stick oh damn laurie said suddenly shed been listening to lou as well as going through the depasquale file whats the matter lou asked they didnt take an xray on depasquale laurie said she reached for her phone and dialed the morgue we have to have an xray before the autopsy unfortunately thats going to hold things up ill have to post one of the other cases first im sorry lou shrugged laurie told the mortuary tech who answered the phone to xray frank depasquale as soon as possible the tech said hed do his best as she was hanging up the doorway to her office was filled by calvin washington laurie calvin said weve got a problem that you should know about laurie stood up when calvin entered what is it she asked she noticed that calvin was eyeing lou questioningly dr washington i believe you met lieutenant soldano ah yes calvin said dont mind me its just alzheimers setting in we met just this morning he shook hands with lou whod stood when laurie introduced him sit down both of you calvin boomed laurie i have to warn you that weve already been getting some heat from the mayors office about this duncan andrews case it seems that the deceased has some powerful political connections so were going to have to cooperate i want you to look hard for some natural cause of death so that you can downplay the drugs the family would prefer it that way laurie looked up at calvins face half expecting it to break out in a broad smile saying that he was only joking but calvins expression didnt change im not sure i understand laurie said i cant be much clearer calvin said his infamous impatience began to show what do you want me to do lie laurie asked hell no dr montgomery calvin snapped what do i have to do draw you a map im just asking you to lean as far as you can okay find something like a coronary plaque an aneurysm anything and then write it up and dont act so surprised or selfrighteous politics play a role here and the sooner you learn that the better off well all be just do it calvin turned and left as quickly as hed come lou whistled and sat down tough guy he said laurie shook her head in disbelief she turned to riva who hadnt paused in her work did you hear that laurie asked her it happened to me once too riva said without looking up only my case was a suicide with a sigh laurie sat down in her desk chair and looked across at lou i dont know if im prepared to sacrifice integrity and ethics for the sake of politics i dont think that was what dr washington was asking you to do lou said laurie felt her face flush it wasnt im sorry but i think it was i dont mean to tell you your business lou said but my take was that dr washington wants you to emphasize any potential natural cause of death you find the rest can be left to interpretation for some reason it makes a difference in this case its the real world versus the world of makebelieve well you seem pretty blasé about fudging the details laurie said in pathology were supposed to be dealing with the truth come on lou said what is the truth there are shades of gray in most everything in life so why not in death my line of work happens to be justice its an ideal i pursue it but if you dont think politics sometimes plays a lead role in how justice is applied youre kidding yourself theres always a gap between law and justice welcome to the real world well i dont like it one bit laurie said all this was reminding her of the concerns about compromise shed had when shed arrived a half hour earlier you dont have to like it lou said not many do laurie flipped open the file on duncan andrews she leafed through the papers until she came to the investigators report after reading for a few moments she looked up at lou im beginning to get the big picture she said the deceased was some kind of financial whiz kid a senior vice president of an investment banking firm at only thirtyfive and on top of that there is a note here that says his father is running for the us senate cant get much more political than that lou said laurie nodded then read more of the investigators report when she got to the section noting who had identified the deceased at the scene she found a name sara wetherbee in the space left to describe the witnesss relationship to the deceased the investigator had scrawled girlfriend laurie shook her head discovering a loved one dead from drugs carried an ugly resonance for her in a flash her thoughts drifted back seventeen years to when she was fifteen a freshman at langley school she could remember the bright sunny day as if it had been yesterday it was midfall crisp and clear and the trees in central park had been a blaze of color shed walked past the metropolitan with its banners snapping in the gusty wind shed turned left on eightyfourth street and entered her parents massive apartment building on the west side of park avenue im home laurie called as she tossed her bookbag onto the foyer table there was no answer all she could hear was the traffic on park peppered by the inevitable bleat of taxi horns anybody home laurie called and heard her voice echo through the halls surprised to find the apartment empty laurie pushed through the door from the butlers pantry into the kitchen even holly their maid was nowhere to be seen but then laurie remembered that it was friday hollys day off shelly laurie yelled her older brother was home from his freshman year at college for the long columbus day weekend laurie expected to find him either in the kitchen or the den she looked in the den no one was there but the tv was on with the sound turned off for a moment laurie looked at the silent antics of a daytime game show she thought it odd that the tv had been left on thinking that someone might still be home she resumed her tour of the apartment for some reason the silent rooms filled her with apprehension she began to move faster sensing a secret urgency pausing in front of shellys bedroom door laurie hesitated then she knocked when there was no answer she knocked again when there was still no answer she tried the door it was unlocked she pushed open the door and stepped into the room in front of her on the floor was her brother shelly his face was as white as the ivorycolored china in the dining room breakfront bloody froth oozed from his nose around his upper arm was a rubber tourniquet on the floor six inches from his halfopened hand was a syringe laurie had seen the night before on the edge of his desk was a glassine envelope laurie guessed what was inside because of what shelly had told her the night before it had to be the speedball hed boasted of a mixture of cocaine and heroin hours later the same day laurie endured the worst confrontation of her life inches from her nose was her fathers angry face with his bulging eyes and purpled skin he was beside himself with rage his thumbs were digging into her skin where he held her upper arms a few feet away her mother was sobbing into a tissue did you know your brother was using drugs her father demanded did you answer me his grip tightened yes laurie blurted yes yes why didnt you tell us her father shouted if youd told us hed be alive i couldnt laurie sobbed why her father shouted tell me why because laurie cried she paused then said because he told me not to he made me promise well that promise killed him her father hissed it killed him just as much as the damn drug laurie felt a hand grip her arm and she jumped the shock brought her back to the present she blinked a few times as if waking from a trance are you all right lou asked hed gotten up and was holding lauries arm im fine laurie said slightly embarrassed she extracted herself from lous grip lets see where were we her breathing had quickened perspiration dotted her forehead she looked over the paperwork in front of her trying to remember what had dredged up such old painful memories as if it had been yesterday she could recall the anguish of the conflict of responsibility sibling or filial and the terrible guilt and burden of having chosen the former what were you thinking about lou asked you seemed a long way off the fact that the victim had been discovered by his girlfriend laurie said as her eyes stumbled again onto sara wetherbees name she wasnt about to share her past with this lieutenant to this day she had trouble talking about that tragic episode with friends much less a stranger it must have been very hard for the poor woman unfortunately homicide victims are often found by those closest to them lou said must have been a terrible shock laurie said her heart went out to sara wetherbee i must say this duncan andrews case is certainly not the usual overdose lou shrugged with cocaine im not sure there is a usual case when the drug went upscale in the seventies deaths have been seen in all levels of society from athletes and entertainers to executives to college kids to inner city hoodlums its a pretty democratic blight a great leveler if you will here at the medical examiners office we mostly see the lower end of the abuser spectrum laurie said but youre right in general laurie smiled she was impressed by lou what was your background before joining the police what do you mean lou asked did you go to college laurie asked of course i went to college lou snapped what kind of question is that sorry laurie said i didnt mean to upset you and i dont mean to be testy lou said sometimes im a bit selfconscious about where i went to school i only got to go to a community college on the island not some ivy league ivory tower whered you go wesleyan university up in connecticut laurie said ever heard of it of course ive heard of it lou said what do you think all police officers are ignoramuses wesleyan university i might have known as billy joel says you uptown girls live in an uptown world how did you know i was from new york your accent doctor lou said its as indelible as my long island rego park accent i see laurie said she didnt like to think she was such an open book she wondered what else this man could tell about her from his years as an investigator laurie changed the subject where you go to school matters less than what you do while youre there she said you shouldnt be sensitive about your college obviously you got a good education easy for you to say said lou but thanks for the compliment laurie looked down at the papers on her desk suddenly she felt a little guilty about her privileged background of a private secondary school wesleyan university columbia medical school she hoped she hadnt sounded patronizing let me take a quick look at the third case laurie said she opened the third folder louis herrera age twentyeight unemployed found in a dumpster behind a grocery store laurie looked up at lou probably died in a crack house and was literally dumped thats the usual overdose we see another sad wasted life in some respects maybe more tragic than the rich guy lou said id guess he had a lot fewer choices in life laurie nodded lous perspective was refreshing she reached for the phone and dialed cheryl myers down in the medical investigators department she asked cheryl to get all the medical records she could on duncan andrews she told her that she hoped to find some medical problem that she might be able to relate to his pathology hanging up the phone laurie glanced over at lou i cant help it but i feel like im cheating she stood up and gathered all the paperwork youre not cheating lou assured her besides why not wait until you have all the information including the autopsy then you can worry about it who knows maybe everything will work out good advice laurie said lets get downstairs and get to work normally laurie changed into her scrub clothes in her office but with lou there she opted to use the locker room when they got off the elevator on the basement level laurie directed lou into the mens side while she went into the womens five minutes later they met up in the hall laurie had on a layer of normal scrub clothes then another impermeable layer then a large apron on her head she wore a hood a face mask dangled from around her neck lou had on a single layer of scrubs a hood and he carried his face mask you look like one of the doctors laurie said eyeing lou to make sure hed put on the right clothing i feel like im going into surgery instead of to see an autopsy lou said i didnt wear all this the last time you sure i have to wear this mask everyone in the autopsy room wears a mask laurie said because of aids and other infectious problems rules have become much stricter if you dont wear it calvin will bodily throw you out they walked down the main corridor of the morgue passing the stainless steel door to the walkin cooler and past the long bank of individual refrigerated compartments the refrigerator compartments formed a large u in the middle of the morgue this place is certainly grisly lou commented i suppose laurie said its less so when youre used to it it looks like a hollywood set for a horror movie lou said whoever picked out these blue tiles for the walls and what about the cement floor why isnt there any covering look at all the stains laurie stopped and gazed at the floor although the surface was swept clean the stains were unspeakable it was supposed to be tiled long ago she said somehow it got fouled up in new york city bureaucratic red tape at least thats what ive been told and what are all those coffins doing here lou asked thats a nice touch he pointed to a stack of simple pine boxes piled almost to the ceiling others were standing on end those are potters field coffins laurie said there are a lot of unidentified bodies in new york city after their autopsies we keep them in the cooler for a number of weeks if they go unclaimed they are eventually buried at citys expense isnt there someplace else they could store the coffins lou asked it looks like a garage sale not that i know of laurie said i guess ive never thought about it im so used to seeing them there laurie pushed into the autopsy room first then held the door for lou in contrast to the previous morning all eight tables were now occupied by corpses each with a tag tied around its big toe at five of the tables the posts were already under way well well dr montgomery is starting before noon one of the gowned and hooded doctors quipped some of us are smart enough to test the water before we jump in the pool laurie shot back youre on table six one of the mortuary techs called out from a sink where he was washing out a length of intestine laurie looked back at lou who had paused just inside the door she saw him swallow hard although hed said hed seen autopsies before she had the feeling that he found this assembly line operation a bit overwhelming with the gut being washed out the smell wasnt too good either you can go outside anytime laurie said to him lou held up a hand im all right he said if you can take this i can too laurie walked down to table six lou followed her a gowned and hooded vinnie amendola appeared its you and me today dr montgomery vinnie said fine laurie said why dont you get everything well need and well get started vinnie nodded then went over to the supply cabinets laurie put out her note papers where she could get to them then looked at duncan andrews handsomelooking man she said i didnt think doctors thought that way lou said i thought you guys all switched into neutral or something hardly laurie said duncan s pale body lay in apparent repose on the steel table his eyelids were closed the only thing that marred his appearance aside from his pasty white color were the excoriations on his forearms laurie pointed to them those deep scratches are probably the result of whats called formication thats a tactile hallucination of bugs under or on the skin its seen in both cocaine and amphetamine intoxication lou shook his head i cant understand why people take drugs he said its beyond me they do it for pleasure laurie said unfortunately drugs like cocaine tap into parts of the brain that developed during evolution as the reward center it was to encourage behavior likely to perpetuate the species if the war against drugs is to succeed the fact that drugs can be pleasurable has to be admitted and not ignored why do i have the feeling you dont think much of the just say no campaign lou asked because i dont its stupid laurie said or at least shortsighted i dont think the politicians who dreamed that scheme up have a clue to what growing up in todays society is like especially for poor urban kids drugs are around and when kids try them and find out that drugs are pleasurable they think the powersthatbe are lying about the negative or dangerous side as well you ever try any of that stuff ive tried pot and cocaine really are you surprised laurie asked i suppose i am to an extent why lou shrugged i dont know i suppose you dont look the type laurie laughed i guess he looks more the type than i do right now she said pointing to andrews but when he was alive i bet he didnt look the type either yeah i tried some drugs in college despite what happened to my brother or maybe because of it what happened to your brother lou asked laurie looked down at the body of duncan andrews shed not meant to bring her brother into the conversation the comment had slipped out as if she were talking with someone with whom she was close did your brother overdose lou asked lauries eyes went from duncan s corpse to lou she couldnt lie yes she said but i dont want to talk about it fine lou said i dont mean to pry laurie turned back to duncan s body for a second she was immobilized by the thought it was her brothers body before her on that cold table she was relieved to be interrupted by vinnie returning with gloves specimen bottles preservatives labels and a series of instruments she was eager to get started and put these reveries behind her lets do it vinnie said he began applying the labels to the specimen jars laurie opened the gloves and put them on she put on her goggles and began a careful exterior examination of duncan andrews after looking at duncan s head she motioned for lou to step around to the other side of the table parting duncan s hair with her gloved hand she showed lou multiple bruises ill bet he had at least one convulsion laurie said lets look at the tongue laurie opened duncan s mouth the tongue was lacerated in several locations just what i expected she said now lets see how much cocaine this fellow has been using with a small flashlight and a nasal speculum she looked up duncan s nose no perforations looks normal guess he hadnt been sniffing much laurie straightened up she noticed lous attention had been directed at a neighboring table where they were busy sawing off the top of a skull their eyes met you okay laurie questioned im not sure lou said you actually do this every day on average three or four days a week laurie said you want to go outside for a while i can let you know when we do depasquale no ill be all right lets get on with it whats next i usually check the eyes laurie said she studied lou the last thing she wanted was for him to pass out and hit his head on the concrete floor that had happened to a visitor once before continue lou urged im fine laurie shrugged then she put her thumb and index finger on duncan s eyelids and drew them up lou gasped and turned away for a moment even laurie was taken aback the eyes were gone the pulpy red sockets were filled with pinkstained wads of gauze it gave the corpse a ghastly appearance okay lou said you got me you set me up and you got me ill have to give you that he turned back to laurie the bit of facial skin visible between his mask and his hood was blanched let me guess this was some sort of initiation ordeal for the rookie laurie let out a short nervous laugh im sorry lou she said id forgotten the eyes had been taken truly this was the case where the family was insistent that the deceaseds wishes to be an organ donor be honored if the eyes can be harvested within twelve hours they often can be used if there are no other contraindications occasionally it can even be longer than twelve hours if the body is chilled i dont mind being the butt of a joke lou said but it wasnt a joke laurie insisted im sorry honest id been called on this case yesterday with everything else thats happened id forgotten i just remembered this was a case where the victim took the cocaine iv lets see if we can find the injection site laurie rotated duncan s right arm palm up so she could examine its volar surface vinnie did the same with the left arm here it is laurie exclaimed pointing to a minute puncture wound over one of the veins in front of the elbow area i didnt know cocaine could be mainlined lou said its taken into the body just about every way you can imagine and some you cant laurie said iv is not common but its done as she spoke her mind took her back to the night before she found shelly dead in his bedroom hed just come home from yale and laurie was in his room eager to hear about college his open dopp kit was on his bed whats this laurie questioned she held up a pack of condoms give me that shelly shouted clearly peeved to have his baby sister find such a thing in his shaving kit laurie giggled as shelly snatched the contraceptives from her hand while shelly was busy burying them in his top bureau drawer laurie looked into the dopp kit to see what else she could find but what she saw was more disturbing than interesting touching it ever so gingerly laurie lifted a cc syringe from the bag it was the needle she was to see the following day what is this she demanded shelly came over and tried to grab the needle but laurie evaded him you got this from daddys office didnt you laurie demanded give me that or you are in serious trouble shelly snapped he trapped her against the wall laurie gripped the needle in both hands behind her back having grown up in new york city she knew what it meant when a fellow teenager had a needle are you shooting up laurie asked shelly overpowered her and got the needle he took it over to his bureau and hid it with his condoms then he turned back to his sister who hadnt moved ive tried it a couple of times shelly said its called speedball a lot of the guys at school do it its no big deal but i dont want you to say anything to mom or dad if you do ill never talk to you again you understand never lauries momentary reverie was cut short by the booming voice of calvin washington what the hell is going on here he yelled why havent you even started this case i came in here to see if you found anything we can hang our hats on and you havent even started get busy laurie sprang into action she completed her external examination noting only a few ecchymotic bruises on duncan s upper arms in addition to her other findings then she took a scalpel and expertly made the traditional yshaped incision from the points of the shoulders down to the pubis with vinnie helping she worked silently and quickly removing the breastbone and exposing the internal organs lou tried to stay out of the way im sorry if ive slowed you down he said when laurie paused allowing vinnie to organize the specimen bottles no problem laurie said when we do depasquale ill explain a bit more i just want to get andrews finished if calvin really gets mad there could be trouble i understand lou said would you rather i leave no not at all laurie said just dont get your feelings hurt when i ignore you for a while after laurie inspected all the internal organs in situ she used several syringes to take various fluids for toxicologic testing she and vinnie went through a precise procedure to make sure the right specimen got in the correctly labeled bottle then she began to remove the organs one by one she spent the most time on the heart until eventually it too was removed while vinnie took the stomach and the intestines to the sink to wash them out laurie carefully went through the heart taking multiple samples for later microscopic examination she then took similar samples from some of the other organs by then vinnie was back without any encouragement he began on the head reflecting the scalp after laurie inspected the skull she nodded to him to use the power vibrating saw to cut through the skull in a circular fashion just above the ears lou kept his distance when laurie lifted the brain out of its skull and plopped it into a pan held by vinnie wielding a longbladed knife similar to a butchers she began making serial cuts as if she were dealing with a slab of processed meat it was all an efficient wellpracticed duet requiring little conversation half an hour later laurie led lou out of the autopsy room leaving the aprons and gowns behind they went up to the lunchroom on the second floor for coffee they had about fifteen minutes while vinnie took duncan s remains away and put up the next case frank depasquale thanks but i dont think ill be eating anything for a few days lou said when offered something from one of the several vending machines in the lunchroom laurie poured herself another cup of coffee they sat at a formica table near the microwave oven there were about fifteen other people in the room all engaged in animated conversation seeing other people smoking lou took out a box of marlboros a pack of matches and lit up when he noticed lauries expression he took the cigarette out of his mouth okay if i smoke he asked if you must laurie said just one lou assured her well duncan andrews didnt have any pathology on gross she said and i dont think im going to find anything on histology either you can only do your best lou said if worse comes to worst dump it in calvins lap let him decide what to do as part of the brass its his job whoever does the autopsy has to sign out on the death certificate laurie said but maybe i can give it a try i was impressed with the way you handled that knife in the autopsy room lou said thanks for your compliment laurie said but why do i feel like i hear a but coming its just im surprised an attractive woman like yourself would choose this kind of work lou said laurie closed her eyes and let out a sigh of exasperation thats a rather chauvinistic comment she stared at lou unfortunately it undermines your compliment did you mean to say what is a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this hey im sorry lou said i didnt mean it that way at all talking about my appearance and my abilities and relating the two makes a negative comment about both laurie said she took a sip of her coffee she could tell that lou was bewildered and uncomfortable i dont mean to jump on you she added but im sick of defending my career choice and im also sick of hearing my looks and my gender have anything to do with my position maybe id better just keep my trap shut said lou laurie glanced up at the clock on the wall i think we should get downstairs im sure vinnie has depasquale on the table she gulped down the rest of her coffee and stood up lou stubbed out his cigarette and hurried after her five minutes later they were back in their gowns standing in front of the xray view box in the autopsy room looking at the xrays of frank depasquale the ap and the lateral of the head showed the bright silhouette of the bullet resting in the posterior fossa you were right about the location of the bullet laurie said there it is in the base of the brain gangland execution is very efficient lou said i can believe it laurie added the reason is that a bullet into the base of the brain hits the brainstem thats where the vital centers are for things like breathing and heartbeat i suppose if i have to go thats one way id like it to be lou said laurie looked at the detective thats a pleasant thought lou shrugged in my line of work you think about it laurie glanced back at the xray you were also right about its being small caliber id guess a twentytwo or a twentyfive at most thats what they usually use lou said the more powerful stuff is just too messy laurie led the way to table six where frankies mortal remains were laid out the corpse was slightly bloated the right eye was more swollen than the left he looks younger than eighteen laurie said more like fifteen lou agreed laurie asked vinnie to roll the body over so they could look at the back of the head with a gloved hand she parted his wet matted hair and exposed a round entrance wound surrounded by a larger round area of abrasion after taking some measurements and photographs laurie carefully shaved the surrounding hair to expose the wound completely it was obviously a closerange shot laurie said she pointed to the tight ring of gunpowder stippling around the punchedout center how close lou asked laurie pondered for a moment id say three or four inches something like that typical lou said laurie took another series of measurements and photographs then with a clean scalpel she carefully teased bits of the gunpowder residue from the depths of some of the small stippled puncture wounds by tapping the scalpel blade against the inside of a glass collection tube laurie preserved this material for laboratory analysis never know what the chemists can tell us she said she gave the tubes to vinnie to label we need a break lou said i dont care where it comes from when vinnie was finished labeling the collection tubes laurie had him help her turn frank back into a supine position whats wrong with the right eye lou asked i dont know laurie said from the xray it didnt look like the bullet went into the orbit but you never know the lid was a purplish color swollen conjunctiva protruded through the palpebral fissure gently laurie pulled up the eyelid ugh lou said that looks bad the first case had no eyes this one looks like the eyes been run over with a mack truck could that have happened when he was floating around in the east river laurie shook her head happened before death see the hemorrhages under the mucous membrane that means the heart was pumping he was alive when this occurred bending closer laurie studied the cornea by looking at the reflection of the overhead lights off its surface she could tell that the cornea was irregular plus it was a milky white reaching over to the left eye she lifted its lid in contrast to the right the left cornea was clear the eye stared blankly at the ceiling could the bullet have done that lou asked i dont think so laurie said it looks more like a chemical burn the way its affected the cornea well get a sample for toxicology ill look at it closely in sections under the microscope i have to admit i havent seen anything quite like it laurie continued her external exam when she looked at the wrists she pointed to them see these abrasions and indentations yeah lou said whats that mean id say this poor guy had been tied up maybe the eye lesion was some kind of torture these are nasty people lou said what irks me is that they hide behind this supposed code of ethics when in reality its just a dogeatdog world and what really irks me is that their screwing around tends to give all italianamericans a bad name as laurie examined franks hands and legs she asked lou why the vaccarro and lucia crime families were feuding for territory lou said they all have to sleep in the same bed queens and parts of nassau county they are forever at each others throats for territory they are in direct competition for their drugs loansharking gambling clubs fencing extortion rings hot car rings hijacking you name it and theyre into it theyre forever fighting and killing each other but its a mexican standoff so in a way they also have to get along its a weird world all this illegal activity goes on even today laurie questioned absolutely lou said and what we know about is just the tip of the iceberg why dont the police do something lou sighed were trying but it aint easy we need evidence as i explained before thats hard to get the bosses are insulated and the killers are pros even when weve got the goods on them they still have to go through the courts and nothing is guaranteed we americans have always been so worried about tyranny from the authorities that we legally give the bad guys the edge its difficult to believe so little can be done laurie said something can only be done if we get hard evidence take frank depasquale here im ninetynine percent sure cerino and his crew are responsible for whacking him but i cant do anything without some proof some break i thought the police had informers laurie said we have informers lou agreed but nobody who really knows anything the people that could really point a finger are more scared of each other than they are of us well maybe ill come up with something with this post laurie said redirecting her gaze to frank depasquales corpse the trouble is that bodies in water tend to be washed of evidence of course there is the bullet at the very least i can give you the bullet ill take whatever i can get lou said laurie and vinnie tackled the autopsy at each step she explained to lou what they were doing the only difference between franks autopsy and duncan s was the way laurie did the brain with frank she was meticulously careful to follow the bullets path she noted that it never came near to the swollen eye she was also careful not to touch the bullet with a metal instrument once shed retrieved it she put it into a plastic container to avoid scratching it later after it was dry she marked it on its base then photographed it before sealing it in a small envelope the envelope was then attached to a property receipt ready to be turned over to the police meaning sergeant murphy or his partner upstairs its been quite a morning lou said as they exited the autopsy room its been very instructive but i think ill pass on your third case i was surprised you tolerated two laurie said they paused outside the locker room ill go through the microscopic material on frank depasquale and ill let you know if anything interesting turns up the only thing that i think might be interesting is the eye but who knows well its been fun lou said he shifted his weight from one foot to the other laurie looked into the lieutenants dark eyes she had a feeling he wanted to ask her something else but couldnt seem to get it out im heading upstairs for another shot of coffee she said would you care for another before you run off sounds good lou said without hesitation up in the lunchroom they found themselves at the same table theyd occupied earlier laurie couldnt understand why the confident lou had become so fidgety and awkward she watched while he took out his cigarettes and matches and fumbled to light up youve been smoking for a long time laurie asked just to make conversation since i was twelve lou said in my neighborhood it was the thing to do he shook out his match and took a long drag have you ever considered stopping laurie asked absolutely lou said he blew smoke over his shoulder its easy to stop ive been doing it weekly for a year seriously though i do want to quit but its hard at headquarters most everybody smokes im sorry that we didnt come up with a breakthrough with depasquale laurie said maybe the bullet will help somehow lou said he dropped his cigarette into the ashtray while trying to balance it on the edge the ballistics people are pretty resourceful ouch lou pulled his hand away from the ashtray hed burned his finger on his cigarette lou are you all right laurie asked im fine lou said too quickly he tried again and this time succeeded in retrieving his cigarette you seem upset about something laurie said just have a lot on my mind lou said but there is something id like to ask are you married in spite of herself laurie smiled and shook her head now theres a question out of the blue i agree lou said also under the circumstances its not very professional laurie said i cant argue with that either lou admitted laurie paused as she had a miniargument with herself no she said finally im not married well in that case lou said struggling for words maybe we could have lunch someday im flattered lieutenant soldano laurie said uneasily but i usually dont mix my private life with work nor do i lou said what if i say maybe and ill think about it fine lou said laurie could tell he regretted having put the question to her he stood up abruptly laurie got up too but lou motioned for her to stay where she was finish your coffee i can testify that you need a break believe me ill just run downstairs change and be on my way let me hear from you with a wave lou left at the door he turned and waved again laurie waved back as lous figure disappeared from view he really was a bit like colombo intelligent yet lumbering and mildly disorganized at the same time he had a basic bluecollar charm and a refreshing downtoearth lack of pretense that appealed to her he also seemed lonely finishing her coffee laurie got up and stretched as she walked out of the lunchroom she realized that lou also reminded her a bit of her onagain offagain boyfriend sean mackenzie no doubt her mother would find lou equally as inappropriate laurie wondered if part of the reason she found herself attracted to such a type was because she knew her parents would disapprove if that was true she wondered when shed get this rebelliousness out of her system for good pressing the down button on the elevator it dawned on laurie that after lou had surprised her with his question shed failed to ask him if he were married she decided that if he called shed ask she checked her watch she was doing fine only one more autopsy to go and it was still before noon laurie checked the address shed jotted on a piece of paper then looked up at the impressive fifth avenue apartment building it was in the midseventies bordering on central park the entrance had a blue canvas scalloped awning that extended to the curb a liveried doorman stood expectantly just behind the glazed wroughtiron door as laurie approached the door the doorman pushed it open for her then politely asked if he could help her id like to speak to the superintendent laurie said she unbuttoned her coat while the doorman struggled with an oldfashioned intercom system laurie sat on a leather couch and glanced around the foyer it was tastefully decorated in restrained muted tones an arrangement of fresh fall flowers stood on a credenza it was not difficult for laurie to imagine duncan andrews striding confidently into the foyer of his apartment building picking up his mail and waiting for the elevator laurie glanced over at the bank of mailboxes discreetly shielded by a chinese wooden screen she wondered which one was duncan s and if letters awaited his arrival can i help you laurie stood and looked eyetoeye at a mustachioed hispanic stitched into his shirt above his breast pocket was the name juan im dr montgomery laurie said im from the medical examiners office laurie flipped open the leather cover of her wallet to reveal her shiny medical examiners badge it looked like a police badge how can i help you juan asked i would like to visit duncan andrews apartment laurie said im involved with his postmortem examination and id like to view the scene laurie purposefully kept her language official in truth she felt uncomfortable about what she was doing although some jurisdictions required medical examiners to visit death scenes the new york office didnt policy had evolved to delegate such duties to the forensic medical investigators but when laurie was training in miami she had had a lot of experience visiting scenes in new york she missed the added information such visits afforded yet she wasnt visiting duncan s apartment for such a reason she didnt expect to find anything that would add to the case she felt compelled more for personal reasons the idea of a privileged accomplished young man ending his life for a few moments of druginduced pleasure made her think of her brother this death had stirred up feelings of guilt shed suppressed for seventeen years mr andrews girlfriend is up there juan said at least i saw her go up half an hour ago directing his attention to the doorman he asked if ms wetherbee had left the doorman said she hadnt turning back to laurie juan added its apartment c ill take you up there laurie hesitated shed not expected anyone to be in the apartment she really didnt want to talk with any of the family members much less andrews girlfriend but juan was already in the elevator pressing the floor button and holding the door for her having presented herself in her official capacity she felt she couldnt leave juan pounded on the door to c when it didnt open immediately he pulled out a ring of keys the size of a baseball and began flipping through them the door opened just as he was about to insert a key standing in the doorway was a woman about lauries height with blond curly hair she was wearing a sweatshirt over acidwashed jeans fresh tears stained her cheeks juan introduced laurie as being from the hospital then excused himself i dont remember seeing you at the hospital sara said im not from the hospital laurie said im from the medical examiners office are you going to do an autopsy on duncan s body sara asked i already have laurie said i just wanted to see the scene where he died of course sara said she stepped back from the door come in laurie stepped into the apartment she felt extremely uncomfortable knowing she was intruding on this poor womans grief she waited while sara locked the door the apartment was spacious even from the foyer laurie could see out over the leafless expanse of central park unconsciously she shook her head at the senselessness of duncan andrews taking drugs at least on the surface his life seemed perfect duncan actually collapsed right here in the doorway sara said she pointed at the floor by the door fresh tears spilled down her cheeks just before i knocked he pulled it open it was as if hed gone crazy he was heading outside practically naked im terribly sorry laurie said drugs can do that to people cocaine can make them feel like theyre burning up i didnt even know he took drugs sara sobbed maybe if id gotten over here faster after he called it wouldnt have happened maybe if id stayed sunday evening drugs are such a curse laurie said no one is going to know the reason duncan took them but it was his choice you cant blame yourself laurie paused i know how you feel she said at last i found my big brother after hed overdosed really sara said through her tears laurie nodded for the second time that day laurie had admitted a secret that shed not shared with anyone for seventeen years this job was getting to her all right but in a way she had never expected the case of duncan andrews had touched her in a fashion no other case had ever done pm tuesday manhattan christ tony exclaimed here we are waiting again every night we wait i thought last night when we finally caught that prick depasquale things would move along but oh no were back here waiting like nothing happened angelo leaned forward and tapped the ash from his cigarette into the ashtray then leaned back he didnt say anything hed promised himself earlier that afternoon to ignore tony angelo regarded the busy street scene people were heading home after work walking their dogs or coming back from the grocery store he and tony were parked in a loading zone on park avenue between eightyfirst and eightysecond headed north both sides of the street were filled with highrise apartment buildings whose first floors were filled with professional office suites im going to get out and do some pushups tony said shut the hell up angelo snapped despite his vow to disregard his partner we went over this last night you dont get out and do pushups when were waiting for action whats the matter with you you want a neon sign or something to let the cops know were sitting here were not supposed to call attention to ourselves cant you understand that all right tony said dont get pissed i wont get out in utter frustration angelo blew through pursed lips and beat a nervous rhythm on the steering wheel with the first two fingers of his right hand tony was wearing even for angelos practiced calm if we want to hit the doctors office why dont we just go in there and do it tony said after a pause it dont make sense wasting all this time were waiting for the secretary angelo said we want to be sure the place is empty plus she can let us in we dont want to break down any doors if she lets us in then shes there and its not empty anymore tony said it doesnt make sense trust me angelo said this is the best way to do what we have to do nobody ever tells me anything tony brooded this whole operation is weird breaking into a doctors office is crazy its even crazier than when we broke into the manhattan organ repository at least there we got a few hundred in cash what the hell are we going to find in a doctors office if it doesnt take too long we can see if theres any cash in here too angelo said maybe we can also look for percodan and stuff like that if it will make you happy hard way to get a few pills tony muttered angelo laughed in spite of his aggravation what do you think about old doc travino tony asked do you think he knows what the hell hes talking about personally i have my doubts angelo said but cerino trusts him and thats whats important come on angelo tony whined tell me why were going in there isnt cerino happy with this doc cerino loves the guy angelo said he thinks hes the best in the world in fact thats why were going in but why tony asked tell me that and ill shut up for some of the guys records angelo said i knew it was crazy tony said but not that crazy what are we going to do with the guys records you told me you would shut up if i told you what we were after so shut up besides youre not supposed to ask so many questions there thats just what i was complaining about tony said nobody tells me whats going on if i knew more about what was happening i could do more i could be more help angelo laughed sarcastically i can tell you dont believe me tony complained but its true try me im sure id have some suggestions even for this job everything is going fine angelo assured him planning is not your strong suit whacking people is thats true tony agreed thats what i like best bam its over none of this complicated stuff therell be enough whacking over the next couple of weeks to satisfy even you angelo promised i cant wait tony said maybe it will make up for all this waiting around there she is angelo said he pointed ahead to a heavyset woman emerging from one of the apartment buildings she was busy buttoning a red coat with one hand and holding a hat to her head with the other okay lets go angelo said but keep your piece out of sight and let me do all the talking angelo and tony got out of the car they walked over to the woman just as she joined a cab line mrs schulman angelo called the woman turned toward angelo her distrustful hauteur evaporated as soon as she recognized the man hello mr she said trying to remember angelos name facciolo angelo offered of course she said and how is mr cerino getting along just great mrs schulman angelo said hes getting pretty good with his cane but he asked me to come over here to talk to you do you have a minute i suppose mrs schulman said what is it youd like to talk about its confidential angelo said id prefer if you came over to the car for a moment angelo gestured toward the black town car obviously discomfited by this request mrs schulman muttered something about having to be somewhere shortly angelo slipped a hand into his jacket pocket and lifted his walther automatic pistol just enough so mrs schulman could see its butt im afraid i have to insist angelo said we wont take much of your time and afterwards well be sure to drop you off someplace convenient mrs schulman glanced at tony who smiled back all right she said nervously as long as it doesnt take too long that will be up to you angelo said motioning toward the car again tony led the way mrs schulman slid into the front seat when tony opened the door for her with a courteous bow tony got in the back while angelo climbed into the drivers seat does this have something to do with my husband danny schulman mrs schulman asked danny schulman from bayside angelo said is he your old man yes he is mrs schulman said whos danny schulman tony asked from the backseat he owns a joint in bayside called crystal palace angelo said a lot of the lucia people go there hes very well connected mrs schulman said maybe you men would like to talk with him no this has nothing to do with danny angelo said all we want to know is if the good doctors office is empty yes everyone has gone for the day mrs schulman said i locked up as i usually do thats good angelo said because we want you to go back inside were interested in some of the doctors records what records mrs schulman asked ill tell you when we get inside angelo said but before we go i want you to know that if you decide to do anything foolish itd be the last foolish thing you do do i make myself clear quite clear mrs schulman said regaining some of her composure this isnt a big deal angelo added i mean were civilized people i understand mrs schulman said okay lets go angelo said and he opened his door hello miss montgomery george said george was one of the doormen at lauries parents apartment house hed been there for decades he looked sixty but he was actually seventytwo he liked to tell laurie that hed been the one to open the cab door the day her mother had brought laurie home from the hospital just days after her birth after a brief chat with george laurie went on up to her parents so many memories even the smell of the place was familiar but more than anything the apartment reminded her of that awful day shed found her brother shed almost wished her parents had moved after the tragedy just so she wouldnt have to be constantly reminded of her brothers overdose hello dear her mother crooned as she let laurie into the foyer dorothy montgomery bent forward and offered her daughter a cheek she smelled of expensive perfume her silvergray hair was cut short in a style that was making the covers of womens fashion magazines lately dorothy was a petite vibrant woman in her midsixties who looked younger than her years thanks to a second facelift as dorothy took lauries coat she cast a critical eye over her daughters attire i see you didnt wear the wool suit i bought for you no mother i did not laurie said she closed her eyes hoping her mother wouldnt start in on her this early at least you could have worn a dress laurie refrained from responding shed chosen a jacquard blouse embellished with mock jewels and a pair of wool pants that shed gotten from a mail order catalogue an hour earlier shed thought it was one of her best outfits now she wasnt so sure no matter dorothy said after hanging up lauries coat come on i want you to meet everyone especially dr scheffield our guest of honor dorothy led laurie into the formal living room a room reserved exclusively for entertaining there were eight people in the room each balancing a drink in one hand and a canapé in the other laurie recognized most of these guests four married couples whod been friends of her parents for years three of the men were physicians the other a banker like her own mother the wives werent career women they devoted their time to charities just as her mother did after some small talk dorothy dragged laurie down the hall to the library where sheldon montgomery was showing jordan scheffield some rare medical textbooks sheldon introduce your daughter to dr scheffield dorothy commanded interrupting her husband in midsentence both men looked up from a book in sheldons hands lauries gaze went from her fathers dour aristocratic face to jordan scheffields and she was pleasantly surprised she had expected jordan to look more like her image of an ophthalmologist that hed be older heavier stodgy and far less attractive but the man who stood before her was dramatically handsome with sandy blond hair tanned skin bright blue eyes and rugged angular features not only didnt he look like an ophthalmologist he didnt even look like a doctor he looked more like a professional athlete he was even taller than her father who was sixtwo and instead of a glenn plaid suit like her father was wearing he had on tan slacks a blue blazer and a white shirt open at the collar he wasnt even wearing a tie laurie shook hands with jordan as sheldon made the introductions his grip was forceful and sure he looked directly into her eyes and smiled pleasantly the fact that sheldon liked jordan was immediately apparent to laurie as he pounded him on the back insisting he get him some more of the special scotch he usually hid when company came sheldon went to get the prized liquor leaving laurie alone with jordan your parents are extremely hospitable jordan said they can be laurie said they enjoy entertaining they certainly were looking forward to your coming tonight im glad to be here jordan said your father had nothing but nice things to say about you ive been looking forward to meeting you thank you laurie said she was mildly surprised to hear that her father had spoken of her at all let alone spoken well likewise said laurie frankly youre not what id expected what did you expect jordan asked well said laurie suddenly slightly embarrassed i thought youd look like an ophthalmologist throwing his head back jordan laughed heartily and just what does an ophthalmologist look like laurie was relieved when her father came back with jordan s refill thus sparing her an explanation her father told jordan that he wanted to show him some ancient surgical instruments in the den as jordan obediently followed his host he sent a conspiratorial smile lauries way at dinner jordan was responsible for lightening the atmosphere he managed to force even the most reserved of lauries parents friends to open up hearty laughter filled the room for the first time in recent memory sheldon encouraged jordan to tell certain stories hed told sheldon about his famous patients jordan was only too happy to oblige and he recounted the stories in an exuberant almost boastful manner that had everyone laughing even lauries emotional day receded into the background as she heard jordan s amusing tales of the rich and famous who passed through his office each day jordan s specialty was the anterior part of the eye particularly the cornea but he also did some plastic surgery even cosmetic plastic surgery hed treated celebrities ranging from movie stars to royalty he had everyone in stitches about a prince from saudi arabia whod come to his office along with dozens of servants then he went on to name drop a few sports figures he was treating finally he mentioned hed even treated the occasional mafioso as in mafia dorothy asked with horrified disbelief absolutely jordan said god is my witness honesttogoodness mobsters in fact just this month ive been seeing a paul cerino who is obviously connected to the underworld over in queens laurie choked on her white wine at jordan s mention of paul cerinos name hearing it for the second time that day startled her the conversation stopped as everyone looked at her with concern she waved off their attention and managed to say she was all right once she could speak again she asked jordan what he was treating paul cerino for acid burns in his eyes jordan said someone had thrown acid into his face luckily he had been smart enough to rinse his eyes with water almost immediately acid how dreadful dorothy said its not as bad as alkali alkali can eat right through the cornea sounds ghastly dorothy said how are cerinos eyes doing laurie asked she was thinking of frank depasquales right eye wondering if that could be the beginning of the break that lou had been hoping for the acid opacified both corneas jordan said but the fact that he washed his eyes out saved the conjunctiva from extensive damage so he should do well with corneal transplants which well be doing soon does it frighten you to be involved with these people one guest asked not at all jordan said they need me im of use to them they wouldnt harm me in fact i find it all rather comical and entertaining how do you know this cerino is a mobster one of the other guests asked jordan gave a short laugh its pretty apparent he comes in with several bodyguards who have obvious telltale bulges in their suits paul cerino is a known mobster laurie said hes one of the midlevel bosses of the vaccarro crime family which is currently warring with the lucia organization how do you know that dorothy asked this morning i autopsied a ganglandstyle execution victim the authorities believe the murder was a direct result of the feud and they would like nothing better than to associate the killing with paul cerino how hideous dorothy said with disdain laurie thats enough lets talk about something else this isnt appropriate dinner conversation sheldon agreed then turning to jordan he added youll have to excuse my daughter since she abandoned her medical education and went into pathology shes somewhat lost her sense of etiquette pathology jordan questioned he looked over at laurie you didnt tell me you are a pathologist you didnt ask me laurie said she smiled to herself knowing that jordan had been too busy talking about his own affairs to have asked about hers actually im a forensic pathologist currently working for the office of the chief medical examiner here in new york maybe we should talk about this season at lincoln center dorothy suggested i dont know much about forensics jordan said we only had two lectures on it in medical school and before them we were told that the material would not be on the exam so guess what i did jordan pretended to fall asleep by snoring and allowing his head to drop onto his chest sheldon laughed at jordan s antics we only had one lecture and i cut it he confessed i think we should change the subject dorothy said the problem with laurie sheldon said to jordan was that she didnt go into surgery where she could have been dealing with the living we have a gal in the thoracic program whos unbelievable as good as a man laurie could have done equally as well it took every ounce of selfrestraint laurie possessed not to lash out at her fathers inane sexist remark instead she calmly defended her specialty forensics very much deals with the living and it does it by speaking for the dead she told the story of the curling iron and how knowledge of the cause of that fatality could potentially save someone elses life when laurie finished there was an uncomfortable pause everyone looked down at their place settings and toyed with their flatware even jordan seemed strangely subdued finally dorothy broke the silence by announcing that dessert and cognac would be served in the living room by the time the group had reassembled in the living room laurie was uncomfortable enough to consider leaving as she watched the others fall effortlessly into conversations she debated taking her mother aside and making the excuse that it was a school night but before she could decide a discreet maid hired for the evening appeared at lauries side with her serving tray filled with brandy snifters accepting a cognac laurie turned her back on the group with drink in hand she slipped down the hall and into the den mind if i join you jordan had followed her from the living room not at all laurie said mildly startled she thought her exit had not been noticed she tried to smile she sat in a leather club chair while jordan leaned comfortably against a massive rearprojection tv sounds of laughter drifted in from the living room i didnt mean to make fun of your specialty he said i actually find pathology fascinating oh laurie said i enjoyed the story about the curling iron he added i had no idea you could get electrocuted with such an appliance unless you dropped it in the tub while you were taking a bath you might have said so at the time she knew she wasnt being polite but she wasnt feeling particularly hospitable just then jordan nodded sorry he said i guess i felt a little inhibited by your parents its pretty obvious they are not wild about your specialty choice is it that obvious laurie asked indeed jordan said i couldnt believe your fathers remark about that woman in their thoracic program and your mother kept trying to change the subject of the conversation you should have heard my mothers comment the day i told her i was going into forensics she said what will i tell people at the club who ask me what you do that gives you a pretty good idea of her feelings and my father the quintessential cardiac surgeon he thinks that anything other than surgery specifically thoracic surgery is for the weak the timid and the retarded not an easy pair to please it must be hard on you frankly ive caused them some heartache through the years i was a pretty rebellious kid dating rough types riding motorcycles staying out late the usual maybe i trained my parents to be wary of everything i do theyve never been particularly supportive in fact theyve kind of ignored me especially my father your father certainly speaks highly of you now jordan said practically every time i run into him in the surgical lounge well its news to me laurie said anybody want more cognac sheldon called hed stuck his head into the den waving the bottle of cognac jordan said no laurie merely shook her head sheldon told them to give a yell if they changed their minds then he left them enough said laurie this is much too serious a conversation i didnt mean to put a damper on the evening she actually was sorry shed revealed so much to jordan it wasnt like her to confide in a relative stranger this way similar to what shed done with lou soldano but shed been feeling vulnerable all day ever since shed been assigned duncan andrews you didnt put a damper on anything jordan assured her then he looked at his watch say he said its getting late and i have surgery in the morning my first case at seventhirty is an english baron who sits in the house of lords really laurie said without much interest i think ill be calling it a night jordan added id be delighted to give you a lift home that is of course if you are intending to leave id love a ride home laurie said ive been thinking about leaving since we got up from the table after the appropriate goodbyes during which dorothy let laurie know her coat was far too thin for late fall jordan and laurie left the party and waited at the elevator mothers laurie said once the doors had closed behind them as they rode down jordan started talking about the parade of celebrities due in his office the next day laurie wasnt sure if he was trying to impress her or merely cheer her up emerging from the building into the cold november air jordan switched the conversation to the surgical aspect of his practice laurie was nodding as if listening in reality she was waiting for some signal from jordan whether hed parked his car to the north or to the south for a moment they stopped directly in front of the building while jordan told laurie how many surgical cases he did in a year sounds like youre busy laurie said could be busier jordan admitted if i had my way id be doing twice the amount of surgery im doing now surgery is what i enjoy its what im best at which way is your car laurie finally asked she was shivering oh im sorry he said its right here he pointed to a long black limousine sitting directly in front of her parents building as if on cue a liveried driver leaped out and held the rear door open for laurie this is thomas jordan said laurie said hello and slipped in the sleek automobile thomas looked as though he could have moonlighted as a bouncer he was powerfully built the limos interior was elegantly luxurious complete with a cellular phone dictaphone and fax well laurie said noticing all the equipment you look ready for business or pleasure jordan smiled he was clearly pleased with his style of living where to he asked laurie gave her address on nineteenth street and they pulled out into traffic i never imagined you had a limo laurie said isnt it a bit extravagant perhaps a bit jordan agreed his white teeth shone in the halflight of the cars interior but there is a practical side to this ostentation i do all my dictation work to and from work and even between work and the hospital so in a sense the car pays for itself thats an interesting way of looking at it its not merely a rationalization jordan said he went on to describe other ways hed organized his practice to boost his productivity as laurie listened she couldnt help compare jordan scheffield with lou soldano they couldnt have been more opposite one was selfeffacing the other arrogantly narcissistic one was provincial the other sophisticated and where one could be awkward the other was smoothly adroit yet despite their differences laurie found each attractive in his own way as they turned onto nineteenth street jordan s monologue stopped abruptly im boring you with all this shop talk he said i can see you are committed laurie said i like that jordan stared at her his eyes sparkled ive truly enjoyed meeting you tonight he said i wish wed had more time to talk how about having dinner with me tomorrow night laurie smiled it had been a day of surprises shed not been dating much since her ninetieth breakup with sean mackenzie yet she found jordan interesting despite his seemingly overbearing nature impulsively she decided it might be fun to see a little more of the man even if her parents did approve of him id love to have dinner laurie said wonderful jordan said how about le cirque i know the maitre d there and hell give us a great table is eight oclock okay eight is fine laurie said although she began to have second thoughts as soon as jordan suggested le cirque for a first date she would have preferred a less formal environment what the hell time is it tony asked my battery must have died in my watch he shook his wrist then tapped the crystal angelo extended his arm and glanced at his piaget its eleven eleven i dont think brunos coming out tony said why dont we go in and see if hes there because we dont want mrs marchese to see us angelo said if she sees us then we got to do her too and thats not right the lucia people might do that kind of stuff but we dont besides look here comes the punk now angelo pointed to the front entrance of the tiny twostory row house bruno marchese emerged into the night dressed in a black leather jacket freshly pressed guess jeans and sunglasses he paused for a moment on the front steps of the house to light a cigarette tossing the match into the shrubbery he started toward the sidewalk get a load of those shades angelo said must think hes jack nicholson my guess is that hes going socializing he should have stayed home the trouble with you young guys is that your brains are in your balls lets get him tony urged hold on angelo said let him round the corner well nab him when he walks under the railroad tracks five minutes later they had bruno cowering in the backseat staring into tonys smiling face the pickup had gone even more smoothly than it had with frankie the only casualty had been brunos sunglasses which ended up in the gutter surprised to see us angelo asked after they had driven a short while angelo looked at bruno in the rearview mirror whats this about bruno demanded tony laughed oh a tough guy tough and dumb how about i give him a few whacks with my gun its about the cerino incident angelo said we want to hear about it from you i dont know anything about it bruno said i never even heard of it thats funny angelo said weve had it from a friend of yours that you were involved who bruno asked frankie depasquale angelo said he watched brunos expression change the kid was terrified and for good reason frankie didnt know crap bruno said i dont know anything about any cerino incident if you dont know anything about it how come youre hiding out at your mothers house angelo asked im not hiding out bruno said i got kicked out of my apartment so im just staying there a few days angelo shook his head they drove to the american fresh fruit company in silence once they were there angelo and tony brought bruno to the same spot theyd brought frankie as soon as bruno saw the hole in the floor his toughguy stance melted all right you guys he said what do you want to know thats better angelo said first sit down once bruno had complied angelo leaned toward him and said tell us about it he took out a cigarette and lit up blowing smoke up toward the ceiling i dont know much bruno said i only drove the car i wasnt inside besides they made me do it who made you do it angelo asked and remember if you give me any bull now youll be in deep trouble terry manso bruno said it was all his idea i didnt even know what was going on until after it was all over who else beside you manso and depasquale were involved in all this angelo said jimmy lanso bruno said who else angelo demanded thats all bruno insisted what did jimmy do angelo asked he went into the place early to locate the electrical panel bruno said he made the lights go out who ordered this hit angelo asked i told you bruno said it was all mansos idea angelo took another long pull on his cigarette then tilted his head back as he blew out the smoke he tried to think if there was anything else that he needed to ask this punk when he decided there wasnt he glanced at tony and nodded bruno id like to ask a favor angelo said id like you to take a message back to vinnie dominick do you think you could do that for me no problem bruno said a bit of his earlier toughness returned to the timbre of his voice the message is angelo began but he didnt finish the sound of tonys bantam made angelo flinch when it wasnt your own gun it always sounded louder since they hadnt tied bruno to the chair his whole body sagged forward and crumpled to the floor angelo stood over him and shook his head i think vinnie will get the message he said tony looked at his gun with a mixture of admiration and pleasure then took out a handkerchief and wiped the soot from the muzzle it gets easier every time i do it he said to angelo angelo didnt respond instead he squatted down next to brunos body and pulled out his wallet there were several hundreddollar bills and a few smaller denominations he handed one of the hundreds to tony the rest he pocketed then he put the wallet back give me a hand he told tony together they carried bruno over to the hole and tossed him into the river like frankie bruno obligingly floated quickly away pausing only momentarily against one of the piers piles angelo brushed off his trousers brunos body had kicked up some dust from the floor you hungry angelo asked im starved tony said lets go over to valentinos on steinway street angelo said im in the mood for a pizza a few minutes later angelo backed up the town car then made a threepoint turn to exit through the chainlink gate at the junction of java and manhattan avenue he made a left then gunned the car its amazing how easy it is to whack somebody tony said i remember when i was a kid i used to think it was a big deal there was a guy who lived on the next block we kids had heard that hed bumped somebody off we used to sit outside his house just to see him come out he was our hero what kind of pizza you want angelo asked pepperoni tony said i remember the first time i whacked somebody i was so excited i got the trots it even gave me bad dreams but now its just fun its work angelo said i wish youd understand that which list we going to work off of after we eat tony asked the old one or the new one the old one angelo said i want to show the new one to cerino just to be sure no sense making work for ourselves am wednesday manhattan from where laurie was standing she could see her brother heading for the lake he was walking quickly laurie was afraid he might break into a run she thought he knew about the mud and how dangerously deep it was yet he kept going as if he didnt care shelly laurie cried either he was ignoring her or he couldnt hear laurie yelled again as loud as she could but still he didnt respond she started running after him he was only a step away from the horrid ooze stop laurie yelled dont go near the water stay away but shelly kept walking by the time laurie reached the lakeside he was already in black mud up to his waist he had turned back toward shore help me he cried laurie came to a stop just at the edge she reached out for him but their hands could not touch laurie turned and screamed for help but no one was in sight turning back to shelly she saw that he had sunk up to his neck there was pure terror in his eyes as he sank further his mouth opened and he screamed shellys scream merged into a mechanical ringing that pulled laurie from her sleep still desperate to help shelly lauries hand shot out and swept the westclox from the windowsill the same movement toppled a halffull glass of water and collided with the book shed been reading the night before the clock the glass of water and the book all fell to the floor lauries sudden movement and the crash of the things on the floor so surprised tom that he leaped first to the top of the bureau where he knocked off most of lauries cosmetics then to the valance over the window unable to make the top of the valance toms claws sank into the upholstered front and the sudden weight brought the valance down with the commotion and the noise laurie was out of bed before she knew what she was doing it was a few seconds before the sound of the alarm clock shocked her into full awake reaching down for it she managed to shut it off for a moment laurie stood in the ruins of her room to catch her breath shed not had that particular nightmare for years probably not since college and its effect was more upsetting than the disarray of her room perspiration dotted her forehead and she could feel her heart beating in her chest after shed sufficiently recovered she went into the kitchen for the dustpan to clean up the broken glass next she picked up the cosmetics from the floor and stacked them on her bureau the valance was too big a task she decided to leave that for later in the day she found tom hiding under the sofa in the living room after coaxing him out she held him in her lap and stroked him for a few minutes until he started purring about ten minutes later she was about to step into the shower when the doorbell rang now what she thought clutching a towel she went to her intercom and asked who was there its thomas a voice said thomas who laurie yelled back dr scheffields driver the voice said im here to deliver something at the request of the doctor he couldnt come himself because hes already in surgery ill be right down laurie said laurie quickly threw on a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt youre early this morning debra engler was poised as usual at her door laurie was grateful when the elevator arrived thomas tipped his hat when he saw her he said he hoped he hadnt woken her what he had for her was a long white box tied with a thick red ribbon laurie thanked him for the package and went back upstairs putting the box on the kitchen table she untied the red bow opened the box and spread the inside tissue paper nestled within the paper were several dozen longstemmed red roses on top of the flowers was a card that said until tonight jordan laurie caught her breath never having been the recipient of such a flamboyant gesture she didnt know quite how to react she wasnt even sure if accepting them was appropriate or not but what could she do she couldnt send them back reaching into the box laurie lifted one of the blossoms and smelled its springlike sweetness and looked at its deep ruby color even though the arrival of the roses confused her and made her feel uncomfortable she also had to admit that it was romantic and flattering getting the largest vase she had laurie put half of the roses into water then carried them into the living room she put the vase on her coffee table she thought she could get used to having cut flowers in her apartment the effect was amazing returning to the kitchen laurie put the cover on the box and retied the ribbon if a dozen roses could do so much for her apartment she could only guess what they would do for her office oh my god laurie said when she saw the time in a panic she tore off her clothes and jumped into the shower it was almost eightthirty before laurie arrived at the medical examiners office a good half hour later than usual feeling guilty she went directly to the id office even though given the box of roses she would have preferred to go to her office first dr bingham wants to see you calvin said as soon as he saw laurie but get your butt back here on the double we got a lot of cases to do laurie put her briefcase and box of roses down on an empty desk she was selfconscious about the roses but if calvin noticed he didnt give any indication hurrying back through the reception area laurie presented herself to mrs sanford given her last time in the chiefs office laurie was apprehensive to say the least she tried to imagine what he wanted this time but she couldnt hes on the phone right this minute mrs sanford said would you care to sit down it should only be a moment laurie went over to a couch but before she could sit down mrs sanford was speaking into her intercom dr bingham was ready to see her taking a deep breath laurie walked into the chiefs office as she approached his desk his head was down he was writing he made laurie stand while he finished his note then he looked up for a moment he studied her with his cold blue eyes he shook his head and sighed after months of flawless work you seem to have developed a penchant for trouble dont you like your work doctor of course i like my work dr bingham laurie said alarmed sit down bingham said he folded his hands and placed them resolutely on his blotter laurie sat down on the very edge of the chair facing dr bingham then perhaps you do not like working at this particular office he said it was half question half statement quite the contrary laurie said i love being here what makes you think i dont only because it is the only way i can explain your behavior laurie returned his gaze evenly i have no idea what behavior you are referring to she said im referring to your visit yesterday afternoon to the apartment of the deceased duncan andrews where you apparently gained access by flashing your official credentials did you go there or have i been misinformed i was there laurie said didnt calvin tell you that we have been getting some pressure from the mayors office about this case he said something to that effect laurie said but the only aspect of the case he discussed with me with regard to that pressure concerned the official cause of death wouldnt that make you think that this was somehow a sensitive case and that maybe you should be as circumspect as possible in all respects laurie tried to imagine who would have complained about her visit and why certainly not sara wetherbee while she was thinking she realized dr bingham was waiting for a response i didnt think that visiting the scene would upset anyone she said at last it is true you didnt think dr bingham said that is painfully obvious can you tell me why you went to visit this scene after all the body was gone hell youd already finished the autopsy and on top of that we have medical investigators to do that type of thing medical investigators whom we had warned not to meddle in this particular case so that brings me back to the question why did you go laurie tried to think of an explanation without becoming personal she did not want to discuss her brothers overdose with dr bingham particularly not now i asked you a question dr montgomery bingham said when laurie failed to respond i hadnt found anything on autopsy laurie said finally there was no pathology i suppose i went in desperation to see if the scene might reveal a plausible alternative to the drugs the man had obviously taken this is in addition to asking cheryl myers to look into the mans medical history thats right laurie said under normal circumstances bingham said such initiative might be commendable but under the present circumstances it has added to the problems of this office the father who happens to be very politically connected found out you were there and screamed bloody murder as if were out to ruin his senatorial campaign and all this is on top of the central park preppy ii case which has already caused enough trouble with the mayors office we dont need any more do you understand yes sir laurie said i hope so bingham said he looked down at the work on his desk that will be all dr montgomery laurie walked out of the chiefs office and took a deep breath this was the closest she had ever come to being fired two unpleasant summonses to the chiefs office in three days laurie couldnt help but think that one more time in front of bingham and she would be out you and the chief square things away calvin asked when laurie reappeared i hope so laurie said me too calvin said because i need you in top form he handed her a pack of folders youve got four cases today two more overdoses like the duncan andrews case and two more floaters fresh floaters i might add i figured since you did the same kind of cases yesterday youd be the fastest today theres a lot of work for everyone i had to give several people five cases so consider yourself lucky laurie flipped through the folders to make sure that they were complete then she took them her briefcase and her box of roses up to her office before she did anything else she went to the lab and borrowed the largest flask she could find taking the roses from the box she arranged them and filled the flask with water after putting the flowers on the lab bench she stepped back she had to smile they were so glaringly out of place sitting down at her desk laurie started with the first folder she didnt get far the moment she opened it there was a knock on her door come in she said the door opened slowly and lou soldano poked his face in hope im not bothering you too much he said im sure you didnt expect to see me he looked as though hed never gone to bed the previous night he was wearing the same baggy unpressed suit and he still hadnt managed to shave youre not bothering me laurie said come in so how are you today he asked once hed come in and sat down he put his hat in his lap except for a little runin with the boss i guess im fine wasnt about my being here yesterday was it lou asked no laurie said something i did yesterday afternoon which i suppose i shouldnt have but its always easy to say that after the fact i hope you dont mind my coming back today but i understand you have a couple more cases like poor frankies they were found almost in the same spot by the same night security guard so i was back out at the south street sea port at five in the morning wow he said suddenly spotting lauries flask fancy flowers they werent here yesterday you like them she asked pretty impressive lou said they from an admirer laurie wasnt sure how to answer i guess youd call him that well thats nice lou said he looked down at his hat and straightened the brim anyway dr washington said he assigned the cases to you so here i am do you mind if i tag along again not at all laurie said if you think you can take several more autopsies im glad to have you im pretty sure at least one of the deaths is related to frankies lou said moving forward in his chair the name is bruno marchese same age as frankie and about the same position in the organization the reason we know so much so quickly is that his wallet was found on his body just as frankies was obviously whoever killed him wanted the fact of his death to be immediately known like an advertisement when it happened with frankie we thought it had been a lucky accident when it happens twice we know its deliberate and it has us worried something big might be about to happen like an allout war between the two organizations if thats the case weve got to stop it a lot of innocent people get killed in any war was he killed the same way laurie asked as she went through the folders until she came across brunos same way lou said ganglandstyle execution shot in the back of the head from close range and with a smallcaliber bullet laurie added as she finished with brunos folder and picked up the phone she dialed the morgue when someone answered she asked for vinnie are we together again today laurie asked youre stuck with me all week vinnie said we got two floaters laurie said bruno marchese and laurie looked over at lou whats the name of the other one we dont know lou said theres been no id no wallet laurie asked worse than that lou said both the head and the hands are missing this one they didnt want us to identify at all lovely laurie said sarcastically the post will be of limited value without the head to vinnie she said i want to be sure bruno marchese and the headless man get xrayed were already working on it vinnie said but its going to be a while theyre in line busy down here today there was some kind of gang war up in harlem last night so were knee deep in gunshot wounds and by the way the headless corpse is a woman not a man when will you be down here shortly laurie said make sure we have a rapekit for the female she hung up and looked over at lou you didnt tell me one of the floaters was a woman i didnt have a chance lou said well no matter laurie said unfortunately the cases you are interested in wont be first im sorry no problem lou said i like to watch you work laurie scanned the material in the folder on the headless woman then she perused one of the overdose folders shed only got as far as the investigators report before she reached for the last folder and scanned its investigators report this is amazing she said she looked up at lou dr washington said these cases were the same as duncan andrews i had no idea he was speaking so literally what a coincidence are they cocaine overdoses lou asked yes laurie said but thats not what makes them such a coincidence ones a banker the other an editor whats so amazing about that lou asked its the demographics laurie said all three were successful professionals actively employed young single people hardly the usual overdose were accustomed to seeing around here like i said whats so amazing about that arent these people the kind of yuppies who made coke popular whats the big surprise the fact that they took cocaine is not the surprising aspect laurie began slowly im not naive behind the veneer of material success can lie some pretty serious addictions but as i told you the overdose cases we get in here are usually the truly down and out with crack you see a lot of very impoverished lowerclass people we do see more prosperous people from time to time but usually by the time the drugs kill them theyve already lost everything else job family money these recent cases just dont strike me as typical overdoses it makes me wonder if there wasnt some kind of poison in the drug now where did i put that article from the american journal of medicine she said talking more to herself ah here it is laurie pulled out a reprint of an article and handed it to lou street cocaine is always cut with something usually sugars or common stimulants but sometimes with weird stuff that article is about a series of poisonings resulting from a kilo of cocaine cut with strychnine wow lou said as he scanned the article that would be quite a trip itd be a quick trip in here to the morgue laurie agreed seeing three rather atypical od cases with such strikingly similar demographics in two days makes me wonder if they each got the cocaine from the same contaminated source i think its a long shot lou said especially with only three cases and quite frankly even if your hunch is right im not that interested not interested laurie couldnt believe what she was hearing with all the problems this city has with all the violence and street crime going down its hard for me to muster much sympathy for a trio of fancy pants who have nothing better to do with their leisure time than do illegal drugs frankly im much more concerned about poor slobs like that headless female floater we got downstairs laurie was stunned but before she could launch into a rebuttal her phone rang she was surprised to hear jordan scheffield on the other end when she picked up i finished my first case he said went perfectly im sure the baron will be pleased glad to hear it laurie said glancing selfconsciously at lou did you get the flowers jordan asked yes laurie said im looking at them this very minute thank you they were just what the doctor ordered very clever jordan laughed i thought it would be an appropriate way to let you know that im looking forward to seeing you tonight the gesture might fall into the same category as your limo laurie said a bit on the extravagant side but i appreciate your thinking of me well i just wanted to check in ive got to get back to surgery jordan said see you at eight im sorry lou said once laurie had hung up you could have told me it was a personal call i would have stepped out into the hall i usually dont get personal calls here laurie said it took me by surprise a dozen roses a limo must be an interesting guy he is interesting laurie said in fact he said something last night that i think youll find interesting thats hard to believe lou said but im all ears the man on the phone is a doctor laurie said his name is jordan scheffield you may have heard of him supposedly hes quite well known at any rate he told me last night that he has been taking care of the man you are so interested in mr paul cerino no fooling lou said he was surprised he was also interested jordan scheffield is an ophthalmologist laurie said wait a sec lou said he held up a hand while he reached into his jacket and pulled out a tattered pad of paper and a ballpoint pen let me write this down while he bit on his tongue he wrote out jordan s name then he asked laurie to spell ophthalmologist is that the same as optometrist lou asked no laurie said an ophthalmologist is a medical doctor trained to do surgery as well as manage medical eye care an optometrist is trained more to correct visual problems with eyeglasses and contact lenses what about opticians lou asked ive always mixed these guys up no one ever explained it to me opticians fill the eyeglass prescriptions laurie said either from an ophthalmologist or an optometrist now that i have that straight lou said tell me about dr scheffield and paul cerino thats the most interesting part laurie said jordan said that he was treating mr cerino for acid burns of the eyes someone had thrown acid in paul cerinos eyes to blind him you dont say lou said that could explain a lot like maybe these two ganglandstyle executions of lucia people and what about frankies eye could that have been acid yes laurie said it could have been acid it will be tough to determine since frankie was in the east river but on the whole the damage to his eye was definitely consistent with an acid burn can you try to have your lab document that it was acid this could be the start of the lucky breakthrough ive been praying for of course well try laurie said but like i said his having been in the river might make it tough well also examine the bullet in the present case maybe it will match the one from frankie i havent been this excited for months lou said come on laurie said lets see what we can do together they went down to the lab laurie found the director a toxicologist dr john devries he was a tall thin man with gaunt cheeks and an academics pallor he was dressed in a soiled lab coat several sizes too small laurie made introductions then asked if any of the results on the previous days cases were available some might be john told her you have the accession numbers absolutely laurie said come in my office john said he led them to his office a narrow cubbyhole filled with books and stacks of scientific journals john leaned across his desk and punched a few keys on his computer what are the accession numbers he asked laurie gave duncan andrews number and john entered it there was cocaine in the blood and urine john said reading off the screen and apparently in high concentration but this was only by thinlayer chromatography any contaminants or other drugs laurie asked not so far john said straightening up but well be using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry as soon as we have time we got a lot of work around here this was a cocaine overdose case but its a little atypical in that the deceased did not appear to be a habitual user and if he did use drugswhich his family swears he didntit wasnt interfering with his life the man was very successful a solid citizen the kind of person you do not expect to overdose so his death was unusual perhaps but not extraordinary cocaine can be an upscale drug but now ive got two more ods with similar profiles the very next day im concerned that a batch of cocaine may be poisoned with some kind of contaminant thats what may be killing these seemingly casual users id really appreciate it if you ran the samples sooner rather than later we might be able to save some lives ill do what i can john said but as i told you were busy was there another case you wanted to know about now laurie gave frank depasquales accession number and john consulted the screen only a trace of cannabinoid in the urine otherwise nothing on screening there was a sample of eye tissue laurie said find anything there hasnt been processed yet john said the eye appeared burned laurie added we now suspect acid could you look for acid it might be important if we can document it ill do what i can laurie thanked john then motioned for lou to follow her to the elevator as they walked laurie shook her head its like squeezing water out of a stone to get information out of him she complained he seems exhausted lou said or he hates his job one of the two in his defense he is busy laurie said like everything else here his funding is limited and getting progressively worse so hes stretched thin when it comes to staff but i hope he can find the time to search for a contaminant in the drug cases the more i think about it the more sure i am when they got to the elevators laurie glanced at her watch i have to get a move on she lifted her eyes to lou i cant afford to have dr washington mad at me as well as dr bingham ill be out pounding the pavement looking for a new job lou gazed into her eyes you really are upset about these overdose cases arent you yes i am laurie admitted she averted her eyes and glanced up at the floor indicator lous comment brought up the memory of the nightmare shed had that morning she hoped that he wouldnt mention her brother thankfully the elevator door opened and they boarded they changed into scrub clothes and entered the main autopsy room it was a beehive of activity every table was occupied laurie saw that even calvin was working at table one things were definitely hopping for him to be there it was not customary for calvin to do routine cases lauries first case was on the table vinnie had taken the liberty of getting all the paraphernalia he anticipated shed need the deceaseds name was robert evans aged twentynine laurie set out her papers and switched into her professional persona beginning her meticulous external exam she was halfway through when she realized that lou was not across from her raising her head she saw him standing to the side im sorry i havent been including you she said i understand lou said you do your thing im fine i can tell that you are all very busy i dont want to be in the way you wont be in the way laurie said you wanted to watch so come over and watch lou stepped around the table being careful where his feet touched the floor his hands were clasped behind his back he looked down at robert evans find anything interesting he asked this poor fellow convulsed just like duncan andrews laurie said he has all the consequent bruises and badly bitten tongue to prove it he also has something else look here in the antecubital fossa see that blanched puncture mark remember seeing that on duncan andrews sure lou said that was the intravenous site where he mainlined the cocaine exactly laurie said in other words mr evans took his cocaine the same way mr andrews did so lou questioned i told you yesterday that cocaine can be taken lots of ways laurie said but sniffing or the medical term insufflation is the usual recreational route what about smoking lou asked youre thinking of crack cocaine hydrochloride the salt is poorly volatile and cant be smoked for smoking it has to be converted to its free base crack the point is that although the usual form of cocaine can be injected it usually isnt the fact that it had been used that way on both these cases is curious not that i know what to make of it wasnt it common in the sixties to shoot cocaine lou asked only when it was combined with heroin in what they call speedball laurie closed her eyes for a moment took a deep breath and let it out with a sigh are you all right lou asked im fine laurie said maybe what were seeing is the beginning of a new fad lou suggested i hope not laurie said but if it is its much too deadly to be a fad for long fifteen minutes later when laurie plunged the scalpel into roberts chest lou winced despite the fact that robert was dead and that there was no blood lou could not dismiss the idea that the razorsharp knife was cutting into human tissue just like his own skin with no pathology apparent laurie finished the internal aspect of robert evans autopsy in short order while vinnie took the body away and brought in bruno marchese laurie and lou went to the xray view box to look at brunos xrays and the one of the headless woman the bullet is in just about the same location laurie said pointing to the bright dot inside the outline of brunos skull looks like slightly larger caliber lou said i could be wrong but i dont think its from the same gun ill be impressed if youre right laurie said laurie put up brunos fullbody xray she scanned the film with a practiced eye when she saw no abnormalities she replaced it with the xray of the unfortunate woman its a good thing we took this xray laurie said oh lou said staring at the foggyappearing shadows you mean you dont see the abnormality laurie asked no lou said at the same time i dont know how you doctors can see much in these things i mean a bullet jumps out at you but the rest just looks like a bunch of smudges i cant believe you cant see it laurie said all right im blind lou said so tell me the head and the hands laurie said theyre gone you miserable slut lou laughed in a forced whisper to keep those at a nearby table from hearing well its an abnormality laurie teased finished with the xrays laurie and lou returned to the table just in time to help vinnie move bruno from the gurney onto the table lou started to help but laurie shooed him away since he was not gloved to save time laurie started out with the body prone the entrance wound looked much like frankies although the diameter of the stippling was slightly larger suggesting the gun had been a bit farther away after taking all the appropriate photographs and samples she and vinnie turned the body supine the first thing laurie did then was check the eyes they were normal after what you said upstairs i was hoping the eyes might tell us something lou said i was hoping as well laurie admitted id love to give you that break you need it still might be important lou said if paul cerino had acid thrown in his eyes and if frank depasquale did too its certainly a link i think its worth my while to take a trip out to queens and have a chat with paul after finishing the rest of the external exam laurie accepted a knife from vinnie and began the internal again with no pathology it went very quickly as soon as brunos autopsy was completed vinnie rolled him away and brought in the second floater as laurie helped vinnie transfer the body to the table someone from a nearby table called out whered that body come from laurie sleepy hollow after the laughter died down lou leaned over to lauries ear that was crude he whispered teasingly want me to go over and slug the guy laurie laughed black humor she said it has always played a role in pathology laurie inspected the womans severed limbs and neck the mutilation was done after death she said thats comforting lou said he felt his tolerance was getting lower with every case he was having more trouble dealing with this dismembered body than with the others the decapitation and the removal of the hands was done crudely laurie said look at the rough saw marks on the exposed bones of course some of this tissue appears to have been eaten by fish or crabs lou forced himself to look even though he would have preferred not to he was feeling slightly nauseated the rest of the torso looks okay laurie said no human bite marks lou swallowed again would you have expected bite marks he asked weakly if rape was involved laurie said then bite marks are occasionally seen you have to think about them otherwise you can miss them ill try to remember that lou said laurie carefully inspected the chest and abdomen the only finding of note was a right upper quadrant scar following the line of the ribs this could turn out to be important for id purposes laurie said pointing at the scar id guess it was a gallbladder operation what if the body is never identified lou asked it will stay in the walkin cooler for a number of weeks laurie said if by then we still dont know who she is shell end up in one of those pine coffins in the hall laurie opened up the rapekit and spread out the contents most of this is probably academic after the body has been in the river but its still worth a try as she took the appropriate samples she asked lou if he thought the case was related to franks or brunos i cant be sure but i have my suspicions i have a number of people including police divers out looking for the heads and hands ill tell you one thing whoever dumped this woman didnt want her to be identified given the east river s tidal and current patterns the fact that she was found in the same general vicinity as frankie and bruno suggests she was dumped from the same place so yeah i think there could be a connection what do you think the chances are of finding the head or the hands laurie asked not great lou said they could have sunk where the body was dumped or they might not have been dumped in the river laurie had moved on to the internal portion of the autopsy she noted that the victim had had two surgeries in the past a gallbladder removal as laurie had surmised and a hysterectomy with three of her four cases out of the way before noon laurie felt comfortable enough with her progress to suggest that she and lou have a quick cup of coffee lou happily agreed saying he could use the fortification after the mornings ordeal besides he would have to leave to get back to his office having seen the autopsies of the two floaters he couldnt rationalize any more time he jokingly told laurie that shed have to do the second overdose without his assistance after taking off her goggles apron and gown laurie took lou up to the coffeemaker in the id room it was just one floor up so they used the stairs laurie sat in a desk chair while lou sat on the corner of a desk just as happened the previous day lous demeanor suddenly changed when he was about to leave he became clumsy and selfconscious he even managed to spill some of his coffee down the front of his scrub shirt im sorry he said dabbing at the coffee spots with a napkin i hope it doesnt stain dont be silly lou laurie said these scrub clothes have had lot worse stains than coffee i guess youre right he said is something on your mind laurie asked yeah lou said he stared into his coffee i wanted to know if youd like to grab a bite to eat tonight i know a great place down in little italy on mulberry street id like to ask you a question laurie said yesterday you asked if i was married you never said whether youre married im not married he said have you ever been married laurie asked yeah i was married lou said ive been divorced for a couple of years i have two kids a girl seven and a boy five do you ever see them of course i see them lou said what do you think i wouldnt see my own kids i get em every weekend you dont have to be defensive laurie said i was just curious yesterday i realized after youd left that youd asked me about my marital status without telling me yours it was an oversight lou said anyway how about dinner im afraid i have plans tonight laurie said oh fine said lou give me the third degree about my marital and parental status then turn me down i suppose youre seeing the fancy doctor with the roses and the limo guess im not quite in his league he stood up abruptly well i better be going i think youre being overly sensitive and silly laurie said i only said i was busy tonight overly sensitive and silly huh ill keep that in mind its been another illuminating morning thank you so very much if you come up with anything interesting on any of the floaters please give me a call with that lou tossed his styrofoam cup into a nearby wastebasket and walked out of the room laurie remained in her seat for a moment sipping her coffee she knew that shed hurt lous feelings and that made her feel uncomfortable at the same time she thought he was being immature some of that blue collar charm shed noted the day before was wearing thin after finishing her coffee laurie returned to the autopsy room and her fourth case of the day marion overstreet aged twentyeight editor for a major new york publishing house you want anything special for this case vinnie asked he was eager to get under way laurie shook her head no she looked at the young woman on the table such a waste she wondered if this woman would have gambled with drugs if she could have anticipated such a terrible price the autopsy went quickly laurie and vinnie worked well together as a team conversation was kept to a minimum the case was remarkably similar to both duncan andrews and robert evans down to the fact that overstreet had injected the cocaine not snorted it there were only a few minor surprises that laurie would have cheryl myers or one of the other forensic investigators check out by twelve fortyfive laurie walked out of the main autopsy room after changing to her street clothes laurie took it upon herself to carry the specimens from each of the days cases to toxicology she hoped to have another chat with the resident toxicologist she found john devries in his office eating his lunch an oldfashioned lunch box with a thermos built into its vaulted cover was open on his desk i finished the two overdoses laurie said ive brought up their toxicology samples leave the samples on the receiving desk in the lab he told her he held an uncut sandwich in both hands any luck finding a contaminant in the andrews case she asked hopefully its only been a few hours since you were here last ill call you if i find anything as soon as possible laurie encouraged i dont mean to be a bother its just that im more convinced than ever that a contaminant of some sort is involved if there is i want to find it if its there well find it just give us a chance for chrissake thanks laurie said ill try to be patient its just that i know i know john interrupted i get the picture already please im out of here laurie said she put her hands in the air to signify her surrender back in her office laurie ate some of the lunch dictated the mornings autopsies and tried to tackle some of her paperwork she found she couldnt take her mind off the drug overdose cases what worried her was the specter of more cases if there was some source of contaminated cocaine in the city it meant there would be more deaths at this point the ball was in johns court there was nothing more she could do or was there how could she prevent more deaths the key lay in warning the public hadnt bingham just lectured her on the fact that they had social and political responsibilities with that thought in mind laurie picked up the phone and called the chiefs office she asked mrs sanford if dr bingham might have a moment to see her i believe i could squeeze you in mrs sanford said but you have to come immediately dr bingham is due at a luncheon at city hall when she entered binghams office she could tell the chief medical examiner was not prepared to give her more than a minute of his time when he asked her what it was she wanted laurie outlined the facts surrounding the three cocaine overdose cases as succinctly as possible she emphasized the upscale demographics the fact that none of the victims appeared to have been in the depths of addiction and that all three had mainlined the drug i get the picture bingham said whats your point im afraid that we are seeing the beginning of a series laurie said im concerned about a toxic contaminant in some cocaine supply with only three cases dont you think thats a rather fanciful leap the point is laurie said id like to keep it at three cases an admirable goal bingham said but are you certain about this alleged contaminant what does john have to say hes looking laurie said he hasnt found anything not yet laurie admitted but hes only used thinlayer chromatography so far so i guess we have to wait for john bingham said he stood up laurie held her seat having come this far she wasnt about to give up yet i was thinking that maybe we should make a statement to the press laurie said we could put out a warning out of the question bingham said im not about to gamble the integrity of this office on a supposition based on three cases arent you coming to me a little prematurely why dont you wait and see what john comes up with besides making that kind of statement would require names and the andrews organization would have the mayor at my throat in an instant well it was just a suggestion laurie said thank you doctor bingham said now if youll excuse me im late as it is laurie was chagrined bingham didnt give her suggestion more credence but without more conclusive proof she could hardly force the issue she only wished there was something she could do before more of the same kind of overdoses showed up on her schedule it was then she had a thought her training in forensics in miami had involved direct onthescene investigation maybe if she toured any future scenes some critical clue might present itself laurie went to the forensic medical investigative department where she found bart arnold chief of the investigators sitting at his desk between two of his innumerable telephone conversations she told him that she wanted to be notified if any more overdoses were called in that were similar to the three that she had had she was very explicit bart assured her that hed let the others know including the tour doctors who took calls at night laurie was about to return to her office when she remembered that she should also request that the autopsies of any similar overdoses be assigned to her that meant seeing calvin it always worries me when one of the troops wants to see me calvin said when laurie poked her head in his office what is it dr montgomery it better not be about scheduling your vacation with the current case load weve decided to cancel all this years vacations vacation i wish laurie said with a smile despite his gruff manner she had a genuine fondness and respect for calvin i wanted to thank you for assigning me those two overdose cases this morning calvin raised an eyebrow well this is a first no one ever thanked me for assigning him a case why do i have the feeling theres more to this visit because you are naturally suspicious laurie teased i truly have found the cases interesting more than interesting in fact id like to request that any other similar case that comes in be assigned to me a grunt looking for work calvin said its enough to make a poor administrators heart glow sure you can have all you want just so i dont make any mistakes what do you mean by similar if you took all our overdoses youd be here round the clock upscale overdose or toxicity cases laurie said just like the two you gave me this morning people in their twenties or thirties well educated and in good physical condition ill personally see that you get them all calvin said cheerfully but i have to warn you now if you put in for overtime im not paying im hoping there will be no overtime laurie said after saying goodbye to calvin laurie returned to her office and sat down to work the positive meeting with calvin had compensated for the meeting with bingham and with a modicum of peace of mind laurie was able to concentrate she was able to accomplish more work than shed expected and signed out a number of cases including most of the weekends autopsies she even had time to counsel a devastated family about the crib death of their infant laurie was able to assure them they were not at fault the only problem that intruded during the early afternoon was a call from cheryl myers she told laurie that shed been unable to find any medical conditions in duncan andrews past his only brush with a hospital had occurred nearly fifteen years ago when he broke his arm during a high school football game you want me to keep looking cheryl asked after a pause yes laurie said it cant hurt try to go back to his childhood laurie knew that she was hoping for nothing less than a miracle yet she wanted to be complete then she could turn the whole problem over to calvin washington she decided lou had been right if the powersthatbe wanted to distort the record for political expediency they should do it themselves by late afternoon lauries thoughts drifted back to the drug cases on a whim she decided to check out where evans and overstreet lived she caught a cab on first avenue and asked to go to central park south evans address was near columbus circle when the cab arrived at the destination laurie asked him to wait she hopped out of the cab to get a good look at the building she tried to remember who else lived around there it was some movie star she was sure probably dozens of stars lived nearby with a view of the park and its proximity to fifth avenue central park south was prime real estate in manhattan it didnt get much better than that standing there laurie tried to picture robert evans striding confidently down the street and turning into his building briefcase in hand excited about the prospects of a social evening in new york it was hard to jibe such an image with so untimely and profligate a demise getting back in the cab laurie directed the driver to marion overstreets a cozy brownstone on west sixtyseventh street a block from central park this time she didnt even get out of the car she merely gazed at the handsome residence and again tried to imagine the young editor in life satisfied she asked the confused driver to take her back to the medical examiners office after the confrontation with bingham that morning over her visit to duncan andrews apartment laurie had not intended going inside either victims building shed merely wanted to see them from the outside she didnt know why shed had the compulsion to do so and when she got back to the medical examiners she wondered if it had been a bad idea the excursion had saddened her since it made the victims and their tragedies more real back in her office laurie ran into her officemate riva riva complimented laurie on the beauty of her roses laurie thanked her and stared at the flowers in her current state of mind they had changed their ambience although they had suggested celebration that morning now they seemed more the symbol of grief almost funereal in their appearance lou soldano was still irritated as he drove over the queensboro bridge from manhattan to queens he felt like such a fool having set himself up so conveniently for rejection what had he been thinking anyway she was a doctor for chrissake whod grown up on the east side of manhattan what would they have talked about the mets the giants hardly lou was the first to admit that he wasnt the most educated guy in the city and except for law enforcement and sports he didnt know much about most other things do you ever see your kids lou said out loud doing a mockingly crude imitation of lauries much higher voice with a short little yell lou pounded the steering wheel and mistakenly honked the horn of his chevrolet caprice the driver in front of him turned around and threw him a finger yeah to you too lou said he felt like reaching down and putting his emergency light on the dashboard and pulling the guy over but he didnt lou didnt do things like that he didnt abuse his authority although he did it in his fantasy on a regular basis i should have taken the triborough bridge he mumbled as the traffic bogged down on the queensboro from the last third of the bridge all the way to the juncture with northern boulevard it was stop and go and mostly stop it gave lou time to think about the last time he had seen paul cerino it had been about three years previously when lou had just made detective sergeant he was still assigned to organized crime at the time and had been pursuing cerino for a good four years so it was a surprise when the operator at the station had said that a mr paul cerino was on the line confused as to why the man he was after was calling him lou had picked up the phone with great curiosity hey how you doing paul had said as if they were the best of friends i have a favor to ask of you would you mind stopping at the house this afternoon when you leave work having been invited to a gangsters house had been such a weird occurrence that lou had been reluctant to tell anybody about it but finally hed told his partner brian oshea whod thought hed gone crazy for accepting what if hes planning on doing you in brian asked please lou had said he wouldnt call me up here at the station if he was going to bump me off besides even if he decided to do it he wouldnt get anywhere near it himself its something else maybe he wants to deal maybe he wants to finger somebody else whatever it is im going this could be something big so lou went with great expectations of some major breakthrough that he thought might even have resulted in a commendation by the chief of course the visit was against brians better judgment and brian insisted on going with him but waiting in the car the deal had been that if lou didnt come out in a half hour brian was going to call in a swat team it was with a lot of anxiety that lou had mounted the front steps of cerinos modest house on clintonville street in whitestone even the houses appearance added to lous unease there was something wrong about it with the huge amount of money the man had to be making from all his illegal activities plus his only legal endeavor the american fresh fruit company it was a mystery to lou why he lived in such a small unpretentious house with a final glance back at brian whose concerns had only served to fan lous anxiety to a fevered pitch and with a final check to make sure his smith and wesson detective special was in its holster lou rang the front bell mrs cerino had opened the door taking a deep breath lou had entered lou laughed heartily bringing tears to his eyes the experience was still capable of doing that after three years while still laughing lou glanced into the car immediately to his left the driver was looking at him as if he were crazy laughing as he was in such abominable traffic but the traffic notwithstanding lou could still laugh at the shock he had had when hed stepped into cerinos house that day expecting the worst what he had unexpectedly walked into was a surprise party for himself in celebration of his having been promoted to detective sergeant at the time lou had been recently separated from his wife so the promotion had gone unnoticed except at the station somehow cerino had heard about this and had decided to give him a party it had been mr and mrs cerino and their two sons gregory and steven thered been cake and soda lou had even gone out to get brian the irony of the whole thing had been that lou and paul had been enemies for so long they had almost become friends after all they knew so much about each other it took lou almost an hour to get out to pauls and by the time he mounted the front steps it was just about the same time of day as when paul had thrown the surprise party lou could remember it as if it had been yesterday looking through the front windows lou could see that the living room lights were on outside it was getting dark even though it was only fivethirty winter was on its way lou pressed the front doorbell and heard the muted chimes the door was opened by gregory the older boy he was about ten he recognized lou greeted him in a friendly fashion and invited him inside gregory was a wellmannered boy is your dad home lou asked no sooner had he asked than paul appeared from the living room in his stocking feet clutching a redtipped cane a radio was on in the background who is it he asked gregory its detective soldano gregory said lou paul said coming directly toward lou and extending a hand lou shook hands with paul and tried to see his eyes behind a pair of reflective sunglasses paul was a big man moderately overweight so that his small facial features were sunk into his fleshy face he had dark hair cut short and large heavily lobed ears on both cheeks were red patches of recently healed skin lou guessed it had been from the acid how about some coffee paul said or a little wine without waiting for a response paul yelled for gloria gregory reappeared with steven the younger cerino he was eight come in paul said sit down tell me whats been happening you married yet lou followed paul back into the living room he could tell that paul had adapted well to his reduced visual acuity at least in his own home he didnt use the cane to navigate to the radio to turn it off nor did he use it to find his favorite chair into which he sank with a sigh sorry to hear about your eye problem lou said sitting opposite paul these things happen paul said philosophically gloria appeared and greeted lou like paul she was overweighta buxom woman with a kind gentle face if she knew what her husband did for a living she never let on she acted like the typical lowermiddleclass suburban housewife who had to scrimp to get along on a budget lou wondered what paul did with all the money he had to be accumulating responding to lous positive reply regarding coffee gloria disappeared into the kitchen i heard about your accident just today lou said i havent told all my friends paul said with a smile did this involve the lucia people lou asked was it vinnie dominick oh no paul said this was an accident i was trying to jumpstart the car and the battery blew up got a bunch of acid in my face come on paul lou said i came all the way out here to commiserate with you the least you can do is tell me the truth i already know that the acid was thrown into your face its just a matter of who was responsible how do you know this cerino asked i was specifically told by someone who knows lou said in fact it ultimately came from a totally reliable source you me paul questioned with genuine surprise gloria returned with an espresso for lou he helped himself to sugar gloria then retreated from the room so did the boys you have awakened my curiosity paul said explain to me how i was the source of this rumor about my eyes you told your doctor jordan scheffield lou said he told one of the medical examiners by the name of laurie montgomery and the medical examiner told me and the reason i happened to be talking to the medical examiner was because i went over there to watch a couple of autopsies on homicide victims the names might be familiar to you frankie depasquale and bruno marchese never heard of them paul said they are lucia people lou said and one of them curiously enough had acid burns in one of his eyes terrible cerino said they certainly dont make batteries the way they used to so youre still telling me that you got battery acid in your eyes lou asked of course paul said because thats what happened how are the eyes doing lou asked pretty good considering what could have happened paul said but the doctor says ill do fine as soon as i have my operations first i have to wait a while but im sure you know about that what are you talking about lou said i dont know anything about eyes except how many you got i didnt know much either paul said at least not before this happened but ive been learning ever since i used to think they transplanted the whole eye you know like changing an oldfashionedtype radio tube just plug the thing in with all the prongs in the right place but thats not how it works they only transplant the cornea thats all news to me lou said want to see what my eyes look like paul asked im not sure lou said paul took off his reflective sunglasses ugh lou said put your glasses back on im sorry for you paul it looks terrible it looks like you have a couple of white marbles in your eyes paul chuckled as he put his glasses back on i would have thought a hardened cop like you would have felt satisfaction that his old enemy took a fall hell no lou said i dont want you handicapped i want you in jail paul laughed still at it huh putting you away is still one of my ultimate goals in life lou said agreeably and finding that acid burn in frankie depasquales eye gives me some hope at this point it looks mighty suspicious that you were behind the kids murder aw lou paul said it hurts my feelings that youd think something nasty about me after all these years pm wednesday manhattan at first laurie thought the experience was unique enough to be tolerable but as the time approached eight fortyfive she began to get irritated thomas jordan s driver had shown up exactly at the agreedupon time eight oclock and had rung lauries bell but when laurie got down to the car she learned that jordan was not there he was still in surgery doing an emergency operation im supposed to take you to the restaurant thomas had said dr scheffield will be meeting you there taken by surprise with this situation laurie had agreed shed felt strange entering the fancy restaurant by herself but she was quickly put at ease by the maitre d who had been expecting her shed been discreetly ushered to a waiting table wedged among others near to the window next to the table stood a wine stand icing down a bottle of meursault the sommelier had appeared instantly and had shown laurie the label of the wine after shed nodded hed opened it poured her a dollop waited for her ok then filled her glass all this had been accomplished without words finally at five minutes before nine jordan arrived he came into the room with a flourish and although he waved a greeting at laurie he didnt join her immediately instead he weaved his way through the crowded room stopping at several tables to say hello each group of diners greeted him with gusto animated conversation and smiles followed in his wake sorry he said finally sitting down i was in surgery but i guess thomas told you as much he did laurie said what kind of emergency surgery was it well it wasnt exactly an emergency jordan said nervously rearranging his place setting my surgery has picked up recently so i have to squeeze standby cases in whenever the operating room can give me a slot hows the wine the wine steward had reappeared and gave jordan a taste of the wine the wine is fine laurie said seems that you know a lot of people here jordan took a sip of his wine and for a moment he looked pensive while he swished it around inside his mouth he nodded with satisfaction after he swallowed motioned for his glass to be filled then looked at laurie i usually run into a few of my patients here he said how was your day i hope it was better than mine some sort of trouble laurie asked plenty of trouble jordan said first my secretary whos been with me for almost ten years didnt show up in the morning shes never not shown up without calling we tried calling her but there was no answer so scheduling got all fouled up by the time i came in from the hospital then to make matters worse we discovered that someone had broken into the office the night before and had stolen our petty cash as well as all the percodans we kept on hand how awful laurie said she remembered how it had felt to be robbed her room at college had been ransacked one day any vandalism she asked whoever had broken into her room had smashed what they couldnt carry away no jordan said but strangely enough the burglar rifled through my records and used the copy machine that sounds like more than a simple robbery laurie said thats what makes me uneasy jordan said the petty cash and the few percodans i could care less about but i dont like the thought of someone in my records not with the high accounts receivable i have ive already called my accountant to run a tape i want to make sure there isnt some big change have you looked at the menu not yet laurie said her irritation was fading now that jordan had arrived responding to jordan s gesture the maitre d appeared with two menus jordan who ate there frequently was full of suggestions laurie ordered from the daily specials menu attached to the main menu she thought the food was wonderful although the frenetic atmosphere made it difficult for her to relax but jordan seemed in his element while they were waiting for dessert and coffee laurie asked jordan about the effects of acid in the eye he warmed to the request immediately going on at length about the corneas and the conjunctivas responses to both acid and alkali laurie lost interest halfway through his discourse but her gaze remained steady she had to admit he was an attractive man she wondered how he maintained such a fabulous tan to lauries relief the arrival of dessert and coffee interrupted jordan s impromptu lecture as he began his flourless chocolate cake he changed the subject i probably should be thankful those crooks didnt take any of the valuables last night like the picassos in the waiting room laurie set her coffee cup down you have picassos in your waiting room signed drawings jordan said casually about twenty of them its truly a stateoftheart office and i didnt want to scrimp on the waiting area after all thats the place the patients spend the most time jordan laughed for the first time since hed sat down thats even more extravagant than the limo laurie said actually she felt more strongly than she let on the idea of such ostentation in a medical setting seemed obscene especially given the runaway cost of medical care its quite an office jordan said proudly my favorite feature of it is that the patients move i dont go to them they come to me im not sure i understand laurie said each one of my five examining rooms is built on a circular mechanism youve seen these revolving restaurants at the tops of certain buildings its kind of like that when i push a button in my office the whole thing turns and the examining room i want lines up with my office another button lifts the wall its as good as a ride in disneyland sounds very impressive laurie said expensive but impressive i suppose your overhead is pretty high astronomical jordan said he sounded proud of it so high that i hate to take a vacation its too expensive not the vacation itself but letting the office sit idle i also have two operating rooms for outpatient procedures id like to see this office sometime laurie said id love to show it to you jordan said in fact why not now its just around the corner on park avenue laurie said she thought that was a great idea so as soon as jordan took care of the bill they were off the first room they entered was jordans private office the walls and furniture were entirely of teak waxed to a high gloss the upholstery was black leather there was enough sophisticated ophthalmological equipment to outfit a small hospital next they entered the waiting room which was paneled in mahogany just as jordan had said the walls were lined with picasso drawings down a short hall from the waiting room was a circular room with five doors on its perimeter opening one jordan asked laurie to sit in the examining chair now stay right there he said before leaving the room laurie did as she was told next thing she knew she felt like the room was moving then the movementreal or imaginedstopped abruptly and the lights in the room began to dim simultaneously the far wall rose its disappearance effectively joined lauries examination room to jordans private office jordan was sitting at his desk backlit and leaning back in his chair whats that line about not having mohammed go to the mountain but the mountain going to him same principle applies here i like my patients to feel they are in powerful hands i actually believe it makes them heal more quickly i know that sounds a bit hocuspocus but it works for me im impressed laurie said obviously ive never seen anything quite like this where do you keep your records jordan took laurie through another door that led from his office into a long hall at the end of the hall was a windowless room with a bank of file cabinets a copy machine and a computer terminal all the records are in the file cabinets he said but most of the material is duplicated on the computer on hard disk are these the records that the burglars went through laurie asked they are jordan said and thats the copy machine im very meticulous about my records i could tell someone had been in them because the contents in some had been put out of order i know the copy machine was used after we closed because i have my secretary record the number from the machine at the end of each day what about paul cerinos record laurie asked was that disturbed i dont know jordan said but its a good question jordan flipped through his c drawer and pulled out a manila folder you were right he said after paging through this one was disturbed as well see this information sheet its supposed to be in the front instead its in the back is there any way to tell if it had been copied jordan thought for a moment but shook his head not that i can think of whats going through your mind im not sure laurie said but maybe this supposed burglary should convince you to be a bit more careful i know you think taking care of this cerino character is mildly entertaining but you have to understand that he is apparently one nasty man and maybe even more important he has some very nasty enemies you think cerino could have been responsible for my breakin jordan asked i truly dont know laurie said but its possible one way or the other maybe his enemies dont want you to fix him up there are all sorts of possibilities the only thing i do know is that these guys play for keeps over the last two days ive done autopsies on two young men whod been murdered gangland style and one of them had what looked like acid burns in his eye dont tell me that jordan said im not trying to scare you just to scare you laurie said im only saying this so that you will think about what you are getting yourself involved with by taking care of these people ive been told that the two major crime families the vaccarros and the lucias are currently at each others throats thats why cerino got the acid slung in his face hes one of the vaccarro bosses wow jordan said this does put a different complexion on things now you got me worried luckily ill be operating on cerino soon so this will all be behind me is cerino scheduled laurie asked jordan shook his head not exactly he said im waiting on material as usual well i think you should do it as soon as possible and i wouldnt advertise the date and the time jordan put the contents of cerinos file back into its proper order and replaced it in the file drawer want to see the rest of the office he asked sure laurie said jordan took laurie deeper into the office complex showing her several rooms devoted to special ophthalmologic testing what impressed her most were the two stateoftheart operating rooms complete with all the requisite ancillary equipment you have a fortune invested here laurie said once theyd reached the final room a photography lab no doubt about it jordan agreed but it pays off handsomely currently im grossing between one point five and two million dollars a year laurie swallowed the figure was staggering although she knew her father the cardiac surgeon had to have a huge income to cover his lifestyle shed never before been slapped with such an astronomical figure knowing what she did about the plight of american medicine and even the shoestring budget the medical examiners office ran under it seemed like an obscene waste of resources how about coming by and seeing my apartment jordan said if you like the office youll love the apartment it was designed by the same people sure laurie said mainly as a reflex she was still trying to absorb jordans comment about his income as they retraced their route through the office laurie asked after jordans secretary did you ever hear from her no jordan said obviously still angry about the noshow she never called and there was never any answer at her home i can only imagine it has something to do with her nogood husband if shed not been such a good secretary i would have gotten rid of her just because of him he has a restaurant in bayside but hes also involved with a number of shady deals she confided in me in order to borrow bail on several occasions hes never been convicted but hes spent plenty of time on rikers island sounds like a mobster himself laurie said once they got into the back of the car laurie asked jordan his missing secretarys name marsha schulman jordan said why do you ask just curious laurie said it didnt take long for thomas to pull up to the private entrance of trump tower the doorman opened the door for laurie to get out but she held back jordan she said looking at him in the dim light of the interior of the limo would you be angry if i asked for a raincheck on seeing your apartment i just noticed the time and i have to get up for work in the morning not at all jordan said i understand perfectly ive got surgery again myself at the crack of dawn but there is a condition which is that we have dinner again tomorrow night you can put up with me two evenings in a row laurie asked shed not been rushed like this since high school she was flattered but wary with pleasure jordan said humorously affecting an english accent all right laurie said but lets pick a place not quite so formal done jordan said you like italian i love italian then it will be palio jordan said at eight vinnie dominick paused outside of the vesuvio restaurant on corona avenue in elmhurst and took advantage of his reflection in the window to smooth his hair and adjust his gucci tie satisfied he motioned to freddie capuso to open the door vinnies nickname since junior high school was the prince hed been considered a handsome fellow whom the neighborhood girls had found quite attractive his features were full but well sculpted favoring a tailored look he heavily moussed his dark hair and brushed it straight back from his forehead he looked considerably younger than his forty years and unlike most of his contemporaries he prided himself on his physical prowess a high school basketball star hed kept his game over the years playing three nights a week at st marys gym entering the restaurant vinnie scanned the room freddie and richie crowded in behind him vinnie quickly spotted whom he was looking for paul cerino the restaurant still had a few diners since its kitchen stayed open until eleven but most of its clientele had already departed it was a good location and time for a meeting vinnie walked to pauls table with the confidence of one meeting an old good friend freddie and richie followed several steps behind when vinnie reached the table the two men sitting with paul stood vinnie recognized them as angelo facciolo and tony ruggerio how are you paul vinnie asked cant complain paul said he stuck out a hand for vinnie to shake sit down vinnie paul said have some wine angelo pour the man some wine as vinnie sat down angelo picked up an open bottle of brunello from the table and filled the glass in front of vinnie i want to thank you for agreeing to see me vinnie said after what happened last time i consider it a special favor when you said it was important and involved family how could i turn you down first i want to tell you how much i sympathize with your eye problem vinnie said it was a terrible tragedy and it never should have happened and right now in front of these other people i want to swear on my mothers grave i knew nothing about it the punks did it on their own there was a pause for a moment no one said anything finally cerino spoke what else is on your mind i know that your people whacked frankie and bruno vinnie said and even though we know this we have not retaliated and were not going to retaliate why because frankie and bruno got what they deserved they were acting on their own they were out of step and were also not going to retaliate because it is important for you and me to get along i dont want a war it gets the authorities up in arms it makes for bad business for us both and how do i know i can trust this gesture of peace cerino asked by my good faith vinnie answered would i ask for a meeting like this at a place of your choosing if i wasnt serious furthermore as another token of my desire to settle the matter im willing to tell you where jimmy lanso the fourth and final guy is hiding out really cerino asked for the first time in the conversation he was genuinely surprised and where might that be his cousins funeral parlor spoletto funeral home in ozone park i appreciate your openness in all of this paul said but i have the feeling that there is more i have a favor to ask of you vinnie said i want to ask you as a colleague to show some good faith to me i want to ask you to spare jimmy lanso hes family hes a nephew of my wifes sisters husband ill see to it that the punk is punished but id like to ask you as a friend not to whack him ill certainly give it serious thought paul said thank you vinnie said after all we are civilized people kids can make mistakes you and i have had our differences but we respect each other and understand our common interests im sure that you will take all this into account vinnie stood up ill take everything into consideration paul said vinnie turned around and walked out of the restaurant paul lifted his wineglass and took a sip angelo he called over his shoulder did vinnie touch his wine no angelo said i didnt think so paul said and he calls himself civilized what about jimmy lanso angelo asked kill him cerino said take me home then do it what if it is a setup angelo asked paul took another sip of his wine i seriously doubt it he said vinnie wouldnt lie about family angelo did not like the situation at all the idea of a funeral home gave him the creeps besides he didnt trust vinnie dominick to tell the truth whether it was about family or business in angelos opinion there was a good chance this was a setup despite cerinos thoughts to the contrary and if it was a setup it was going to be very dangerous to go breaking into the spoletto funeral home angelo decided this was a good occasion to let tony take the lead and tony was so eager hed no doubt be pleased hed been crying for a year that he was never able to do something on his own so whats your take angelo asked once he and tony were parked across the street from the funeral parlor it was a rather large white clapboard building with greek columns supporting a small front porch i think its perfect tony said his eyes sparkled with excitement dont you feel its a little creepy angelo asked nah tony said my uncles cousin had a home i even worked there for a summer when i needed a job for the parole board the work is definitely not your usual nine to five but for what we have in mind i think its convenient we whack him they embalm him its all done inhouse tony laughed you get it of course i get it angelo snapped well lets do it tony said i can see a light on in the back must be the embalming room that must be where lansos hiding out you say you worked in a funeral home angelo asked as he scanned the neighborhood for signs of trouble for about two months tony said since youre familiar with this kind of place maybe you should go in first he hoped it would sound as if the idea had just occurred to him once you get lanso cornered you can flip the light on and off meanwhile ill hang out here and make sure it isnt a setup sounds great tony said with that he was off getting up from the cot jimmy lanso stepped over to the tiny tv and turned down the sound he thought hed heard a noise again just like he had the last couple of nights he listened intently but he didnt hear anything except his own heart thumping in his chest and a slight ringing in his ears from all the aspirin hed been taking not having slept for sixty or so hours except short snatches he was a nervous exhausted wreck hed been hiding out in the funeral home ever since he and bruno abandoned their pad in woodside after frankie didnt return or call the last month had been a nightmare for jimmy ever since the stupid acid episode hed been living in constant fear up until the dirty deed actually went down hed been convinced that his part in it would make his career instead he seemed to have guaranteed his own death the first terrible shock was terry mansos getting killed trying to get into the car and now hed heard that both frankie and bruno had ended up floating in the east river it couldnt be long before they got him too jimmys only hope was that his uncle had talked to vinnie dominick his brotherinlaw by marriage and vinnie had promised to take care of things but until jimmy heard that everything was copacetic he couldnt relax not for a second jimmy heard a slight thump in the embalming room it was not his imagination with the tv turned down it had been as clear as day he froze wondering if hed hear the sound again beads of perspiration dotted his forehead when all remained quiet he mustered the courage to check it out by stepping over to the door of the utility room he was using to hide out opening the door as soundlessly as possible jimmy let his eyes slowly roam around the unilluminated embalming room there was a series of high windows along one wall that allowed some light in from a streetlamp but most of the room was lost in shadow jimmy could see the two shrouded corpses that his cousin had embalmed that evening since they were on gurneys pushed against the wall opposite the windows their white sheets seemed to glow in the halflight in the center of the room was the embalming table but jimmy could just make out its outline against the far wall was a large glassfronted cabinet that loomed out of the shadows on the wall below the windows were several porcelain sinks with trembling fingers jimmy reached into the room and switched on the light immediately he saw the source of the noise a large rat was on the embalming table disturbed in its foraging it stared at jimmy with angry gleaming eyes then it leaped from the table and scampered to a grate in the floor and disappeared down a drain jimmy felt disgusted and relieved at the same time he hated rats but he also hated hiding in a funeral home the place gave him the willies and reminded him of all the horror comic books hed read as a child his imagination had conjured up all sorts of explanations for the noises hed been hearing so seeing a rat was far better than seeing one of the embalmed corpses stalking around the room like tales from the crypt stepping out into the embalming room jimmy hurried over to a large metal box the size of a small trunk pushing it along the floor he used it to cover the grate where the rat had disappeared with that accomplished he headed back toward his room but he didnt get far he heard another slight thump through the door to the supply room thinking the rat had surfaced in the supply room jimmy grabbed the broom that hed been using on his cleanup chores planning on beating the crap out of the rat he threw open the supply room door he even took a step forward before he froze blood drained from his face in front of him was an upright figure whose features were lost in shadow a muffled scream issued from between jimmys lips as he staggered back the broom slipped from his hands and fell to the tiled floor with a clatter jimmys wildest fears had become a reality one of the corpses had come alive hi jimmy said the figure panic could not overcome paralysis in jimmys brain he stood rooted to the floor as the figure in front of him stepped from the shadows of the supply room along with a cold breeze from an open window you look a little pale tony commented he was holding his gun but it was pointed toward the floor maybe youd better climb up on that old porcelain table and lie down tony pointed with his free hand toward the embalming table they made me do it jimmy slobbered when he comprehended he was not dealing with a supernatural creature but rather a live human being obviously associated with cerinos organization yeah sure tony said in a falsely consoling tone of voice but get on the table just the same as jimmy stepped over to the embalming table with shaky legs tony walked over to the wall switch and turned the light on and off several times on the table tony commanded when he noticed that jimmy was hesitating with some effort jimmy got himself up on the table sitting on the edge lie down tony snapped when jimmy did so tony walked over and looked down on him great place to hide out he said it was all mansos idea jimmy blurted out his head was propped up on a black rubber block all i did was turn the lights off i didnt even know what was going down everybody says it was mansos idea tony complained of course hes the only one who didnt make it from the scene too bad hes not around to defend himself a thump in the supply room heralded angelos entrance he came into the room warily looking like a caged animal he did not like the funeral home this place stinks he said thats formaldehyde tony said you get used to it you dont even smell it after a while come over and meet jimmy lanso angelo walked over to the embalming table eyeing jimmy with contempt such a little prick he said it was mansos idea jimmy insisted i didnt do anything who else was involved angelo demanded he wanted to be sure manso depasquale and marchese jimmy said they made me go nobody wants to take any responsibility angelo said with disgust jimmy im afraid youve got to go for a little ride no please jimmy begged tony leaned over and whispered into angelos ear angelo glanced over at the embalming equipment then back down at jimmy cowering on the embalming table sounds appropriate angelo said with a nod especially for such a gutless piece of dog turd hold him down tony said with glee he darted over to the embalming equipment and turned on a pump he watched the dials until sufficient suction was produced then he wheeled the aspirator over to the table jimmy observed these preparations with growing alarm having avoided watching any of the embalming procedures his cousin had performed he had no idea what tony was up to whatever it was he was sure he wasnt going to like it angelo leaned across his chest and held his hands down without giving jimmy a chance to guess what was happening tony plunged the knifesharp embalming trocar into jimmys abdomen and roughly rooted the tip around with a stifled scream jimmys face seemed to pull inward as his cheeks went hollow and pale the canister on the aspirator filled with blood bits of tissue and partially digested food feeling queasy angelo let go of the boy and turned away for a second jimmys hands tried to grab the trocar from tony but they quickly went limp as the boy lapsed into unconsciousness what do you think tony asked as he stepped away to view his handiwork pretty neat huh all id have to do is pump him full of embalming fluid with the embalming machine and hed practically be ready for the grave lets get out of here angelo said he felt a little green wipe off any prints from that machine five minutes later they retraced their steps and climbed back out the window theyd considered using the door but decided against it in case it was wired once in the car angelo began to relax cerino had been right dominick hadnt been lying it hadnt been a setup as he pulled away from the curb angelo felt a sense of accomplishment well thats the end of the acid boys he said now we have to get back to real work did you show the second list to cerino tony asked yeah but well still start from the first list angelo said the second list will be easier makes no difference to me tony said but what do you say we eat first sitting around the vesuvio made me hungry how about another pizza i think wed better get one job done first angelo said he wanted to put a little distance between the grisly scene at the spoletto funeral home and his next meal embroiled again in the recurrent nightmare about her brother sinking into the bottomless black mud laurie was thankful for her alarms jangle that pulled her from her deep sleep barely awake she reached over to the alarm and turned it off before she could retract her arm back into the warm covers the alarm went off again that was when laurie realized it wasnt the alarm it was the telephone dr montgomery this is dr ted ackerman the caller said im sorry to bother you at this hour but im the tour doctor on call and i got a message that i should call you if a certain kind of case came in laurie was too bewildered to respond glancing down at the clock she saw it was only twothirty in the morning no wonder she was having a tough time getting her bearings i just got a call ted continued it sounds like the demographics you had mentioned it also sounds like cocaine the deceased is a banker aged thirtyone the name is stuart morgan where laurie asked nineseventy fifth avenue ted said do you want to take the call or shall i just go i dont mind either way ill go laurie said thanks she hung up the phone and stood up she felt miserable tom on the other hand seemed pleased to be awake purring contentedly he rubbed against her legs laurie threw on some clothes and grabbed a camera and several pairs of rubber gloves she left her apartment still buttoning her coat and dreaming of returning home to climb back in bed outside laurie found her street deserted but first avenue had traffic in five minutes she was in the back of a taxi with an afghani freedom fighter for a driver fifteen minutes later she got out of the cab at fifth an nypd car and a city ambulance were pulled up on the sidewalk both vehicles had their emergency lights blinking impatiently inside laurie flashed her medical examiners badge and was directed to penthouse b you the medical examiner a uniformed policeman asked with obvious amazement when laurie entered the apartment and again showed her badge his name tag read ron moore he was a muscular heavyset fellow in his late thirties laurie nodded feeling little tolerance or reserve for what was coming hell ron said you dont look like any of the medical examiners ive ever seen nonetheless i am laurie said without humor hey pete moore yelled get a load of what just walked in a medical examiner who looks more like a playboy bunny another uniformed but youngerappearing policeman poked his head from around a doorway his eyebrows went up when he saw laurie well ill be damned he said he had a handful of correspondence in both hands who is in charge here laurie questioned i am honey ron said my name is dr montgomery laurie said not honey sure doc ron answered who can give me a tour of the scene laurie asked might as well be me ron said this heres the living room obviously notice the drug paraphernalia on the coffee table the victim apparently injected himself there then went into the kitchen thats where the body is you get to the kitchen through the den laurie took a quick look around the apartment it was tiny but beautifully decorated from her spot in the foyer she could see the living room and part of the den in the living room two large windows with a southern exposure afforded an extraordinary view but more than the view laurie was interested in the clutter on the floor it appeared that the room had been ransacked was this a robbery laurie asked nah ron said we did this part of our usual thorough investigation if you know what i mean im not sure i do laurie said were always exhaustive in our search ron said for what laurie demanded for proper identification ron said you didnt notice all these diplomas here on the foyer walls laurie questioned while making a sweeping gesture the name seems to be rather obvious guess we didnt see them ron said wheres the body laurie asked i told you ron said its in the kitchen he pointed toward the den laurie walked ahead avoiding the debris on the floor and stepped into the den all the drawers to the desk were open the contents looked as if theyd been roughly gone through i suppose you were looking for identification in here as well she said thats right doc ron said passing through the den laurie walked to the threshold of the kitchen there she stopped the kitchen was as messy as the other rooms the entire refrigerator was emptied including its shelves laurie also noticed some clothing scattered across the floor the refrigerators door was slightly ajar dont tell me you were looking for identification in here as well she asked sarcastically hell no ron said the victim did this himself wheres the body laurie asked in the refrigerator ron said laurie stepped to the refrigerator and opened the door ron wasnt kidding stuart morgan was wedged into the refrigerator compartment he was almost naked clothed only in jockey shorts a money belt and socks his face was bone white his right arm was raised his hand balled into a tight fist i cant understand why he wanted to climb into the refrigerator ron said weirdest thing ive seen since i joined the force its called hyperpyrexia laurie said staring at stuart morgan cocaine can make peoples temperature go sky high the users get a little crazy theyd do anything to get their temperature down but this is the first one ive seen in a refrigerator if youll release the body we can let the ambulance boys take stuart away ron said were pretty much done otherwise did you touch the body laurie asked suddenly what are you talking about ron said nervously just what i said did you or pete touch the body well ron said he didnt seem inclined to answer its a simple question we had to find out if he were dead ron said but that was pretty easy since he was cold as one of those cucumbers on the floor so you merely reached in and felt for a pulse laurie suggested thats right ron said which pulse laurie asked the wrist ron said the right wrist laurie asked hey youre getting too specific ron said i cant remember which wrist let me tell you something laurie said as she removed the lens cap from her camera and started taking pictures of the body in the refrigerator see that right arm in the air yeah ron said its staying up in the air because of rigor mortis laurie said her camera flashed as she took a photo ive heard of that ron said but rigor mortis develops after the arm has been flaccid for a while laurie said does that suggest something to you about this body laurie took another photo from a different angle i dont know what youre talking about ron said it suggests that the body was moved after death laurie said like perhaps out of the refrigerator and then back and it had to be several hours after death because it takes about two hours for rigor mortis to set in well isnt that interesting ron said maybe pete should hear about this ron went to the door to the den and yelled for pete to come into the kitchen when he did ron explained what laurie had told him maybe this guys girlfriend pulled him out pete suggested this overdose was found by the deceaseds girlfriend laurie asked the torture drug abusers put their loved ones through was horrible thats right pete said the girlfriend called so maybe she pulled him out and then stuffed him back in laurie questioned with skepticism hardly likely what do you think happened ron asked for a moment laurie stared at the two policemen wondering what approach she should take i dont know what to think she said finally she pulled on her rubber gloves but for now i want to examine the body release it to the hospital people and go home laurie reached in and touched stuart morgans body it was hard due to the rigor mortis and cold as she examined him it was obvious that his other limbs were in unnatural positions as well as the right arm she noticed an iv site in the antecubital fossa of the left arm except for the refrigerator the case certainly seemed uncannily similar to the duncan andrews robert evans and marion overstreet overdoses straightening up laurie turned to ron would you mind helping me lift the body out of the refrigerator she asked pete you help her ron said pete made an expression of annoyance but accepted the rubber gloves from laurie and put them on together they lifted stuart morgan from the refrigerator and laid him out on the floor laurie took several more photos to her trained mind it was obvious from the attitude of the body that the rigor mortis had taken place while the body had been in the refrigerator that much was clear but it was also clear that the position the body was in when she found it was not the position it had been in originally as she was photographing the body laurie noticed that the money belt was partially open its zipper was caught on some paper money she moved in for a closeup putting her camera aside laurie bent down to examine the money belt more closely with some difficulty she managed to work the zipper loose and open the pouch inside were three single dollar bills with torn edges from having been caught in the zipper standing up laurie handed the three dollars to ron evidence she said evidence of what ron said ive heard of cases where police steal from the scenes of accidents or homicides laurie said but id never expected to be confronted by such an obvious case what the hell are you talking about ron demanded the body can be moved sergeant moore laurie said and i am supposed to extend an invitation to you to come and see the autopsy frankly i hope i never see you again laurie snapped off her rubber gloves threw them in the trash grabbed her camera and left the apartment i cant eat another bite tony said as he pushed the remains of a pizza away from him he pulled the napkin from his collar where hed tucked it and wiped his mouth of tomato stains whats the matter you dont like pepperoni youre eating like a bird angelo sipped his san pellegrino mineral water its fizz tended to settle his stomach which was still churning from the spoletto funeral home visit hed tried several bites of the pizza but it hadnt appealed to him in fact it made him nauseated so hed been impatient for tony to finish you done angelo asked tony yeah tony said sucking his teeth but i wouldnt mind having a coffee they were sitting in a small allnight italian pizza joint in elmhurst not far from the vesuvio there was a handful of customers sitting at widely spaced formica tables despite the fact it was threethirty in the morning an oldfashioned juke box was playing favorites from the fifties and sixties angelo had another mineral water while tony had a quick espresso ready angelo asked when tonys empty espresso cup clanked against the saucer angelo was eager to get going but felt he owed it to tony to relax for a while after all they had been busy ready tony said with a final wipe with his napkin they stood up tossed some bills on the table and walked out into the cold november night tucking their heads into their coats they dashed for the car it had started drizzling with the motor running to get the heater up to temperature angelo took the second list from the glove compartment and scanned it heres one in kew garden hills he said thats nice and convenient and it should be fast and easy this is going to be fun tony said eagerly he burped love that pepperoni angelo put the sheet back into the glove compartment as he pulled out into the deserted street he said working at night sure makes it easier to get around town the only problem is getting used to sleeping all day tony said he pulled out his beretta bantam and screwed the silencer on over the muzzle put that thing away until we get there angelo said you make me nervous just getting ready tony said he tried to jam the gun back into the holster but with its silencer it didnt quite fit the butt stuck out of his jacket ive been looking forward to this part of the operation because we dont have to be so careful pussyfooting around we still have to be careful angelo snapped in fact we always have to be careful calm down tony said you know what i mean we wont have to worry about all that crazy stuff now its going to be fast and we leave i mean boom its over and were out the door he pretended to shoot a pedestrian with his index finger extended from his hand sighting down his knuckle it took them a while to find the house a modest twostory affair made of stone and stucco with a slate roof it was situated on a quiet street that deadended into a cemetery not bad tony said these people must have a few bucks and possibly an alarm system angelo said he pulled over to the side of the road and parked lets hope its nothing complicated i dont want any complications who gets whacked tony asked i forgot angelo said he reached over to the glove compartment and took out the second list the woman he said after locating the name he returned the list to the glove compartment and lets get this straight so there will be no confusion ill do her theyll probably be in bed so you cover the man if he wakes up whack him you understand of course i understand tony said what do you think i am an imbecile i understand perfectly but you know how much i enjoy this stuff so hows about i do her and you cover the man jesus h christ angelo said he took out his gun and attached a silencer this is work not some turkey shoot were not here to have fun what difference does it make if you whack her or i whack her tony asked ultimately no difference at all angelo said but im in charge and im shooting the woman i want to make sure shes dead im the one who has to answer to cerino so you think you can shoot someone better than me tony said he seemed insulted for chrissake tony angelo said you can do the next one how about we take turns okay thats fair tony said share and share alike glad you approve angelo said then looking briefly up at the ceiling of the car he added i feel like im back in kindergarten all right lets go they climbed out of the car crossed the street and melted into the dense wet shrubbery surrounding the house in question arriving at the back door angelo studied it carefully running his hand over the architrave peering through the cracks with a small flashlight and inspecting the hardware he straightened up no alarm angelo said with amazement unless its something i havent seen you want to go through a window or a door tony asked the door should be easy enough angelo said with his pocketknife tony made short work of the caulking around one of the glass panes bordering the door with a pair of needlenosed pliers he pulled out the wire brads then lifted the pane out reaching inside he unbolted the door and turned the knob the door opened with only a minor squeak of protest no alarms sounded and no vicious dogs barked angelo silently stepped inside holding his gun up alongside of his head he let his eyes roam around the room it seemed to be a family room with ginghamcovered couches and a largescreen television he listened for a minute then lowered his gun after testing for alarms he began to relax everything seemed to be fine the place was there for the taking motioning for tony to follow angelo moved silently to the front entrance hall together the two men crept up a grand circular staircase the stairs led them to an upstairs corridor with a halfdozen doors opening onto it each of the doors was slightly ajar save for one trusting his instincts angelo made his way straight for it when he was sure tony was right behind him he tried the door it pushed open at his touch loud snores came from the bed against the far wall angelo wasnt sure who was snoring but once he was convinced both were still sound asleep he motioned for tony to follow him together they advanced to the bed it was a kingsized bed covered with a downfilled comforter in the bed were a man and a woman of late middle age they were both on their backs their arms at their sides angelo veered to the right to be on the same side as the woman tony went to the opposite side the victims did not stir angelo motioned for tonys attention pointing toward his walther in the halflight of the bedroom indicating that he was about to dispatch the woman and that tony should keep his eye on the man tony nodded and as angelo brought up his gun to bear on the sleeping female head tony did the same across the bed angelo advanced the gun to the point where hed be unable to miss aiming at the temple just above and in front of the ear he wanted the bullet to penetrate into the base of the brain approximately where it would end up if he were able to shoot her from behind the report was loud in relation to the silence that prevailed in the room but when compared with normal noise it was a soft hissing thump like a fist striking a pillow hardly had angelo recovered from the wince he made after pulling the trigger when there was another similar hissing thump out of the corner of his eye he saw the mans head rebound off the pillow then settle back a dark stain that looked black in the halflight began to spread i couldnt help it tony said i heard you shoot and i couldnt help pulling the trigger myself i like it it gives me such a rush youre a goddamn psychopath angelo said angrily you werent supposed to shoot the guy unless he moved that was the plan what the hell difference does it make tony said the difference is that you have to learn to follow orders angelo snapped all right already tony said im sorry i couldnt help it next time ill play exactly how you say lets get out of here angelo said he started toward the door how about looking around for some cash or valuables tony asked after all were here i dont want to take the time angelo said at the door to the hall he turned come on tony were not here to turn a profit cerinos already paying us enough but what cerino doesnt know cant hurt him tony said he picked up a wallet on the nighttable along with a rolex watch how about i take a souvenir fine angelo said now lets get out of here three minutes later they were speeding away holy crap tony exclaimed whats the matter theres over five hundred big ones in here tony said waving the bills in the air he already had the gold rolex watch on his wrist add that to what cerino is paying us and were doing okay just be sure to get rid of that wallet angelo said it could finger us for sure no problem tony said ill drop it in the incinerator angelo pulled up to the curb and put the car in park now what asked tony angelo leaned over and took the list out of the glove compartment i want to see if theres anybody else in this area he said bingo angelo said after a brief perusal heres two in forest hills thats right around the corner we can do both before dawn no problem id say thatd make it a pretty good night id say itd make it a fabulous night tony said ive never made this kind of money all right angelo said studying a map i know where both of these houses are expensive part of town he placed the map and the list down on the center console put the car in gear and drove off it took less than half an hour for angelo to cruise past the first house it was a large white mansion set far back from the street angelo guessed the house sat on at least two acres several leafless elms lined a long curving driveway which one this time tony asked as he gazed up at the big house the man angelo said he was trying to decide where to leave the car in such a ritzy part of town there werent many vehicles parked on the street in the end he decided to drive right up the driveway since it looped behind the house he could park so that the car wasnt visible from the street he turned his lights off as he came up the drive hoping the darkened car wouldnt attract any attention now remember tony said as they prepared to move in this time its my turn angelo looked to the heavens as if to say why me god then he nodded and the two went to the house the white mansion proved more difficult than the more modest stone house the white mansion had several overlapping alarm systems that took angelo some time to figure out as well as neutralize it was a half hour before they broke out a whole sash in a window into a laundry room angelo went in first to make sure there were no infrared detectors or lasers when he determined the coast was clear tony climbed over the windowsill they stayed together and moved slowly through the kitchen where they could hear a tv playing in a nearby room as carefully as possible they moved toward the sound it was coming from a room off the front hall angelo went first and peered around the corner the room was a den with a wet bar built into one wall a giant rearprojection tv in another in front of the tv was a chintzupholstered chesterfield asleep in the center of the couch was an enormously overweight man dressed in a blue bathrobe his stubby surprisingly skinny legs stuck out from beneath the corpulent mass of his abdomen and were propped up on a hassock on his feet were leather slippers angelo pulled back to talk with tony hes asleep and alone well have to assume the wife if there is one is upstairs what are we going to do tony questioned you wanted to whack him angelo said so go in and do it just do it right then well check on the woman tony smiled and stepped beyond angelo his gun with the silencer in place was in his right hand rounding the corner tony boldly strode into the den he went directly up to the man on the couch pointing the gun at the mans temple just above the ear he purposefully bumped the mans thigh with his leg the man sputtered as his heavily lidded eyes struggled up gloria dear he managed no honey its metony the hissing thump knocked the man over onto his right side on the couch tony leaned over and placed the muzzle of his silencer at the base of the skull and fired again the man didnt move tony straightened up and looked back at angelo angelo waved for him to follow him together they went up the stairs on the second floor they had to search through several rooms before finding gloria she was fast asleep with the lights on but with black eyeshades over her eyes and earplugs in her ears looks like she thinks shes a movie star tony said this is going to be a snap lets go angelo said he gave tonys arm a tug aw come on tony said shes like a sitting duck im not going to argue angelo snarled were getting out of here back in the car tony pouted while angelo checked the fastest route to the next house angelo didnt care how long tony brooded at least it kept him quiet the final house was a twostory row house with a metal awning forming a carport in front of the singlecar garage a small chainlink fence demarcated a postagestampsized lawn that contained two pink flamingo statues the man or the woman tony asked breaking his silence for the first time the woman angelo said and you can do her if you want he was feeling magnanimous with the evenings work drawing to a close breaking into the final house was a breeze they did it from the alleyway going through the back door to their surprise they found the husband sleeping on the couch with an empty sixpack on the floor next to him angelo told tony to go upstairs by himself and that hed keep his eye on the man angelo could see tonys eager smile in the halflight and he thought the kids appetite for whacking was insatiable several minutes later angelo could barely hear the silenced report of tonys gun followed quickly by another shot at least the kid was thorough a few minutes after that tony reappeared the guy move tony asked angelo shook his head and motioned for them to leave too bad tony said his eyes lingered a second on the sleeping man before he turned to follow angelo out the door on the back stoop angelo stretched and looked up at the brightening sky here comes the sun he said how about some breakfast sounds great tony said what a night it doesnt get any better than this as he walked to the car he unscrewed his silencer from his gun am thursday manhattan although she hadnt slept much thanks to her latenight call laurie made it a point to arrive at work a little early to compensate for having been late the day before it was only seven fortyfive as she mounted the steps to the medical examiners office going directly to the id office she detected a mild electricity in the air several of the other associate medical examiners who usually didnt come in until around eightthirty were already on the job kevin southgate and arnold besserman two of the older examiners were huddled around the coffeepot in heated debate kevin a liberal and arnold an archconservative never agreed on anything im telling you arnold was saying when laurie squeezed through to get herself some coffee if we had more police on the streets this kind of thing wouldnt happen i disagree kevin said this kind of tragedy what happened now laurie asked as she stirred her coffee a series of homicides in queens arnold said gunshot wounds to the head from close range smallcaliber bullets laurie asked arnold looked at kevin i dont know about that yet the posts havent been done yet kevin explained were they pulled out of the river no arnold said these people were asleep in their own homes now if we had more police presence come on arnold kevin said laurie left the two to their bickering and went over to check the autopsy schedule sipping her coffee she checked at who was on autopsy besides herself and what cases were assigned after her own name were three cases including stuart morgan she was pleased calvin was sticking by his promise noting that the other two cases were drug overdosetoxicity cases as well laurie flipped through the investigators reports she was immediately dismayed to see that profiles of the deceased resembled the previous suspicious cases randall thatcher thirty years old was a lawyer valerie abrams thirtythree was a stockbroker the day before shed feared thered be more cases but shed hoped her fears wouldnt materialize obviously that wasnt to be the case already there were three more overnight her modest series had jumped one hundred percent laurie walked through communications on her way to the medical forensic investigative department spotting the police liaison office she wondered what she should do about the suspected thievery at the morgan apartment for the moment she decided to let it go if she saw lou she might discuss the matter with him laurie found cheryl myers in her tiny windowless office no luck so far on that duncan andrews case cheryl told her before she could say a word thats not why i stopped by laurie said i left word last evening with bart that i wanted to be called if any upscale drug overdose cases came in like duncan andrews or marion overstreet i was called last night for one but this morning i discovered there were two others that i wasnt called on have you any idea why i wasnt called no cheryl said ted was on last night well have to ask him this evening was there a problem not really laurie admitted im just curious actually i probably couldnt have gone to all three scenes and i will be handling the autopsies by the way did you check with the hospital about the marion overstreet case sure did cheryl said i spoke with a dr murray and he said that they were just following policy orders from you thats what i figured laurie said but it was worth a check also i have something else id like to ask you to do would you see what kind of medical records you can get particularly surgical on a woman by the name of marsha schulman id love to get some xrays i believe she lived in bayside queens im not sure of her age lets say around forty ever since jordan had told laurie about his secretarys husbands shady dealings and arrest record shed had a bad feeling about the womans disappearance particularly in view of the odd breakin at jordans office cheryl wrote the information down on a pad on her desk ill get right on it next laurie sought out john devries as shed feared he was less than cordial i told you id call you john snapped when laurie asked about a contaminant ive got hundreds of cases besides yours i know youre busy laurie said but this morning i have three more overdoses like the three i had before that brings the body count to a total of six young affluent welleducated career people something has to be in that cocaine and we have to find it youre welcome to come up here and run the tests yourself john said but i want you to leave me alone if you dont ill have to speak to dr bingham why are you acting this way laurie asked ive tried to be nice about this youre being a pain in the neck john said fine laurie said its wonderful to know we have a nice cooperative atmosphere around here exasperated laurie stalked out of the lab grumbling under her breath she felt a hand grip her arm and she spun around ready to slap john devries for having the nerve to touch her but it wasnt john it was one of his young assistants peter letterman could i talk to you a moment peter said he glanced warily over his shoulder of course laurie said come into my cubbyhole peter said he motioned for laurie to follow him they entered what had originally been designed as a broom closet there was barely enough room there for a desk a computer terminal a file cabinet and two chairs peter closed the door behind them peter was a thin blond fellow with delicate features to laurie he appeared as the quintessential graduate student with a marked intensity to his eyes and demeanor under his white lab coat was an opennecked flannel shirt john is a little hard to get along with he said thats an understatement laurie answered lots of artists are like that peter continued and john is an artist of sorts when it comes to chemistry and toxicology in particular hes amazing but i couldnt help overhearing your conversations with him i think one of the reasons hes giving you a hard time is to make a point with the administration that he needs more funding hes slowing up a lot of reports and for the most part it makes little difference i mean the people are dead but if your suspicions are right it sounds like we could be in the lifesaving business for a change so id like to help ill see what i can do for you even if i have to put in some overtime id be grateful peter laurie said and youre right peter smiled selfconsciously we went to the same school he said really laurie said where wesleyan peter said i was two years behind you but we shared a class physical chemistry im sorry but i dont remember you laurie said well i was kinda a nerd then anyway ill let you know what i come up with laurie returned to her office feeling considerably more optimistic about mankind with peters generous offer to help going through the days autopsy folders she came up with only a few questions on two of the cases similar to her question about marion overstreet just to be thorough she called cheryl to ask her to check them out after changing in her office laurie went down to the autopsy room vinnie had stuart morgan up and was well prepared for her arrival they started work immediately the autopsy went smoothly as they were finishing the internal portion cheryl myers came in holding a mask to her face laurie glanced around to make sure calvin wasnt in sight to complain that cheryl had not put on scrubs happily he wasnt in the room i had some luck with marsha schulman she said waving a set of xrays shed been treated at manhattan general because she worked for a doctor on the staff they had recent chest film which they sent right over want me to put it up please laurie said she wiped her hands on her apron and followed cheryl over to the xray view box cheryl stuck the xrays into the holder and stepped to the side they want them back right away cheryl explained the tech in xray was doing me a favor by letting them out without authorization laurie scanned the xrays they were an ap and lateral of the chest taken two years before the lung fields were clear and normal the heart silhouette looked normal as well disappointed laurie was about to tell cheryl to remove the films when she looked at the clavicles or collarbones the one on the right had a slight angle to it twothirds along its length associated with a slight increase in radiopacity marsha schulman had broken her collarbone sometime in the past though well healed there had definitely been a fracture vinnie laurie called out get someone to bring the xray we took on the headless floater see something cheryl asked laurie pointed out the fracture explaining to cheryl why it appeared as it did vinnie brought the requested xray over to the view box he snapped the new film up next to marsha schulmans well look at that laurie cried she pointed to the fractured clavicle they were identical on both films i think were looking at the same person she said who is it vinnie asked the name is marsha schulman laurie said pulling down the xrays from the manhattan general and handing them to cheryl then she asked cheryl to check if marsha schulman had had a cholecystectomy and a hysterectomy she told her it was important and asked her to do it immediately pleased with this discovery laurie started her second case randall thatcher as with her first case of the day there was essentially no pathology the autopsy went quickly and smoothly again laurie was able to document with reasonable certainty that the cocaine had been taken iv by the time they were sewing up the body cheryl was back in with the news that marsha schulman had indeed had both operations in question in fact both had been performed at manhattan general thrilled by this additional confirmation laurie finished up and went to her office to dictate the first two cases and to make several calls first she tried jordans office only to learn that dr scheffield was in surgery again laurie sighed she was disappointed not to get him right away hes been doing a lot of transplants lately jordans nurse explained he always does quite a bit of surgery but lately hes been doing even more laurie left word for jordan to call back when he could then she called police headquarters and asked for lou to lauries chagrin lou was unavailable laurie left her number and asked that he return her call when he could somewhat frustrated laurie did her dictation then headed back to the autopsy room for her third and final case of the day as she waited for the elevator she wondered if bingham might be willing to change his mind about making some kind of public statement now that there were six cases when the elevator doors opened laurie literally bumped into lou for a moment they looked at each other with embarrassment im sorry she said it was my fault lou told her i wasnt looking where i was going i was the one who wasnt looking laurie said then they both laughed at their selfconscious behavior were you coming to see me laurie asked no lou said i was looking for the pope someone said he was up here on the fifth floor very funny laurie said leading him back to her office actually i just this minute tried to call you oh sure lou teased honest laurie said she sat down at her desk lou took the chair hed been in the day before i made an id on the headless floater that was found with marchese the name is marsha schulman she is jordan scheffields secretary you mean dr roses she was his secretary lou pointed at the flowers which had not lost any of their freshness one and the same laurie said just last night he told me that shed not shown up for work but he also told me that her husband whos no boy scout has ties to organized crime whats the husbands name lou asked danny schulman laurie said could that be the danny schulman who owns a restaurant in bayside he asked thats the one laurie said apparently hes had several brushes with the law damn right he has hes associated with the lucia crime family at least they used his place to run some of their operations like fencing stolen goods gambling that sort of thing we picked up old dannyboy hoping hed finger some of the higherups but the guy took the fall without talking you think his wife might have gotten killed because of his business laurie asked who knows lou admitted threats could have been made warnings not heeded ill certainly look into that angle what a nasty business laurie said thats an understatement lou said and speaking of nasty business have you gotten any results on frankie depasquales eyes could they document acid im afraid i havent heard back yet dr devries has not been terribly accommodating i dont think hes looked at the specimen yet but there is some good news a young assistant of his is going to help me on the qt i think ill finally start getting some results i hope so lou said something big is about to happen in the queens crime world there were four ganglandstyle slayings there last night people shot in their own homes and on top of that a friend of frankies and brunos was killed in a funeral home in ozone park whatever tensions were brewing are bubbling big time id heard there were a number of homicides in queens laurie said one couple was shot right in their bed while they were sleeping the other two one man and one woman were sleeping as well as far as we can tell none of these people had any previous association with organized crime sounds like youre not convinced im not the manner in which they were killed is almost an indictment anyway ive got three separate detective teams working on the three cases and this is in addition to the organized crime unit who is doing the same we have so many people out there they are running into each other sounds like the vaccarro and lucia families are moving toward a showdown laurie said but you know something somehow mobsters offing mobsters doesnt bother me so much at least not as much as the deaths of the accomplished people im seeing with this rash of cocaine overdoses ive got three more today that makes six i guess we view things from a different perspective lou said i feel just the opposite as far as im concerned i cant get too overly sympathetic about rich privileged people doing themselves in trying to get high in fact i couldnt care less about druggies of any sort oding because they are the ones that create the demand for drugs if it werent for the demand there wouldnt be a drug problem theyre more to blame for this current national disaster than the starving peasant down in peru or colombia growing coca leaves if the druggies knock themselves off all the better with each death there is that much less demand i cant believe im hearing you correctly laurie snapped these are productive members of society that we are losing people on whom society has spent time and money educating and why are they dying because some bastard put a contaminant in the drug or cut it with something lethal stopping these unnecessary deaths is a lot more important than stopping a bunch of gangsters from killing each other hell theyre the ones who are doing a service to society but not only gangsters get hurt when crime wars break out lou yelled besides organized crime reaches way down into our lives in a city like new york it is all around us take trash collection i dont care about trash collection laurie yelled thats the most stupid comment that i all of a sudden laurie stopped in midsentence she realized shed become angry and that getting angry at lou was ridiculous im sorry for raising my voice laurie said i sound like im mad at you but im not im just frustrated i cant get anyone else to share my concern about these particular overdose deathsnot even youand i think future deaths are preventable but at the rate im going were like to have forty more ods before anybody blinks about them and im sorry for raising my voice lou said i suppose im frustrated too i need some kind of break plus i have the police commissioner breathing down my back ive only been a lieutenant on homicide for a year i want to save lives but i also want to save my job i like being a policeman i cant imagine doing anything else speaking of police laurie said changing the subject i had a little shock last night i wanted to share with you id like your advice laurie described the experience shed had the night before at stuart morgans apartment she tried to be as objective as possible since there had been no hard evidence yet as she told the story especially with the three dollars remaining in the money belt she became even more convinced that the uniformed patrolmen had stolen things from the stuart morgan apartment thats too bad lou said dejectedly there was a pause laurie looked at lou expectantly is that all you can say laurie questioned finally what else can i say i hate to hear stories like that but it happens what can you do i thought youd demand to know the names of the officers involved so that you could reprimand them and and what lou asked get them fired im not going to do that you have to expect a little thievery once in a while with the kind of money the typical uniformed patrolman pulls down a few bucks here and there its like incentive pay remember police work is godawful frustrating as well as dangerous so its not so surprising not that i personally condone it but you have to expect some that sounds like convenient morality laurie said when you start allowing the good guys to break the law where do you stop and not only is this kind of thievery morally objectionable its also a disaster from a medicallegal point of view these guys mucked around with a scene distorting and destroying evidence its bad and its wrong but im not about to make an issue about this kind of illicit behavior at a drug overdose scene id feel differently if it had been a homicide im sure the officers would too i cant believe what a double standard you have any drug user can drop dead as far as youre concerned and if cops steal from a victim before the me arrives so much the better im sorry to disappoint you lou said but this is just the way i feel you asked me how i felt ive told you if you want to pursue the matter i suggest you call internal affairs at police headquarters and tell the story to them me id rather concentrate on serious bad guys once again i cant believe im hearing you correctly laurie said im floored what am i too naive i take the fifth amendment lou said trying to lighten the atmosphere but i tell you what why dont we discuss it further this evening how about dinner tonight i have plans laurie said of course lou said how silly of me to think you might be available i suppose it is dr roses again but dont tell me whats left of my ego couldnt take it with his limo and all hes probably taking you to those places where i couldnt afford to check my coat like i said yesterday let me know if your lab decides to do any of the tests that might show anything ciao with that lou got up and left the room laurie was happy to see him go he could be so irritating if he wanted to take personally her turning him down for that evening he was welcome to what did he expect her to do drop everything she was about to call internal affairs as lou had facetiously suggested but before she could pick up the receiver the phone rang it was jordan returning her call i hope you didnt call to cancel for tonight he said nothing like that laurie said its about your secretary marsha schulman you mean my former secretary jordan said she didnt show up or call this morning either so im in the process of replacing her i already have a temp im afraid shes dead laurie said oh no jordan said are you serious laurie explained how she had made the identification of the headless corpse with the chest xray and the fact of the two surgeries the forensic medical investigators are following up to make the identification even more certain laurie said but with what we have already i think we can be quite confident i wonder if that bastard husband was involved jordan wondered aloud im sure the police will be looking into the possibility laurie said anyway i thought you should know im not sure i want to know jordan said what horrible news sorry to be the bearer of sad tidings laurie said its not your fault jordan said and i had to be told anyway ill still see you at eight eight it is laurie hung up and dialed internal affairs she spoke to a disinterested secretary who took down the details of her story promising to pass them along to her boss laurie sat at her desk to compose her thoughts before returning to the autopsy room for her last case she was beginning to feel overwhelmed it felt as if every aspect of her lifepersonal professional ethicalwas spinning out of control im lieutenant lou soldano lou said politely he passed his credentials to the brighteyed secretary at the reception desk homicide she asked thats right lou said id like to speak with the doctor i only need a few minutes of his time if youll have a seat in the waiting room ill let him know youre here lou sat down and idly flipped through a recent edition of the new yorker he noticed the drawings on the walls especially one that was blatantly pornographic he wondered if someone had actually chosen them or if they had come with the office either way thought lou there was no accounting for some peoples taste other than the drawings lou was impressed with the waiting room the walls were paneled with mahogany a tasteful inchthick oriental carpet covered the floor but then lou already knew the good doctor did quite well for himself lou looked at the faces of the patients who paid for this opulence plus the limo and the roses there were about ten in the waiting room some with eyepatches some who looked totally healthy including one middleaged woman draped in jewels lou would have loved to ask her what she was there for just to get an idea but he didnt dare time passed slowly as one by one the patients disappeared into the depths of the office lou tried to contain his impatience but after threequarters of an hour he began to get irritated he began to think it was a deliberate snub on jordan scheffields part although lou didnt have an appointment hed expected to be seen relatively quickly perhaps to schedule a future visit if it were needed it wasnt every day a detective lieutenant from homicide dropped by someones office besides lou hadnt planned on taking much of the doctors time lous reason for the visit was twofold he wanted to find out more about marsha schulman but he also wanted to talk about paul cerino it was a kind of fishing trip the doctor might be able to fill him in on some details he didnt yet know he resisted the nagging thought at the back of his mind he was really there to check out the guy who was seeing doctor laurie montgomery every night for dinner mr soldano the secretary said at last dr scheffield will see you now its about time lou mumbled as he got to his feet and tossed his magazine aside he walked toward the door being held open by the secretary it wasnt the same door that all the patients had disappeared into after a short hall lou was shown into jordans private office he strode into the center of the room behind him he heard the door close lou looked at the top of jordans blond head the doctor was writing in a record sit down jordan said without looking up lou debated what he wanted to do the idea of disregarding what sounded more like a command than an offer appealed to him so he stayed where he was his eyes roamed the office he was impressed and couldnt help compare the environment with his own utilitarian metaldesked peelingwalled rathole who said life was fair lou mused redirecting his attention to the doctor lou couldnt tell much other than that the man was well groomed he was dressed in a typical doctor white coat that appeared to be whiter than white and starched to boardlike stiffness on his ring finger he wore a large gold signet ring probably from some fancy school jordan finished his writing and meticulously organized the pages of the record before folding over its cover then he looked up he appeared genuinely surprised that lou was still standing in the middle of his office hat in hand please jordan said he got to his feet and gestured toward one of the two chairs facing his desk sit down sorry to have made you wait but im tremendously busy these days lots of surgery what can i do for you i suppose you are here about my secretary marsha schulman tragic situation i hope you people are planning on looking into her husbands probable involvement lous eyes traveled up to jordans face he was dismayed the man was so tall it made him feel short by comparison although he was almost six feet himself what do you know about mr schulman lou asked with jordans more cordial offer lou sat down jordan did the same lou listened while jordan told all he knew about marshas husband since lou already knew considerably more than jordan he took the time to observe the good doctor noticing things like a mild yet probably fake english accent before jordan had even finished talking about danny schulman lou had decided that jordan was a pompous affected arrogant creep lou couldnt understand what a downtoearth girl like laurie could see in him lou decided it was time to change the subject what about paul cerino he asked jordan hesitated for a moment he was surprised at the mention of pauls name pardon me for asking he said but what does mr cerino have to do with anything lou was glad to see jordan squirm id appreciate your telling me all you know about mr cerino mr cerino is a patient jordan said stiffly i already know that lou said id like to hear how his treatment is coming along i dont talk about my patients jordan said coldly really lou asked raising his eyebrows thats not what ive heard in fact i have it from a reliable source that youve been discussing mr cerinos case in detail jordans lips narrowed some but we can leave that subject for the moment lou said i also wanted to ask if you or any of your staff had been the subject of any extortion attempt absolutely not jordan said he laughed nervously why would anyone threaten me when you start involving yourself with people like cerino things like extortion have a way of happening could your secretary have been threatened in some way for what i dont know lou said you tell me cerino wouldnt want to extort me or any of my employees im taking care of the man im helping him these organizedcrime people think differently than normal people lou said they consider themselves special and above the law in fact above everything if they dont get exactly what they want they kill you if they do get what they want but decide they dont like you or they owe you too much money they kill you well im certainly giving them what they want whatever you say doc im just trying to explore all the angles youve got one dead secretary and somebody whacked her rather brutally and whoever did it didnt want anyone finding out who she was anytime soon i want to know why well all i can tell you is im quite certain marshas disappearance or death hasnt anything to do with mr cerino now if youll kindly excuse me i have patients to attend to if you have any additional questions perhaps you should contact me through my attorney sure doc sure lou said ill be on my way but a word to the wise id be very careful where paul cerino is concerned the mafia may seem glamorous when you read about them or see them in the movies but i think youd develop a different point of view if you got a glimpse of what mrs schulman looks like now and one last piece of advice id be careful about sending him a bill thank you for your time doctor lou walked out of the building embarrassed to an extent that he had come it had been a worthless encounter that had only annoyed him he couldnt stand pompous silverspoonfed fools like jordan scheffield if he got into trouble with paul cerino it was his own fault he was so full of his own selfimportance that he couldnt see the danger half an hour later lou arrived at his office at police headquarters for a moment he stood on the threshold surveying the mess within his digs were a far cry from jordan scheffields posh surroundings the furniture was the usual gray metal city issue with the burns from innumerable cigarettes left on the edges and with stains from spilled coffee the floor was dried and cracked linoleum the walls had been painted years previously in a pale green that had blistered from a water leak from the floor above papers and reports were stacked on every horizontal surface since the file cabinets were full lou had never thought much about his office but today it seemed oppressively dingy it was irrational he knew but he got mad at the smug doctor all over again just then harvey lawson another detective lieutenant on the force interrupted lous thoughts hey lou harvey called you know that broad you were talking about yesterday the one from the medical examiners office yeah i just heard she called internal affairs made some beef about two uniformed guys stealing from an overdose scene what do you think of that tony and angelo were back in angelos town car they were parked across the street from the greenblatt pavilion of manhattan general hospital the greenblatt pavilion was the fancy part of the hospital where pampered wealthy patients could order from special menus that included amenities such as wine provided their doctors permitted such treats as part of their diet it was in the afternoon and tony and angelo were exhausted theyd hoped to sleep after their busy night but paul cerino had other plans for them what time did doc travino say we should pull this off tony asked three oclock angelo said supposedly thats the time theres most confusion in the hospital thats when the day shift of nurses are getting ready to leave and the evening shift is just coming on if thats what the doc says its good enough for me i dont like it angelo said i still think its too risky he surveyed the vicinity with wary eyes there was a lot of activity and plenty of cops in the ten minutes theyd been parked there angelo had spotted three squad cars cruising by think of it as a challenge tony suggested and think about all the money were getting i like working at night better angelo said and i dont need any challenges at this point of my life besides i should be sleeping right this minute i shouldnt be working when im so tired i might make a mistake lighten up tony said this should be fun but angelo wouldnt let it go i got a bad feeling about this job he said maybe we should just go home and sleep we got another big night ahead of us tonight why dont you wait here and ill go in by myself ill still split the money with you angelo bit his lip it was tempting to send the kid into the hospital alone but if anything went wrong he knew cerino would be furious and even under the best circumstances if tony went in by himself there was a good chance things would go awry reluctantly angelo came to the conclusion that he really didnt have a choice thanks for the offer angelo said scanning the neighborhood once more but i think we should do this together it was then that angelo turned to tony and saw to his horror that tony had his gun out he was checking the magazine for chrissake angelo shouted put your goddamn gun away what if someone was to walk by the car and see you monkeying around with that thing theres cops all over this place all right already tony exclaimed he clicked the magazine back into his gun and slipped the gun into its holster you are in one hell of a bad mood i looked around before i took my piece out what do you think i am a moron theres nobody anywhere near this car angelo closed his eyes and tried to calm himself his headache was getting worse his nerves were frayed he hated being so tired its getting close to three tony said all right angelo said you remember the plan of what were going to do when we get inside the hospital i remember what were supposed to do tony repeated no problem all right angelo said again lets do it they got out of the car angelo gave one more glance around the immediate area satisfied he led tony across the street and into the lobby of bustling manhattan general hospital their first stop was the hospitality shop where angelo purchased two bunches of cut flowers handing one to tony angelo carried the other taking the flowers back to the entrance area they waited in line for information mary oconnor angelo said politely once it was his turn five zero seven the desk attendant told him after consulting her computer screen joining the crowd at the elevators tony leaned toward angelo and whispered so far so good angelo glowered at tony again but said nothing nurses just coming on duty had them surrounded it was no time for a reprimand at the fifth floor angelo and tony got off the elevator along with three nurses angelo waited to see which way the nurses went then chose the opposite direction he immediately saw that room was the other way but he walked until the nurses had reached the busy nurses station before retracing his steps angelo behaved as if he knew exactly where he was going he sauntered past the nurses station without so much as a glance in its direction once beyond the nurses station it was easy to find slowing down angelo glanced inside satisfied that no staff was in the room he stepped over the threshold and looked at the woman in the bed she was watching a tv mounted on a mechanical arm attached to the bed frame the woman had an eyepatch over one eye her unprotected eye switched its attention from the tv to angelo she gave him a questioning look good afternoon mrs oconnor angelo said affably you have a visitor angelo waved for tony to come into the room who are you mrs oconnor asked tony came smiling into the room with his bouquet of flowers out in front of him mrs oconnors eyes went from angelo to tony she smiled i think you must have the wrong room she said maybe the wrong oconnor oh angelo questioned arent you the oconnor whos scheduled for surgery later today yes mrs oconnor said but i dont know either of you do i i cant imagine you do angelo said he stepped back to the door and looked up and down the hall the nurses station was still a flurry of activity no one was coming the other way i think its time for mrs oconnors treatment tonys smile broadened he laid his flowers on the night table what treatment mrs oconnor asked relaxation therapy tony said let me take your pillow did dr scheffield order this although she was suspicious mrs oconnor did not resist as tony pulled the pillow from beneath her head she wasnt accustomed to secondguessing her physicians not exactly tony said the confession emboldened mrs oconnor id like to speak with nurse lang she began to say but she didnt get a chance to finish tony crammed the pillow down over her face then sat on her chest a few muffled sounds followed but mrs oconnor didnt struggle for long she kicked several times but the move seemed less defensive than an uncontrollable reaction to being deprived of air angelo acted as lookout throughout he kept his eyes on the nurses station no problem there the nurses were engrossed in conversation angelo looked down the hall in the other direction his heart missed a beat when he spotted a middleaged woman approaching pushing a cartful of water pitchers she was only fifteen feet away stepping back into the room angelo closed the door tony hadnt quite finished dispensing his treatment he was still sitting on top of mrs oconnor someones coming angelo warned him he pulled his gun from his pocket and fumbled with the silencer tony kept pressure on the pillow there was a knock at the door angelo motioned toward the bathroom come on he urged in a whisper when tony failed to follow him in after another ten seconds there was a second knock tony reluctantly lifted the pillow mary oconnor was blue and motionless her unpatched eye stared blankly at the ceiling frantically angelo motioned for tony to join him in the bathroom as a third knock sounded then as the door to the hall opened tony pushed off the bed and crowded into the bathroom forcing angelo to straddle the toilet tony pulled the bathroom door partially closed as the woman with the cart of water pitchers entered the room angelo had his gun ready the silencer was in place he did not like the idea of using it but he was afraid he didnt have any choice with the bathroom door open a fraction of an inch he was able to watch as the woman switched oconnors water pitcher for a fresh one he held his breath the woman was only a few feet away his plan was to wait for her to spot mrs oconnor before he made his move to his surprise the woman disappeared from view without so much as a glance in mrs oconnors direction after waiting for a full minute angelo told tony to take a careful peek slowly tony opened the bathroom door enough so that he could get his head around the door shes gone tony said lets get out of here angelo said exiting the bathroom tony paused at the bedside you think shes dead he questioned you cant be that blue and still be alive angelo said come on grab your flowers i want to be long gone before they find her they made it to the car without incident angelo was thinking it was a good thing hed gone in triggerhappy tony would have left a trail of bodies in his wake angelo was just pulling away from the curb when tony confided in him smothering wasnt bad but i still like shooting them better its surer quicker and definitely more satisfying lou took out a cigarette and lit up he didnt even feel like smoking particularly he was just interested in killing time the meeting was to have started half an hour earlier but officers were still drifting in the subject was the three ganglandstyle executions that had occurred in queens overnight lou had thought the cases would have inspired a sense of urgency in the department but three detectives were missing screw them lou said finally referring to the missing officers he motioned to norman carver a detective sergeant to start norman was nominally in charge of the investigation although in point of fact the three units covering the cases were acting independently im afraid we dont have much norman said the only link weve established between the three cases other than the manner of murder is that each of the men was involved in the restaurant business in one way or another either as an owner partner or supplier thats not much of an association lou commented lets review each case the first one was the goldburgs in kew gardens norman said both harry and martha goldburg were shot dead in their sleep the preliminary report suggests two guns were involved and harrys occupation lou asked owned a successful restaurant here in manhattan norman said place is called la dolce vita east side fiftyfourth he was partners with an anthony debartollo so far weve come up with no problems financial or personal involving the partnership or the restaurant next lou said steven vivonetto of forest hills norman said owned a chain of fastfood joints all over nassau county called pasta pronto again no financial problems that weve come across but these are all just preliminaries and finally janice singleton also of forest hills norman said married to chester singleton he has a restaurantpurveyor business and was recently picked up by the vivonetto chain as a supplier again no financial problems in fact things had been looking up with the pasta pronto account whod been supplying the pasta pronto before singleton lou asked dont know that yet norman said i think we should find that out lou said did the singletons and the vivonettos know each other personally we havent established that yet norman said but we will what about any organizedcrime associations lou asked the way these people were killed certainly suggests as much thats what we thought when we started norman said he glanced around at the five other men in the room they all nodded but weve found almost nothing a couple of the restaurants that singleton supplied have some loose association but nothing major lou sighed theres got to be some connection linking the three i agree norman said the slugs we got from the medical examiners suggest that harry goldburg steven vivonetto and janice singleton were shot with the same gun martha goldburg from another but thats not the ballistics report its just from preliminary examination but they were all the same caliber so we have a strong suspicion the same people were behind all three murders what about burglary lou asked relatives of the goldburgs say that harry had a big gold rolex we havent found it also his wallet could not be located but at the other scenes nothing seems to have been taken seems that the answer has to be in the restaurant connection lou said get detailed financial statements on all the operations also try to find out if these guys had been subjected to extortion or other threats and do it sooner rather than later the commissioner is on my back weve got people working around the clock norman said lou nodded norman handed a typewritten sheet to lou heres a summary of what i just told you sorry for the typos lou read it over quickly he took a thoughtful drag on his cigarette something big and bad was going on in queens there was no doubt about it he wondered if these murders could have had anything to do with paul cerino it seemed unlikely but then lou thought of marsha schulman he wondered if any of the deceased were acquainted with her husband danny it was a long shot but there was a chance he was the connecting thread pm thursday manhattan after getting a cup of coffee from the id office that looked more like sludge than coffee by that time of the day laurie pushed her way into the thursday afternoon conference which was held in the conference room connected to binghams office this was the one opportunity for all the citys medical examiners to get together and share cases and discuss diagnostic problems although the office of the chief medical examiner handled deaths in the bronx as well as manhattan the boroughs of queens brooklyn and staten island had their own offices thursday was the day they all got together coming to the conference was not an option as far as bingham was concerned it was a command performance as usual laurie took a seat near to the door when the discussions became too administrative or political for her taste she liked to slip away the most interesting part of these weekly conferences usually occurred before the meeting was called to order it was in these casual conversations beforehand that laurie was able to pick up interesting tidbits and details of particularly baffling or gruesome cases in that respect this thursdays meeting proved no different id thought id seen it all dick katzenburg told paul plodgett and kevin southgate dick was a senior medical examiner assigned to the queens office lauries ears perked up it was the weirdest homicide id seen dick continued and god knows ive seen some strange ones are you going to tell us or do we have to beg kevin asked obviously as eager for the story medical examiners loved to swap war stories that were either intellectually stimulating or grotesquely bizarre it was a young guy dick said done in a funeral home with the aspirator that they use for embalming he was bludgeoned to death kevin asked so far he was unimpressed no dick said with the trocar the aspirator was running it was as if the kid was embalmed alive ugh paul said obviously impressed that is weird it reminds me of the case dr montgomery a voice called laurie turned dr bingham stood before her im afraid there is something else i have to discuss with you he said laurie felt queasy she wondered what shed done now dr devries came to see me bingham said he complained that you have been coming in his lab bothering him about some test results now i know that you are eager for those results but youre not the only one waiting dr devries is swamped right now i dont think i have to tell you but dont expect special treatment youre going to have to wait like everyone else ill thank you not to harass dr devries any further do i make myself clear laurie was tempted to say something like devries had a hell of a way of going after more funding but bingham turned away before laurie had a chance to dwell on this her third reprimand in four days bingham called the meeting to order bingham began the conference as usual by summarizing the statistics for the previous week then he gave a short report on the status of the central park murder case since it had been so much in the news he again rebutted the medias charges of mismanagement of the case on the part of the medical examiners office he concluded by advising everyone not to offer any personal opinions laurie was certain that last remark was directed at her who else had been offering opinions from within the medical examiners ranks following binghams talk calvin spoke about administrative issues particularly concerning how reduced city funding was affecting operations every other week one service or supply was being curtailed or eliminated following calvins talk each of the deputy medical examiners from the other borough offices gave summaries some of the people present yawned others nodded off when the borough chiefs were finished the floor was opened up for general discussion dick katzenburg described a few cases including the rather grisly one at the queens funeral home once he was through laurie cleared her throat and began to address the group she presented her six overdose cases as succinctly as possible careful to delineate the demographic differences that set them apart from usual overdoses laurie described the deceased as single yuppies whose drug use came as a surprise to friends and family she explained the cocaine was mainlined although not mixed with heroin my concern laurie said avoiding looking at bingham is that we are seeing the beginning of a series of unusual overdose deaths i suspect a contaminant in the drug is to blame but so far none has been found what id like to request is that if anybody sees any cases similar to the ones ive described please send them to me ive seen four myself over the last several weeks dick said once laurie was through since we see so many overdosetoxicity cases i didnt give the demographics much thought but now that you mention it all four seemed like overachievers in fact two were professionals and three of the four took the cocaine intravenously the fourth orally orally someone echoed with surprise an oral cocaine overdose thats pretty uncommon you usually only see that in drugsmuggling mules coming from south america whose condoms break im never surprised what druggies do dick said one of the cases that i had was found wedged in the refrigerator apparently he got so hot he had to crawl into the ice box for relief one of mine climbed into a refrigerator too laurie said i had one also jim bennett said he was the chief at the brooklyn office and now that i think about it i had another who ran out into the street stark naked before he had a terminal seizure hed taken the drug orally but only after attempting to take it iv did these two cases have the same unlikely demographics for a drug overdose laurie asked jim sure did jim said the man who ran out in the street was a successful lawyer and the families in both cases swore up and down that the deceased didnt do drugs laurie looked to margaret hauptman who headed the staten island office have you seen any similar cases she asked margaret shook her head laurie asked dick and jim if they would mind faxing over the records on the cases theyd described they immediately said that they would one thing i have to mention dick said in three out of four ive had a lot of pressure from the involved families to sign the case out as natural thats a point i want to underline bingham said speaking for the first time since the beginning of the discussion with upscale overdose deaths like these the families will certainly want to keep the whole episode low profile i think we should cooperate in this regard politically we cannot afford to alienate this constituency i dont know what to make of this refrigerator aspect laurie said although it brings me back to the contaminant idea perhaps there is some chemical that has a synergistic effect with cocaine visávis causing hyperpyrexia at any rate im concerned that all these deaths are coming from the same source of the drug now that we have this many cases we ought to be able to prove it by comparing the percentages of its natural hydrolysates of course we will need the lab to cooperate laurie looked nervously at bingham to see if his expression changed with her reference to the lab it didnt i dont think a contaminant is a given dick said cocaine is fully capable of causing these deaths all by itself on the four cases ive seen the serum level was high very high these people took big doses maybe the cocaine wasnt cut with anything maybe it was onehundredpercent pure weve all seen that kind of death with heroin i still think a contaminant is involved laurie said with the general intelligence of this group of victims its hard for me to believe that so many would mess up if it were purely dose related dick shrugged you may be right he admitted all im saying is lets not jump to hasty conclusions leaving the conference laurie felt a strange and disturbing mixture of excitement yet a renewed frustration and anxiety within a couple of hours her series had doubled from six cases to twelve that was ominous her intuition about the number of cases increasing was already coming to pass and at an alarming rate now even more than before laurie felt that the public had to be warned especially this group of yuppie types the problem was how to do it certainly she dared not go back to bingham but she had to do something suddenly she thought of lou the police had a whole division devoted to drugs and vice perhaps that division had a way of putting out the word that a certain drug was particularly dangerous with growing resolve she went to her office and dialed lou immediately when he answered she felt relieved im so glad youre still there she said with a sigh you are lou asked i want to come right down and talk to you laurie said you do will you wait for me laurie demanded sure lou said he was puzzled and elated at the same time come on down laurie hung up the phone grabbed her briefcase opened it threw in some halffinished records snapped it shut snatched her coat and literally ran down to the elevator a slight rain was falling as she stepped out onto first avenue she despaired of catching a cab but as luck would have it one pulled up to the curb and let off a passenger right in front of her laurie got in before the passenger had a chance to close the door never having been to new york city police headquarters laurie was surprised to find it a relatively modern brick structure entering the front entrance she had to sign in while a security person called up to lou to make sure she was expected then they went through her briefcase armed with a visitors pass and directions she found his office like the entire building it reeked of cigarette smoke can i take your coat lou asked as she stepped inside lou took the coat and hung it on a coatrack while he was doing so he caught harvey lawson giving him a dirty look from across the hall lou closed his office door you sounded excited on the phone lou commented as he went around behind his desk laurie had taken one of the two straightbacked chairs her briefcase was on the floor next to her i need your help laurie said she was intense and obviously nervous clutching her hands in her lap oh really lou commented i was hoping this excitement had something to do with dinner tonight like you had changed your mind he couldnt keep the sarcasm from his voice he was obviously disappointed my series has doubled laurie said there are now twelve cases not six thats interesting lou said flatly i was hoping that you might know some way we can warn the public laurie said i think were about to see a flood of these cases unless something is done and done soon what would you have me do lou asked have an ad posted in the wall street journal yuppies just say no lou im serious laurie said im truly worried about this lou sighed he took out a cigarette and lit up must you smoke laurie asked him ill only be here a few moments jesus christ lou snapped its my office then try to blow the smoke away please laurie said ill ask you again lou said what do you want me to do you must have had something in mind if you bothered coming all the way down here no nothing specific laurie admitted i just thought the police narcotics squad might have some way of warning the public couldnt they make some kind of announcement to the press why doesnt the medical examiners office do it lou asked the police are around to arrest people with drugs not help them the chief refuses to take a public stand so far im sure hell come around but in the meantime lives are being lost lou took a drag on his cigarette and blew the smoke over his shoulder what about the other medical examiners are they as convinced as you about this thing exploding into a glut of dead yuppies i havent polled them laurie said dont you think you might be a little overly sensitive about these deaths because of your brother lou offered laurie became enraged i didnt come down here for you to play amateur psychologist but while were on the subject sure im sensitive i know how it feels to lose a loved one to drugs but i would say that kind of empathy is a boon to my work maybe if a few more jaded policemen like yourself had a little more empathy we civil servants would be in the business of saving lives instead of picking corpses pockets lou held his temper frankly dr montgomery id love to be in the lifesaving business in fact i already consider myself to be in the lifesaving business but unless you furnish me with more proof as to this grand contaminant theory of yours im afraid narcotics wont do anything more than laugh me back to homicide isnt there anything you can do me a detective lieutenant in homicide lou was exasperated but he knew laurie was genuinely concerned cant you go to the media i cant laurie said if i go to the media behind dr binghams back ill be looking for work that much i know we already had a runin about that how about you me lou questioned with surprise a homicide lieutenant suddenly involved with drug overdoses theyd want names and where i got them and id have to say i got them from you besides my bosses would wonder why i was worried about druggies and not solving the problem with the gangland slayings no i cant go either if i went to the media id probably be out looking for work as well wont you try talking with the narcotics division laurie asked i got an idea lou said what about your boyfriend the doctor its sorta natural that a doctor would be interested in this kind of problem besides he seems to be pretty high profile with a limo and that posh office jordan is not my boyfriend laurie said hes a male acquaintance and how do you know about his office i went to see him this afternoon lou said why laurie asked you want the truth or what i told myself lou said how about both laurie said i wanted to ask him about his patient paul cerino lou said and also about his secretary now that she is a homicide victim but i was also curious to meet the guy and if you want my opinion hes a creep i dont want your opinion laurie snapped what i dont understand lou persisted is why youd be interested in such a fake pompous ostentatious bum ive never seen such an office for a doctor and a limo please the guy must be robbing his patients blind excuse the pun what is it that attracts you his money no laurie said indignantly and as long as you are bringing up money i called your internal affairs department so i heard lou interrupted well i hope you sleep better now that youve probably gotten some poor patrolman in hot water while hes trying to send his kids to college bravo for your strict morality now if youll excuse me ive got to go out to forest hills and try to solve some real crime lou stubbed out his cigarette and got to his feet so you wont talk to your drug division laurie asked trying one more time lou leaned over his desk no i dont think so he said i believe ill just let you rich people look after yourselves having reined in her anger over the last few minutes laurie now gave in to it thanks for nothing lieutenant she said superciliously getting up she got her coat picked up her briefcase and stalked out of lous office downstairs she threw her visitors pass on the security table and walked out catching a cab was easy as they came in from the brooklyn bridge with just about a straight shot up first avenue she was home in no time getting off the elevator on her floor she glared at debra engler then slammed her door and at one point you thought he was charming she said out loud ridiculing herself as she stripped down and got into the shower she couldnt believe that she had allowed herself to sit for as long as she had in lou soldanos office absorbing all that abuse in the futile hopes that he might deign to help her it had been a degrading experience ensconced in a white terry robe laurie went to her answering machine and listened to her messages while a hungry tom rubbed across her legs and purred one was from her mother and the other was from jordan both asked her to call when she got home jordan had left a number different from his home number with an extension when she called jordan at the number hed left she was told that he was in surgery but that she should hold on sorry said jordan once he picked up a few minutes later im still in surgery but i insisted on being told when you called youre in the middle of an operation right now laurie couldnt believe it it doesnt matter jordan said i can break scrub for a few minutes i wanted to ask if we could make dinner tonight a bit later i dont want to keep you waiting again but i have another case to go maybe it would be just as well if we took a raincheck no please jordan said its been a hell of a day and ive been looking forward to seeing you remember you took a raincheck last night wont you be tired especially if you have another case laurie herself felt exhausted the idea of going straight to bed sounded wonderful to her ill get a second wind jordan said we can make it an early evening what time can you meet for dinner nine oclock jordan said ill send thomas around then reluctantly laurie agreed after she hung up she called calvin washington at home what is it montgomery calvin demanded once his wife called him to the phone he sounded grumpy sorry to bother you at home laurie said but now that i have twelve cases in my series id like to ask that i be assigned any more that might come in tomorrow youre not on autopsy tomorrow its a paper day for you i know thats why im calling im not on call this weekend so i can catch up with my paperwork then montgomery i think you ought to cool it youre getting much too carried away with all this youre too emotionally involved youre losing your objectivity im sorry but tomorrow is a paper day for you no matter what comes through the door feetfirst laurie hung up the phone she felt depressed at the same time she knew there was a certain amount of truth in what calvin had said she was emotionally involved in the issue sitting by the phone laurie thought about returning her mothers call the last thing she wanted to go through was the third degree about her budding relationship with jordan scheffield besides she hadnt quite decided what she thought of him herself she decided to wait on calling back her mother as lou drove through the midtown tunnel and out the long island expressway he wondered why he insisted on continually bashing his head up against a brick wall there was no way a woman like laurie montgomery would look at someone like himself other than as a city servant why did he keep entertaining delusions of grandeur in which laurie would suddenly say oh lou ive always wanted to meet a police detective whos gone to a community college lou slapped the steering wheel in embarrassed anger when laurie had suddenly called and insisted on coming down to his office hed believed shed wanted to see him for personal reasons not some harebrained idea of using him to publicize a yuppie cocaine epidemic lou exited the long island expressway and got onto woodhaven boulevard heading to forest hills feeling the need to do something rather than play with paper clips at his desk hed decided to go out and do a little gumshoeing on his own by visiting the surviving spouses it was also better than going back to his miserable apartment on prince street in soho and watching tv pulling up the vivonettos long curved driveway lou couldnt help but be awed the house was a mansion with white columns right away lights went off in lous head this kind of opulence suggested serious money and lou had a hard time believing a simple restaurateur could make that kind of dough unless he had organizedcrime connections lou parked the car by the front door hed called ahead so mrs vivonetto was expecting him when he rang the bell a woman wearing a ton of makeup came to the door she was wearing a white offtheshoulder wool dress there was not much suggestion of aggrieved mourning you must be lieutenant soldano she said do come in my name is gloria vivonetto can i offer you a drink lou said that just water would be fine for him you know on duty he muttered by way of explanation gloria poured him a glass at the bar in the living room she fixed herself a vodka gimlet im sorry about your husband lou said it was his standard intro for occasions like this it was just like him gloria said id told him time and time again he shouldnt stay up and watch television and now he goes and gets himself shot i dont know anything about running a business im sure people are going to rob me blind was there anyone that you know of who would have wanted your husband dead lou asked it was the first question in the standard protocol ive been all over this with the other detectives do we have to go through it again perhaps not lou said let me be frank with you mrs vivonetto the way your husband was killed suggests an organizedcrime involvement do you know what im saying you mean mafia well theres more to organized crime than the mafia lou said but thats the general idea is there any reason that you can think of why people like the mafia would want your husband killed ha gloria laughed my husband was never involved with anything as colorful as the mafia what about his business lou persisted did pasta pronto have any connection whatsoever with organized crime no gloria said are you sure lou questioned well no i guess im not sure gloria answered i wasnt involved with the business but i cant imagine he ever had anything to do with the mafia and anyway my husband was not a well man he wasnt going to be around much longer anyway if someone wanted him out of the way they could have waited for him to keel over naturally how was your husband sick lou asked in what ways wasnt he sick gloria shot back everything was falling apart he had bad heart problems and had had two bypass operations his kidneys werent great he was supposed to have his gallbladder removed but they kept putting it off saying his heart wouldnt take it he was going to have an eye operation and his prostate was messed up im not sure what was wrong with that but his whole lower half didnt work anymore hadnt for years im sorry lou said unsure of what else to say i suppose he suffered a lot gloria shrugged her shoulders he never took care of himself he was overweight drank a ton and he smoked like a chimney the doctors told me he might not last a year unless he changed his ways which wasnt something he was about to do lou decided there wasnt much more hed learn from the notsoaggrieved widow well he said standing up thank you for your time mrs vivonetto if you think of anything else that might seem important please give me a call he handed her one of his business cards next lou headed for the singleton residence the place was a simple twostory brick row house with two pink flamingos stuck in the front lawn the street reminded him of his old neighborhood only a half dozen blocks away in rego park he felt a stab of nostalgia for the evenings in the alleyway playing stickball mr chester singleton opened the door he was a big man middleaged and quite balding he had a hounddog look thanks to his beefy jowls his eyes were red and streaked the instant lou saw him he knew he was in the presence of true grief detective soldano lou nodded and was immediately invited inside inside the furniture was plain but solid a crocheted comforter was folded over the back of a plaid wellworn couch dozens of framed photos lined the walls most of them black and white im very sorry about your wife lou said chester nodded took a deep breath and bit his lower lip i know that other people have been by lou continued he decided to go right to the heart of the matter i wanted to ask you flatout why a professional gunman would come into your home to shoot your wife i dont know chester said his voice quavered with emotion your restaurantsupply business supplied some restaurants with organizedcrime connections do any of the restaurants you supply have any complaints with your service never chester said and i dont know anything about any organized crime sure i heard rumors but i never met anyone or saw anyone i would call a mobster type what about pasta pronto lou asked i understand you had new business there i recently got some of their business thats true but only a piece of it i think they were just trying me out i hoped to get more of their business eventually did you know steven vivonetto lou asked yes but not well he was a wealthy man you know he got shot last night as well lou said i know i read about it in the paper had you received any threats lately lou asked any attempts at extortion any kind of protection racket knocking on your door chester shook his head can you think of any reason your wife and steven vivonetto should have been killed during the same night possibly by the same person no chester said i cant think of any reason why anyone would have wanted to kill janice everyone loved janice she was the warmest nicest person in the world and on top of that she was ill what was wrong with her lou asked cancer unfortunately it had spread before they found it she never liked to go to the doctor if only shed gone sooner they might have been able to do more as it was she only had chemotherapy she seemed okay for a while but then she got this awful rash on her face herpes zoster they call it it even got into one of her eyes and blinded it so that she needed to have an operation did the doctors hold out much hope for her lou asked im afraid not chester said they told me that they couldnt say for sure but they thought that it might be only a year or so and shorter if the cancer came back quicker im so sorry to hear all this lou said well maybe what happened was just as well maybe it saved her a lot of suffering but i miss her so we were married for thirtyone years after offering additional condolences and his business card lou bade farewell to mr singleton driving back to manhattan he reviewed what little hed learned the organizedcrime connection to either case was at best tenuous hed been surprised to learn that both victims were terminally ill he wondered if their killers had known by reflex he reached into his jacket pocket and took out a cigarette he pushed in the lighter then he thought about laurie rolling down the window he tossed the unlit cigarette into the street just as the lighter popped out he sighed wondering where that pompous jordan scheffield was taking her for dinner vinnie dominick came into the locker room at st marys and sat wearily on the bench he was perspiring heavily he was bleeding slightly from a small scratch on his cheek youre bleeding boss freddie capuso said get out of my face vinnie snapped i know im bleeding but you know what bugs me that bum jeff young said he never touched me and whined for ten minutes when i called a foul vinnie had just finished an hours worth of pickup threeonthree basketball his team had lost and he was in a foul mood his mood got even worse when his most trusted lieutenant franco ponti came in with a long face dont tell me its true vinnie asked franco came over to the bench he put one foot on it and leaned on his knee his nickname since high school had been falcon mostly because of his face with a narrow hooked nose thin lips and beady eyes he resembled a bird of prey its true franco said he spoke in a monotone jimmy lanso got whacked last night in his cousins funeral home vinnie bolted off the bench and hammered one of the metal lockers the crashing noise reverberated around the small locker room like a clap of thunder everyone winced except franco christ vinnie cried he began pacing freddie capuso got out of his way what am i going to tell my wife vinnie cried what am i going to tell my wife he repeated raising his voice i promised her id take care of it he pounded one of the lockers again perspiration flew off his face tell her that you made a mistake trusting cerino franco suggested vinnie stopped in his tracks its true he snarled i thought cerino was a civilized man but now i know otherwise and theres more franco said cerinos men have been busy whacking all sorts of people besides jimmy lanso last night they hit two in kew gardens and two in forest hills i saw that on the news vinnie was astounded that was cerinos people yup franco said why vinnie asked i didnt recognize any of the names nobody knows franco shrugged his shoulders there must be some reason for sure franco said i just dont know what it is well find out vinnie ordered its one thing putting up with cerino and his bums as business rivals but its quite another to sit around watching them ruin things for everyone there are cops crawling all over queens franco agreed thats just what we dont need vinnie said with the authorities up in arms well have to suspend a significant part of our operations you have to find out what cerino is up to franco im depending on you franco nodded ill see what i can do youre not eating much jordan said laurie looked up from her plate they were dining at a restaurant called palio although the food was italian the décor was a relaxing meld of oriental and modern before her was a delicious seafood risotto her wineglass was filled with a crisp pinot grigio but jordan was right she wasnt eating much although she hadnt eaten much that day she just wasnt hungry you dont like the food jordan asked i thought you said you liked italian his dress was as casually elegant as ever he had on a black velvet blazer with a silk shirt open at the neck he was not wearing a tie the logistics had worked much better this evening as jordan had promised hed called just before nine when he was leaving surgery saying that thomas was on his way to pick her up while he went back to his apartment to change by the time thomas and laurie got back to the trump tower jordan was waiting curbside from there it had been a short ride over to west fiftyfirst street i love the food laurie said i guess im just not that hungry its been a long day ive been avoiding talking about the day jordan admitted i thought it better to get a bit of wine under our belts as i mentioned on the phone my day was atrocious thats the only word for it starting from your phone call about poor marsha schulman every time i think about her i get this sick feeling i even feel guilty about being so angry with her for not showing up to work and here she was a headless corpse floating in the east river oh god jordan couldnt continue he buried his face in his hands and shook his head slowly laurie reached across the table and put a hand on jordans arm she felt for him but was also relieved to see this display of emotion up until this moment shed felt hed been incapable of such demonstrativeness and rather dispassionate about his secretarys murder he suddenly seemed a lot more human jordan pulled himself together and theres more he said sadly i lost a patient today part of the reason i went into ophthalmology was because i knew id have a hard time dealing with death yet i still wanted to do surgery ophthalmology seemed an ideal compromise until today i lost a preop by the name of mary oconnor im sorry laurie said i understand how you feel dealing with dying patients was hard for me too i suppose its one of the reasons i went into pathology especially forensics my patients are already dead jordan smiled weakly mary was a wonderful woman and such an appreciative patient he said id already operated on one eye and was about to do the other this afternoon she was a healthy lady with no known heart trouble yet she was found dead in her bed shed died watching television what a terrible experience for you laurie sympathized but you have to remember that occult medical problems are always found in such cases i imagine well be seeing mrs oconnor tomorrow and ill be sure to let you know what it was sometimes knowing the pathology makes it easier to deal with the death id appreciate that jordan said i suppose my day wasnt as bad as yours laurie said but im beginning to understand how cassandra felt when apollo made sure that she was not to be heeded laurie told jordan all about her overdose series and that she was sure there would be more cases if no appropriate warnings were issued she told him how upsetting it had been that shed been unable to convince the chief medical examiner to go public with the story then she told him shed gone to the police and even they refused to help sounds frustrating jordan said there was one good thing about my day he said changing the subject i did a lot of surgery and that makes me and my accountant very happy over the last couple of weeks ive been doing double my normal number of cases im glad laurie said she couldnt help but notice jordans propensity for turning the conversation to himself i just hope it keeps up he said there are always fluctuations i can accept that but im getting spoiled at the current rate once they had finished their meal and their places were cleared the waiter rolled a tempting dessert trolley to their table jordan selected a chocolate cake laurie chose berries jordan had an espresso laurie a decaf as she stirred her coffee she discreetly glanced at her watch i saw that jordan said i know its getting late i also know its a school night ill get you home in a half hour if we can make the same deal we made last night lets have dinner again tomorrow night again laurie asked jordan youre sure to get sick of me nonsense jordan said im enjoying every minute i just wish it werent so rushed and tomorrow is friday its the weekend maybe youll even have some news about mary oconnor please laurie laurie couldnt believe she was being asked to dinner for a third night in a row it was certainly flattering all right she said at last you have yourself a date wonderful jordan said have any suggestions for a restaurant i think you have a lot more experience laurie said you pick okay i will shall we say nine oclock again laurie nodded as she sipped her decaf looking into jordans clear eyes she thought of lous negative description of the man for a second laurie was tempted to ask how the meeting with the detective lieutenant had gone but decided against it some things were better left unsaid pm thursday manhattan not bad tony said he and angelo were just leaving an allnight pizza joint on fortysecond street near times square i was surprised the place looked like such a dump angelo didnt answer his mind was already on the job that lay ahead when they arrived at the parking garage angelo nodded toward his town car the garage owner lenny helman paid money to cerino since angelo usually collected it he parked for free better not have scratched the car angelo said after the attendant drove the car up to the curb once he was satisfied there wasnt a mark on its highly polished surface angelo got in tony did the same they pulled out onto fortysecond street whats next tony asked sitting sideways so he could look directly at angelo the light from the glittering neon marquees of the neighborhood movie theaters played over angelos gaunt face making him look like an unraveled mummy in a museum were going to switch to the demand list angelo told him great tony said with enthusiasm im getting tired of the other where to eightysixth angelo said near the metropolitan museum good neighborhood tony said ill bet therell be souvenirs for the taking i dont feel good about it angelo said wealthy neighborhood means fancy alarms you handle all that stuff like a breeze tony said things have been going a little too well angelo said im starting to get concerned you worry too much tony said with a laugh the reason things have been going so well is because we know what were doing and the more we do it the better we get its the same thing with everything screwups happen angelo said no matter how much you prepare we have to expect it and be able to handle it when it does ah youre just a pessimist tony said engrossed in their banter neither tony nor angelo took note of a black cadillac cruising two cars behind them at the wheel a relaxed franco ponti was enjoying a tape of aida thanks to a tip from a contact in the times square area franco had been tailing angelo and tony since their stop at the pizza place which one are we doing tony asked the woman angelo said whose turn tony asked he knew angelo was due but hoped he might have forgotten i dont give a damn angelo said you can do her ill watch the man angelo drove by the brownstone several times before parking it was five stories tall with a double door at the top of a short flight of granite steps beneath the stoop at the ground level was another door the service entrance is probably the way to go angelo said well be a little shielded by the stoop i can see theres an alarm but if its the kind i think it is it wont be a problem youre the boss tony said he took his gun out and attached the silencer they parked almost a block away and walked back angelo carried a small flight bag full of tools when they got to the house angelo told tony to wait on the sidewalk and let him know if anyone was coming angelo descended the few steps to the service entrance door tony kept an eye out but the street was quiet no one was in sight what tony didnt see was franco ponti parked only a few doors down blocking a driveway all right angelo whispered from the shadows of the service entrance come on they entered a long hallway moving quickly to the stairs there was an elevator but they knew better than to use it taking two steps at a time they climbed to the first floor and listened save for a large antique clock ticking loudly in the dark the house was quiet can you imagine living in a place like this tony whispered its like a palace shut up angelo snapped they continued upstairs climbing a curving double staircase that circled a chandelier tony guessed was six feet across on the second floor they peered into a series of sitting rooms a library and a den on the third floor they hit pay dirt the master bedroom angelo stood to one side of the double doors that no doubt led to the master suite tony took the other side both men had their guns drawn their silencers were attached angelo slowly turned the door handle and pushed the door in the room was larger than any bedroom either of them had ever seen on the far wallwhich seemed very far to angelostood a massive canopied bed angelo stepped into the room motioning for tony to follow he went to the right side of the bed where the man was sleeping tony went to the other side angelo nodded tony extended his gun while angelo did the same tonys gun went off with its familiar hissing thump and the woman recoiled the man must have been a light sleeper no sooner had the shot gone off than he sat bolt upright eyes wide angelo shot him before he had a chance to say a word he toppled over toward his wife oh no angelo said out loud whats the matter tony questioned using the tip of the silencer angelo reached over and separated the fingers of the dying man clutched in his hand was a small plastic device with a button he had a goddamn alarm angelo said what does that mean tony asked it means we have to get the hell out of here angelo said come on moving as quickly as they could in the semidarkness they ran down the stairs rounding the bend onto the first floor they practically ran into a housekeeper who was on her way up the housekeeper screamed turned and fled back down the way shed come tony fired his bantam but at distances greater than six feet his gun wasnt accurate the slug missed the housekeeper shattering a large goldframed mirror instead we have to get her angelo said knowing that the woman had gotten a good look at them he threw himself down the stairs the flight bag bouncing its shoulder straps reaching the bottom he skidded on the marble strewn with shards of mirror regaining his footing he hurled himself down the firstfloor hallway toward the back of the house ahead he could see the woman struggling to open a pair of french doors leading to the backyard before he could catch her she was out the door pulling it closed behind her angelo got there just seconds behind her tony was right behind him they ran out after her only to trip on a pair of garden chairs they couldnt see in the dark angelo peered into the darkness the backyard could have passed for a public park there was a rectangular reflecting pool in the center of the space to the right was an ivycovered gazebo that was lost in shadow a thick oak had a swing hanging from a broad branch nowhere could angelo spot the woman where did she go tony whispered if i knew would i be standing here angelo said you go that way and ill go this way he pointed to either side of the pool the two men groped their way around the garden they strained to look into the dark recesses of the ferns and shrubbery there she is tony said pointing back at the house angelo fired two shots at the fleeing woman the first bullet shattered the glass of the french doors after the second he saw the woman stumble and fall you got her tony cried lets get out of here angelo said he could hear sirens in the distance it was hard to be sure but they seemed to be approaching not wanting to risk coming out of the front of the house angelo turned to the back wall of the garden spotting a door on the far side of the pond he yelled come on to tony angelo reached the door first he unbolted the dead bolt securing the door and rushed into a debrisstrewn alleyway they made their way down the darkened path trying each garden door they passed tony finally found one with nearly rotten planking and broke through the garden they found themselves in seemed as neglected as the door now what tony said that way angelo said he pointed to a dark passageway leading toward the front of the house at the end of the passageway they came to a bolted door but it was bolted from the inside passing through it they found themselves on eightyfifth street angelo brushed off his clothes tony followed his example okay said angelo now be cool confident relaxed the pair walked slowly down the street and around the corner as if they called the neighborhood home slowly they made their way to angelos car the sirens had indeed been heading for the brownstone theyd just left ahead they could see three squad cars with emergency lights flashing blocking the street in front of the house where theyd made the hit angelo unlocked his car doors with a remote control and the two men climbed in that was awesome tony said excitedly once they were a half dozen blocks away that was the coolest thing ive ever seen angelo scowled at him it was a disaster he said what do you mean tony questioned we got away no problem and you got the housekeeper you dropped her right in her tracks but we didnt check her angelo said how do i know if i really got her or just winged her we should have checked her she looked directly at both of us she dropped quickly tony said i think you hit her real good this is what i mean screwups happen how would we have guessed the guy would sleep holding a panicbutton alarm angelo was glad he had the wheel to grip his hands were shaking okay so we got the bad luck hit out of the way tony said now you cant say that things are going too well whats next im not sure angelo said maybe we should call it a night what for tony questioned the night is young come on lets at least do one more we cant pass up this kind of money angelo thought for a minute intuition told him to call it a night but tony was right the money was good besides hits were like riding horses you fall off you get back on otherwise you may never ride again all right he said finally well do one more thats what i like to hear tony said where to down in the village another town house angelo took the ninetyseventh street transverse across central park and got on the henry hudson parkway for a while they didnt talk each was recovering from the opposite ends of the emotional spectrum angelo from fear and anxiety and tony from pure exhilaration neither noticed the black cadillac in the distance it will be up here on the left angelo said once they turned onto bleecker street he pointed to a threestory town house with a lions head knocker on the front door tony nodded as they drove past angelo felt his pulse start quickening its the man this time he said same plan as before you do him ill cover the wife got it tony said thrilled to have yet another turn this time angelo parked farther away than usual they walked back in silence except for the occasional clank of tools in angelos flight bag they passed a few pedestrians the streets werent empty as they had been uptown the village was always livelier than the upper east side the alarm at the targeted house was childs play for angelo within minutes he and tony were tiptoeing up the creaking stairs conveniently there was a small nightlight plugged into a socket in the upstairs hall the rosy glow it cast was just enough to see by the first door angelo tried proved to be an empty guest room since there was only one other door on the floor he assumed it was to the master suite once again the two men positioned themselves on either side of the door holding their guns alongside their heads angelo turned the knob and briskly pushed open the door angelo managed one step into the room when a snarling dog sprang at him in the halflight the beasts paws hit him in the chest knocking him back through the door to the opposite wall of the hall the dog snapped at him biting through his jacket shirt and even a bit of his skin angelo wasnt sure but he thought it was a doberman it was too long and lean for a pit bull although it certainly had the temperament whatever it was it had angelo terrorized and effectively pinned tony moved quickly he stepped to the side and shot the dog from pointblank range in the chest he was sure hed hit his mark but the dog didnt flinch with a snarl he ripped another large patch of cloth out of angelos jacket and spit it out then he lunged for another bite tony waited until he had a clear shot before pulling the trigger again this time he hit the dog in the head and the animal went instantly limp hitting the floor with a solid thud a womans scream sent new chills down angelos spine the woman of the house had awakened just in time to see her dog slaughtered she was standing a few feet from the foot of her bed her face contorted in horror tony raised his gun and again there was a hissing thump the womans scream was cut short her hand went to her chest pulling her hand away she looked at the spot of blood her facial expression was one of bewilderment as if she could not believe shed been shot tony stepped over the threshold into the bedroom raising his gun again he shot her at pointblank range in the center of her forehead like the dog she collapsed instantly in a heap on the floor angelo started to speak but before he could say anything there was a frightful yell from the first floor as the husband charged up the stairs with a doublebarrel twelvegauge shotgun he held the gun in both hands at waist height sensing what was about to happen angelo threw himself onto the floor just as the shotgun discharged with a powerful concussion in the confined area the sound was horrendous making angelos ears ring the concentrated buckshot blew a hole twelve inches in diameter in the wall where angelo had been standing even tony had to react by reflex throwing himself to the side to avoid the open bedroom doorway the second blast of the shotgun traveled the length of the bedroom and blew out one of the rear windows from his position on the floor angelo fired his walther twice in rapid succession hitting the husband in the chest and the chin the force of the bullets stopped the mans forward momentum then in a kind of slow motion he tipped backward with a terrible racket he fell down the stairs and ended up on the floor below tony reappeared from the bedroom and ran down the stairs to put an additional bullet into the fallen mans head angelo picked himself and his flight bag off the floor he was shaking hed never come so close to death rushing down the stairs on shaky legs he told tony that they had to get the hell out of there when they got to the front door angelo stood on his tiptoes to look out what he saw he didnt like there was a handful of people gathered in front of the building gazing up at its facade no doubt theyd heard glass smash when the bedroom window was blown out maybe theyd heard both shotgun blasts out the back angelo said he knew they couldnt risk a confrontation with this crowd they easily scaled the chainlink fence in the backyard there wasnt even any barbed wire at the top to worry about once they made it over they went through a neighboring backyard and through to another street angelo was glad hed parked as far away as he had they made it to his car without incident sirens started in the distance just as they were pulling away what the hell kind of dog was that tony asked as they cruised up sixth avenue i think it was a doberman angelo said it scared the life out of me you and me both tony agreed and that shotgun that was close too close we should have called it quits after the first job angelo shook his head in disgust maybe im getting too old for this stuff no way tony said youre the best i used to think so angelo said he glanced down at his tattered brioni jacket in despair by force of habit he glanced in the rearview mirror but nothing he saw worried him of course he was looking for cop cars not franco pontis sedan which was pursuing them at a discreet distance am friday manhattan ordinarily laurie would be pleased to have slept through the night although no one from the medical examiners office had called her to report any more upscale overdose cases for her series she wondered if that meant there had been no such overdoses or as her intuition suggested there had been and she had simply not been called she dressed as quickly as she could and didnt even bother with coffee so eager was she to get to work and find out the moment she stepped inside the medical examiners office she could tell that something out of the ordinary had happened once again there was a group of reporters huddled in the reception area laurie felt the knot in her stomach tighten as she wondered what their restless presence could mean going directly to the id office she helped herself to a cup of coffee before doing anything else vinnie as usual had his nose in the sports page apparently none of the other associate medical examiners had yet arrived laurie picked up the sheet at the scheduling desk to check the cases to be posted that day as her eyes ran down the list she saw four drug overdoses two were scheduled for riva and two were scheduled for george fontworth a fellow whod been with the office for four years laurie flipped through the folders intended for riva and glanced at the investigators report sheet judging by the harlem addresses laurie figured they were the common crackhouse deaths relieved laurie put the folder down then she picked up the two for george reading the first investigators report her pulse quickened the deceased was wendell morrison aged thirtysix a medical doctor with a shaky hand laurie opened the last folder julia myerholtz aged twentynine art historian laurie breathed out she hadnt been aware that shed been holding her breath her intuition had been correct thered been two more cocaine overdose cases with similar demographics as the others she felt a mixture of emotions including anger about not having been called as shed requested and confirmation that her fears had come to pass at the same time she felt sorry there had been two more potentially preventable deaths laurie went straight to the forensic investigators office and found bart arnold she knocked loudly on his door and walked in before he had a chance to invite her why wasnt i called i spoke to you specifically about this i told you i wanted to be called on cocaine overdoses that fall within certain demographic parameters last night there were two i wasnt called why i was told you were not to be called bart said why not laurie questioned i wasnt given a reason bart said but i passed the word on to the tour doctors when they came on duty who told you this laurie asked dr washington bart said im sorry laurie i would have told you myself but you had already gone for the day laurie abruptly turned and walked out of barts office she was more angry than hurt her worst fears had been confirmed she hadnt been overlooked accidentally there was a deliberate effort going on to keep her out of the way just outside the police liaison office she saw lou soldano can i talk to you for a minute lou asked laurie stared at him didnt the guy ever get any sleep once again he looked as if hed been up all night he hadnt shaved and his eyes were redrimmed his closecropped hair was matted down on his forehead im quite busy lieutenant laurie said just a moment of your time lou repeated please all right laurie relented what is it i had a little time to think last night lou said i wanted to apologize for being such a boob yesterday afternoon i came on a little stronger than i should have so im sorry the last thing shed expected from lou was an apology now that it was being offered she was gratified to hear it as kind of an explanation lou continued im under a lot of pressure from the commissioner about these ganglandstyle murders he thinks that since id spent time on organized crime i should be the one to solve them unfortunately hes not a patient man i guess were both pretty stressed laurie said but your apology is accepted thank you lou said at least thats one hurdle out of the way so what brings you here this morning you havent heard about the homicides what homicides laurie asked we get homicides every day not like these lou said more gangland stuff professional hits two couples here in manhattan floating in the river laurie asked nope lou said shot in their homes both of the couples were welltodo one in particular and the wealthier one is also politically connected uhoh laurie said more pressure youd better believe it lou said the mayor is livid hes already chewed out the commissioner and guess who the commissioner has decided to target yours truly do you have any ideas laurie asked i wish i could tell you i did lou said something big time is going on but for the life of me i dont have a clue as to what it is the night before last there were three similar hits in queens now these two in manhattan and there doesnt seem to be any organizedcrime connection certainly not with the two last night but the mo of the killers is definitely gangland style so youre here for the autopsies laurie asked yeah lou said maybe i can get a job here after im fired from the police department im spending as much time here as in my office whos doing the cases laurie asked dr southgate and dr besserman lou said how are they all right theyre excellent both are very experienced id kinda hoped youd be doing them lou said i was beginning to think we worked well together well youre in good hands with southgate and besserman she assured him ill let you know what we find lou said he fumbled with his hat please do laurie answered all of a sudden she had that same feeling that shed gotten on previous days lou seemed to become painfully selfconscious as if he wanted to say something but couldnt well im glad i ran into you lou said avoiding lauries eyes well ill see you bye lou turned and started back toward the police liaison office for a second laurie watched lous lumbering gait and again was impressed by a sense of the mans loneliness she wondered if he had intended asking her out once again for a minute after lou disappeared from view laurie forgot where shed been headed but her anger returned the minute she remembered calvins attempt to get her off her overdose series with a renewed sense of purpose she marched to calvins office and knocked on the open door she was inside facing him before he had a chance to say a word she found calvin seated behind a mountain of paperwork he looked up over the tops of his wirerimmed reading glasses that were dwarfed by his broad face he didnt seem happy to see her what is it montgomery there were two more overdoses last night similar to the kind that i am interested in laurie began youre not telling me anything i dont already know calvin said i know this is scheduled as a paper day for me but i would appreciate it if you would let me do the autopsies something tells me these cases are related by my doing them all maybe ill make some connections we went over this on the phone calvin said i told you i think you are getting carried away youve become less than objective please dr washington laurie pleaded she hated to beg no goddamn it calvin exploded he slammed an open palm on his desk sending some of his papers flying he stood up george fontworth is doing the overdoses and i want you to stick to your own work youre behind in signing out some of your cases as it is i dont think i need to tell you now i dont need this kind of aggravation not with the pressure this office is under laurie nodded then walked out of the office if she werent so enraged she would probably have been in tears leaving calvins office she went directly to binghams this time laurie waited to be asked in bingham was on the phone but he waved her in laurie got the impression bingham was speaking to someone at city hall since his side of the conversation reminded her of speaking with her mother bingham was saying yes certainly and of course over and over when he finally hung up and peered at laurie she could tell he was already exasperated it was not an opportune time for her visit but since she was already there and there was no one else to whom she could appeal laurie pressed on im being deliberately prevented from further involvement with these upscale overdose cases she said she tried to sound firm but her voice was filled with emotion dr washington will not let me perform the relevant autopsies that have come in today he made sure i wasnt called to any of the scenes last night i dont think barring me from these cases is in the best interests of the department bingham put his face in his hands and rubbed particularly his eyes when he looked up again at laurie his eyes were red were dealing with a lot of bad press about possibly mishandling a central park murder case weve got a rash of brutal professional homicides that are on top of the usual nighttime new york mayhem and on top of that youre in here causing trouble i dont believe it laurie truly i dont i want to be allowed to pursue these cases laurie said evenly now there are at least fourteen someone has to be looking at the whole picture i think im the person to do it im convinced were on the brink of a widespread disaster if there is a contaminant and im convinced there is we must issue a public warning bingham was incredulous gazing up at the ceiling and throwing his hands up in the air he muttered to himself shes been on the staff for about five months and shes telling me how to run the department he shook his head then he turned his attention back to laurie this time he sounded a lot fiercer calvin is an able administrator in fact he is more than able hes excellent what he says goes you hear me thats it the issue is closed with that he turned his attention to the pile of letters stacked in his inbox laurie headed straight for the lab she decided it was better to keep moving if she paused to think about these last two interviews she might do something rash shed later regret she was looking for peter letterman but ran into john devries instead thanks for putting in a good word for me with the chief she said sarcastically as angry as she was she couldnt contain herself i dont like to be pestered john said i warned you i wasnt pestering laurie snapped i was merely asking you to do your job have you found a contaminant no john said he pushed past her without giving her the courtesy of a more detailed reply laurie shook her head she wondered if her days at the new york medical examiners office were numbered she found peter over in the corner of the lab working on the largest and newest of the gas chromatographs i think you should try to avoid john he said i couldnt help overhearing believe me i wasnt looking for him laurie answered i havent found any contaminant either peter said but ive been running samples on this gas chromatograph it has what they call a trap if were going to pick something up this is the apparatus that will do it keep at it laurie said were up to fourteen cases now i did learn something peter said as you know cocaine naturally hydrolyzes to benzoylecgonine ecgonine methyl ester and ecgonine yes laurie said go on each batch of cocaine that is made has a unique percentage of these hydrolysates peter said so by analyzing the concentrations you can make a pretty educated guess as to the origin of the samples and laurie asked all the samples that ive recovered from the syringes have the same percentages peter said that means the cocaine has all come from the same batch meaning the same source laurie added exactly peter said thats what i suspected laurie said its nice to have it documented ill let you know if i find any contaminant with this machine please do laurie said if i had proof of a contaminant i think dr bingham would make a statement but as she returned to her office laurie wondered if she could be sure of anything dont hold my arm cerino shouted angelo had been trying to guide him through the entrance to jordan scheffields office i can see more than you think i can cerino was carrying his redtipped cane but wasnt using it tony came in last and pulled the door shut one of jordans nurses guided the group down the corridor making sure that cerino was comfortably seated in one of the examination chairs when cerino came to jordans office he did not use the usual entrance and he bypassed the waiting room altogether that was the customary modus operandi for all of jordans vip patients oh dear the nurse said as she eyed tonys face there was a deep scratch that extended down from in front of his left ear to the corner of his mouth thats a nasty cut on your cheek howd you get it a cat tony said selfconsciously putting a hand to his face i hope you got a tetanus shot the nurse said would you like us to wash it out nah tony said embarrassed at the attention in front of cerino let me know if you change your mind the nurse said heading for the door gimme a light paul said as soon as the nurse had left the room angelo hastily lit pauls cigarette then pulled one out for himself tony found a chair off to the side and sat down angelo remained standing a little to cerinos left and a little behind both he and tony were exhausted having been roused out of bed for cerinos unexpected doctors visit both were also still suffering the late effects of the experiences at the last two hits particularly angelo here we are in disneyland again paul said the room stopped and the wall lifted jordan was poised at the edge of his office with cerinos record in hand as he stepped forward he immediately smelled the cigarettes excuse me he said there is no smoking in here angelo nervously looked around for someplace to deposit his smoldering cigarette cerino grabbed his arm and motioned for him not to move if we want to smoke were going to smoke paul said like i told you when you called me on the phone doc im a bit disappointed in you and i dont mind telling you again but the instruments jordan said pointing toward the slit lamp smoke is detrimental to them screw the instruments doc paul said lets talk about you blabbing all over town about my condition what are you talking about jordan asked hed known cerino was angry about something from their phone call hed figured it had something to do with the wait for a suitable cornea transplant but cerinos true complaint came as a complete surprise to him im talking about a detective by the name of lou soldano paul said and a broad by the name of dr laurie montgomery you talked to the broad the broad talked to the detective and the detective came to me and ill tell you something doc it pisses me off i was trying to keep the details of my little accident a secret for business purposes you understand we doctors sometimes discuss cases jordan said he suddenly felt very warm give me a break doc paul said derisively i hear this supposed colleague is a medical examiner and in case you havent noticed im not dead yet and if you two had been consulting for some strange reason she wouldnt have blabbed to a homicide detective youll have to give me a better explanation than that jordan was at a loss he couldnt think of any plausible excuse the bottom line doctor is that you havent respected my confidentiality isnt that the fancy word you doctors use the way i understand it i could go to a lawyer and slap a malpractice suit on you couldnt i im not sure jordan couldnt even complete a phrase he was instantly aware of his legal vulnerability now i dont want to hear any of your doubletalk paul told him i probably wont go to a lawyer you know why i have lots of friends who are cheaper than lawyers and a hell of a lot more effective you know doc my friends are kind of like you specialists for kneecaps leg bones and knuckles i can just imagine what it would do to your practice if you happened to have your hand crushed by a car door mr cerino jordan said in a conciliatory tone but paul cut him off i think ive made myself clear doc im counting on you not to go blabbing anymore am i right jordan nodded his hands were trembling now doc i dont mean to make you nervous i want you in nothing but good shape cause thats what youre going to put me in good shape i was very pleased when your nurse called this morning to say i could come in for my operation im glad too jordan said trying to regain some of his professionalism and composure youre lucky your chance came up so quickly the waiting period has been much shorter than usual not short enough for me paul said in my line of work you have to have all your senses and then some there are any number of sharks whod love to put me out to pasture or worse so lets get it over with fine by me jordan said nervously he laid cerinos record on the lens stand straddling a small wheeled stool he pushed up to cerinos ophthalmic examination chair swinging around the slit lamp he motioned for cerino to put his chin on the chin rest reaching below with a trembling hand jordan switched on the slit lamp as he did so he got a whiff of garlic from cerinos breath i understand youve been doing more surgery than usual lately paul said thats true jordan replied as a businessman myself i would imagine youd like to do as much surgery as possible cerino said i imagine thats where the big bucks are thats also true jordan said he moved the slit lamps beam so that it fell across cerinos badly scarred cornea i have some ideas about keeping your surgery up cerino said would that interest you of course jordan said fix me up first doc cerino said if you do well remain friends then who knows maybe we can do some business jordan wasnt certain he wanted to be friends with this guy but he certainly didnt want to be enemies he had a feeling paul cerinos enemies didnt last too long he was determined to do his best by cerino and hed already made up his mind he wouldnt be sending the man a bill laurie put down her pen and leaned back in her desk chair shed been struggling to keep her mind on her paperwork but she wasnt making much headway her thoughts kept drifting back to those drug overdoses she couldnt believe she wasnt down in the autopsy room working on the two cases that had come in overnight shed resisted the temptation to sneak down and watch as fontworth went about his business calvin would have exploded if hed seen her laurie looked at her watch she decided it was late enough to slip downstairs to see if fontworth had turned up anything no sooner had she stood up than lou walked in on your way out he asked laurie sat back down its probably better if i dont yeah said lou she could tell he wasnt sure what she was talking about its a long story laurie said how are you doing you look exhausted i am lou admitted ive been up since three and doing autopsies with people other than you is just plain work are they finished laurie asked hell no lou said im the one whos finished i couldnt stand up any longer but it will probably take the two doctors all day to finish the four cases plus the dog the dog clipper lou said at one of the homes the killer shot the dog as well as the man and the woman but im only kidding theyre not autopsying the dog find out anything useful laurie asked i dont know the caliber of the bullets looks similar to the cases in queens but well have to wait to hear what ballistics says before were certain theyre from the same guns and of course ballistics is weeks behind no ideas yet laurie asked lou shook his head afraid not the queens cases suggested a restaurant connection but the two cases downstairs have nothing to do with the business one guy was a bigshot banker whod contributed heavily to the mayors campaign the other is an executive for one of the big auction houses still no organizedcrime association laurie asked nope lou said but were still working on it theres no question that these were professional hits ive got two more investigative teams on these two manhattan cases between the three teams in queens and these two new ones im running out of manpower the only positive break so far is that the housekeeper at one of the homes is still alive if she makes it well have our first witness id like to get a break with my series laurie said if only one of these overdoses wouldnt die i wish i had some manpower to try to find the source of the coke thats killing all these people you think its from a single source i know so laurie said she explained how peter had determined it scientifically just then lous beeper sounded lou checked the number speaking of manpower he said thats one of my boys may i use your phone laurie nodded what is it norman lou asked once he got through laurie was flattered that lou put the call on speakerphone so she could hear probably nothing norman said but i thought id tell you anyway ive found one note of commonality in these three cases a doctor really lou said he rolled his eyes at laurie this wasnt exactly the break he had been looking for thats not the sort of association thats going to be much help in this kind of murder case norman i know norman said but its the only thing thats turned up remember you told me that steven vivonetto and janice singleton were both terminal yeah lou said was one of the kaufmans terminally ill too no but henriette kaufman had a medical condition she was being treated for and she was seeing the same doctor that steven vivonetto and janice singleton were seeing of course steven and janice were seeing about a dozen doctors but there was one doctor who was seeing all three what kind of a doctor lou asked an eye doctor norman said his name is jordan scheffield lou blinked he couldnt believe what hed heard he glanced at laurie her eyes registered equal surprise how did you find this out lou asked just by accident norman replied after you told me about steven and janice being terminal i looked into everybodys health i didnt even realize the connection until i got back to my office and started going over all the material that had been coming in do you think its important i dont know lou said its certainly weird you want me to follow up on it in any way i wouldnt even know how to follow up let me think about it and ill get back to you meanwhile keep the investigation going lou hung up the phone well its a real small world either that or that boyfriend of yours really gets around hes not my boyfriend laurie said irritably im sorry lou said i forgot your male acquaintance who happens to be a friend you know the night that marsha schulman disappeared jordan told me that his office had been broken into someone had gone through his records some had been stolen lou asked no laurie said apparently some had been copied i had him check cerinos record it was one of the ones that had been disturbed no kidding lou said he sat in bemused silence for a few minutes laurie was quiet too it doesnt make a lot of sense lou said at last could the lucia family have gotten involved because cerino is seeing scheffield im trying to fit cerinos rival vinnie dominick into the picture but i cant make any sense of it one thing we could do is check the ganglandstyle homicides that came in today see if any of them are jordans patients lous face brightened you know thats a good idea glad i thought of it his smile told laurie he was kidding in mock anger laurie threw a paper clip at him five minutes later dressed in scrubs laurie and lou entered the autopsy room luckily calvin was nowhere in sight both southgate and besserman were on their second cases southgate was almost finished the kaufmans were fairly straightforward cases given their simple head wounds bessermans cases were more difficult first he had dwight sorenson who had three bullet paths to trace the work had been laborious and timeconsuming so besserman was just starting on amy sorenson when lou and laurie got there with the permission of the respective doctors laurie and lou glanced through the folders on each case unfortunately the medical histories were meager ive got a better idea laurie said she went to the phone and called cheryl myers cheryl ive got a favor to ask laurie said what is it cheryl asked cheerfully you know the four manhattan homicides we got today laurie said the ones that everybodys up in arms about i want to know if any of them have ever seen an ophthalmologist by the name of jordan scheffield will do cheryl said ill call you back in a few minutes where are you im down in the pit laurie said laurie told lou theyd hear back soon then laurie went over to george fontworth he was just finishing up the second of his two overdose cases julia myerholtz calvin said i wasnt supposed to talk with you today george told her i dont want to cross him just answer me this was the cocaine mainlined yeah george said his eyes darted around the room as if he expected calvin to come thundering by were the autopsies normal except for signs of the overdose and toxicity laurie asked yes george said come on laurie dont put me in this situation one last question laurie said were there any surprises just one george said but you know about that id just not heard it was standard policy on this kind of case i think it should have been brought up at thursday conference what are you talking about laurie asked please george said dont act dumb calvin told me it was your doing i dont know what youre talking about laurie said oh god george said here comes calvin bye laurie laurie turned in time to see calvins hulking figure enter through the swinging door even dressed in his scrubs and protective gloves there was no mistaking that body laurie quickly stepped away from georges table making a beeline for the master sheet of the days autopsies she wanted to have a cover in case calvin asked why she was there quickly she searched for mary oconnors name finding it she noted that paul plodgett had been scheduled for the autopsy he was at the far table near the wall laurie joined him ive found a lot of stuff paul said when laurie asked how the autopsy was going laurie glanced over her shoulder calvin had gone directly to bessermans table whats your feeling about the cause of death laurie asked she was relieved that calvin hadnt seen her or if he had he didnt seem concerned about her presence undoubtedly cardiovascular paul said gazing down at mary oconnors body the woman was considerably overweight the face and head were a deep blue almost purple a lot of pathology laurie asked enough paul said moderate coronary disease for starters also the mitral valve was in pretty bad shape the heart itself seemed awfully flabby so there are a lot of candidates for the final culprit laurie thought jordan would appreciate the news shes awfully purple laurie commented true paul said quite a bit of congestion in the head and the lungs must have been a lot of terminal agonal effort she didnt want to die poor lady she apparently even bit her lip really laurie asked do you think she had some kind of seizure could have paul said but its more like an abrasion like she was chewing her lip lets see paul reached over and drew back mary oconnors upper lip youre right laurie said what about the tongue normal paul said thats why i doubt there was a seizure maybe she had a lot of terminal pain well perhaps the microscopic of the heart will show something pathognomonic but i bet this case will fall into that category of an unknown coup de grace at least specifically in general i know it was cardiovascular laurie nodded but looked at mary oconnor something bothered her about the case it was triggering a memory she couldnt quite put a finger on what about these petechiae on her face laurie asked its consistent with terminal heart disease paul said this much as i said there must have been a lot of agonal effort would you mind letting me know what you find on microscopic she asked she was a friends patient i know hell be interested in what you find will do paul said laurie saw that calvin had moved from besserman to fontworth lou had wandered back to southgates table laurie headed over to him sorry she said to lou as she came alongside no problem lou said im starting to feel right at home here hey laurie the phones for you a voice yelled out over the general background noise of the busy autopsy room laurie walked to the phone cringing that her presence had been so blatantly broadcasted she didnt dare look in calvins direction she picked up the receiver it was cheryl i wish all your requests were so easy cheryl said i called over to dr scheffields office and the secretary couldnt have been more helpful henriette kaufman and dwight sorenson were both patients does that help you im not sure laurie said but it is interesting indeed thanks laurie went back to lou and told him what she had learned wow he said that takes it out of the realm of coincidence at least i think it does five for five laurie said the possibility of that happening by chance is extremely small but what does it mean lou asked it seems like an awfully strange way to get at cerino if thats what its about it doesnt make any sense i agree laurie said one way or the other lou said ive got to look into it immediately ill be in touch he was gone before laurie could say so much as goodbye laurie hazarded one last glance at calvin he was still talking with george and didnt seem the least perturbed by her presence back in her office laurie called jordan as usual he was in surgery laurie left a message for him to please call back trying to go back to work laurie wasnt much more successful than shed been earlier her mind was in a turmoil concerning her precarious job situation from having alienated so many people her overdose series and the odd coincidence that jordan was treating a string of five ganglandstyle murder victims lauries thoughts drifted back to mary oconnor she suddenly remembered what shed been trying to think of earlier the abrasions on the lip the florid petechiae and the faces deep purple discoloration suggested burking the suffocation by compressing the chest while occluding the mouth with that thought in mind laurie phoned down to the autopsy room and asked for paul ive had a thought laurie said once he was on the line shoot paul said what do you think about burking as a possible cause of death in the oconnor case her suggestion was met with silence well laurie questioned the victim was in manhattan general paul said she was in a private room in the goldblatt wing try to forget where she was laurie said just look at the facts but as forensic pathologists were supposed to take the scene into consideration if we didnt wed misdiagnose tons of cases i understand that laurie said but sometimes the scene can be misleading what about homicides set up to look like suicides thats different paul said is it laurie questioned anyway i just wanted you to give burking some thought think about the lip abrasion the petechiae and the amount of congestion of the face and the head as soon as laurie put down the receiver the phone rang it was jordan im glad you called jordan said i was about to call you im up in surgery and i only have a second ive got a number of cases including youll be glad to hear mr paul cerino i am glad laurie said and i have a favor to ask jordan said cutting laurie short in order to get cerino on the schedule ive had to do some juggling so im going to be stuck here until late could we take a raincheck on our dinner plans how about tomorrow night i suppose laurie said but jordan i have some things i have to talk to you about now make it fast jordan said my next patient is already in the operating room first about mary oconnor laurie said she had heart disease thats reassuring jordan said do you know anything about her personal life not much what would you say if i told you shed been murdered murdered jordan sputtered are you serious i dont know laurie admitted but if you told me she had twenty million dollars and was about to cut her wicked grandson out of her will the possibility of murder might enter into my thinking she was welloff but not wealthy jordan said and do i have to remind you that you were supposed to make me feel better about her death not more uneasy the doctor who did her autopsy is convinced that she died from heart disease laurie said thats better jordan said where did this murder question originate my fertile imagination laurie said plus some other rather startling news are you sitting down please laurie no games i was due in the or ten minutes ago do the names henriette kaufman and dwight sorenson mean anything to you laurie questioned theyre two of my patients why they were your patients laurie said they were both killed last night along with their spouses their autopsies are going on as we speak my god jordan said and thats not all laurie said the night before last three other patients of yours were murdered all of them were shot in a manner that suggests an organizedcrime connection at least thats what ive been told oh my god jordan said and paul cerino was in my office threatening me just this morning this is a nightmare how did he threaten you laurie asked i dont even want to discuss it jordan said but hes quite angry with me and im afraid i have you to thank me i wasnt going to bring this up until we got together jordan said but now that were on the subject what why did you tell a detective soldano about my treating cerino i didnt think it was a secret laurie said after all you talked about it at my parents dinner party i suppose youre right jordan said but how did you happen to tell a homicide detective of all people he was here observing autopsies laurie said cerinos name came up in relation to some homicides several ganglandstyle execution victims pulled out of the east river oh boy jordan said im sorry to be the greek messenger with all this bad news its not your fault jordan said and i guess im better off knowing thankfully ill be doing cerino this evening at this point the sooner i get rid of him the better just be careful laurie said something strange is going on im just not sure what jordan didnt need laurie to remind him to be careful not after cerinos threat to crush his hands and now this news that five of his patients had been murdered and another one dead possibly also murdered it was too much preoccupied with this bizarre yet terrifying set of circumstances jordan got up from the chair in the surgical lounge of the manhattan general hospital and traipsed into the or he wondered if he should go to the police and tell them about cerinos threat yet if he did go to the police what would they do probably nothing what would cerino do probably what he threatened jordan shivered with fear at the thought and wished that cerino had never walked through his door as he scrubbed his hands jordan tried to think of why five and possibly six of his patients would be killed and what about marsha but try as he might he couldnt think of a reason holding his hands in the air he pushed into the operating room surgery for jordan was a cathartic experience he was relieved to be able to lose himself in the exacting procedure of a corneal transplant for the next few hours he completely forgot about threats mob hits marsha schulman and unsolved homicides wonderful job the junior resident commented after jordan had finished thank you jordan said he beamed then to the nursing staff he added ill be in the surgical lounge lets turn the room around as soon as possible the next case is one of my vips yes your highness the scrub nurse teased walking back to the surgical lounge jordan was glad that cerino was next he just wished it was already over although complications were rare for jordan they did occur he shivered to think of the consequence of a postoperative infection not for cerino for himself gripped by his scary thoughts jordan was oblivious of his surroundings and when he sank into one of the armchairs in the lounge and closed his eyes he hadnt noticed the man sitting directly across from him good afternoon doctor jordan opened his eyes it was lou soldano your secretary told me you were up here lou said i told her it was important that i talk with you i hope you dont mind jordan sat bolt upright and his eyes nervously darted around the room he knew cerino had to be close probably in the holding area at that moment and that meant that the tall gaunt fellow would be around someplace cerino had insisted on it and the administration had agreed jordan did not relish the idea of cerinos man seeing him with lou soldano he didnt want to be forced to explain it to cerino certain facts have come up lou continued im hoping you might have some explanations i have another operation jordan said he started to get up sit down doctor lou said i only want a minute of your time at least at the moment weve been puzzling over five recent homicides which we have reason to believe were done by the same person or persons and the only way we have been able to associate them so far other than the manner in which they were killed is that they were your patients naturally wed like to ask you if you have any idea why this has happened id just been informed about it an hour ago jordan said nervously i havent the slightest idea why but i can tell you there is no way that it could involve me so we can assume they have all paid their bills lou asked under the circumstances lieutenant jordan snapped i dont think that is a very funny comment excuse my black humor lou said but guessing how much that office of yours had to cost and knowing you have a limo i dont have to talk with you if i dont want to jordan said interrupting lou and again motioning to get up you dont have to talk with me now lou said thats true but youd have to talk with me eventually so you might as well try to cooperate after all this is one hell of a serious situation jordan sat back what do you want from me i dont have anything to add to what you already know im sure you know much more than i tell me about martha goldburg steven vivonetto janice singleton henriette kaufman and dwight sorenson they were patients of mine jordan said what were their diagnoses lou asked he took out his pad and pencil i cant tell you that jordan said thats privileged information and dont cite my mentioning the cerino case to dr montgomery as a precedent i made a mistake talking about him ill be able to get the information from the families lou said why dont you just make it easy for me its up to the families to tell you if they so choose jordan said i am not at liberty to divulge that information ok lou said then lets talk generalities did all these people have the same diagnosis no jordan said they didnt lou questioned he visibly sagged are you sure of course im sure jordan said lou looked down at his blank pad and thought for a moment raising his eyes he asked were these patients related in some unlikely way for example were they customarily seen on the same day anything like that no jordan said could their records have been kept together for some reason no my records are alphabetical could any of these patients have been seen on the same day as cerino that i cant say jordan admitted but i can tell you this when mr cerino came to see me he never saw any other patient nor did any other patient see him are you sure of that lou asked positive jordan said the intercom connecting the surgical lounge to the or crackled to life one of the or nurses told jordan that his patient was in the room waiting for him jordan got to his feet lou did the same ive got surgery jordan said ok lou said im sure well be in touch lou put on his hat and walked out of the surgical lounge jordan followed him to the door and watched as lou continued down the long hallway to the main hospital elevators he watched as lou pushed the button waited then boarded and disappeared from view jordans eyes swept the hallway for cerinos man stepping across the hall he peered into the surgical waiting room he was encouraged when he didnt see the gaunt man anyplace turning back into the surgical lounge jordan sighed he was relieved that lou had left the meeting with him had left jordan feeling more rattled than ever and it wasnt only because of the fear that cerinos man would see them talking jordan sensed the detective didnt like him much and that could mean trouble jordan was afraid hed have to put up with the mans annoying presence in the future stepping into the mens locker room jordan splashed his face with cold water he needed to pull himself together to try to relax a moment before going into the or and doing cerino but it wasnt easy so much was happening his mind was in a turmoil one of the thoughts that was particularly disturbing was that hed realized there was one way that the five homicides were related including mary oconnor hed realized it while lou soldano had been talking with him but jordan had chosen not to say anything about it and the fact that he had so chosen confused him he didnt know if the reason hed not mentioned it was because he wasnt sure of its significance or because it scared him jordan certainly did not want to become a victim himself walking down toward the operating room where paul cerino was waiting jordan decided that the safest course of action for him was to do nothing after all he was in the middle suddenly jordan stopped hed realized something else despite all these problems he was doing more surgery than ever there had to be another part to it all as he started walking again it all began to make a kind of grotesque malicious sense he picked up his pace definitely playing dumb was the way he should handle it it was the safest by far and he liked to do surgery pushing into the operating room he went up to cerino who was significantly sedated well have you done in no time jordan said just relax after giving cerino a pat on the shoulder jordan turned and headed out to scrub as he passed one of the orderlies in scrubs he realized it wasnt one of the orderlies jordan had recognized the eyes it was the gaunt one pm friday manhattan laurie was hesitant to visit the lab again she didnt want to risk another runin with john devries but attempting any more paperwork just then was ridiculous she was far too distracted she decided to find peter surely he had to have more results by then i know you promised to call if you found anything laurie said once shed found him but i couldnt help but stop by just to check how you were doing i havent found a contaminant yet peter said but i did learn something that might be significant cocaine is metabolized in the body in a variety of different ways producing a variety of metabolites one of the metabolites is called benzoylecgonine when i calculated the ratio of cocaine and benzoylecgonine in the blood urine and brain of your victims i can estimate the amount of time from injection to death and what did you find laurie asked i found it was pretty consistent peter said roughly an hour in thirteen of the fourteen but in one of the cases it was different for some reason robert evans had practically no benzoylecgonine at all meaning laurie questioned meaning that robert evans died very quickly peter said maybe within minutes maybe even less i really cant say what do you think the significance is laurie questioned i dont know peter said youre the medical detective not me i suppose he could have suffered an instantaneous cardiac arrhythmia peter shrugged whatever he said and i havent given up on a contaminant but if i find something its going to be in nanomoles leaving the toxicology department laurie felt discouraged despite all her efforts she didnt feel any further along in her investigation of these unlikely overdoses than she had been at the start intending to talk again with george fontworth and have him explain what had surprised him on the autopsies laurie descended to the basement level and poked her head into the autopsy room she didnt see george but she saw vinnie and asked about george he left about an hour ago vinnie said laurie went upstairs to georges office the door was open but he wasnt there since his room was adjacent to one of the serology labs laurie went in and asked if anyone had seen george he had a dentists appointment one of the techs said he mentioned hed be back later but he didnt know when laurie nodded stepping out of the lab she paused outside georges office from where she was standing she could see the autopsy folders from the two overdose cases hed handled that day looking over her shoulder to make sure no one was watching laurie stepped into the office and opened the top folder it was julia myerholtzs file that was the case george had been working on when laurie had gone over to his table she hastily read through georges autopsy notes immediately she understood what he had meant by the surprise obviously hed responded the same way laurie had with duncan andrews looking at the forensic investigators report laurie noticed that the victim had been identified at the scene by robert nussman boyfriend taking a piece of scratch paper from a pad on georges desk laurie jotted down julias address laurie was just about to open the second file when she heard someone coming down the hall sheepishly she closed the folder pocketed the piece of scrap paper and stepped back out into the hall she nodded and smiled guiltily as one of the histology techs passed by although bingham had chastised laurie for visiting duncan andrews apartment she decided she would go to julia myerholtzs place hailing a cab she convinced herself that binghams anger had more to do with the unique fact that the case was such a political hot potato he hadnt objected to examination of the scene per seor so laurie rationalized julias apartment was in a large posh building on east seventyfifth street laurie was quite surprised when the doorman came to the curb to open her door for her as she paid the cab fare it amazed her to experience the kind of style some people enjoyed in the city the ambience was certainly a far cry from her own in kips bay may i help you madame the doorman asked he had a thick irish brogue laurie showed her medical examiners badge and asked to see the superintendent a few minutes later the man appeared in the foyer id like to view julia myerholtzs apartment laurie told him but before i go up i want to make certain that no one is there just now the superintendent asked the doorman if the apartment was empty it is indeed the doorman said her parents arent due in until tomorrow you want the key the superintendent nodded the doorman opened a small cabinet took out a key and handed it to laurie just give it back to patrick here when you leave the superintendent said id prefer if you came along i have a hot water leak in the basement the superintendent explained youll be okayc its to the right when you get off the elevator the elevator stopped on and laurie got out just to be sure she rang the bell of c several times and even pounded on the door before going in she didnt want to run into any of the deceaseds loved ones this time around the first thing laurie noticed were the shards of a plaster cast statue scattered over the floor of the foyer judging by the larger pieces laurie guessed the piece had been a replica of michelangelos david the roomy apartment was decorated in a comfortable country style not sure of what she was looking for laurie simply roamed from room to room surveying the scene in the kitchen laurie opened the refrigerator it was well stocked with health food yogurt bean sprouts fresh vegetables and skim milk in the living room the coffee table was loaded with art books and magazines american health runners world triathlon and prevention the room was lined with bookshelves filled with more art books on the mantel laurie noticed a small plaque she went closer to read the inscription central park triathlon third place in the bedroom laurie discovered an exercise bike and lots of framed photographs most of the photos featured an attractive woman and a handsome young man in various outdoor settings on bikes in a mountain setting camping in a forest finishing a race as she wandered back into the living room laurie tried to imagine why an amateur athlete like julia myerholtz was apparently taking drugs it just didnt make any sense the health food the magazines and the accomplishments just didnt jibe with cocaine lauries musings were abruptly cut short when she heard a key in the door for a second of absolute panic she contemplated trying to hide as if she expected bingham to come through the door when the door opened the young man who entered seemed as surprised as laurie to meet someone in the apartment laurie recognized him as the man in many of the bedroom photos dr laurie montgomery laurie said flipping open her badge im from the medical examiners office investigating miss myerholtzs death im robert nussman i was julias boyfriend i dont mean to be a bother laurie said moving to leave i can come back at another time she did not want bingham to get wind of this no its all right robert said holding up a hand please stay ill only be here a moment terrible tragedy laurie said she felt the need to say something tell me about it robert said he suddenly looked very sad he also acted as if he needed to talk did you know she took drugs laurie asked she didnt he said i know thats what you people say he added as his face flushed but im telling you julia never did drugs it just wasnt in her nature she was totally into health she got me into running he smiled at the memory last spring she had me do my first triathlon i just cant figure it my god she didnt even drink im sorry laurie said she was so gifted robert said wistfully so strongwilled so committed she cared about people she was religious not overly but enough and she was involved in everything like pro choice the homeless aids you name it i understand you identified her here at the scene laurie said were you the one who found her yes robert managed he looked away struggling with tears it must have been awful laurie said memories of finding her brother crowded in with graphic intensity she did her best to dismiss them where was she when you came in robert pointed toward the bedroom was she still alive at that point laurie asked gently sort of robert said she was breathing off and on i gave her cpr until the ambulance got here how did you happen to come by laurie asked shed called me earlier robert said she said to be sure to come over later on was that customary laurie asked robert looked puzzled i dont know he said i guess did she sound normal laurie asked could you tell if shed taken any drugs yet i dont think shed taken anything robert said she didnt sound high but i guess she didnt seem normal either she sounded tense in fact i was a little afraid she was planning on telling me something bad like she wanted to break up or something was there some problem in your relationship laurie asked no robert said things were great i mean i thought they were great its just that she sounded a little funny what about that broken statue by the front door i saw that the second i came through the door last night robert said it was her favorite possession it was a couple of hundred years old when i saw it was broken i knew something bad was going on laurie glanced over at the shattered statue and wondered if julia could have broken it while in the throes of a seizure if so how did she get from the foyer to the bedroom thank you for your help laurie said i hope i havent upset you with my questions no robert said but why are you going to all this trouble i thought medical examiners just did autopsies and only got involved with murders like quincy we try to help the living laurie said thats our job what id really like to do is prevent future tragedies like julias the more i learn the more i may be able to do that if you have any more questions call me robert said he handed laurie his card and if it somehow turns out that it wasnt drugs please let me know it would be important because suddenly overcome with emotion he wasnt able to continue laurie nodded she gave robert her own business card after scribbling her home phone number on the back if you have any questions for me or if you think of anything i should know please give me a call you can call anytime leaving robert to grieve in private laurie left the apartment and boarded the elevator as she was riding down she recalled that sara wetherbee had said that duncan had invited her over the night hed overdosed laurie thought both duncans and julias invitations to their significant others were odd if both were doing such a good job hiding their drug abuse why invite someone over the very night they were indulging laurie returned the key to patrick the doorman and thanked him on her way out she was a half dozen steps from the door when she turned around and went back were you on duty last night laurie asked him indeed i was patrick said three to eleven thats my shift did you happen to see julia myerholtz yesterday evening laurie asked i did patrick said id see her most every evening i suppose youve heard what happened to her laurie said she didnt want to offer any information the doorman might not be privy to i have patrick said she took drugs like a lot of young people its a shame did she seem depressed when she came in last night laurie asked i wouldnt say depressed patrick said but she didnt act normal in what way laurie asked she didnt say hello patrick said she always said hello except for last night but maybe that was because she wasnt alone do you remember who was with her laurie questioned with interest i do patrick said normally i cant remember things like that since we have a lot of traffic going in and out but since ms myerholtz hadnt said hello i looked at her companions did you recognize them laurie said had they been here before i didnt know who they were patrick said and i dont think id ever seen them one was tall thin and well dressed the other was muscular and on the short side no one said anything when they came in did you see them when they went out laurie asked no i didnt patrick said they must have left during my break what time did they come in laurie asked early evening patrick said something like seven oclock laurie thanked patrick yet again and hailed a cab to return to her office it was almost dusk the skyscrapers were already lit and people were hurrying home from work as the cab headed downtown in the heavy traffic she thought about her conversations with the boyfriend and the doorman she wondered about the two men patrick had described although they were probably coworkers or friends of julias the fact that they had visited the same night that julia overdosed made them important laurie wished there was some way she could find out their identities so she could talk with them the thought even went through her mind that they could have been drug dealers could julia myerholtz have had a secret life her boyfriend wasnt privy to back at the medical examiners building laurie went first to georges office to see if hed returned from the dentist obviously he had come and gone his office was dark disappointed laurie tried the door but it was locked not being able to talk with george shed had the sudden idea to get the address of the other overdose wendell morrison leaving her coat in her room and picking up some rubber gloves laurie went down to the morgue she found the evening mortuary tech bruce pomowski in the mortuary office any idea of the dispensation of the myerholtz remains laurie asked have they been picked up was she one of todays cases bruce asked yes laurie said bruce opened a thick ledger and ran a finger down the days entries when he got to myerholtz his finger ran across the page hasnt been picked up yet he said were waiting on a call from an outoftown funeral home is she in the walkin laurie asked yup bruce said should be on a gurney near the front laurie thanked him and walked down the corridor toward the walkin refrigerator in the evenings the environment of the morgue changed considerably during the day it was full of frantic activity but now as laurie walked she could hear the heels of her shoes echo through the deserted and mostly dark bluetiled corridors all at once she remembered lous response when theyd come down tuesday morning hed called it a grisly scene laurie stopped and looked down at the stained cement floor that lou had pointed out then she raised her eyes to the stacks of pine coffins destined for potters field with unclaimed unidentified remains she started walking again it was amazing how her normal mental state shielded the ghastly side of the morgue from her consciousness it took a stranger like lou and a time when the morgue was empty of the living for her to appreciate it reaching the large cumbersome stainlesssteel door of the walkin laurie put on her gloves and pressed the thick handle to release the latch with a hefty yank she pulled the heavy door open a cold clammy mist swirled out around her feet reaching in she turned on the light reacting to her mindset of only moments earlier laurie viewed the interior of the walkin cooler from the perspective of a nonprofessional person not the forensic pathologist she was it was definitely horrifying bare wooden shelves lined the walls on the shelves was a ghoulish collection of cold dead bodies and body parts that having been autopsied and examined were waiting to be claimed most were nude although a few were covered with sheets stained with blood and other body fluids it was like an earthly view of hell the center of the room was crowded with old gurneys each bearing a separate body again some were covered others naked and blankly staring up at the ceiling like some sort of macabre dormitory feeling uncharacteristically squeamish laurie stepped over the threshold her eyes nervously darting around the gurneys to locate julia myerholtz behind her the heavy door slammed shut with a loud click irrationally laurie spun around and rushed back to the door fearful that shed been locked into the cooler but the latch responded to her push and the door swung open on its bulky hinges embarrassed at her own imagination laurie turned back into the refrigerator and began methodically going through the bodies on the gurneys for identification purposes each body had a manila name tag tied around the right big toe she found julia not far from the doorway her body was one of those that had been covered stepping up to the head laurie drew down the sheet she gazed at the womans pallid skin and her delicate features judging by her appearance alone if she hadnt been so pale she could have been sleeping but the rude yshaped autopsy incision dispelled any hope that she might still be alive looking more closely laurie saw multiple bruised areas on julias head an indication of her probable seizure activity in her minds eye laurie could see the woman bumping up against her statue of david and knocking it to the floor opening up julias mouth laurie looked at the tongue which had not been removed she could see that it had been bitten severely more evidence of seizure activity next laurie looked for the iv site where julia had injected herself she found it as easily as she had the others she also noticed that julia had scratched her arms the way duncan andrews had done she had probably experienced similar hallucinations but laurie noticed julias scratches were deeper almost as if they had been done with knives looking at julias carefully manicured nails laurie could see why the scratches were so deep julias nails were long and immaculately polished while she was admiring the womans nails laurie noted a bit of tissue wedged beneath the nail of the right middle finger after finding no other tissue under any of the other nails laurie went to the autopsy room for two specimen jars and a scalpel returning to julias side she teased a bit of tissue free and put it into one of the specimen jars using the scalpel she sliced a small sliver of skin from the margin of the autopsy wound and slipped it into the other specimen jar after covering julias body with the sheet laurie took the two samples up to the dna lab where she labeled them and signed them in on the request form she asked for a match even though it was fairly obvious the woman had scratched herself laurie thought it was worth checking just because the mes office was overworked was no reason not to be thorough still she was relieved that it was evening and the lab was empty she wouldnt have wanted to explain the need for this test laurie walked back to her office with everyone else gone she thought she might take advantage of the quiet and turn her attention to some of that paperwork shed been so studiously neglecting still feeling slightly tense from her strange reaction to the cooler door closing laurie was ill prepared to deal with what awaited her in her office as she rounded the corner of the doorway preoccupied with her thoughts a figure shouted and leaped at her laurie screamed from someplace deep down in her being it was a purely reflex response and of a power that caused the sound to reverberate up and down the cinderblocked hallway like some charged subatomic particle in an accelerator shed had no control simultaneous with the scream her heart leaped in her chest but the attack that laurie feared did not occur instead her brain frantically changed the message and told her that the terrifying figure had cried boohardly what a mad rapist or some supernatural demon would yell at the same time her brain identified the face as belonging to lou soldano all this had happened in the blink of an eye and by the time laurie was capable of responding her fear had changed to anger lou she cried why did you do that did i scare you lou asked sheepishly he could see that her face had turned to ivory his ears were still ringing from her scream scare me she yelled you terrified me and i hate to be scared like that dont ever do that again im sorry lou said contritely i suppose it was juvenile but this place has been scaring me i thought i could get you back a little i could bop you in the nose laurie said shaking a clenched fist in front of his face her anger had already subsided especially with his apology and apparent remorse she walked around her desk and fell into her chair what on earth are you doing here at this hour anyway she asked i was literally driving by lou said i wanted to talk with you so i pulled into the morgue loading dock on the chance that youd be here i really didnt expect you to be but the fellow downstairs said youd just been in his office what did you want to talk to me about your boyfriend jordan lou said hes not my boyfriend laurie snapped youre really going to irritate me if you persist in calling him that whats the problem lou asked it seems to me to be a relatively accurate term after all you go out with him every night my social life is no ones business but mine laurie said but for your information i do not go out with him every night im obviously not going out tonight well three out of four aint bad lou said but look down to business i wanted to let you know that i talked with jordan about his patients being professionally bumped off what did he have to say laurie asked not a lot lou said he refused to talk about any of his patients specifically good for him but more important than what he said was how he acted he was really nervous the whole time i was there i dont know what to make of that you dont think he was involved with these murders in any way do you no lou said robbing his patients blindno pun intendedyes shooting them no hed be killing the golden goose but he was definitely nervous somethings on his mind i think he knows something i think he has plenty of reason to be nervous laurie said did he tell you that cerino threatened him no he didnt lou said how did he threaten him jordan wouldnt say laurie said but if cerino is the kind of person you say he is then you can just imagine lou nodded i wonder why jordan didnt tell me probably he doesnt think you could protect him could you probably not lou said certainly not forever not someone as high profile as jordan scheffield did you learn anything helpful talking with him laurie asked i did learn that the murder victims did not have the same diagnosis lou said at least according to him that was one harebrained idea i had and i learned that they are not related in any other obvious way visávis jordan scheffield other than being his patients i asked about every way i could imagine so unfortunately i didnt learn much what are you going to do now laurie asked hope lou said plus ill have my investigative teams find out the individual diagnoses maybe that will tell us something there has to be some aspect im missing in all this thats the way i feel about my overdose cases laurie said by the way lou said what are you doing here so late i was hoping to get some work done but with my pulse still racing thanks to you ill probably take the paperwork home and tackle it there what about dinner lou asked how about coming with me down to little italy you like pasta i love pasta how about it then lou asked you already told me you arent going out with the good doctor and thats your favorite excuse you are persistent hey im italian fifteen minutes later laurie found herself in lous caprice heading downtown she did not know if it was a good idea to have dinner with the man but she really hadnt been able to think of a reason not to go and although hed been somewhat rude on previous occasions now he seemed nothing but charming as he regaled her with stories of growing up in queens although laurie had grown up in manhattan shed never been to little italy as they drove up mulberry street she was delighted by the ambience there was a multitude of restaurants and throngs of people strolling the streets just like italy itself the place seemed to be throbbing with life its definitely italian laurie said it looks it doesnt it lou said but ill tell you a little secret most of the real estate here is owned by chinese thats strange laurie said a bit disappointed although she didnt know why used to be an italian neighborhood lou said but the italians for the most part moved out to the suburbs like queens and the chinese with a nose for business came in and bought up the properties they pulled into a restricted parking zone laurie pointed to the sign please lou said he positioned a little card on the dash by the steering wheel once in a while im entitled to take advantage of being one of new yorks finest lou led her down a narrow street to one of the less obvious restaurants it doesnt have a name laurie said as they entered it doesnt need one the interior was a kitschy blend of red and white checked tablecloths and trellis interlaced with artificial ivy and plastic grapes a candle stuck in a jug with wax drippings coating the sides served as each tables light fixture a few black velvet paintings of venice hung on the walls there were about thirty tables packed tightly in the narrow room all seemed to be occupied harried waiters dashed about attending to the customers everyone seemed to know each other by their first names over the whole scene hung a babble of voices and a rich savory herbed aroma of spicy food laurie suddenly realized how hungry she was looks like we should have made a reservation she said lou motioned for her to be patient in a few minutes a very large and very italian woman appeared and gave lou an enveloping hug she was introduced to laurie her name was marie as if by magic an available table materialized and marie seated laurie and lou i have a feeling youre pretty well known here laurie said with as many times as ive eaten here id better be ive put one of their kids through college to lauries chagrin there were no menus she had to listen to the choices as they were recited by a waiter with a heavy italian accent but no sooner had he finished his impressive litany than lou leaned over and encouraged her to choose the ravioli or the manicotti laurie quickly settled on the ravioli with dinner ordered and a bottle of white wine on the table lou disappointed laurie by lighting a cigarette maybe we could compromise laurie said how about you having only one fine by me after a glass of wine laurie began to revel in the chaotic atmosphere when their entrées arrived giuseppe the ownerchef appeared to pay his respects laurie thought the dinner was wonderful after the last few nights in such formal settings this lively spot was a welcome relief everyone seemed to knowand lovelou he received much goodnatured kidding for having brought laurie along apparently he usually dined solo for dessert lou insisted they take a walk up the street to an italianstyle coffee bar that served decaf espresso and gelato with their espressos and ice creams before them laurie looked up at lou lou she said theres something i want to ask you uhoh lou said i was hoping we could avoid any potentially troublesome subjects please dont ask me to go to the narc boys again i only want your opinion laurie said ok lou said thats not so scary shoot i dont want you to laugh at me ok laurie said this is starting to sound interesting lou said i have no definitive reason why ive been thinking this laurie said just some little facts that bother me its going to take you all night to get this out at this rate lou said its about my overdose series laurie said i want to know what your opinion would be if i suggested that they were homicides not accidental overdoses keep talking lou said absently he took out a cigarette and lit it a case came in where a woman died suddenly in the hospital laurie said she has lots of cardiac disease but when you looked at her and you examined her carefully you couldnt help but think that she could have been smothered the case is being signed out as natural mainly because of the other detailswhere she was the fact that she was overweight and had a history of heart disease but if the lady had been found someplace else it might have been considered a homicide how does this relate to your overdoses lou asked he leaned forward the cigarette stuck in the corner of his mouth his eyes were squinting from the smoke i started thinking about my overdoses in the same light take away the fact that these people were found alone in their apartments with syringes by their sides its hard not to view murders in context but what if the cocaine wasnt selfadministered wowthat would be a twist lou said he sat back and took the cigarette from his mouth its true homicides have been committed with drugs theres no doubt about that but the motive is usually more apparent robbery sex retribution inheritance a lot of smalltime pushers get killed by their disgruntled clients that way the cases in your series dont fit that mold i thought the whole reason these cases are so striking is the fact that in each case the deceased was apparently such a solid citizen with no history of drug abuse or runins with the law thats true laurie admitted do you mean to say you think these yuppies were forcibly administered the cocaine laurie get real with users willing to pay big bucks for the stuff why would anyone go on a personal crusade to rid the city of some of its best and brightest what would they have to gain isnt it likelier that these people were really into drugs on the sly maybe even dealing i dont think so laurie said besides lou said didnt you say that these people were shooting the coke rather than sniffing it thats right laurie said well how is someone going to stick a needle in someone who isnt cooperating i mean dont nurses in hospitals have a hard enough time sticking patients now youre telling me some struggling victim whos trying to just say no can get shot up against his will give me a break laurie closed her eyes lou had stumbled upon the weakest point of her homicide theory if these people were being injected against their will there would be signs of struggle have there been any no laurie admitted at least i dont think so she suddenly recalled the shattered statue in julias apartment the only other way i could conceive of this happening is if the victims had been drugged to beat the band with some kind of knockout cocktail beforehand correct me if im wrong but you people at the me office would have found a drug like that if thered been one am i right youre right laurie conceded well there you go lou said im not going to fault you for considering homicide but i think its a mighty remote possibility there are a few other facts ive discovered that have made me suspicious laurie persisted i visited the apartment of one of the more recent overdose cases today and the doorman said that on the evening the woman died shed come home with two men hed never seen before laurie you cant mean to tell me that the fact a woman comes home with two men the doorman doesnt recognize has spawned this huge conspiracy theory is that it ok ok laurie said go easy on me do you mind that i bring this stuff up the problem is that these things are bothering me its like a mental toothache what else lou said patiently out with it on two of the cases the respective girlfriend or boyfriend was called by the victim an hour or so before and asked to come over and said lou and nothing said laurie thats it i just thought it was curious that these people who were allegedly hiding their drug abuse invited their nondruggie significant others over if they were planning a night of cokedout debauchery these two could have called for a million different reasons i dont think either had any idea this trip was going to turn out the way it did if anything its more support for selfadministration they probably believed in the popular myth of cocaines aphrodisiac powers and wanted their playmates to be available at the height of their turnon you must think im nuts laurie said not at all lou insisted its good to be suspicious particularly in your line of work thank you for the consult i appreciate your patience my pleasure lou said any time you want to run something by me dont hesitate i enjoyed dinner very much laurie said but i think id better be thinking of getting home i still have to make good on my plans to get some work done if you liked this restaurant lou said id love to take you to one in queens its out in the middle of a real italian neighborhood authentic northern italian cuisine how about tomorrow night thank you for asking laurie said but i do have plans of course lou said sarcastically how could i forget dr limo lou please laurie said come on lou said pushing back his chair ill take you home if you can stand my humble strippeddown caprice laurie rolled her eyes franco ponti pulled his black cadillac up in front of the neapolitan restaurant on corona avenue up the street from the vesuvio and got out the valet recognized him and rushed over to assure him that good care would be taken of his car franco gave the valet a tendollar bill and walked through the door at that hour on a friday night the restaurant was in full swing an accordion player went from table to table serenading the customers between the laughter and din an air of conviviality marked the evening franco paused for a moment just inside the red velvet curtain separating the foyer from the dining area he easily spotted vinnie dominick freddie capuso and richie herns at one of the upholstered booths along with a pair of buxom miniskirted bimbos franco walked directly to the table when vinnie saw him he patted the girls and told them to go powder their noses as soon as they left ponti sat down you want something to drink vinnie asked a glass of wine would be fine franco said vinnie snapped his fingers a waiter instantly appeared for instructions just as quickly he reappeared with the requested glass vinnie poured franco some wine from the bottle standing on the table you got something for me vinnie asked franco took a drink and twisted the bottle around to look at the label angelo facciolo and tony ruggerio are with cerino tonight so theyre idle but last night they were out hustling i dont know what they did early in the evening because id lost them but after some midnight pizza i picked them up again and they were busy you read about those murders in manhattan last night you mean that bigshot banker and the auction house guy vinnie asked those are the ones franco said angelo and tony did both those jobs and they were messy they almost got nabbed both times in fact i had to be careful not to get picked up for questioning especially on the banker job i was parked out front when the cops came what the hell did they whack them for vinnie said his face had gotten quite red and his eyes started to bulge i still dont know franco said every day the cops are more agitated vinnie bellowed and the more of an uproar theyre in the worse it gets for business weve had to shut most of our gambling clubs down temporarily he glared at franco you got to find out whats going on ive put out some feelers franco said ill be asking around as well as tailing angelo and tony somebodys got to know i have to do something vinnie said i cant sit around forever while they ruin everything give me a couple more days franco said if i cant figure it out i can get rid of angelo and tony but that would mean a war vinnie said im not sure im ready for that either thats even worse for business you know something doc cerino said that wasnt so bad at all i really was worried but i didnt feel a thing when you operated howd it go like a dream jordan said he was holding a small penlight and shining it in the eye on which hed just performed surgery and it looks fine now the corneas as clear as a bell and the chambers deep if youre happy cerino said im happy cerino was in one of the private rooms of the goldblatt wing of manhattan general hospital jordan was making late postoperative rounds since hed finished his last corneal transplant only half an hour earlier hed done four in that day alone in the background angelo was leaning against the wall in an armchair next to the door to the bathroom tony was fast asleep what well do is give this eye a few days jordan said straightening up then if all goes well which im sure it will he hastily added well do the other eye then youll be as good as new you mean i have to wait for the other operation too cerino demanded you didnt tell me about that when we started you just said i had to wait for the first operation relax jordan urged dont get your blood pressure up its good to put a little time between operations so that your eye has a chance to recover before i work on the other one and at the rate weve been going today you shouldnt have long to wait i dont like surprises from doctors cerino warned i dont understand this second waiting period are you sure this eye you operated on is doing ok its doing beautifully jordan assured him no one could have done better believe me if i didnt believe you i wouldnt be laying here cerino said but if im doing this good and if i got to wait for a few days what am i doing in this depressing room i want to go home its better that you stay you need medication in your eye and should any infection set in anybody can put a couple of drops in my eyes paul said with all thats happened my wife gloria has gotten pretty good at it i want out of here if you are determined to go i cant keep you jordan said nervously but at least be sure to rest and stay quiet three quarters of an hour later an orderly pushed cerino to angelos car in a wheelchair tony had already moved the town car to the curb in front of the hospitals entrance he had the engine idling cerino had paid his hospital bill in cash a feat that had stunned the cashier who was on duty after a snap of his bosss fingers angelo had peeled hundreddollar bills off a big roll he had in his pocket until hed surpassed the total hands off cerino said when angelo tried to help him out of the wheelchair when it reached the side of the car and the orderly had activated the wheel brakes i can do it myself what do you think i am handicapped cerino pushed himself into a standing position and swayed for a moment getting his considerable bulk directly over his legs he was dressed in his street clothes over his operated eye he had a metal shield with multiple tiny holes slowly he eased himself into the front passenger seat he allowed angelo to close the door for him angelo got in the backseat tony started driving but as he reached the street he misjudged the curb the car bounced jesus christ cerino yelled tony cowered over the steering wheel they drove through the midtown tunnel and out the long island expressway cerino became expansive you know something boys cerino beamed i feel great after all that worry and planning it finally happened and as i told the doc it wasnt half bad of course i felt that first needle stick angelo cringed in the backseat hed been squeamish about going into the operating room from the start when hed seen jordan direct that huge needle into cerinos face just below the eye angelo had almost passed out angelo hated needles but after the needle cerino continued i didnt feel a thing i even fell asleep can you believe that can you tony no i cant tony said nervously when i woke up it was done cerino said jordan might be an ass but hes one hell of a surgeon and you know something i think hes smart i know hes practical we might very well go into business he and i what do you say about that angelo an interesting idea angelo said without enthusiasm am saturday manhattan since it was saturday laurie did not set her alarm but she woke up before eight anyway again troubled by her nightmare about shelly vaguely she wondered if it would help if she were to see someone professional despite not being on call laurie had decided to go into the office her intentions notwithstanding shed not been productive with her work the previous evening after lou had dropped her off wine and work did not mix well with laurie emerging from her building laurie was pleasantly surprised to find a crisp fall day the sun had already taken on its weak winter look but the sky was clear and the temperature moderate being a saturday the traffic and its resultant exhaust was minimal on first avenue and laurie enjoyed the walk up to thirtieth street as soon as she arrived laurie went straight to the id office to check on that days cases she was relieved to see there were no new candidates for her overdose series the schedule was filled with the usual fridaynight homicides and accident cases reflecting a normal night of murder and mayhem in the big apple next laurie headed for the toxicology lab she was relieved she wouldnt have to dodge john devries he certainly wouldnt be in on a saturday she was pleased to find hardworking peter at his usual spot in front of the newest gas chromatograph nothing yet along the lines of a contaminant peter told her but with that huge new sample i got yesterday we might be in luck what kind of sample laurie asked blood no peter said pure cocaine taken from the gut whose gut laurie asked peter checked the specimen tag before him wendell morrison one of fontworths cases from yesterday but how did he get a sample from the gut i cant help you there peter said i have no idea how he got it but by giving me as much as he did it makes my job considerably easier im glad laurie said puzzled by this unexpected bit of news let me know what you find laurie left the toxicology lab and went to her office after finding his number in the office directory she called george fontworth at home he answered on the second ring laurie was relieved not to have awakened him dont tell me youre in the office he said when he heard who it was what can i say laurie said youre not even on call george said dont work so hard youll make the rest of us look bad sure laurie laughed im not impressing anyone around here you know what calvin told you you werent even supposed to talk with me yesterday that was kinda stupid george agreed whats on your mind im curious about the first case you did yesterday laurie said wendell morrison what do you want to know george asked toxicology told me that you had given them a cocaine sample from the deceaseds gut how did you come by that dr morrison took the drug orally george said i thought you told me both your cases mainlined it laurie said only the second case george said when you asked me the route of administration i thought you were only referring to that one all of my cases took the drug iv but one of dick katzenburgs took it orally only after trying to take it iv same with dr morrison george said his antecubital fossae looked like pincushions the guy was overweight and his veins were deep but youd think a doctor would have been a bit better at venipuncture there was still a lot of cocaine in the gut laurie asked a ton george said i cant imagine how much the guy ate part of the gut was infarcted where the cocaine had closed down the blood supply it was just like one of those cocaine mule cases where the condoms break in transit was there anything else of note yes george said he had a cva from a small aneurysm it probably burst during a seizure before laurie hung up she told george about the little bit of tissue shed taken from beneath julia myerholtzs fingernail and sent up to the lab i hope you dont mind my butting in on your case laurie said hell no george said im just embarrassed i missed it with the way she had excoriated herself i should have looked under her nails after wishing george a good weekend laurie finally settled down to her paperwork but as she experienced lately she couldnt take her mind off the troubling aspects of her overdose series despite her conversation with lou some of the details of the myerholtz case continued to bother her laurie pulled out the folders on the three cases shed posted on thursday stuart morgan randall thatcher and valerie abrams using a scratch pad she jotted down each of the threes address in another minute laurie was out the door she caught a cab and visited each of the three scenes at each residence laurie talked with the doorman after explaining who she was she obtained the names and telephone numbers of the doormen who had been on duty wednesday evening back at the office laurie began her calls the first she put through was to julio chavez did you know valerie abrams laurie asked after explaining who she was yes of course julio said did you see her wednesday night laurie asked no i didnt julio said at least i dont remember lou was probably right laurie told herself after shed thanked the man and hung up she was probably wasting her time still she couldnt resist dialing the next name on the list angel mendez the evening doorman at stuart morgans apartment laurie introduced herself as she had before then asked angel if he knew stuart morgan and the answer was the same of course did you see mr morgan wednesday night laurie asked of course angel said i saw mr morgan every night i worked he jogged after work every day did he jog on wednesday night laurie asked just like every other night angel told her again laurie wondered about the inconsistency of a guy who thought enough of himself to run every night taking drugs it didnt make a lot of sense did he seem normal laurie asked did he seem depressed he seemed fine when he went out angel said but he didnt jog as far as usual at least he came back very soon he wasnt even sweaty i remember because i told him hed not worked up a sweat what did he say in return laurie asked nothing angel said was it usual for him not to say anything laurie asked only when he was with other people angel said was mr morgan with other people when he came back from jogging she asked yes angel said he was with two strangers laurie sat up can you describe these strangers she asked angel laughed no i dont think so he said i see so many people in a day i just remembered he was with strangers because he didnt say hello laurie thanked the man and hung up now this was something she could still hear lous admonition warning her not to play detective but this striking similarity to the myerholtz case could be the beginning of a big break finally laurie called the last name on her list david wong unfortunately david couldnt remember seeing randall thatcher on wednesday night laurie thanked him and hung up laurie decided to turn her attention to one more case before returning to her paperwork she went to histology and asked for the slides of mary oconnor back in her office she scanned the heart slides under her microscope to study the extent of atherosclerosis it was moderate on microscopic just as paul had said it had been on gross she also didnt notice any cardiac myopathy with that out of the way laurie couldnt think of another reason to avoid her work pushing her microscope to the side she pulled out her uncompleted cases and forced herself to begin so this is it lou asked he waved a typed sheet of paper in the air thats what weve been able to come up with norman told him this is a bunch of doctor gobbledygook what the hell is keratoconus or heres a gem pseudophakic bullous keratopathy what is this crap will you please tell me you wanted the diagnoses of the victims who were seeing dr jordan scheffield norman said thats what the teams came up with lou read the page again martha goldburg pseudophakic bullous keratopathy steven vivonetto interstitial keratitis janice singleton herpes zoster henriette kaufman fuchs endothelial dystrophy dwight sorenson keratoconus i was hoping they would all have the same condition muttered lou id hoped to catch twinkletoes scheffield in a lie norman shrugged sorry he said i can get someone to translate those terms to regular englishif theres any english to cover it lou settled back in his chair so what do you think he asked i dont have any bright ideas norman said when i first saw the doctors name pop out of the data i thought maybe we had something but now it doesnt look that way any of the patients unhappy with their care lou asked only positive in that arena is the goldburgs norman said harry goldburg had initiated a malpractice suit against dr scheffield after the doctor took out his wifes cataract apparently there was some complication and she wasnt seeing much through that eye whats all this other stuff lou asked grasping at a fat file folder filled with typed pages thats the rest of the material that has been gathered by the investigative teams norman said jesus christ lou said there must be five hundred pages in here more like four hundred norman said nothings jumped out at me yet but i thought youd better go through it too and you might as well get started therell be more coming as we interview more people what about ballistics lou asked they havent gotten to us yet norman said theyre still on last months homicides but preliminary opinion is that there were only two guns involved a twentytwo and a twentyfive caliber what about the housekeeper lou asked shes still alive but has yet to regain consciousness norman said she was shot in the head and shes in a coma do you have her protected lou asked absolutely norman said around the clock having finally made some progress on her paperwork laurie made a neat stack of her completed cases with them out of the way she pulled out the records of the overdose cases sorting through she set aside the three she wanted duncan andrews robert evans and marion overstreet these were the cases she had autopsied on tuesday and wednesday she copied the addresses and packed up laurie made the same kind of tour shed made that morning only this time she found that the doormen she wanted to question were on duty again she was disappointed with the results at the evans and overstreet residences neither doorman could tell her very much about the evenings in question but it was a different story at duncan andrews when the cab pulled up to the building laurie recognized the blue scalloped canvas awning and the wroughtiron door from her previous visit as she got out of the cab she even recognized the doorman hed been the same one on duty on her last illfated visit but recognizing the doorman did not deter her although she thought there was an outside chance that her visit might get back to bingham she was willing to risk it can i help you the doorman asked laurie looked for signs of recognition on the doormans part she didnt see any im from the medical examiners office laurie said my name is dr montgomery do you remember my coming here tuesday i believe i do the doorman said my name is oliver is there something i can do for you are you here to go back up to the andrews apartment no i dont want to disturb anyone laurie said i just want to speak with you were you working sunday night yes i was oliver said my days off are monday and thursday do you remember seeing mr andrews the night he died i think i do he said after thinking about it i used to see him most every night do you remember if he was alone laurie asked that i cant tell you oliver said with as many people who go in and out of here i wouldnt be likely to remember a thing like that especially almost a week later maybe if it was the same day or if something happened out of the ordinary wait a minute he suddenly cried maybe i do remember there was one night that mr andrews came in with some people i remember now because he called me by the wrong name he used the superintendents name did he know your name laurie asked for sure oliver said ive been working here since before he moved in that was five years ago how many men were with him laurie asked two i think maybe three but youre not positive which night laurie asked i cant be sure oliver agreed but i remember he called me juan and it confused me i mean he knew my name was oliver laurie thanked oliver and headed home what to make of this odd streak of similarities who were these two men and were they the same pair in each case and what did it mean that a young intelligent dynamic man would mix up the names of his doorman and his superintendent probably nothing after all duncan could have been thinking about calling juan for a problem in his apartment just as he was arriving home entering her own tenement laurie cast an appraising glance around the interior as she walked to the elevator she noted the cracked and chipped tiles on the floor and the peeling paint on the walls comparing it to the residences shed been visiting it was a slum the depressing thing was that all the overdose victims had been about lauries age or younger and obviously had been doing a lot better than she was financially laurie was already paying more rent than she thought she could afford on her salary and she was living in a comparative dump it was depressing tom lightened lauries mood the moment she entered her apartment having been sleeping all day as well as through the previous night the catkitten was a ball of energy with truly awesome leaping ability he caromed off walls and furniture in a fantastic display of exuberance that made laurie laugh to the point of tears unaccustomed to the luxury of free time to splurge on herself laurie took full advantage of the next several hours by taking a nap as well as a bath since there had been no message from jordan to the contrary she assumed their dinner plans had not changed from the prearranged nine pm after taking a half hour to decide what to wear which encompassed trying on three different outfits laurie was ready by five of nine contrary to the previous two outings jordan himself showed up on time at nine sharp youre really going to get my neighbors talking now laurie told him im sure theyre thinking ive been seeing thomas jordan had made reservations for them at the four seasons as with the other restaurants he favored laurie had never dined there although the food was excellent the service impeccable and the wine delightful laurie couldnt help but compare it unfavorably to the nameless restaurant lou had taken her to the night before there was something so winning about that chaotic bustling little place the four seasons on the other hand was so quiet it was distracting with the only sounds being the tinkle of ice against the waterglasses or the clink of the sansserif flatware against the china she felt she had to whisper and the décor was so purposefully daunting with its stark geometry she felt intimidated laurie choked on her water when a pesky thought occurred to her what if it wasnt the restaurant she preferred so much as the company jordan was relaxed and expansive going on about his office things couldnt be better he said i got a replacement for marsha who is ten times better than marsha ever was i dont know why i was so worried about replacing her and my surgery is going fine ive never done so much surgery in such a short period of time i just hope it keeps up my accountant called me yesterday and told me this is going to be a record month im glad for you laurie said she was tempted to mention her days revelations but jordan didnt give her a chance im toying with the idea of adding an additional exam room he said maybe even taking in a junior partner who would see all the junk patients what are junk patients laurie asked nonsurgical ones jordan said he spotted a waiter and called him over to order a second bottle of wine i looked at mary oconnors slides today laurie said id prefer to keep the conversation on happier subjects jordan said you dont want to know what i found laurie asked not particularly jordan said unless it was something astonishing i cant dwell on her i have to move on after all her general medical condition was not my responsibility but rather her internists its not as if she died during surgery what about your other patients who were killed laurie asked would you like to talk about them not really jordan said i mean whats the point its not as if we can do anything for them i just thought youd have a need to discuss it laurie said if i were in your shoes im sure i would it depresses me jordan admitted but it doesnt help to talk about it id rather concentrate on the positive things in my life laurie studied jordans face lou had said hed seemed nervous when questioned about his patients deaths laurie didnt see any nervousness now all she saw was a deliberate denial hed just rather not think about any unpleasantness positive things like the fact that you operated on paul cerino yesterday laurie asked if jordan caught the facetiousness in her tone he didnt let on thats the ticket he said responding eagerly to a change in the subject i cant wait to do the second eye and see the last of him when will that be laurie asked within a week or so jordan said i just want to make sure his first eye goes well i shudder every time i think about the possibility of complications not that i expect any his case went perfectly well but he refused to stay in the hospital overnight so i cant be a hundred percent sure hes getting the medication he needs well if he didnt it wouldnt be your fault laurie said im not sure cerino would see it that way jordan said after dessert and coffee laurie agreed to go back to see jordans apartment in the trump tower she was impressed the moment she went through the door directly in front of her almost at the same height as jordans apartment was the illuminated top of the crown building walking into the living room laurie could see south down fifth avenue to the empire state building and to the world trade center beyond looking north she could see a wedge of central park with its serpentine pathways fully illuminated its gorgeous laurie said she was transfixed by the view of the new york skyline as her eyes swept the horizon she realized that jordan was standing directly behind her laurie he said softly turning around laurie found herself enveloped by jordans muscular arms his angular face was illuminated by reflected light streaming in through the windows from the golden apex of the crown building with his lips slightly parted he leaned forward intending to kiss her hey she said disengaging herself how about an afterdinner drink your wish is my command jordan said with a rueful smile laurie was a little surprised at herself surely she was not so naive to believe jordans gesture wasnt expected after all shed gone out with the man nearly three nights in a row and she did find him attractive yet for some reason she was beginning to have serious second thoughts well tony mumbled as angelo came back to the table from the phone outside the mens room tonys mouth was full hed just finished shoveling in a huge bite of tortellini con panna lifting up his napkin he wiped off the ring of cream and cheese from his lips angelo and tony were in a small allnight restaurantsub shop in astoria it was tonys idea to stop but angelo didnt mind since he had to call cerino anyway well tony repeated after hed swallowed the tortellini in his mouth he washed it down with mineral water i wish you wouldnt talk with food in your mouth angelo said as he sat down it makes me sick im sorry tony said he was already busy stabbing tortellini with his fork in preparation for the next bite he wants us to go out again tonight angel said tony shoveled the forkful of tortellini into his mouth then said great it sounded more like rate having had yet another disgusting look at the mash of pasta in tonys mouth angelo reached over and picked tonys bowl from the table and crammed it upside down on tonys place mat tony flinched at the sudden movement and stared at his upturned bowl with shocked surprise why did you do that he whined i told you not to eat with your mouth open angelo snapped im trying to talk with you and you keep eating im sorry all right besides it pisses me off about cerino sending us out angelo said i thought we were finally finished with all this crap at least the money is good tony said what are we supposed to do were supposed to stick to the supply side angelo said we might be finished with the demand side which is fine by me thats where we got into trouble when tony asked as soon as you get your ass out into the car angelo said fifteen minutes later as they were approaching the queensboro bridge angelo spoke up theres another thing that bothers me about this i dont like the timing late saturday night is not a good time we may have to change things around and be creative why dont we just use the phone tony said we can make sure things are copacetic before we do anything else angelo shot a glance in tonys direction sometimes the kid surprised him he wasnt dumb all the time am sunday manhattan bending over and trying to point the umbrella into the wind laurie slowly made her way up first avenue it was hard for her to believe that the weather could change as much as it had in a single day not only was it windy and rainy but the temperature had plummeted during the night to just a tad above freezing laurie had taken her winter coat out of its mothballed storage container for the occasion standing on the corner laurie vainly waved at the few cabs that streaked past but all were occupied just when she had resigned herself to walking to the office a vacant taxi pulled up to the curb she had to leap away to keep from being splashed having finally made significant progress on her paperwork the day before laurie was not planning on working that sunday yet she felt compelled to go to the office because of a superstitious feeling it was her idea that if shed made the effort to go there wouldnt be any additional cases in her series stomping off the moisture in the reception area laurie unbuttoned her coat and walked through to the id office no one was there and nor was there a schedule for the days cases but the coffee machine was on and someone had made coffee laurie helped herself to a cup leaving her coat and umbrella laurie descended a floor to the morgue and walked back to the main autopsy room the lights were on so she could tell it was in use the door creaked open to her touch only two of the eight tables were occupied laurie tried to recognize who was working with the goggles face masks and hoods it was difficult just when she was about to go into the locker room to change someone noticed her and leaving the autopsy table came over to speak with her it was sal dambrosio one of the techs what the hell are you doing here sal asked i live here laurie said with a laugh which doctor is on today plodgett sal said whats the problem no problem laurie said whos at the other table dr besserman sal said paul called him we got a lot of cases today more than usual laurie nodded to sal then called over to paul hey paul anything interesting id say so he replied i was going to call you later we got two more overdoses that can go into your series laurie felt her heart sink so much for superstition ill be right in she said once she had changed into her full protective gear laurie went to pauls table he was working on the remains of a very young woman how old laurie asked twenty paul said college student at columbia how awful laurie said this would be by far the youngest in her series thats not the worst of it paul said how so laurie asked dr besserman is doing the boyfriend paul said hes a thirtyoneyearold banker thats why i thought youd be interested apparently they injected themselves simultaneously oh no laurie felt almost dizzy as a double tragedy the incident was doubly poignant she moved over to dr bessermans table he was just lifting the internal organs out of the body laurie looked at the dead mans face there was a large discolored bruise on his forehead he convulsed dr besserman said noticing lauries curiosity must have hit his face on the floor or it could have happened in the refrigerator laurie switched her attention to dr besserman this man was found in a refrigerator she asked thats what the tour doctor told us dr besserman said thats the third one then laurie said where was the girlfriend she was in the bedroom on the floor dr besserman said find anything special on the post so far laurie asked pretty routine for an overdose dr besserman said laurie stepped back to pauls table and watched him slice off several samples of liver what kinds of specimens have you been sending up to toxicology on these cases he asked when he noticed laurie by his side liver kidney and brain laurie said in addition to the usual fluid samples thats what i thought paul said have you found anything remarkable on this case laurie asked not so far certainly consistent with a cocaine overdose no surprises but we have the head to go i hear you have a lot of cases today since im already here would you like me to help its not necessary paul said especially since dr bessermans come in are you sure laurie asked thanks for the offer but im sure going through all the paperwork on the cases laurie got the names of the victims as well as the males address it had been at the males apartment that the bodies had been found then she went back to the locker room and changed she was extremely disheartened there was something particularly tragic about two young lovers losing their lives so senselessly she began to regret anew binghams decision not to inform the public about the potentially tainted drug if he had those two people might be alive today with sudden resolve laurie decided to call bingham if this romeo and julietstyle tragedy didnt wake him up to the fact that they were potentially facing a major publichealth crisis nothing would upstairs in her office she found binghams home number in the directory taking a deep breath she placed the call bingham himself answered this is sunday morning he said crisply when he understood who was on the other end of the line laurie immediately told him about the two new overdose cases once she had finished she was met with silence then bingham said sharply i fail to see why you felt compelled to call me about this on a sunday if we had made a statement this couple might be alive today laurie said obviously we cant help them but perhaps we can help others with these cases i now have sixteen in my series look montgomery im not even convinced you have a bona fide series so stop throwing the term around as if its an a priori assumption maybe you have a series maybe you dont i appreciate your good intentions but have you come up with any proof has the lab come up with a contaminant not yet laurie admitted then as far as im concerned this conversation is just a rehash of the one we had the other day but im convinced we can save lives i know you are bingham said but im also convinced it is not in the best interests of the department and for the city as a whole the media will want names and we are not prepared to give names not with the pressure were under and its more than duncan andrews family whod like to keep these cases out of the headlines but i am meeting with the commissioner of health this week in all fairness to you i will present the issue to him and he can decide but dr bingham laurie protested thats enough laurie goodbye laurie looked at the phone with frustration bingham had hung up on her she slammed the phone down in anger the idea that he would take the problem to the commissioner was not a consolation to her as far as she was concerned it was merely shuffling the problem from one political hack to another she also felt bingham had been closest to the real reason for keeping a lid on the series when he mentioned duncan andrews bingham was still worried about the political ramifications of going public with a connected name laurie decided to give jordan a call since he didnt work for the city and was beholden to no special group or interest maybe he could speak out laurie wasnt sure hed be inclined to get involved but she decided to chance it jordan picked up on the second ring but sounded out of breath when he answered im on my exercise bike he explained when laurie asked good to hear from you so soon i hope you had a nice evening i know i did it was lovely she said thank you again it had been a nice evening and laurie had been relieved when jordan didnt pressure her after that brief aborted kiss laurie filled jordan in on the latest additions to her overdose series to her relief he sounded genuinely upset now i have a question for you laurie said and a favor to ask the medical examiner is not willing to make a public statement about my series i want it made because im convinced it will save lives do you know any other way to get this information to the public and might you be willing to put the word out wait a second jordan said im an ophthalmologist this isnt exactly my area of expertise you want me to make some kind of statement about a series of drug deaths no way its inappropriate laurie sighed would you think about it i dont need to think about it jordan said this is the type of thing i have to stay clear of pure and simple remember you and i are coming at medicine from the opposite ends of the spectrum im in the clinical end ive got a very high profile clientele im sure they wouldnt want to hear im mixed up in any drug affair no matter which side of the law im on theyd start to wonder about me and before i knew what was happening theyd be going to someone else ophthalmology is extremely competitive these days laurie didnt even try to argue she understood more clearly than ever jordan scheffield was not about to help her she merely thanked him for his time and hung up there was only one other person to whom laurie could turn although she was far from optimistic about the reception shed meet there she swallowed her pride and called lou since she didnt have his home number she called police headquarters to leave word for him to her surprise he returned her call almost immediately hey how are you he sounded pleased to have heard from her i knew i should have given you my home number here let me give it to you now laurie got a pen and paper and jotted the number down im glad you called lou continued i got my kids here you want to come down to soho for some brunch another time laurie said ive got a problem uhoh lou said what is it laurie told him about the double overdose and her conversations with bingham and jordan nice to know im at the bottom of your list lou commented please lou laurie said dont play wounded im desperate laurie why are you doing this to me lou complained id love to help you but this is not a police matter i told you that the last time you brought it up i can understand your problem but i dont have any suggestions and if you want my opinion its not really your problem youve done what you could and youve informed your superiors thats all you can expect from yourself my conscience wont let me leave it at that laurie said not while people are dying what did big bucks jordan say lou asked he was afraid his patients wouldnt understand laurie said he said he couldnt help me thats a pretty flimsy excuse lou said im surprised hes not falling all over himself trying to prove what a man he is by helping his damsel in distress im not his damsel laurie said even as the words came out of her mouth she knew she shouldnt be rising to his bait not always charming that prince of yours eh laurie hung up on lou the man could be so infuriatingly rude she got her things together including the address of the doubleoverdose scene and was ready to go when the phone started to ring figuring it was lou she avoided answering the phone rang about twenty times before it stopped just as she reached the elevator laurie hailed a cab and headed for the address on sutton place south when she arrived she flashed her medical examiners badge at the doorman on duty and asked to see the superintendent the doorman readily obliged her carl will be down in a minute he lives right here in the building so hes almost always available a diminutive man with dark hair and a thin black moustache soon appeared and introduced himself as carl bethany i guess youre here about george vandeusen carl asked laurie nodded if it wouldnt be too much trouble id like to view the scene where the bodies were found is the apartment empty oh yeah carl said they took the bodies out last night thats not what i meant laurie said i want to be sure there arent any family members up there i dont want to disturb anyone carl said hed have to check he conferred with the doorman then returned to assure laurie that the vandeusen apartment was vacant then he took her up to the tenth floor and unlocked the door for her stepping aside he let laurie go in first nobodys cleaned in here yet carl said as he followed laurie through the door laurie noticed a musty almost fishy smell as she entered the apartment laurie surveyed the living room an antique butlersstyle coffee table with only three legs lay at an odd angle the fourth leg was on the floor just by it magazines and books were haphazardly scattered across the carpet it looked as if they had been spilled when the leg was broken a crystal lamp lay smashed between an end table and the couch a large oldmaster oil painting hung askew on the wall a lot of damage laurie said in her minds eye she tried to imagine the kind of seizure that could have resulted in such breakage thats just the way it looked when i came in here last night carl said laurie started toward the kitchen who found the bodies she said i did carl said laurie was surprised what brought you in the night doorman called me carl said laurie was going to ask about him next she hoped to speak to him too and said so why did he call you she asked he said another tenant had called him to report strange noises coming from f the caller was worried that someone was hurt what did you do laurie asked i came up here and rang the bell carl said i rang it several times then i used my passkey thats when i found the bodies laurie blinked her mind was mulling over this scenario and something wasnt making sense she could remember reading an hour earlier in the investigators report that both bodies had significant rigor mortis even the woman in the bedroom that meant that they had to have been dead at least several hours you said the tenant called down to the doorman because sounds were coming out of the apartment at that time i mean at the same time he was calling i think so carl said laurie began to wonder how the other victims in her series had been found duncan andrews and julia myerholtz had been found by their lovers but what about the others laurie had never considered the question before now now that she thought about it she did recognize one strange thing all the victims had been found relatively quickly their bodies were discovered in a matter of hours whereas in many cases single people who unexpectedly died in their apartments werent found for days sometimes only after the smell of decay had alerted neighbors the scene in the kitchen was all too familiar the contents of the refrigerator had been strewn helterskelter across the floor the refrigerator door was still ajar laurie noticed that the smell of spoiled milk and rotting vegetables permeated the air someone is going to have to clean this up carl said laurie nodded leaving the kitchen she looked into the bedroom again she started to feel incredibly sad seeing the apartment where these people had lived made them all the more real it was easier to remain dispassionate down at the medical examiners office than it was in the deceaseds home laurie felt her eyes well with tears is there anything else i can do to help carl asked id like to speak to that night doorman she said pulling herself together thats easily arranged carl said anything else yes laurie said gazing around the apartment maybe you shouldnt let anyone clean this place up just yet let me talk to the police they were here last night too carl said i know laurie said but im thinking of someone a little higher on the ladder in the homicide department downstairs carl got the night doormans phone number for laurie the mans name was scott maybrie he even offered to allow laurie the use of his phone if she wanted to call immediately wouldnt he be asleep at this time laurie asked it wont hurt him carl insisted carls tiny apartment was on the first floor and faced the street in contrast to vandeusens which had faced out over the east river carl allowed laurie to sit at his cluttered desk amid notes to plumbers and electricians being particularly helpful carl even dialed scotts number and handed laurie the phone as shed feared the mans voice was hoarse with sleep when he answered laurie identified herself and explained that carl had suggested she call i wanted to ask you a few questions about the vandeusen case she continued did you see mr vandeusen or his girlfriend last night no i didnt scott said carl told me that one of the other tenants called you about noises coming from the vandeusen apartment what time was that around twothirty three oclock scott said which tenant called laurie asked i dont know scott admitted he didnt say was it one of the immediate neighbors laurie suggested i really dont know i didnt recognize the voice but thats not unusual what did he say exactly laurie asked he said there were strange noises coming from f scott said he was concerned someone might be hurt did he say they were occurring at the moment he was calling laurie asked or did he say they had happened sometime in the past i think he said they were happening right then scott said did you notice two men leaving the building during the night laurie asked two men youd never seen before that i couldnt say scott said people come and go all night to be honest i dont pay much attention to people leaving its the ones who are arriving im most concerned about laurie thanked scott and apologized for disturbing him then turning to carl she asked if she could speak to the doorman whod been on duty earlier in the evening absolutely carl said that would have been clark davenport again carl dialed the number then handed laurie the phone laurie went through the same explanation when clark picked up did you see mr george vandeusen come into his apartment last night laurie asked after the introductions yes clark said he came in around ten with his girlfriend was he behaving normally laurie asked normal for a saturday night clark said he was a little tipsy his girlfriend had to give him a little support but they seemed to be having a good time if thats what you mean were they alone laurie asked yup clark said their guests didnt come in for about half an hour they had a party laurie asked with surprise i wouldnt call it a party clark said just two men a tall guy and a shorter one can you remember what these men looked like laurie asked clark had to think about it the tall one had bad skin like hed had acne as a kid did they give their names laurie asked she could feel her pulse quicken yeah of course they gave their names clark said how else was i to call up and ask mr vandeusen if they were expected otherwise i wouldnt have let them in what were the names laurie asked shed taken out a pen and a piece of paper i dont remember clark said on a saturday night i have a hundred people coming in laurie was disappointed to be so tantalizingly close to a real breakthrough although she wasnt able to get the names this was progress yet again two men were spotted at the scene of the od shortly before the deaths occurred did you see these men come out again laurie asked nope clark said of course i went off duty not too long after they arrived laurie thanked clark before hanging up she also thanked carl profusely for all his help before she left the building even though it was ugly and quite cold laurie decided to huddle under her umbrella and walk for a bit before catching a cab home she wanted to mill over what she had learned and what it might mean for the case as a whole by far the most significant discovery was the surfacing of these two mystery men laurie wondered if the pair was involved in the drug trade she wondered if this revelation would be enough to get the police narcotics squad interested she began to hope lou might feel differently now that more similarities between the cases were falling into place laurie wished she could speak to the tenant who complained of noise what did he hear and when did he hear it when it began to rain in earnest laurie hailed a cab and headed for home over a salad and some hot tea she got out all the material she had concerning her series and made a new sheet listing the cases in order she started two columns beside the column of names found by two men at scene she filled in what answers she had the rest of the afternoon she devoted to filling in the blanks it meant a lot of legwork but laurie knew she had to be thorough if she was ever going to get anyone to believe in her theory by late afternoon laurie was convinced her efforts had been worthwhile in each of the scenes the bodies had been discovered by a doorman or superintendent investigating after a neighboring tenants complaint of strange noises coming from the deceaseds apartment with the information on her sheet nearly complete laurie headed home convinced more than ever that there was something sinister afoot there were too many coincidences now if only she could persuade someone in a position to do something about it by the time she got home it was dark she wasnt sure what her next move should be out of curiosity laurie opened the sunday times to see if the media had picked up the story of the banker and the columbia coed whod odd she found a brief mention of the deaths in the depths of the second section the article made the deaths sound like just another couple of overdoses and made no mention of other demographically similar occurrences in the recent past another day another opportunity to alert the public lost laurie decided to try lous home number she wasnt sure she had enough to convince him of anything but she was eager to give him an update she got lous answering machine but decided against leaving a message hanging up the phone laurie pondered the thought of calling bingham believing it would be an exercise in futility at best and might get her fired at worst she gave up the idea he clearly stated that he intended to do nothing at least not until he spoke with the commissioner of health lauries eyes moved from the phone to the open newspaper slowly the idea of leaking the story herself began to occur to her shed had a bad experience with giving her opinion to bob talbot the last time but in all fairness to him shed not specifically said her remarks were confidential with that thought in mind she got out her address book to see if she had his number she did and she gave him a call well well he said when he heard it was laurie i was afraid i was never going to hear from you again i didnt know what else to do beyond apologizing i overreacted laurie admitted im sorry i never got back to you it was just that i got an awful chewing out by the chief over your story i apologize again bob said whats up this might surprise you laurie said but i may have a story for you a big story im all ears bob said i dont want to talk on the phone laurie said fine by me bob said how about i buy you dinner youre on laurie said they met at p j clarks on the corner of fiftyfifth and third they were lucky to get a table on a rainy sunday evening especially one by the far wall where they could talk above the usual hubbub after a cleareyed irish waiter took their order and slid two brimming draughts in front of them laurie began first im not sure im doing the right thing talking to you but im desperate i feel i have to do something bob nodded i want you to promise me you will not use my name scouts honor bob said holding up two fingers then he took out a note pad and a pencil i dont know where to begin laurie said she was hesitant at first but once she began explaining recent events she warmed up a bit she began with duncan andrews and her first suspicions and took him through to the double death of george vandeusen and carol palmer she emphasized that all the victims were single educated successful people with no hint of drug use or illegal activity in their pasts she also mentioned the pressure brought to bear on the medical examiner to keep a lid on the duncan andrews case in particular in a way its too bad he was the first i think part of the reason bingham keeps rejecting my series theory is because the series began with him this is unbelievable bob said when laurie had to pause with the arrival of their food i havent seen anything about this in the media at all nothing zip there was a mention of the double death in this mornings times laurie said but it was in the second section it got barely a squib but youre right theres been no mention of the other cases what a scoop bob marveled he glanced at his watch ill have to move on it if im going to make tomorrow mornings paper but theres more laurie said she went on to tell him that the cocaine involved was coming from one source was probably contaminated with a trace of a very lethal compound on top of being extremely potent and was probably being distributed by a single pusher who somehow came in contact with upscale young people well thats not exactly true laurie corrected herself it might be two people on most of the cases that ive investigated two men have been seen going into the victims apartment i wonder why two bob asked i havent the slightest idea laurie admitted there are a lot of mysteries about this whole affair is that it bob questioned he was eager to leave he hadnt even touched his food no thats not all laurie said ive begun to get the feeling that these deaths are not accidental that they are deliberate in other words they are homicides this keeps getting better and better bob said all of the bodies were found shortly after death laurie said that in itself is unusual single people who die alone are usually not found for days in all the cases ive investigated a phone call led to the discovery of the body in two cases the victims called their significant other beforehand in all the others an anonymous tenant in the victims building called the doorman to complain about strange sounds emanating from the victims apartment but heres the catch based on medical evidence these complaints about noise came several hours after the time of death my god bob said he looked up at laurie what about the police he asked why havent they gotten involved in all this nobody buys my series theory the police arent the least suspicious they consider these cases to be simple drug overdoses and what about dr harold bingham what has he done nothing so far laurie said my guess is he wants to steer clear of such a potential hot potato duncan andrews fathers running for office his people have really been leaning on the mayor whos been leaning on bingham he did say hed talk to the commissioner of health about it if these are homicides then were talking about some new kind of serial killer bob said this is hot stuff i think its important for the public to be warned if this can save one life its worth it thats why i called you weve got to put the word out about the contaminant in this drug is that it then bob asked i think so laurie said if i think of anything i forgot to mention ill call you great bob said getting to his feet sorry to run but if im going to get this into tomorrow mornings paper ive got to go directly to my editor laurie watched bob weave through the crowd of people waiting for tables looking down at her veal swimming in a pool of oil she decided she wasnt hungry herself she was about to get up when their irish waiter reappeared with the bill laurie looked after bob but he was long gone so much for his offer to pick up the tab what time is it angelo asked seventhirty tony said checking the rolex hed picked up at the goldburg place they were parked on fifth avenue just north of the seventysecond street entrance to central parks east drive they were on the park side of the avenue but had a good view of the entrance to the apartment house they were interested in must take this kendall fletcher a long time to put on his jogging shorts angelo said he told me he was going jogging tony said defensively you should have called him yourself if you werent going to believe me here comes somebody angelo said what do you think could that be kendall fletcher banker he doesnt look like a banker in that getup tony said i dont understand this jogging stuff whod want to dress up in peter pan tights and run around the park at night its like asking to be mugged i think its him angelo said looks like the right age how old did you say kendall was tony took a typed sheet of paper out of the glove compartment using the map light he searched for the kendall fletcher entry then read kendall fletcher age thirtyfour vice president citicorp that must be him angelo said he started the car tony put the list back in the glove compartment kendall fletcher had come out of his apartment building dressed to run he crossed fifth avenue at seventysecond street and began jogging as soon as he reached the park angelo headed for the east drive he and tony kept their eyes glued to kendall as he made his way down the seventysecond street transverse to the drive where he turned north into the jogging lane angelo motored about a hundred yards past the man then pulled over to the side of the road with the blinkers on he and tony got out kendall wasnt the only runner out on the drive as angelo and tony watched him approach a half dozen other runners passed by i just dont get these people tony said with wonderment just before kendall reached them angelo and tony stepped into the jogging lane kendall fletcher angelo asked kendall came to a stop yes he said police angelo said he flashed his ozone park police badge tony flashed his hate to bother you while youre running angelo continued but we want to talk to you downtown were involved with a citicorp investigation this is not a good time kendall said his voice was firm but his eyes gave him away he was definitely nervous i dont think you want to make a scene angelo said we wont take much of your time we wanted to talk with the vice presidents before we convened a grand jury im in my jogging shorts kendall said no problem angelo said well be happy to give you a lift home and let you change you can be out jogging in another hour if you cooperate kendall appeared wary but finally agreed he climbed into angelos car and they drove back to his building on fifth avenue leaving a card on the dash angelo and tony got out of the car with kendall and followed him into the building tony was carrying the old black leather doctors bag they walked as a group past the doorman who ignored them got on the elevator and went up to the twentyfifth floor no one spoke as kendall opened his apartment door went in and held the door for angelo and tony tony nodded several times as he viewed the apartment nice layout he said he put down his doctors bag on the coffee table can i get you men anything while i change kendall asked he motioned toward the bar nah tony said you understand were on duty we dont drink while we work angelo checked out the apartment quickly while tony watched kendall kendall in turn watched angelo with confused curiosity what are you looking for kendall called after angelo make sure there arent any other people up here angelo said as he returned from glancing into the kitchen he then disappeared back toward the master suite hey kendall called you cant search my apartment he turned to tony you have to have a warrant for this a warrant tony questioned oh yeah the warrant we always forget the warrant angelo returned id like to see your identification again kendall said this is an outrage angelo reached into his brioni jacket and withdrew his walther pistol heres mine he said he motioned for kendall to sit down tony snapped open the latches on his doctors bag what is this a robbery kendall asked staring at the gun he sat down help yourself take what you want im the candy man tony said he lifted a long clear plastic bag and a small cylinder out of the bag angelo moved behind kendall gun in hand kendall watched nervously as tony used the cylinder to inflate the plastic bag with a gas that was obviously lighter than air once the bag was completely full he occluded the end and put the cylinder back in the doctors bag with the plastic bag in hand he approached kendall whats going on kendall demanded were here to offer you a wild trip tony said with a smile im not interested in any trip kendall said take what you want and get out of here tony opened the base of the plastic bag so that it looked more like a miniature transparent hot air balloon then holding two sides of the base he crammed it down over the top of kendalls head the unexpectedness of the move caught kendall by surprise he reached up and grabbed tonys forearms and halted the bag at his shoulders as he tried to stand up angelo threw the arm with the gun around his neck angelos other hand grabbed kendalls right wrist in an attempt to free its grip on tonys forearm for a second the three people struggled against one another kendall terrified at this point opened his mouth and bit angelos forearm through the plastic bag ahhhh angelo cried feeling kendalls incisors break his skin angelo let go of kendalls arm and was about to punch kendall in the face inside the plastic bag when he saw it wasnt necessary after having taken only a few breaths in the plastic bag kendalls eyelids sagged and his whole body including his jaws went limp while tony followed kendall to the floor maintaining the plastic bag in position angelo got his arm back quickly angelo undid his cuff link and pulled up his sleeve on the inside of his forearm about three inches from his elbow was an elliptical ring of puncture wounds corresponding to kendalls dentition a few of them were bleeding the bastard bit me angelo said indignantly he put his gun into its shoulder holster in this line of work you never know what the hell is going to happen tony stood up and went back to the doctors bag every time we use that gas im amazed he said old doc travino sure knows his stuff he got out a syringe and a piece of rubber tubing returning to kendall he used the rubber tubing as a tourniquet look at these veins will you he said god they look like cigars no way we can miss these you want to do it or should i you do it angelo said but you better get that bag off his head we dont want another robert evanstype screwup right tony said he worked the plastic bag free then shook it out ugh he said i hate that sweet smell give him the coke will you angelo said hell wake up before youre finished tony took the needle and pushed it into one of kendalls prominent veins there what did i tell you he said pleased to have scored on his first try he pulled off the tourniquet then pushed in the plunger emptying the syringe into kendalls arm tony left the used syringe on the coffee table and put the rest of his paraphernalia back into the doctors bag at the same time he took out a small glassine envelope going back to kendall he poured a small amount of the white powder into kendalls nostrils then he dabbed a little onto his thumb and snorted it i love leftovers he said with glee stay away from that stuff angelo commanded couldnt resist tony said he put the glassine envelope next to the used syringe what do you think into the fridge with him lets skip it angelo said i was talking with doc about it he says that as long as the bodys not out longer than twelve hours were okay and the way weve been working this everybodys been found way before twelve hours tony looked around did i get everything looks good angelo said lets sit down and see how kendall likes his trip tony sat on the couch while angelo sat in the armchair that kendall had been occupying nice apartment tony said what do you say we glance around a little to see if theres anything we might want to pick up how many times do i have to tell you we dont take anything when we do these drug trips such a waste tony said wistfully as he surveyed the room a few minutes later kendall stirred and smacked his lips moaning he rolled over on his stomach hey kendall baby tony called how you feel talk to me kendall pushed himself up to a sitting position he had a blank expression on his pale face how is it tony asked with as much snow as you got coursing through those veins you must be in heaven without any warning kendall vomited onto the rug oh god tony cried as he scrambled out of the way this is disgusting kendall coughed violently then looked up at tony and angelo his eyes were glazed he looked confused how do you feel angelo asked kendalls mouth tried to form words but the man seemed utterly incapable of them suddenly his eyes rolled back so that only the whites were showing and he began to convulse thats our cue angelo said lets get out of here tony picked up the doctors bag and followed angelo to the door angelo peered through the peephole with no one in sight he opened the door and stuck his head out hallways clear he said come on they exited the apartment quickly and ran to the stairwell descending a single floor they relaxed and waited for the elevator are you hungry tony asked a little angelo said to avoid being seen by the doorman they got off the elevator on the first floor and returned to the stairwell they exited the building via the service entrance arriving at the car angelo stopped he was astonished look at this he said i cant believe it we got a ticket some nerve i hope the cop who gave us this never tries to bring his car out to ozone park so whats next tony asked as soon as they were seated in the car another job or dinner i dont know what you like more said angelo shaking his head whacking or eating tony smiled depends on my mood i think we should do the other hit angelo said then when we stop to eat it will be just about the right time to call back here to tell the doorman about noises coming from g lets do it tony said he sat back with his snort of cocaine he felt great in fact he felt like he could do anything in the world as angelo pulled away from the curb franco ponti put his own car in gear he allowed several cars to pass before pulling out into fifth avenue traffic hed watched while angelo and tony picked the jogger up in the park and escorted him back to his apartment although he hadnt been privy to what had transpired in the apartment he thought he could guess but the real question wasnt what had happened but why am monday manhattan the alarm went off and laurie went through her usual routine of rapidly fumbling with it to get it turned off as she set the clock on her windowsill she realized that for the first time in many days shed not awakened with the anxiety of having had her recurrent nightmare apparently her conscience had been temporarily appeased by her visit with bob talbot but as laurie slipped into her sheepskin slippers and turned on the bedroom tv to the local news she began to feel progressively nervous about what the day would bring visávis dr bingham she was particularly anxious to get a copy of the paper to see bob talbots piece and how prominently it would be featured it was quite apparent bingham would suspect her as the source what would she say if he asked her directly she doubted she would be able to lie to the chief pausing in the kitchen on her way to the bathroom laurie hazarded a glance out at the tiny wedge of sky she could see from her window the dark swirling clouds suggested that the weather had not improved since yesterday later after her shower and with a second cup of coffee balanced on the edge of the sink laurie started applying her makeup all the time going over various scenarios of what she might say to dr bingham in the background she heard the familiar theme music to good morning america as the show came on the air a little later she heard the equally familiar happy voices of the hosts as laurie was about to apply her lipstick she heard mike schneider come on and talk about more weapons of mass destruction that a un team had found in iraq laurie had her upper lip done and was about to do the lower when she flinched shed heard mike schneider say a surprising name it was her name laurie dashed into the bedroom and turned up the volume her expression changed from disbelief to horror as schneider gave an overview of her overdose series starting with duncan andrews son of senatorial hopeful clayton andrews he went on to cite three cases unfamiliar to laurie kendall fletcher stephanie haberlin and yvonne andre he mentioned the double overdose at george vandeusens most disturbing of all he repeated lauries name saying that according to dr laurie montgomery there was reason to believe these deaths were deliberate homicides not accidental overdoses and that the whole affair potentially represented an extraordinary coverup on the part of the new york city police and the medical examiners office as soon as mike schneider moved on to other news laurie dashed into her living room and literally threw papers aside searching for her address book finding bob talbots number she punched it into the telephone what did you do to me she screamed as soon as he picked up the phone laurie im sorry bob said you must believe me it wasnt my fault to get the story into the morning paper my editor had me write up a memo to him i wrote that your name was not to be included but he stole the story from me it was totally unethical in every regard laurie hung up the phone in disgust her heart was pounding this was a disaster a catastrophe shed surely be out of a job there was no question of binghams response now hed be furious and after this where would she ever find a job in forensics laurie walked over to the window and gazed out at the sad refusestrewn warren of neglected backyards she was so distressed she felt numb she couldnt even cry but as she stood there looking at the depressing vista her emotions began to change after all her actions had come from a need to follow her conscience and bingham had admitted during her call to him yesterday that he knew her intentions were good lauries initial fear of total calamity mellowed all at once she didnt think she would be terminated reprimanded yes suspended possibly but fired no turning from the window she went back into the bathroom to finish her makeup the more she thought about the situation the calmer she became she could see herself explaining that she had been true to her sense of responsibility as a person as well as a medical examiner returning to the bedroom for the last time laurie completed her dressing then gathering her things she left her apartment as she was standing at the elevator awaiting its arrival she noticed a newspaper in front of a neighbors door stepping over to it she slipped it from its plastic cover there on the front page as a second headline was the story of her overdose series there was even an old picture of her taken in medical school laurie wondered where the picture had come from opening the paper to the proper page laurie read the first few paragraphs which were a repeat of mike schneiders summary but true to tabloidstyle journalism there was much more lurid detail including reference to a number of victims having been stuffed into refrigerators laurie wondered where that distortion had come from she certainly hadnt mentioned anything like that to bob talbot there was also more emphasis on the alleged coverup making it sound far more sinister than mike schneider had hearing the elevator arrive behind her laurie dropped the newspaper in front of the proper door and hurried back before the elevator left when she was halfway into the car she heard debra englers hoarse voice you shouldnt read other peoples papers the woman said for a moment laurie stood holding the insistent elevator door from closing she wanted to turn around and bash her umbrella against debras door to frighten the woman but she controlled herself and finally boarded as she descended lauries calmness crumbled and was replaced by apprehension of meeting with bingham laurie dreaded confrontations she had never been good at them paul cerino was hunched over his favorite meal of the day breakfast he was enjoying a hearty feast of eggs over easy pork sausage and biscuits he was still wearing the same metal patch over his eye but he was feeling terrific gregory and steven were momentarily quiet eating their own choice of sugarcoated breakfast cereal which they had selected from a bewildering choice of single serving boxes each had his own empty box in front of him which he was studying intently gloria had just sat down after having retrieved the newspaper from the front stoop read me about yesterdays giants and steelers game paul mumbled with his mouth full oh my gloria said staring at the front page whats the matter paul asked theres a story about a bunch of drug deaths of wealthy and educated young people gloria said says here they think they were murders paul choked violently spraying most of the food that hed had in his mouth out over the table daaad gregory whined a layer of partially chewed egg and sausage had settled on the surface of his sugar pops paul are you all right gloria questioned with alarm paul held up a hand to indicate he was fine his face had become as red as the heeling patches of skin on his cheeks with his other hand he picked up his orange juice and took a drink i cant eat this gregory said looking at his cereal its going to make me puke i cant either steven said who tended to do just about everything gregory did get yourselves clean bowls gloria directed then pick another cereal better read me that article about the drug deaths paul said with a hoarse voice gloria read the whole article straight through when she was finished paul headed for his den arent you going to finish your breakfast gloria called after him in a minute paul said he closed the door of the den behind him and pressed the button on his automatic dialer that would connect him to angelo who the hell is this angelo muttered sleepily did you read this mornings paper how am i going to read this mornings paper ive been sleeping i was out doing you know what until all hours i want you tony and that harebrained pillpusher travino over here this morning paul said and read the paper on the way we got a problem franco marie dominick said with surprise isnt this a little early for you i have to talk with vinnie franco said vinnies still sleeping marie said i figured he was but if you could please wake him up are you sure im sure franco said well come on in then marie said as she opened the door wide franco stepped inside go on into the kitchen marie said theres coffee already made marie disappeared up a short flight of steps while franco wandered into the kitchen vinnies little boy vinnie junior was seated at the table the sixyearold was busy slapping a short stack of pancakes with the back side of a spoon his older sister roslyn age eleven was at the stove poised to turn over the next batch of flapjacks franco poured himself a cup of coffee then he wandered into the living room and sat on a white leather sofa and gazed at the new peppermintcolored shag carpet he was amazed he didnt think you could buy shag carpet anymore this better be good vinnie thundered as he came into the room he was dressed in a silky paisley print robe his hair which was normally immaculately slicked back was virtually standing on end instead of explaining franco handed vinnie the paper vinnie grabbed it and sat down so what am i supposed to be looking at he growled read the article about drug deaths franco said vinnies forehead wrinkled as he read he was silent for about five minutes franco sipped his coffee so what the hell vinnie said looking up he slapped the paper with the back of his hand what the hell are you doing waking me up for this see those names at the end of the list fletcher and the other ones i followed angelo and tony last night they whacked those people my guess is that theyve whacked the whole bunch but why vinnie demanded why with cocaine they giving the stuff away i still dont know why franco admitted i dont even know if angelo and tony are on their own or taking orders from cerino theyre taking orders vinnie said theyre too stupid to do anything on their own god this is a disaster the whole city is going to be crawling with feds and narcs on top of normal everyday cops what the hell is cerino doing has he gone crazy i dont understand i dont either franco said but i just established a connection that goes through a couple of people who know tony someone will get in touch with you we got to do something vinnie said shaking his head we cant let this go on its hard to know what to do until we know what cerinos up to franco said give me one more day only one vinnie said after that we move laurie was filled with dread as she faced her office building what a difference a day made yesterday and the day before she had breezed in and out like she owned the place now she was afraid to cross the threshold but she knew it was what she had to do the calmness shed felt in her apartment had vanished as she drew closer she saw that a swarm of restless reporters had already descended on the place to get the storyher story her thoughts had been so focused on bingham she hadnt been thinking of them there were at least as many there now as there had been for the preppy murder ii case maybe more might as well get it over with she decided entering the reception area she was instantly recognized microphones were pushed in her face along with a cacophony of questions and the pop of camera flashes laurie pushed her way through to the inner door without a word a uniformed security man checked her photo identification before admitting her the reporters were unable to pursue her beyond that door trying to maintain her composure laurie went directly to the id office vinnie was there reading his paper calvin was there too laurie gazed into the black mans face he stared back at her hiding his feelings his eyes were like black marbles perfectly framed by his wirerimmed glasses dr bingham wants to see you calvin said flatly unfortunately he cant see you until he finishes dealing with these reporters hell call you in your office laurie would have liked to try to explain but there wasnt much she could say and calvin didnt seem interested he returned to whatever work he was doing when laurie had entered laurie decided to check the autopsy schedule before going to her office her name was not on the list she noticed the three names shed read in the newspaper kendall fletcher stephanie haberlin and yvonne andre apparently they were new cases that fit her series laurie approached calvin i guess you know id like to do the posts on these overdoses she said calvin looked up from his work personally i dont care what your preferences are he said the fact of the matter is that you are to go to your office and wait for dr binghams call embarrassed at this obvious snub laurie glanced at vinnie but he seemed riveted to the sports page as usual if hed heard the exchange he wasnt about to show it feeling like a child banished to her room laurie went up to her office deciding she might as well try to get some work done she sat at her desk and pulled out some folders she was just about to start when she sensed someones presence she looked to the open doorway and saw a rumpled lou soldano he didnt look happy i personally want to thank you for making my life miserable lou said not that i wasnt under enough stress from the commissioner before your little revelation to the press but this just puts the icing on the cake they distorted what i said laurie said oh sure lou said with sarcasm i never said anything about a coverup laurie said all i said was the police didnt believe the affair involved them thats essentially what you told me my own little mischiefmaker its like your call to internal affairs wasnt enough you had to be sure to really get me that call was deserved laurie snapped and talk about calls you couldnt have been much ruder when i called you yesterday ive had quite enough of your glib sarcasm laurie and lou glared at each other until lou broke off and averted his gaze he stepped into the room and sat down in his usual chair the comment on the phone was juvenile he admitted i knew it the second it came out of my mouth im sorry the problem is that im jealous of the guy there i said it whatever is left of my ego you can kick around as much as you like lauries anger subsided she let her head fall into her hands her elbows on the desk and im sorry if i caused you any trouble at work she said rubbing her eyes i certainly didnt mean to but you know how desperate id become i had to do something in order to live with myself i couldnt see any more of these people die without trying something did you have any idea of the upheaval youd be causing lou asked and the effects i still dont know completely laurie said i knew there would be some fallout from the story otherwise i wouldnt have given it but i didnt know the extent and i didnt know theyd distort the facts on top of that they reneged on my condition of remaining anonymous i havent seen my chief yet but from the way the deputy chief spoke with me its not going to be a pleasant talk i could even be fired hell be mad lou said but he wont fire you hes got to respect your aims if not your methods but hes going to take a lot of heat for this he wont be a happy man laurie nodded she appreciated the reassurance shed not be terminated well id love to stick around to see how this all turns out but ive got to go my office is in an uproar too i just had to come down here and get it off my chest im glad i did good luck with your boss thanks laurie said and im glad you came too after lou left laurie put in a call to jordan she could have used some moral support but he was in surgery and wasnt expected back in the office until much later laurie was just settling down to work again when there was a knock on her door she looked up to see peter letterman standing before her dr montgomery peter said tentatively laurie welcomed him in and offered him a seat thank you peter said he sat and gazed around the office nice place you think so laurie questioned better than my broom closet peter said anyway i wont take too much of your time i just wanted to let you know that ive finally picked up a trace contaminant or at least a foreign compound in the sample you sent up from randall thatcher really laurie said with interest what did you find ethylene peter said it was only a trace since the gas is so volatile and i havent been able to isolate it from two other cases that i tested ethylene laurie questioned thats odd i dont know what to make of that ive heard of using ether in free basing but not ethylene free basing is associated with smoking cocaine peter said not taking the drug iv the way the folks in your series did besides even in smoking ether is only used as a solvent for extraction so i dont know why ethylene turned up it could even be a laboratory error for all i know but since youve been so interested in the possibility of a contaminant i wanted to let you know right away if ethylene is so volatile laurie said why dont you look for it in the samples from robert evans since you determined hed died so quickly maybe there would be more of a chance to find it if it had been involved thats a good idea peter said ill give it a whirl laurie kept her eyes on the empty doorway for a moment after peter had left ethylene was hardly the kind of contaminant shed expected she thought that they might find some exotic centralnervoussystem stimulant like strychnine or nicotine laurie wasnt familiar with ethylene shed have to do a little research glancing through the pharmacology book she and riva kept in the office laurie didnt find much on the gas she decided to check the office library upstairs there she found a long article on ethylene in an old pharmacology book ethylene was featured more prominently in the older book because it had been used as an anesthetic agent a number of years ago it had ultimately been abandoned because it was lighter than air and flammable those two qualities made the gas too dangerous for use in operating rooms in another book laurie found that ethylene had been noted around the turn of the century to prevent carnations in chicago greenhouses from opening the ethylene had been in the greenhouse illuminating gas on a more positive note she read that the gas was used to hasten the ripening of fruit and in the manufacture of certain plastics like polyethylene and styrofoam although this background information was interesting laurie still didnt see why ethylene would turn up in cocaine overdosetoxicity cases feeling discouraged she replaced the books on their respective shelves and returned to her office hoping she hadnt missed binghams call maybe peter was right his finding of ethylene had resulted from a laboratory error when lou got back to police headquarters he was handed a stack of urgent messages from his captain the area commander and the police commissioner clearly all of officialdom was in an uproar going into his office he was surprised to find a newly appointed detective sitting patiently by his desk his suit was new suggesting hed only recently become a plainclothesman who are you lou asked officer obrian the policeman said you have a first name yes sir its patrick nice italian name lou said patrick laughed what can i do for you lou asked trying to decide on the order in which to return his messages sergeant norman carver asked me to come by to try to collate the medical information you have relating to those gangland killings you know all those people who were also patients of dr jordan scheffield he thought i might be good at it because id been premed for a while in college and had worked in a hospital summers before switching to law enforcement sounds reasonable lou said i came up with something that might be important patrick said uh huh lou said he stared at the messages to call the police commissioner that was the one that was the most disturbing hed never gotten a message to call the police commissioner it was like a parish priest getting a call from the pope all the patients had different diagnoses patrick continued but they did have one feature in common lou looked up oh patrick nodded they were all scheduled to have surgery they were all going to have operations on their corneas no kidding lou said no kidding patrick said after patrick had left lou tried to make sense of it hed been disappointed when hed failed to find a common link between the murder victims besides the fact theyd been patients of jordan scheffield but now there might be something after all it couldnt be simple coincidence looking at his stack of phone messages lou decided to postpone returning the calls hed be better off following up on this new information after all he already knew what his higherups were calling him about they wanted to complain about his lack of progress in the gangland murders and probably give him an earful about lauries overdose series to boot if there was a chance he could start to break the case with this cornea stuff hed be better off pursuing it now before he spoke to them lou decided to start with the doctor himself he figured hed get the usual runaround but he was determined to speak with the man patients or no but when lou asked for jordan scheffields receptionist told him that jordan was in surgery over at manhattan general and that he had many cases scheduled he wouldnt be back in the office until late in the day lou pondered his options returning his urgent messages still wasnt his next choice he decided persistence was the virtue of the day hed pay the eye doc another visit even if it meant barging in the operating room hed witnessed about a dozen autopsies that week could surgery be much worse what the hell happened paul bellowed angelo tony and dr louis travino had been hauled on the carpet they stood like errant pupils before the school principal paul cerino was seated behind his massive partners desk he was not happy dr travino wiped his forehead nervously with a handkerchief he was a balding overweight man with a vague resemblance to cerino isnt somebody going to answer me whats the matter with you people i asked a simple question howd this story get into the papers he swatted the newspaper on his desk in front of him all right paul said when it was clear no one was about to volunteer anything lets start from the beginning louie you told me this fruit gas would not be detectable thats right louie said its not its too volatile nothing was said about the gas in the papers true paul said but then why are they describing these overdoses as murders i dont know louie replied but it wasnt because they detected the gas youd better be right paul said i dont think i have to remind you ive been covering your sizable gambling debts the vaccarro family would be very unhappy with you if i suddenly wasnt good for the money it wasnt the gas louie reiterated so what was it im telling you this article has given me a very bad feeling if someones screwed up heads are going to roll this is the first suggestion of trouble louie said otherwise everything has been doing fine and look at you youre doing great then how did this female doc come up with the real story paul asked this laurie montgomery is the same broad who blabbed to lou soldano about the acid being tossed in my face who is this chick shes one of the medical examiners in the manhattan office louie said you mean like that character quincy that used to be on tv paul asked well its a little different in real life louie said but basically the same so how did she suspect something paul asked i thought you said thered be no figuring this how did this laurie montgomery guess what was going on i dont know louie said maybe this is something we should ask dr montgomery cerino considered the suggestion for a moment to tell you the truth he said id been thinking the same thing besides this laurie montgomery could become a big pain in the ass if she keeps up the detective work angelo you think you might arrange a little er interview with the little lady no problem angelo said you want her ill get her its the only thing i can think to do paul said and after weve had a little chat i think the best thing this lady doc could do is disappear i mean completely im talking no body nothing isnt the montego bay going to be leaving soon angelo asked yeah paul said shes about to pull anchor and head for jamaica good idea okay bring her to the pier i want dr louie to question her i dont like being directly involved in something like this louie said im going to pretend i didnt hear you say that paul said youre involved in this operation up to your eyeballs so dont give me any crap when do you want us to move angelo asked this afternoon or tonight paul said we cant wait around for things to get worse doesnt that amendola kid work over there at the morgue whats his name the familys from bayside vinnie tony said vinnie amendola yeah cerino said vinnie amendola he works at the morgue talk to him maybe hell help remind him what i did for his old man when he had trouble with the union and take this he pointed to the newspaper i understand the lady docs pictures in the paper use that to make sure you get the right person after his guests had departed cerino used his automatic dialer to call jordans office when the receptionist explained that the doctor was in surgery cerino told her he wanted his call returned within the hour jordan got back to him in fifteen minutes i dont like whats going on jordan said before paul could say a word when we talked about some sort of business association you told me there would be no problems that was two days ago and already theres a major scandal brewing i dont like it calm down doc cerino said all businesses have some startup pains stay cool i just wanted to be sure you didnt do anything foolish something youd regret you got me involved in this by threatening me is this the same kind of scare tactic i guess thats what you could call it paul said depends on your point of view me i thought we were talking one businessman to another i just wanted to remind you youre dealing with professionals like yourself the call when it came was from binghams secretary she asked laurie if she would come to dr binghams office laurie had said of course binghams expression was solemn when laurie stepped into his office laurie could tell he was trying to maintain his composure much as she was trying to retain her nerve i truly dont understand you doctor bingham said finally his face was hard his voice firm you have deliberately countermanded my directive i specifically warned you about going to the media with your own opinions yet you willfully disobeyed me given such willful disregard for my authority you leave me no choice but to terminate your employment at this office but dr bingham laurie began i dont want any excuses or explanations bingham interrupted according to regulations i have the right to terminate you at my discretion since you are still within the probational first year of your employment however if you demand in writing a hearing on this issue i will not block it beyond that i have nothing more to say to you dr montgomery that will be all but dr bingham laurie started again that will be all dr bingham shouted the tiny capillaries that wrapped around his nostrils dilated turning his whole nose a bright red hastily laurie scrambled from her chair and fled out of binghams office she consciously avoided the stares of the administrative secretaries whod undoubtedly heard binghams outburst without stopping she went up to her office and closed the door sitting at her desk she looked at its cluttered surface she was in shock shed talked herself out of the possibility of being fired yet that was exactly what had happened once again she found herself fighting tears and wishing that she had more control over her emotions with trembling fingers she opened her briefcase and emptied out all the files she had in it then she packed it with her personal belongings books and that sort of thing shed have to come back for at a later date she did take out the summary sheet of the overdose series from the central desk drawer and put it into her briefcase with her coat on her umbrella under her arm and her briefcase in her hand she closed and locked her door she didnt leave the building immediately instead she went down to the toxicology lab to find peter letterman she told him that shed been let go but that she was still interested in the results of his tests with respect to her series she asked if hed mind if she checked in peter said that he wouldnt mind at all laurie knew he was eager to ask about what had happened with bingham but he didnt laurie was about to head out when she remembered the test shed requested from the dna lab one floor below she was interested to know about the sample shed taken from julia myerholtzs fingernail what she was hoping for was something positive even though she did not expect it to her astonishment her wish came true the final result wont be ready for a long time the technician explained when laurie inquired about the status of the specimen but im ninetyninepercent sure that the two samples came from two different people laurie was stunned here was another baffling piece to the puzzle what could it mean was it another clue that pointed to homicide she didnt know the only thing she could think to do was call lou she went back to her office and tried to reach him but was told that he was out the police operator didnt know when hed be back and had no way to reach him unless it was an emergency laurie was disappointed she realized she would also like to tell lou about getting fired yet she could hardly justify saying it was an emergency she thanked the operator and didnt leave a message she relocked her door laurie thought it best to leave via the morgue that way shed stand less of a chance of running into either bingham or calvin shed also have a chance to avoid the press however when she reached the morgue level she thought of one more thing she wanted to do get the addresses and the details of the three cases that had come in overnight her only chance at possibly getting her job back lay in proving her allegations if she could do that then she thought shed request that hearing bingham had mentioned laurie quickly changed into scrub clothes and entered the autopsy room as usual on a monday morning all tables were in use laurie went to the master schedule and saw that the three cases she was interested in had been given to george fontworth she joined him at his table he and vinnie had already gotten a start i cant talk to you george said i know it sounds crazy but bingham came down here to tell me youd been fired and that i absolutely was not to speak to you if you want you can call me tonight at home just answer me this laurie said are these cases like the others i guess george said this is the first one so i dont know for sure about the others but from glancing through the folders id say so for now all i want are the addresses laurie said let me take the investigators reports for a minute then ill bring them right back i dont know what ive done to deserve this george said rolling his eyes just make it quick if anybody asks im going to say you came in here and took them when i wasnt looking laurie got the papers she wanted from georges folders and went back to the locker room she copied down the three addresses and put them in her briefcase back in the autopsy room she slipped the reports into their respective folders thanks george laurie said i never saw you george answered returning to the locker room laurie slowly put on her street clothes then with her things in hand she walked the length of the morgue past the mortuary office and past the security office at the morgue loading dock were several mortuary vans with health and hospital corp stenciled on the sides walking between the vans laurie emerged on thirtieth street it was a gray rainy clammy day opening her umbrella laurie began to trudge up toward first avenue as far as she was concerned it was the nadir of her life tony got out of angelos car he was just slamming the door when he noticed that angelo hadnt moved he was still sitting behind the wheel whats the matter tony asked i thought we were going inside i dont like the idea of going into the morgue angelo admitted you want me to go in there by myself tony asked no angelo said i like that idea even less angelo reluctantly opened his door and stepped out he pulled an umbrella from the floor of the backseat and snapped it open then he locked the car at the security office angelo asked for vinnie amendola go on into the mortuary office the guard said its just ahead on your left angelo didnt like the city morgue any better than hed thought he would it looked bad and smelled bad they hadnt been there three minutes and already he couldnt wait to get out at the mortuary office he again asked for vinnie he explained that it was something about vinnies father the man asked angelo and tony to wait there hed be right back with vinnie five minutes later vinnie came into the mortuary office in his green scrub clothes he looked upset what about my father he asked angelo put an arm around vinnies shoulder could we speak in private he asked vinnie let himself be led into the hall vinnie looked him straight in the eye my father has been dead for two years he said whats this about were friends of paul cerino angelo said we were supposed to remind you that mr cerino helped your father once with the unions mr cerino would appreciate having his favor returned theres a doctor here by the name of laurie montgomery shes not here anymore vinnie interrupted what do you mean angelo asked she was fired this morning vinnie said then we need her address angelo said could you get that for us and remember this is just between us im sure i dont have to spell it out for you i understand vinnie said hang on ill be right back angelo sat back down but he didnt have to wait for long vinnie came back with lauries address and even her phone number as speedily as promised he explained he got the information from the oncall schedule relieved to be leaving the morgue angelo nearly jogged back to his car whats the plan tony asked once angelo had started the engine no time like the present lets go to the broads apartment now were even in the neighborhood fifteen minutes later they had parked on nineteenth street and were walking toward lauries apartment building how are we going to handle this tony asked well try the usual way angelo said use our police badges as soon as we get her in the car were golden in the foyer of lauries building they got her apartment number from her mailbox the inner door was not much of a barrier to the likes of angelo two minutes later they were in the elevator heading for the fifth floor they went directly to lauries door and pressed her buzzer when there was no response angelo hit it again she must be out looking for another job tony said looks like quite a set of locks angelo said studying the door tonys eyes left the door and roamed around the tiny hall his eyes instantly locked onto debra englers tony tapped angelo on the shoulder and whispered we got one of the neighbors looking at us angelo turned in time to see debras probing eye through her narrowly opened door as soon as his eye caught hers she slammed the door shut angelo could hear her locks clicking in place damn angelo whispered what should we do tony asked lets go back to the car angelo said a few minutes later they were seated in angelos car in full view of the entrance to lauries building tony yawned in spite of himself angelo did the same im exhausted tony complained me too angelo said id expected to sleep all day today think we should break into the apartment tony asked im thinking about it angelo admitted with all those locks it might take a few minutes and i dont know what to do about that witch in the other apartment did you catch her face how would you like to wake up with that in bed with you this chicks not bad looking tony said gazing at the picture of laurie in the paper i could go for something like that lou helped himself to another cup of coffee he was waiting in manhattan general hospitals surgical lounge where hed surprised jordan on their last encounter but that time lou had had to wait for only twenty minutes already hed been there well over an hour he was beginning to doubt the wisdom of putting this hopedfor interview with jordan ahead of returning his superiors calls just when lou was thinking about leaving jordan entered the room he went directly to a small refrigerator and pulled out a carton of orange juice lou watched jordan take a long drink he waited until jordan came over to the couch to look through the newspaper lying there then lou spoke up jordan old boy lou said imagine running into you here of all places jordan frowned when he recognized lou not you again im touched youre so friendly lou said it must be all the surgery youve been doing thats got you in such an affable mood you know what they say make hay while the sun shines nice seeing you again lieutenant jordan finished the juice and tossed the carton into the wastebasket just a second lou said he got up and blocked jordans exit lou had the definite impression jordan was being even less cooperative than hed been during their previous meeting he was also more upset beneath the brusque facade the man was definitely nervous i have more surgery to perform jordan said im sure you do lou said which makes me feel a little better i mean its nice to know that not all your patients scheduled for surgery meet violent deaths at the hands of professional hit men what are you talking about jordan demanded oh jordan indignation becomes you but id appreciate it if youd cut the crap and come clean you know full well what im talking about last time i was here i asked you if there was anything these murdered patients of yours had in common like maybe they were suffering from the same ailment or something you were happy to tell me i was wrong what you failed to tell me was that they were all scheduled to undergo surgery by your capable hands it hadnt occurred to me at the time jordan said sure lou said sarcastically he was certain jordan was lying yet at the same time lou was not sure of his objectivity in judging jordan as lou had recently admitted to laurie he was jealous of jordan he was jealous of the mans tall good looks of his ivy league education his silverspooned past his money and his relationship with laurie it didnt occur to me until i got back to the office jordan said after i looked at their charts but even once you did realize this connecting factor you failed to let me know well let that go for the moment my question now is how do you explain it i cant jordan said as far as i can tell its extraordinary coincidence nothing more nothing less you dont have the slightest idea why these murders were committed none jordan said and i certainly hope and pray there are no more the last thing i want to happen is see my surgical population decreasing in any form or fashion particularly in such a savage way lou nodded knowing what he did about jordan he believed this part what about cerino lou asked after a pause what about him hes still waiting for another operation lou said is there any way this murder streak could be related to cerino do you think that hes at risk i suppose anything is possible jordan said but ive been treating paul cerino for months and nothing has happened to him i cant imagine hes involved or specifically at risk if you have any ideas get back to me lou said absolutely lieutenant jordan said lou stepped out of the way and jordan pushed through the swinging doors and disappeared from view laurie decided that even if nothing panned out if she failed to turn up any useful information at least she was keeping busy and keeping busy meant she couldnt dwell on her situation she was unemployed in a city that was hardly cheap to live in and she might even be out of forensics she could hardly expect a recommendation from bingham but she wouldnt think about that just then instead she decided to follow through and get more information for her series there were three more overdoses to be investigated how were the bodies discovered and were the deceased seen going into their apartments that fateful evening in the company of two men inside an hour laurie hit pay dirt at kendall fletchers apartment building and it all sounded familiar fletcher had gone out to jog but had returned very soon afterwith two men the doorman never saw the two men leave the apartment several hours after fletcher had returned an unnamed tenant called to complain about noise in g the tenant feared that someone inside g might be hurt the superintendent responded to the call thats when fletchers body was discovered laurie had less luck at stephanie haberlins the woman lived in a converted brownstone with no doorman laurie decided to leave that case for the time being and head on to the third and final location yvonne andre lived in a building similar to kendall fletchers laurie made use of her medical examiners badge just as she had at fletchers the doorman who introduced himself as timothy was more than happy to help just as with kendall fletcher ms andre had entered her building along with two men timothy couldnt describe the men but he distinctly remembered their coming when laurie asked whod found the body timothy replied that jose the super had laurie asked if she could speak with him timothy said of course he called out to a lean man in a tan uniform who was at that moment repairing a piece of furniture in the foyer jose immediately joined them and introductions were made so how was it that you found the body laurie asked the night doorman called me asking me to check the andre apartment let me guess laurie said the night doorman had been called by a tenant complaining that strange noises were coming from the andre apartment jose and timothy gazed at laurie with surprise and respect ah jose said with a smile youve been talking with the police where in the apartment did you find the body laurie asked in the living room jose said what did the apartment look like laurie asked was anything broken did it look as if thered been a struggle i didnt really look around jose said not after i spotted ms andre the police were here of course but no one has touched anything you want to see it id love to laurie answered they went directly to yvonnes apartment on the fourth floor jose opened the door with his passkey and stepped aside laurie went in first she hadnt taken more than five steps in the door when she nearly collided with an elegantly dressed middleaged woman who had responded to the sound of the key in the lock the woman was quite stunning although she looked as if shed been crying she clutched a tissue in her hand excuse me laurie said with embarrassment she was appalled that the apartment was occupied the woman started to say something when she recognized jose im sorry mrs andre jose said i didnt know anyone was here this is dr montgomery from the medical examiners office who is it dear a tall grayhaired man appeared in the doorway to the kitchen its the superintendent mrs andre managed and this is dr montgomery from the medical examiners office from the medical examiners office here in manhattan mr andre questioned thats right laurie said im terribly sorry for this intrusion jose suggested i come up here i had no idea youd be here nor did i jose added quickly its all right mrs andre said she raised the tissue to dab at the corners of her eyes as she wistfully looked around the living room we were just going through some of yvonnes things if youll excuse me mr andre said he abruptly turned and disappeared back toward the kitchen i can return at a later time laurie said taking a step back toward the door im terribly sorry about your loss oh dont go mrs andre said holding out a hand toward laurie please come in sit down its better for me to talk about it laurie glanced at jose she wasnt sure what she should do ill leave you people jose said if you need anything please call laurie wanted to leave the last thing she should be doing was consoling the loved ones of the deceased look where it had gotten her when shed tried to comfort sara wetherbee duncan andrews girlfriend but laurie didnt feel she could simply walk out on the obviously bereaved mother now that shed burst in on her with some misgivings laurie allowed herself to be guided toward the sitting area mrs andre sat on a love seat laurie took a side chair you cant imagine what a shock this has been to us mrs andre said yvonne was such a good generous daughter selfless to a fault she was always devoting herself to one charitable cause or another laurie nodded sympathetically greenpeace amnesty international naral you name a good liberal cause chances were she was active in it laurie knew she didnt need to say much it was enough just to listen she had two new ones mrs andre said with an aggrieved laugh at least they were new to us animal rights and organ donation its such an irony that she died of a heart attack i think shed really hoped some of her organs would be used to a good purpose someday oh not anytime soon mind you but she very much did not want to be buried she was quite adamant about it she thought it was a terrible waste of resources and space i wish more people felt as your daughter did laurie said if they did doctors could really begin to save more lives she wanted to be very careful not to contradict the poor womans notion that her daughter had died of a heart attack not because of cocaine maybe youd like to have some of yvonnes books mrs andre said i dont know what we are going to do with them all clearly the woman was desperate to talk to someone before laurie could respond to her generous offer mr andre stormed back into the room his face was flushed whats the matter walter mrs andre asked her husband was clearly upset dr montgomery mr andre sputtered ignoring his wife i happen to be on the board of trustees of manhattan general hospital i also happen to know dr harold bingham personally having spoken with him earlier about my daughter i was rather surprised when you showed up so i called him back he is on the phone now and would like a word with you laurie swallowed with some difficulty she got up and walked past mr andre into the kitchen hesitantly she picked up the phone montgomery bingham thundered after laurie answered she had to move the receiver a few inches from her ear what in gods name are you doing at yvonne andres apartment youve been fired do you hear me ill have you arrested for impersonating a city official if you keep this up do you understand me laurie was about to reply when she caught sight of a business card tacked to a bulletin board on the wall behind the phone it was a business card for a mr jerome hoskins at the manhattan organ repository montgomery bingham shouted again answer me what the hell do you think youre up to laurie hung up without saying a word to bingham with trembling hand she took the card off the board suddenly the pieces fit together and what a terrible hideous picture they formed laurie almost couldnt believe it yet from the moment everything clicked she knew the awful inexorable truth could not be refuted the thing to do of course was to call lou but before she did that there was one other place she wanted to visit pm monday manhattan lou soldano was back in the surgical lounge at manhattan general for the second time that day but on this visit he wouldnt have long to wait this time hed called the operating room supervisor and asked when dr scheffield would be through with his surgery lou had timed his arrival so that hed catch jordan just as he was coming out after waiting for less than five minutes lou was pleased to see the good doctor as he strode confidently through the lounge and into the locker room lou followed hat in hand and trench coat over his arm he kept his distance until jordan had tossed his soiled scrub shirt and pants into the laundry bin it had been lous plan to catch the man in his skivvies when he was psychologically vulnerable it was lous belief that interrogation worked better when the subject was off balance hey doc he called softly jordan spun around the man was obviously tense excuse me lou said scratching his head i hate to be a bother but i thought of something else who the hell do you think you are jordan snapped colombo very good lou said i didnt think youd get it but now that i have your attention there is something i wanted to ask you make it fast lieutenant jordan said ive been stuck over here all day and i got an office full of unhappy patients he went to the sink and turned on the water when i was here earlier i mentioned that the patients whod been killed were all waiting for surgery but i failed to ask what kind of operations they were scheduled to have i mean i was told they were going to be corneal operations of some sort doc fill me in just what was it you were going to do for these people jordan stood up from having been bent over the sink water dripped from his face he nudged lou to the side to get at the towels he took one and vigorously dried his skin making it glow they were going to have corneal transplants jordan said finally eyeing himself in the mirror thats interesting lou said they all had different diagnoses but they were all going to get the same treatment thats right lieutenant jordan said he walked away from the sink to his locker he spun the wheel on the combination lock lou followed him like a dog i would have thought different diagnoses required different treatments its true these people all had different diagnoses jordan explained he began dressing but the physiological infirmity was the same their corneas werent clear but isnt that treating the symptom and not the disease lou asked jordan stopped buttoning his shirt to stare at lou i think i have underestimated you he said you are actually quite right but often where the eye is concerned we do precisely that of course before you perform a transplant you have to treat the cause of the opacity you do that so you can be reasonably sure the problem will not recur in the transplanted tissue and with the proper treatment it generally doesnt gee lou said maybe i could have been a doctor if id had the chance to go to an ivy league school like you jordan went back to his buttoning of his shirt that comment was much more in character he said one way or the other lou said isnt it surprising that all your murdered patients were scheduled for the same operation not at all jordan said as he continued to dress im a superspecialist cornea is my area of expertise ive just done four today most of your operations are corneal transplants lou asked maybe ninety percent even more lately what about cerino lou asked same thing jordan said but with cerino ill be doing two procedures since both eyes were affected equally oh lou said once again he was running out of questions dont get me wrong lieutenant im still shocked and distressed to know that these patients of mine were murdered but knowing that these patients were killed im not at all surprised to know they were all slated for corneal transplants as my patients almost by definition that would have to be expected now is there anything else lieutenant he pulled on his jacket was there anything about the corneal transplants these people were waiting for that set them apart from other recipients nope jordan said what about marsha schulman could she have been associated with these patients deaths she wasnt waiting for an operation but shed met the people lou said she was my main secretary she met practically everyone who came into the office lou nodded now if youll excuse me lieutenant i really must go to the recovery room to check on my last case good seeing you again with that he was gone discouraged again lou returned to his car hed been so sure that hed hit on the crucial fact when patrick obrian had come into his office to tell him that the dead patients were all to have the same operation now lou thought it was just another dead end lou pulled out into the street and instantly got bogged down in traffic rush hour was always murder in new york and on rainy days it was even worse when lou glanced over at the sidewalk he realized the pedestrians were moving faster than he was with time to think lou tried to review the facts of the case he had a hard time getting past dr jordan scheffields personality god how he hated the guy and it wasnt just because of laurie although there was that the guy was so smug and condescending he was surprised laurie didnt see it suddenly the car behind lous rammed into his his head snapped back then forward in a fit of anger lou jammed on the emergency brake and leaped out the guy behind him had gotten out too lou was chagrined to see that the man was at least two hundred and fifty pounds of solid muscle watch where youre going lou said shaking his finger he walked around to check the back of his caprice there was a bit of paint from the guys car on his bumper he could have played tough cop but he chose not to he rarely did it took too much effort sorry man the other driver said no harm done lou said he got back into the car inching forward in the traffic he turned his head to the left and right he hoped he wouldnt suffer any whiplash suddenly the glimmer of an idea started to take shape in lous head getting hit had worked some sense into him how could he not have seen for a moment he stared into space mesmerized by the solution that had crystallized so suddenly in his brain he was so deep in thought the big guy behind him had to beep to get him to move ahead holy crap lou said aloud he wondered why it had not occurred to him before as hideously outlandish as it was all the facts seemed to fit snapping up his cellular phone he tried laurie at the medical examiners office the operator told him shed been terminated what lou demanded shes been fired the operator said and hung up lou quickly dialed lauries home number he kicked himself for not having tried to call her earlier to find out what had happened when she saw her chief obviously the meeting had not gone well lou was disappointed to get lauries answering machine he left a message for her to call him asap at the office and if not there at home lou hung up the phone he felt badly for laurie losing her job had to have been an enormous blow for her she was one of those rare people who liked her job as much as lou liked his there she is tony cried he gave angelo a shove to wake him up angelo shook his head then squinted through the windshield it had gotten dark during the short time hed been asleep his mind felt fuzzy but he could see the woman tony was pointing at she was only ten feet from her building and heading for the door lets go angelo said he piled out of the car then almost fell on his face his left leg had gone to sleep in the weird position hed assumed when hed closed his eyes tony was significantly ahead as angelo tried to run on a leg that felt more like wood than bones and muscle by the time he got to the door the leg was feeling like pins and needles from the crotch down he pulled open the door to see tony already conversing with the woman we want to talk with you down at the station tony was saying trying to imitate angelo angelo could see that he was holding his badge too high so that laurie montgomery could read what it said if she so chose angelo pulled tonys arm down and smiled he noticed that laurie was as goodlooking a woman as tony had guessed from the photo wed like to talk to you just for a few moments angelo said purely routine well have you back here in less than an hour it has to do with the medical examiners office i dont have to go anyplace with you i dont think you want to create a scene angelo said i dont even have to talk with you angelo could tell laurie was not going to be an easy broad im afraid we have to insist he said calmly i dont even recognize you men what precinct are you from angelo cast a quick glance over his shoulder no one was coming into the building this pickup was going to take force angelo glanced at tony and gave a tiny nod getting the message tony reached into his jacket and pulled out his beretta bantam he pointed it at laurie angelo winced as laurie let out an earpiercing scream that could have awakened the dead as far away as saint johns cemetery in rego park with his free hand tony reached out and grabbed laurie by the neck intending to force her to the car instead he got a briefcase in the groin he doubled over in pain as soon as he straightened back up tony pointed his gun at the womans chest and fired two quick shots laurie went down instantly the shots were deafening tony hadnt put his silencer on not thinking hed have to resort to force the smell of cordite hung in the air what the hell did you shoot her for angelo demanded we were supposed to bring her in alive i lost my head tony said she hit me in the nuts with her goddamn briefcase lets get her the hell out of here angelo ordered together they each grabbed one of lauries arms angelo bent down and grabbed her briefcase then the two men halfdragged halfcarried lauries lifeless body to their car dead or alive they could still get her to the montego bay as quickly as possible they shoved her into the backseat of the car a few pedestrians eyed them suspiciously but no one said anything tony climbed in beside her while angelo jumped into the front seat and started the car as soon as the engine responded he pulled out into nineteenth street she better not be bleeding on that upholstery angelo said glancing in the rearview mirror he could see tony struggling with the body what the hell are you doing trying to get her purse out from under her tony said he grunted its like shes got a death grip on it as if it matters at this point she dead angelo asked he was still furious she hasnt moved tony said ah got it he held up the purse as if it were a trophy if cerino asks me what happened angelo snapped im going to have to tell him im sorry tony said i told you i lost my head hey look at this this broad is loaded he waved a handful of twenties that he pulled from a wallet just keep her out of view said angelo oh no tony cried whats the matter now angelo demanded this chick isnt laurie montgomery tony said looking up from a piece of identification its a maureen wharton an assistant da but she looks just like that photo tony leaned forward and picked up the newspaper with lauries photo brushing maureens hair to the side he compared her face to the one in the photo well its pretty close he said angelo gripped the steering wheel so hard that the blood drained from his hand he was going to have to tell cerino about tony whether he asked or not because of tony they had whacked the wrong woman an assistant da no less this kid was driving him berserk its meponti franco said hed put a call through to vinnie dominick im in the car heading for the tunnel i just wanted you to know that i just watched the two guys weve discussed hit another young woman in broad daylight its crazy it makes no sense im glad you called vinnie said ive been trying to get ahold of you that snitch you set me up with that friend of a friend of tony ruggerios girlfriend just clued me in he knows what theyre doing its unbelievable youd never have figured it out want me to come back franco asked no stay on those two vinnie said im heading out now to talk directly with some lucia people well figure out what to do we got to stop cerino but in a way to take advantage of the situation capisce franco hung up the phone angelos car was about five carlengths ahead now that vinnie knew what was going on franco was dying to know as well cupping her hands around her face laurie pressed them against the locked glass doors of the converted brownstone on east fiftyfifth street she could make out a set of marble steps that rose up to another closed door laurie stepped back to view the front of the building it was five stories tall with a bow front the second floor had tall windows from which light poured the third floor had lights as well above that the windows were dark to the right of the door was a brass plate that said manhattan organ repository hours nine to five since it was after five laurie understood why the front doors were locked but the lights on the second and third floors suggested that the building was still occupied and laurie was determined to talk with someone going back to the door laurie knocked again just as loudly as she had when shed first arrived still no one responded looking to the left laurie noticed a service entrance walking over to this door she tried to peer inside but saw nothing it was totally black returning to the main door laurie was about to knock again when she noticed something shed not seen below the brass plate and partially hidden from view by the ivy that snaked up the buildings facade was a small brass bell laurie pushed it and waited a few minutes later the foyer beyond the glass doors illuminated then the inner door opened and a woman in a long tight unadorned wool dress came down the few marble steps she had to walk sideways because of the snugness of the dress about her legs she appeared to be in her midfifties her humorless face was stern and her hair was pulled back in a tight bun coming to the door she pantomimed that they were closed to emphasize her point she repeatedly pointed at her watch laurie mimed in return indicating that she wanted to talk with someone by making her hand move as if she were operating a hand puppet when that didnt work laurie took out her medical examiners badge and flashed it despite binghams dire warnings that hed have her arrested when that didnt work its usual wonders laurie took out the business card shed taken from yvonne andres apartment and pressed it against the glass finally the woman relented and unlatched the door im sorry but were closed for the day the woman said i gathered that laurie said putting a hand on the door but i must speak with you i only need a few minutes of your time im with the medical examiners office my name is dr laurie montgomery what is it you wish to discuss the woman asked can i come in laurie suggested i suppose the woman said with a sigh she opened the door wide and let laurie in then she locked the door behind them this is quite lovely laurie said most of the buildings nineteenthcentury detailing had been preserved when it had been converted from a private residence to office space were lucky to have the building the woman said by the way my name is gertrude robeson they shook hands would you care to come up to my office laurie said that she would and gertrude led her up an elegant georgian staircase that curved up to the floor above i appreciate your time laurie said it is rather important im the only one here gertrude said trying to finish up some work gertrudes office was in the front and it accounted for the light streaming out of the windows from the second floor it was a large office with a crystal chandelier vaguely laurie wondered how it was that so many nonprofit organizations had such sumptuous surroundings once they were seated laurie got to the point she again took out the business card shed picked up at yvonnes and passed it to gertrude is this individual a member of the staff here laurie questioned yes he is gertrude said she gave the card back jerome hoskins is in charge of our recruiting efforts what exactly is the manhattan organ repository laurie asked id be happy to give you our literature gertrude said but essentially were a nonprofit organization devoted to the donation and reallocation of human organs for transplantation what do you mean by your recruiting efforts laurie asked we try to get people to register as potential donors gertrude said the simplest commitment is just to agree that in the event of an accident that renders one brain dead one would be willing to have the appropriate organs given to a needy recipient if thats the simplest commitment laurie said whats a more complicated one complicated is not the right word gertrude said it is all simple but the next step is to get the potential donor to be blood and tissue typed that is particularly helpful in replenishable organs like bone marrow how does your organization do its recruiting laurie asked the usual methods gertrude said we have charitable fundraisers telethons active college groups that sort of thing its really a matter of getting the word out thats why its so helpful when a recipient can command media attention like a child needing a heart or liver do you have a large staff laurie questioned its rather small actually gertrude said we use a lot of volunteers who responds to your appeals laurie asked mostly collegeeducated people gertrude said particularly those who are civicminded people who are interested in social issues and are willing to give something back to society have you ever heard the name yvonne andre laurie asked no i dont believe so gertrude said is this someone i should meet i dont think so laurie said shes dead oh dear gertrude said why did you ask if i knew her just curious laurie said could you tell me if yvonne andre was someone mr hoskins recruited im sorry gertrude said thats confidential information i cannot give it out i am a medical examiner laurie said my interest in this is not casual i was speaking with yvonne andres mother today and she told me her daughter was committed to your cause before her untimely death mr hoskins card was in her apartment i dont want to know any details but i would appreciate knowing if shed signed up with your organization did ms yvonne andres death occur under questionable circumstances gertrude asked it will be signed out as accidental laurie said but there are some aspects to her death that bother me you know generally speaking that for organs to be transplanted the donor must be in a vegetative state in other words everything but the brain must still be physiologically alive of course laurie said im well aware of that caveat yvonne andre was not in a vegetative state before her death nevertheless her status in your organization is something i need to know just a moment gertrude said she walked over to her desk and punched some information into her computer terminal yes she said yvonne was registered but that is all i can say i appreciate what you have told me laurie said i have one more question have there been any breakins here at your offices in the last year gertrude rolled her eyes i really dont know if im at liberty to divulge this kind of information but i guess its a matter of public record you could always check with the police yes we were broken into a couple of months ago luckily not too much was taken and there was no vandalism laurie rose from her chair thank you very much youve been generous with your time i really appreciate it would you like to take some of our literature gertrude asked i would laurie said gertrude opened a cabinet and pulled out a number of brochures which she handed to laurie laurie put them in her briefcase then gertrude saw her to the door emerging onto fiftyfifth street laurie walked over to lexington avenue to catch a cab downtown she directed the taxi driver to take her to the medical examiners office with her suspicions strengthening and her confidence renewed she wanted to talk with george fontworth there was something about that days overdose cases that she wanted to ask about even though it was after six oclock she thought that he might still be at work he usually worked late but as laurie approached the office she began to worry about bingham still being there she knew that on a number of evenings he also stayed late consequently laurie instructed the cab driver to turn from first avenue onto thirtieth street when they came abreast of the morgue loading dock she had him turn in it was good that she had there was binghams official city car one of the perks of being the chief medical examiner ive changed my mind laurie called to the driver through the plexiglas screen she gave him her home address with some cursing in a language laurie had never heard he pulled out of the morgue driveway and returned to first avenue fifteen minutes later she was in front of her tenement building it was still raining so laurie bolted for the door she was surprised to find that the lock to the inner door was broken shed have to call the super about it in case no one else had reported it yet laurie headed straight for the elevator she didnt bother collecting her mail just then she had one thing in mind calling lou as the elevator doors began to slide shut laurie saw a hand come around its edge to try to stop the doors from closing laurie tried to hit the open button but hit the close instead the hand pulled back the doors closed and the elevator ascended laurie was just unlocking her locks when she heard debra englers door open behind her there were two men at your door debra said ive never seen them before they rang your bell twice although laurie didnt like having debra meddle in her affairs she wondered who the two men were and what they could have wanted it was difficult not to think of two men in anything but the context relating to the overdose cases and the thought sent a chill down her spine she wondered how theyd gotten as far as her door since she hadnt been there to buzz them in then she remembered the broken lock in the second door she asked debra what they looked like didnt get a good look at their faces debra said but they seemed no good to me and as i said they rang your bell twice laurie turned back to her door and unlocked the last lock it occurred to her that if the two men had malicious intentions they could have gone up the service stairs and broken in through her rear door in the kitchen laurie pushed open her door it creaked on its hinges which had been coated with a hundred layers of paint from her vantage point in the hall her apartment appeared as she had left it she didnt hear anything abnormal or see anything suspicious cautiously she stepped over the threshold ready to flee at the slightest unexpected sound out of the corner of her eye laurie saw something coming at her letting out a small involuntary cry that was more of a gasp than a scream laurie let go of her briefcase and raised her arms to defend herself at the moment the briefcase hit the floor the cat was on her but only for a second in the next instant it had leaped to the foyer table and with its ears held flat against its skull it scampered into the living room for a second laurie stood in her doorway clutching her chest her heart was beating as fast as it did after several games of racquetball only after shed caught her breath did she turn back to her door close it and secure the multitude of locks picking up her briefcase laurie went into the living room the manic cat rushed from his hiding place and leaped to the top of the bookcase and from there to the top of the valance over the windows from that vantage point it glared down at laurie with playful anger laurie went directly to her phone her answering machine light was blinking but she didnt listen to her messages instead she dialed lous work number unfortunately he didnt pick up laurie hung up and started to dial his home number but before she could finish dialing her doorbell rang startled she hung up at first she was afraid to go to the door even to look out the peephole the doorbell sounded a second time she knew she had to act she would see who it was she told herself she didnt have to open up laurie tiptoed to the door and peered out into the hall two men she didnt recognize were standing there their faces distorted by the wideangle lens into exaggerated corpulence who is it laurie asked police a voice called a feeling of relief spread over her as she began to unlock her locks could bingham have made good on his threat to have her picked up but he hadnt said hed do it hed only said he might after undoing the chain lock laurie paused she again put her eye to the peephole do you have identification she asked she knew enough not to let anyone in on their word alone as to who they were the two men quickly flashed police badges in front of the peephole we only want to talk with you for a moment the same voice explained laurie backed away from the door although shed initially been relieved to learn that her visitors were police now she was beginning to wonder what if they were here to arrest her that would mean theyd have to take her to the police station to be booked shed be questioned held maybe arraigned who knew how long that would take she had to talk to lou about much more important matters besides hed undoubtedly be able to help her if she were to be arrested just a moment laurie called to them i have to put on some clothes laurie headed straight for her kitchen and the back door tony exchanged looks with angelo should we tell her not to bother dressing he asked shut up angelo whispered the click of old hardware sounded behind them tony turned around to see debra englers door opening a crack tony lunged toward the door and clapped his hands loudly to give debra a scare the tactic worked debras door slammed shut about a dozen locks were audibly being secured for chrissake angelo whispered whats the matter with you this is no time for screwing around i dont like that witch looking at us get over here angelo ordered he looked away from tony shaking his head thats when he caught a fleeting glimpse of a womans silhouette dashing by the wireembedded smoked glass of a door to the fire stairs it took angelo a second to appreciate what was happening come on he said as soon as it hit him shes going down the back stairs angelo ran over to the stairwell door and yanked it open tony sprinted through they both halted momentarily at the banister and peered down a dirty stairwell that dropped in a series of short flights to the ground floor five stories below they could see laurie several floors lower and hear the echo of her heels on the bare concrete treads get her before she reaches the street angelo snarled tony took off like a rabbit taking the stairs four at a time he gained steadily on laurie but wasnt able to catch her before she went through a door on the ground floor leading to the backyard tony reached the door before it had a chance to swing shut he pushed through to the outside and found himself in a rubblestrewn backyard overgrown with weeds he could hear lauries running footsteps echo as she sprinted down a narrow passageway leading to the street leaping over a short handrail tony ran after her laurie was only twenty feet away hed have her in a moment laurie had known that shed not slipped out unnoticed and that the police were behind her shed heard them coming down the stairwell as she fled shed questioned the advisability of having done so but having started she couldnt stop now that shed run she was even more determined not to be caught she knew that resisting arrest was a crime in and of itself on top of that the thought of whether they were bona fide police crossed her mind as she mounted the final steps to the street laurie knew that one of her pursuers was almost on her at the lip of the steps pushed against the wall of the building was a collection of old dented metal garbage cans in a fit of desperation laurie grabbed the top edge of one and pulled it behind her sending it clattering down the steps to the floor of the passthrough to the backyard seeing her pursuer stumble on the can and fall laurie quickly rolled the rest of the cans to the lip of the stairs and sent them crashing down a few pedestrians passing on the street slowed their pace at this spectacle but none stopped and no one said anything hoping that her pursuer was momentarily occupied laurie ran down to first avenue she praised her luck as the first cab she saw came over to her and stopped completely out of breath laurie jumped in and yelled that she wanted to go to thirtieth street as the taxi accelerated into the traffic laurie was afraid to look back she was also trembling wondering what she had done now as she thought about the consequences of resisting arrest she changed her mind about her destination she leaned forward and told the driver that she wanted to go to police headquarters instead of thirtieth street the driver didnt say anything as he turned left to head over to second avenue laurie sat back and tried to relax her chest was still heaving as they worked their way south on second avenue laurie had a change of heart again worrying that lou might not be at police headquarters laurie decided her first destination was better scooting forward again she told the driver this time he cursed but turned left to go back to first avenue as shed done with the previous cab laurie had this driver turn on thirtieth and pull into the morgue loading area she was relieved to see that binghams car had left after paying the fare she ran into the morgue tony paid the driver and got out of the cab angelos car was where theyd left it with angelo behind the wheel tony climbed in well angelo asked i missed her tony said that much is clear angelo said where is she she tried to lose me tony said she had her driver make a loop but i stayed with her she went back to the medical examiners office angelo leaned forward and started his car cerino doesnt know how right he was when he said that this girl could be trouble well have to nab her from the medical examiners office maybe it will be easier there tony suggested shouldnt be many people there at this hour it better go more smoothly than it did here angelo said as he looked back before pulling out into the street they rode up first avenue in silence angelo had to hand one thing to tony at least he was fast on his feet angelo turned onto thirtieth street and killed the engine he wasnt happy to be back at the medical examiners office again but what choice did they have there could be no more screwups whats the plan tony asked eagerly im thinking angelo said obviously she wasnt so impressed with our police badges laurie felt relatively safe in the dark deserted medical examiners building she got into her office and locked the door behind her the first thing she did was dial lous home number she was pleased when he picked up on the first ring am i glad to hear from you lou said the moment laurie identified herself not as glad as i am to get you where are you lou asked ive been calling your apartment every five minutes if i hear your answering machine message one more time ill scream im at my office laurie said theres been some trouble i heard lou said im sorry about your being fired is it final or will you get a hearing its final at the moment but thats not why i called two men came to my apartment door a few minutes ago they were policemen i got scared and ran i think im in big trouble uniformed policemen lou asked no laurie said they were in street clothes suits thats strange lou said i cant imagine any of my boys going to your apartment what were their names i havent the slightest idea laurie said dont tell me you didnt ask them their names lou said thats ridiculous you should have gotten their names and badge numbers and called the police to check on them i mean how do you know they were really police i didnt think of getting their names laurie said i asked to see their badges come on laurie lou complained youve lived in new york too long to act like that you should know better all right laurie snapped she was still overwrought the last thing she needed from lou was a lecture what should i do now nothing lou said ill check into it meanwhile if anybody else shows up get their names and badge numbers do you think you can remember that laurie wondered if lou was deliberately trying to provoke her she tried to remain calm this was no time to let him get to her lets change the subject she said theres something even more important we have to talk about i think ive come up with an explanation about my cocaine overdosetoxicity cases and it involves someone you know i finally even have some evidence that i think youll find convincing maybe you should come over here now i want to show you some preliminary dna matches obviously i cant meet you here in the daytime what a coincidence lou said sounds like weve both made some progress i think ive solved my gangland murder cases i wanted to run it by you how did you manage to solve them i went by to see your boyfriend jordan lou said in fact i saw him a couple of times today i think hes getting tired of me lou are you deliberately trying to irritate me laurie questioned if so you are doing a wonderful job for the tenth time jordan is not my boyfriend put it this way lou said im trying to get your attention you see the more time i spend with that guy the more i think hes a creep and a sleazeball and this is going beyond that jealousy crap i admitted to in a moment of weakness i cant imagine what you see in him i didnt call you to get a lecture laurie said wearily i cant help it lou said you need some advice from someone who cares i dont think you should see that guy anymore ok dad ill keep it in mind with that she hung up the phone she was tired of lous condescending paternalism and for the moment she couldnt talk with him she had to give herself some time to calm down the man could be so infuriating especially when she needed support not criticism lauries phone started ringing almost as soon as shed hung up but she ignored it shed let lou stew for a little while she unlocked her office door and walked down the silent hallway and took the elevator to the morgue at that hour the morgue was desolate with most of the skeleton evening staff on dinner break bruce pomowski however was in the mortuary office she hoped he hadnt heard about her being fired excuse me laurie called from the doorway bruce looked up from his newspaper is the fletcher body still here she asked bruce consulted the log book nope he said went out this afternoon how about andre or haberlin laurie asked bruce referred to the book again andre went out this afternoon but haberlin is still here the body is going out to long island someplace any minute its in the walkin thanks laurie said she turned to leave obviously bruce hadnt heard shed been taken off the payroll dr montgomery bruce called peter letterman was looking for you earlier and im supposed to tell you to be sure to go up and see him if i run into you he said it was important and that he was going to be around for a while tonight laurie felt torn she wanted to view the haberlin body thinking that a brief examination could very well substantiate her suspicions at the same time she didnt want to miss peter if he had something to tell her listen laurie said to bruce im going to run up and see if peter is still here dont let that haberlin body go until i see it you got it bruce said with a wave laurie went to the fourth floor and the toxicology lab when she saw a light coming from peters door she breathed a sigh of relief peter was still there knock knock laurie called out pausing at the door she didnt want to give peter a scare peter looked up from a long computer printout he was studying laurie am i glad to see you i have something i want to show you laurie followed peter to the gas chromatographmass spectrometry unit peter picked up another computer printout and handed it to laurie she studied it with little comprehension its from robert evans peter said proudly just as you suggested what am i looking at laurie asked peter pointed with his pencil there he said thats a positive for ethylene and its a lot more evident than it had been in randall thatchers case it is no laboratory error or false positive its real thats weird laurie said shed really come to think the ethylene reading in the thatcher case had been an error it might be weird peter said but its real no doubt about it i need another favor laurie said can you open the dna lab for me sure peter said you want me to open it now if you dont mind peter got his keys and led laurie down a flight of stairs to the lab on the third floor as they went in laurie explained what she was up to i was shown a polaroid of a match but it was just a preliminary it concerns the julia myerholtz case you probably recognize the name certainly peter said ive run lots of samples on her i want to find that polaroid laurie said i need a copy of it i dont need a duplicate photograph a copy from the copy machine will be fine no problem peter said he knew exactly where to look once he had the polaroid in hand he went to the copy machine laurie followed while the copy machine warmed up peter looked at the photo its pretty obvious they dont match he said is that what you expected no laurie said it was a shot in the dark interesting peter said do you think it is significant absolutely laurie said i think it means julia was fighting for her life you think shes still in there tony asked he was more antsy than usual she could have left while i was going back to get you and if shes not in there then were wasting our time sitting here like a couple of chumps youve got a good point angelo said but before we move in i wish we could make sure she didnt call the cops i still dont understand why she split unless she didnt think we were real cops i mean isnt she the solidcitizen type what does she have to hide from cops it doesnt make sense and when something doesnt make sense it means im missing something and when im missing something it scares me god youre always worrying tony said lets just go in there get her and be done with it all right angelo said but take it easy and bring the bag were going to have to play this one by ear im with you all the way tony said eagerly due to the unconsummated chase after laurie tonys appetite for action had been honed to a razors edge he was a bundle of nervous energy i think wed better put the silencers on our guns angelo said no telling what were going to meet and were going to have to work fast great tony exclaimed with obvious excitement he pulled out his bantam and attached the silencer it took him a moment because his hand trembled with pleasurable anticipation angelo gave him a hard look then shook his head in exasperation try to stay calm lets go they got out of the car and ran across the street and between the two mortuary vans they ran hunched over trying to avoid the drizzle as much as possible they entered the same way they had that afternoon through the morgue loading dock angelo was in the lead tony followed with the black doctors bag in one hand and his gun in the other in an attempt to conceal the gun he had it partially under his jacket angelo was almost past the open door to the security office when someone inside yelled hey you cant go in there tony collided with angelo when his partner stopped abruptly a guard in a blue uniform was sitting at his desk in front of him was a game of solitaire where you guys think youre going he asked before angelo could respond tony raised his bantam and aimed it at the surprised guards forehead he pulled the trigger without a moments hesitation the slug hit the guard in his head just above his left eye so that he fell over onto his desk his head landing with a solid thump on his card game except for the pool of blood forming on the desk top a passerby might have thought the man was simply asleep on the job what the hell did you shoot him for angelo snarled you could have given me a chance to talk with him he was going to give us trouble tony said you said we had to be fast what if he has a partner angelo said what if the partner comes back where will we be then tony frowned come on angelo said they peered into the mortuary office there was cigarette smoke in the air and a live butt in an ashtray by the desk but no one was in sight leaving the office and advancing cautiously into the morgue proper angelo glanced into the small auxiliary autopsy room used for decomposed bodies the dissecting table was barely visible in the halflight this place gives me the creeps he admitted me too tony said its nothing like the funeral home i worked at look at the floor this place is disgusting why are so many lights off angelo asked saving money tony suggested they came to the huge ushaped mass of refrigerator compartments stacked fourhigh each with its own heavily hinged door you think all the bodies are in here angelo asked pointing toward the bank of cooler doors i guess so tony said this is just like in those old movies when they have to identify somebody it doesnt smell like this in the movies angelo said what the hell are all those simple coffins for they expecting the bubonic plague beats me tony said they wandered past the large walkin cooler heading for the light that was coming through the windows of the double doors that led into the main autopsy room just before they got there the doors burst open and out walked bruce pomowski everyone recoiled in surprise tony hid his gun behind his back you guys scared me bruce admitted with a nervous laugh the feelings mutual angelo said you must be here for the haberlin body bruce said well i got good news and bad news the good news is that its ready the bad news is you have to wait until one of the doctors examines it thats too bad angelo said but as long as were waiting around have you seen dr laurie montgomery yeah bruce said i just saw her a few minutes ago can you tell us where she went angelo asked she went up to toxicology bruce said he was becoming curious and even a little suspicious about these two men and where might toxicology be angelo asked fourth floor bruce tried to remember if hed ever seen these two on a body pickup before thanks angelo said he turned motioning for tony to follow him hey you cant go up there said bruce and what funeral home are you from spoletto angelo said thats not the one ive been expecting bruce said i think id better make a call what are your names were not looking for any trouble angelo said wed just like to talk with laurie montgomery bruce took a step backward and eyed angelo and tony i think ill give security a call tonys gun appeared and pointed at the mortuary tech bruce froze in place looking crosseyed at the barrel tony pulled the trigger before angelo could say anything similar to the security man the slug hit bruce in the forehead and he swayed for a second then crumbled to the floor damn angelo said you cant shoot everybody hell tony said he was about to call security a lot of good that would have done him angelo said you already took care of security you have to learn to restrain yourself so i overreacted tony said at least we know the chicks still here we even know where to find her but first we have to hide this body angelo said what if somebody comes along angelo glanced around his eyes settled on the cooler compartments lets stick him in one of the refrigerators angelo said quickly angelo and tony began checking compartments searching for an empty one in every one the first thing they spotted was a pair of bare feet with a manila tag around the big toe this is disgusting angelo said heres an empty one tony said he pulled out the drawer they went back to bruces limp body tony discovered the man was still alive and making weird noises when he breathed should i give him another slug he asked no angelo snapped he didnt want any more shooting its not necessary he wont be making much noise in the refrigerator together they dragged the body to the open refrigerator compartment and managed to lift him onto the drawer sleep tight tony said as he slid the drawer into the wall and closed the door now put your goddamned gun away angelo commanded all right tony said he stuck his bantam into his shoulder holster with the silencer in place the butt of the gun showed at tonys lapel lets get up to the fourth floor angelo said nervously this isnt going very well we have to get the woman and get out of here all hell is going to break loose if someone comes across this trail of corpses youve been leaving tony picked up his doctors bag and hurried after angelo whod already headed for the stairs angelo did not want to chance running into anyone in the elevator emerging on the fourth floor they saw only one room was lit assuming that had to be the toxicology lab they headed straight for it they entered cautiously only to find peter cleaning some equipment excuse me angelo said were looking for dr laurie montgomery peter turned around you just missed her he said she went down to the morgue to look at a body in the walkin cooler thanks angelo said not at all peter said angelo took tony by the arm and quickly led him out into the hall nice of you not to shoot him angelo said sarcastically the two retraced their steps heading back downstairs to the morgue after looking in the mortuary office and the main autopsy room laurie gave up on finding bruce hed probably gone on break she had it in her mind to ask him for help but she decided to check the walkin for the haberlin body herself laurie put on rubber gloves before entering the large refrigerator straining against the doors weight she pulled it open reached in and switched on the light the walkin looked much as it had when shed gone in in search of julia myerholtz most of the bodies on the wooden shelves had not been disturbed since her last visit those on gurneys represented a new batch unfortunately there were more bodies than there had been before in an attempt to be methodical she began by checking the bodies closest to the door as usual all the bodies had been tagged for identification laurie had to lift the sheets shrouding the feet to check the names after checking each gurney she moved it aside to allow her to work deeper into the cooler finally near the back of the walkin and after checking a dozen bodies she found the tag with stephanie haberlin written on it it was none too soon laurie was shivering covering the feet back up laurie jockeyed the gurney around to get to its head then she pulled back the sheet laurie winced at the sight seeing a young persons pale corpse was never a pleasant sight no matter how long she stuck with forensics laurie didnt think shed ever get used to this part of the job with uncharacteristic reluctance laurie reached over and placed her thumb and index finger on stephanies upper eyelids for a moment laurie hesitated wondering what she wished for more to be wrong or right taking a deep breath she lifted the lids laurie winced for the second time she even felt her legs go weak in a split second her suspicions had been validated shed been correct it could no longer be considered a coincidence the dead womans eyes were gone you awful awful man laurie said aloud through chattering teeth how could any human being perpetrate such a heinous crime this scheme was truly diabolical the resonant click of the coolers latch shocked laurie from her musing anticipating bruce she was surprised to see two strangers enter one carrying an oldfashioned doctors bag dr montgomery the tall one called out yes laurie answered she was afraid she recognized these two as the same men whod come to her door we want to talk with you downtown angelo said would you mind coming with us who are you she demanded she began to tremble i dont think that really matters the shorter one said as he started pushing gurneys to the side with his free hand he was cutting a path to laurie angelo started to move toward her too what do you want with me laurie asked her terror mounting we just want to talk tony said laurie was trapped she had no place to run she was snared in a virtual sea of corpseladen gurneys tony was already pushing aside the last two of the remaining gurneys that lay between them with no other recourse laurie stripped her shoulder purse from her arm and let it drop to the floor she then stepped to the head of stephanie haberlins gurney and grasped the sides screaming to bolster her courage laurie started wheeling stephanies gurney desperately trying to build up speed in the confined space she aimed the gurney directly at the surprised tony at first tony suggested he would stand his ground but as lauries efforts accelerated he tried to get out of the way laurie crashed the gurney into tony with enough force to knock him off balance as well as to cause stephanies corpse to topple off haphazardly a stiff dead arm draped itself around tonys neck as he fought to regain his footing not allowing the man to recover laurie grabbed another gurney and ran it into stephanies grabbing still another she ran it at angelo who slipped on the tile floor trying to avoid being struck and totally disappeared from view tony struggled from stephanies embrace pushing the corpse away from him he was wedged between the gurneys which he attempted to push away as he pulled out his gun he tried to take aim but laurie crashed another gurney into the others throwing him off balance once again angelo struggled to his feet and tried to make a space for himself to stand upright pushing more gurneys in tonys direction tony fired as laurie crashed one last gurney the sound even with the silencer was deafening within the insulated cooler the bullet passed over lauries shoulder as she scrambled for the door she was out of the cooler in an instant slamming the heavy door behind her frantically she searched for a lock to secure the walkin refrigerator but there wasnt one she had no other choice but to make a run for it she hadnt gotten far when she heard the cooler door open behind her running as fast as she could she rounded the corner of the mortuary office seeing no one she continued on to the security office dashing inside she called out to the sleeping guard help me she cried youve got to help me there are two men when the guard did not move laurie desperately reached out and roughly grabbed the mans shoulder yanking him to an upright sitting position but to lauries shock the mans head flopped back like a rag doll dragging playing cards with it with horror she saw the bullet hole in his forehead his unseeing eyes and bloody froth oozing from his mouth where his head had been on the desk was a pool of partially dried blood laurie screamed and let go of the guard he collapsed backward in the chair his head hyperextending and his arms limply dangling with his fingers just brushing the floor laurie wheeled around to flee but it was too late the shorter of the two men came flying through the door his gun held out in front of him a demonic smile spread like a gaping wound across his face he pointed the gun directly at laurie at such close range she could even see a short distance up the barrel of the silencer the man advanced toward her as if in slow motion until the tip of the gun was a mere inch from lauries nose she didnt move she was paralyzed with dread dont shoot her cried the other taller man who suddenly appeared over tonys shoulder please dont shoot her it would be so rewarding tony said come on angelo urged gas her angelo put the black doctors bag on the corner of the desk with his foot he gave the desk chair a shove to get it out of the way the dead guard rolled out of the chair and fell to the floor then angelo stepped into the corridor to look in both directions hed heard voices tony lowered his gun it had been all he could do to keep from firing it placing it in his jacket pocket he opened the black bag and took out the gas cylinder and the plastic bag after inflating the bag he stepped over to laurie whod backed up against a table this will be a nice rest tony said wideeyed with terror laurie was shocked when tony crammed the bag over her head the force bent her back over the table both hands splayed out to support herself as they did her right hand hit up against a glass paperweight clutching it laurie swung it underhand hitting tony in the groin tonys grip on the plastic bag released as he reflexively grabbed his genitals after their recent runin with the briefcase they were particularly sensitive laurie took advantage of his pain to tear the plastic bag from her head the smell inside it had been sickeningly sweet pushing off the table laurie dashed by tony who was still doubled over and then angelo whod been standing guard outside goddamn it angelo shouted he started after laurie tony partially recovered limped after angelo carrying the black bag the plastic bag and the gas cylinder laurie ran out the way shed come passing the stack of potters field coffins and the walkin refrigerator she was hoping to run into some of the custodial staffanyone who might be able to help her when she saw the light in the main autopsy room she was encouraged she went through the swinging doors at a full run inside laurie was thrilled to find a man mopping the floor youve got to help me she gasped the janitor was shocked by her sudden appearance there are two men chasing me laurie cried she dashed to the sink and snatched up one of the large autopsy knives she knew it wouldnt be much help against a gun but it was the only defense she could think of the confused janitor looked at her as if she were crazy and before she could say anything else the door burst open a second time angelo entered at a run with his gun drawn its over angelo snarled between harsh winded breaths behind him the door opened again tony came charging inside clutching the black bag and the gas paraphernalia in one hand his gun in the other whats happening the janitor demanded his shock had changed to fear with the sight of the guns he gripped his mop in both hands as if he were prepared to use it as a weapon with no further provocation tony raised his gun and shot the man in the head the janitor staggered and collapsed tony stepped over to shoot the man a second time its the girl we want angelo yelled forget the janitor gas her as hed done in the security office tony inflated the plastic bag and approached laurie paralyzed with shock from having seen the janitor killed in front of her laurie was temporarily incapable of resisting the autopsy knife slipped from her hand and clattered to the floor tony went behind her and pulled the bag over her head after taking a few breaths of the sweet gas inside the bag laurie reached up as if to pull the plastic off her but her efforts came too late her knees gave way and she sank to the floor unconscious run out and get one of those pine coffins angelo said make it quick a few minutes later tony returned with a coffin nails and a hammer he put the coffin down next to laurie with angelo at her head and tony at her feet they lifted her into the box then pulled off the plastic bag tony put on the lid and was about to nail it shut when angelo suggested putting more of the gas inside tony held the cylinder under the lid and tried to fill the coffin quickly he smelled the gas pulling his hand out he closed the lid thats about all i can get in tony said lets hope it holds her angelo said get one of those wagons over here he pointed to a gurney pushed against the far wall tony wheeled the gurney over while angelo nailed down the coffins lid then they both lifted the coffin onto it tony threw the plastic bag and gas cylinder into the doctors bag and set the bag on top of the coffin together he and angelo wheeled the gurney out the door they headed for the loading dock moving at a run they passed the mortuary office then turned and passed the security office while tony waited on the lip of the loading dock and made sure the gurney didnt roll away angelo went to check inside the mortuary vans in the first one he found the keys in the ignition running back to tony he told him theyd use the truck as quickly as possible and using the keys to unlock the rear doors they loaded the coffin containing laurie into the back of the van angelo dropped the keys into tonys hand you drive her angelo said go directly to the pier ill see you there tony climbed into the front of the van and started the engine move it out angelo yelled frantically waving he guided tony as tony backed up into thirtieth street again angelo could hear voices within the morgue get moving angelo said as he slapped the side of the mortuary van he watched until tony had turned onto first avenue then he sprinted over to his own car started it and followed as soon as angelo caught up to the van he gave cerino a call from his cellular phone we got the merchandise he said beautiful cerino said bring her to the pier ill call doc travino well meet you there this wasnt a clean operation angelo said but we seem to be clear no one is following us as long as you got her its ok cerino said and your timing is perfect the montego bay departs tomorrow morning our little lady doc is due for a cruise pm monday manhattan lou pulled into the morgue loading dock and parked his car to the side there was only one van in the drive instead of the usual two so he could have pulled right up to the entrance but figuring the other van would be back soon he didnt want to be in the way he put his police identification card on the dash and got out lou could have kicked himself for pushing laurie as he had on the phone when was he going to learn to back off criticizing jordan was sure only to make her more defensive about the man he must have really set her off this time he could understand why she hadnt picked up the phone when hed called back but even if she was mad he would have thought shed have called him back when she hadnt gotten back to him after half an hour lou decided to head over to the medical examiners office to talk to her in person he hoped she hadnt left lou passed the security office and glanced in through the window he was a little surprised to see that no one was there but he assumed that the security guard was making his rounds farther down the hall lou checked the mortuary office but it was empty as well lou scratched his head the place seemed deserted it was dead quiet he thought with a laugh he checked his watch it wasnt that late and wasnt this place supposed to be open around the clock after all people died twentyfour hours a day with a shrug of his shoulders lou walked to the elevators and rode up to lauries floor as soon as he stepped off the elevator he could tell that she wasnt there her door was closed and the room was dark but he wasnt about to give up not yet he remembered her having said something about some laboratory results lou decided to see if he could find the right lab and maybe then laurie he took the elevator down one floor unsure of where to find the appropriate lab at the end of the fourthfloor hall he saw a light lou walked the length of the hall and peered in the open door excuse me he said to the youthful man in a white lab coat stooped over one of the rooms major pieces of heavy equipment peter looked up im looking for laurie montgomery lou said you and everyone else peter said i dont know where she is now but half an hour ago she went down to the morgue to look at a body in the walkin cooler someone else been looking for her lou asked yeah peter said two men id never seen before thanks lou said he turned back toward the elevator and hustled down the hall he didnt like the sound of two strangers looking for laurie not after what shed said about two alleged plainclothes policemen coming to her apartment lou went straight to the morgue level exiting the elevator he was surprised he still hadnt seen a soul besides the guy in the lab with growing concern he hurried down the long hall to the walkin cooler finding its door partially ajar only added to his unease with mounting dread he pulled the door the rest of the way open what he saw was far worse than he could have imagined inside the cooler bodies were strewn helterskelter two gurneys were tipped on their sides several of the sheets covering the bodies had been pulled aside even after a few days experience in the autopsy room he still didnt have the stomach for this and whatever had happened to laurie this bodystrewn battleground was hardly an auspicious sign lou spotted a purse among the wreckage pushing gurneys aside he picked it up to check for id he snapped open the wallet the first thing he saw was lauries photo on her drivers license as he rushed from the cooler lous concern turned to fear especially if his current theory about all the ganglandstyle murders was correct frantically he looked for someone anyone there was always someone available at the morgue seeing the light in the main autopsy room he ran down to it and pushed open the doors but no one was there either turning around lou dashed back to the security office to use the phone entering the room he immediately saw the guards body on the floor he knelt down and rolled the man over the mans unseeing eyes stared up at him there was a bullet hole in his forehead lou checked for a pulse but there wasnt any the man was dead standing up lou snatched up the phone and dialed as soon as an operator answered he identified himself as lieutenant lou soldano and requested a homicide unit for the city morgue he added that the victim was in the security office but that he would not be able to wait for the unit to arrive slamming the phone down lou raced to the morgue loading dock and jumped into his car starting the engine he backed up with a screech of his tires leaving two lines of rubber on the morgues driveway he had no other choice than to head directly for paul cerinos it was cardsonthetable time he slapped his emergency light on the cars roof and arrived at cerinos queens address after twentythree minutes of hairraising driving racing up the front steps of the cerino home he reached into his shoulder holster and unsnapped the leather band securing his smith and wesson detective special he rang the bell impatiently judging by all the lights blazing someone had to be home lou knew that he was operating on a hunch that depended on his theory about the gangland slayings being correct but at the moment it was all he had and his intuition told him that time was of the utmost importance an overhead light came on above lous head then he had the feeling that someone was looking at him through the peephole finally the door opened gloria was standing there dressed in one of her plain housedresses lou gloria said pleasantly what brings you here lou shoved past her and into the house wheres paul he demanded he looked into the living room where gregory and steven were watching tv whats the matter gloria asked i have to talk with paul where is he hes not here gloria said is there something wrong somethings very wrong lou said do you know where paul is im not positive gloria said but i heard him on the phone with dr travino i think he said something about going down to the company you mean at the pier lou asked gloria nodded is he in danger gloria asked lous distress was infectious lou was already half out the door calling over his shoulder he said ill take care of it back in his car lou started the engine and made a sweeping uturn in the middle of the street as he accelerated he caught sight of gloria standing on her stoop anxiously clutching her hands to her chest lauries first sensation was nausea but she didnt vomit although she retched she woke up in stages becoming progressively aware of movement and uncomfortable bumps and jostling she also became aware of dizziness as if she were spinning and a terrible sense of air hunger as if she were smothering laurie tried to open her eyes only to realize with a terrible shock that they were already open wherever she was it was pitch black when she was more awake laurie tried to move but when she did her legs and arms immediately hit up against a wooden surface exploring with her hands she quickly determined that she was in a box a wave of frightful claustrophobia passed through her like a cold wind as she realized shed been sealed into a potters field coffin at the same time the memory of what happened at the medical examiners office flooded back with searing clarity the chase those two horrible men the dead guard the poor janitor murdered in cold blood and then another horrid thought occurred to her what if they were planning to bury her alive gripped with terror laurie tried to draw up her knees straining against the top of the coffin then she tried to kick but it was all to no avail either something extremely heavy was on the lid or it had been nailed firmly down ahhhh laurie cried as the coffin jarred severely it was then that she realized she was in some sort of vehicle laurie tried screaming but only succeeded in hurting her own ears next she tried pounding the underside of the lid with her fists but it was difficult in the confined space abruptly the jarring stopped the vibration of the engine also stopped then there was the distant sound as if the doors of the vehicle had opened laurie felt the coffin move help laurie cried i cant breathe she heard voices but they werent speaking with her in a wave of desperate panic laurie again tried to pound the underside of the lid as tears came she couldnt help herself shed never been so terrified in her life laurie knew she was being carried for a time she hated to think where they were taking her would they really bury her would she hear the dirt raining down on the lid with a final thump the coffin was put down it hadnt hit ground it sounded like wood laurie gasped for air between sobs as a cold sweat appeared on her forehead lou wasnt exactly sure where the american fresh fruit company was but he knew it was in the green point pier area hed been there once years before and was hoping it would come back to him when he got to the waterfront district he took his emergency light down and turned it off he continued on greenpoint avenue until he could go no further then turned north on west street the whole time scanning the abandoned warehouses for some sign of life he was beginning to feel discouraged and progressively desperate until he saw a road marked java street the name rang a bell lou turned left onto it heading ever closer to the river a block down stood a high chainlink fence over the open gate was a sign bearing the name of cerinos company several cars were parked on the inside of the gate lou recognized one as cerinos lincoln continental beyond the cars was a huge warehouse that extended out over the pier above and behind the warehouse lou could see the very top of the superstructure of a ship lou drove through the gate and parked next to cerinos car a wide overhead door to the warehouse was open lou could just make out the rear of a van parked in the darkness within he shut off his engine and got out all he could hear was the distant screech of some sea gulls lou checked his gun but left it in his holster he tiptoed over to the open door and peered in for a better look at the van when he saw health and hospital corp on its side he was encouraged glancing around in the darkness of the warehouse lou saw nothing but the vague outlines of stacks of bananas no one was in sight but toward the end of the pier in the direction of the river perhaps a hundred yards away he could see a glow of light lou debated calling for backup proper police procedure required such a move but he feared there wasnt time he had to be certain laurie wasnt in immediate danger once he did that he could take the time to call for help avoiding the central corridor through the bananas lou worked his way laterally until he found another corridor that led out the pier groping ahead he moved in the general direction of the light it took him about five minutes to get abreast of the light carefully he again moved laterally until he could see that the light was coming from a windowed office inside were people lou recognized cerino immediately inching even closer lou got a better view of the interior most important he saw laurie she was sitting in a straightback chair lou could even see that her forehead gleamed with perspiration sensing that laurie was all right momentarily lou began to carefully retrace his steps now he wanted to use his radio in his car to call in some backup with as many people as there were in the office he wasnt about to play hero and go barging in back at his car lou climbed in and picked up his police radio he was about to speak when he felt the press of cold metal against the back of his neck get out of the car a voice commanded lou turned slowly and looked up into angelos gaunt face out of the car lou carefully replaced the microphone and got out onto the asphalt face the car angelo ordered angelo quickly frisked lou removing his gun when he found it ok angelo said lets go down to the office maybe youd like to go on a little cruise too i dont know what youre talking about laurie said she was trembling the coffin shed been in was off to the side she was terrified that they were going to force her back into it please doctor travino said im a doctor myself we speak the same language all we want to know is how you figured it out how did you guess that these cases were not the gardenvariety overdoses you people see day in day out you must be thinking of someone else laurie said she tried to think but it was difficult with her terror yet she had the idea that the reason she was still alive was because they were desperate to know how shed solved the case consequently she didnt want to tell them anything let me at her tony pleaded if you dont talk with the doctor paul said ill have to let tony have his way at that moment the door to the warehouse proper opened and lou soldano was propelled inside the office angelo followed his gun held at his side company he said who is it angelo paul demanded his patch was still in place over his operated eye its lou soldano angelo said he was about to use his radio lou cerino echoed what are you doing here keeping an eye on you lou said looking at laurie he asked are you all right laurie shook her head as well as can be expected she said through tears angelo grabbed a chair and set it next to lauries sit down he barked lou sat down his eyes glued to laurie are you hurt he asked travino paul said angrily this whole affair is getting too complicated you and your big ideas then to angelo he said get someone outside to make sure soldano was alone and get rid of his car to be on the safe side lets assume he had a chance to call in before we got him angelo snapped his fingers at several of the lowlevel hoodlums whod accompanied paul the men immediately left the office want me to take care of the detective tony asked paul waved him away the fact that he is here means he knows more than he ought to know he said hes going on the cruise too well have to talk with him just like we have to talk with the girl but for the moment lets get them on the montego bay quickly id prefer if the crew saw as little as possible what do you suggest gas angelo said good idea paul said tony youre on tony leaped at the opportunity to prove himself in pauls presence he got out a couple of plastic bags and the gas cylinder as soon as he had the first bag inflated he tied it off and started on the second while the first slowly floated toward the ceiling one of the hoodlums came back and reported that no one else was around and that soldanos car had been taken care of a sudden vibrating blast from the montego bays ships horn made everybody jump the ship was just on the other side of the uninsulated wall of the office paul cursed tony had let go of the second bag and some of the gas escaped into the room is that stuff bad for us cerino questioned smelling the gas no dr travino said in the confusion laurie turned to lou do you have your cigarettes with you she asked lou looked at her as if hed not heard correctly what are you talking about your cigarettes she repeated give them to me lou reached into his jacket pocket as he was about to pull out his hand another hand grabbed his wrist it was the hoodlum whod reported on his car the thug glared at lou and pulled lous hand from his jacket when he saw that lou was only holding a pack of cigarettes with matches under the cellophane he let go of lous arm and stepped back still baffled lou handed the cigarettes to laurie are you alone laurie asked in a whisper unfortunately lou whispered back he tried to smile at the thug whod grabbed his wrist the man was still glaring at him i want you to have a cigarette laurie said im sorry lou said im not interested in smoking at the moment take it laurie snapped lou looked at her in bewilderment all right he said whatever you say laurie took one of the cigarettes out of the pack and stuck it into lous mouth then she slipped out the matches tearing out a match she glanced up at the hoodlum who was watching them so intently his expression hadnt changed laurie shielded the match and struck it lou leaned toward her with the cigarette between his lips but laurie didnt light it instead she used the match to fire the entire pack of matches once the pack started to flare she tossed it toward tony and his plastic bags in the same motion she fell sideways off her chair tackling a surprised lou in the process together they fell to the floor the resulting explosion was severe especially around tony and upwards toward the ceiling where the escaped ethylene had layered and the second bag had positioned itself the concussion of the blast blew out all the office windows as well as the door and all the overhead lights sparing only a lamp on the desk tony was consumed by the fireball angelo was thrown against the wall where he sagged to a sitting position his eardrums blown out his hair was singed to his scalp and he suffered some internal damage to his lungs all the others were knocked momentarily senseless to the floor and superficially burned a few managed to push themselves up on all fours groaning and totally befuddled on the floor laurie and lou were relatively spared having been below any of the layered ethylene although both had suffered some minor burns and mild ear damage from the severe deflagration laurie opened her eyes and released her grip around lous middle are you all right she questioned her ears were ringing what the hell happened lou said laurie scrambled to her feet she pulled lous arm to get him to his feet lets get out of here she said ill explain it later together they stepped around and over moaning people strewn about the floor they coughed in the acrid smoke beyond the blownout door of the office their feet crunched over shattered glass down the corridor of bananas they saw a flashlight bobbing in the dark someone was running toward them lou yanked laurie laterally away from the office in the direction from which hed originally come as they huddled behind a stack of bananas the running footfalls drew closer soon another one of cerinos thugs stood gasping at the threshold of the office for a moment he stood there with his mouth open in amazement then he went to his bosss aid paul was sitting on the floor in front of the desk holding his head this is our chance lou whispered he held on to laurie as they worked their way back toward the entrance of the warehouse the going was slow because of the dark and the fact that they wanted to stay away from the main corridor in case there were other cerino people in the area it took them almost ten minutes before they could see the vague outline of the opening of the overhead door in front of it was the black silhouette of the morgue van it was still parked where it had been when lou had entered my car is probably gone lou whispered lets see if the keys are in the van they approached the van cautiously opening the drivers side door lou felt along the steering column his fingers hit the keys still dangling from the ignition thank god he said theyre here get in laurie climbed in the passenger side lou was already behind the wheel as soon as i start this thing lou whispered urgently were out of here fast but we might not be in the clear there might be some shooting so how about you going in the back and lying down just start the van laurie said come on lou said dont argue youre the one whos arguing laurie snapped lets go nobodys going nowhere a voice said to lous left with a sinking feeling laurie and lou looked out the window on lous side a number of faceless men in hats were standing in the dark a flashlight snapped on and played over lous face then over lauries they each blinked in its glare out of the truck the same voice ordered both of you with hopes dashed laurie and lou climbed back out of the van they could not see the men for the bright light shining at them but there seemed to be three back to the office the same voice commanded discouraged laurie and lou led the way back neither of them said a word neither wanted to think about cerinos fury the scene at the office was still chaotic smoke still hung heavily in the air one of cerinos goons had helped his boss into the desk chair angelo was still sitting on the floor with his back against the wall he looked confused and a trickle of blood was dripping down his chin from the corner of his mouth an additional light had been turned on and the extent of the damage was more apparent laurie was surprised by the amount of charring that old pharmacology text hadnt been kidding when it said ethylene was flammable it meant flammable she and lou were lucky not to have been injured more severely laurie and lou were given the same seats theyd occupied only minutes before sitting down laurie got a glimpse of tonys burned remains she grimaced and looked away my eye hurts paul wailed laurie closed her eyes not wanting to think what the consequences were to be of her having ignited the ethylene someone help me cerino cried lauries eyes opened again something was wrong no one was moving the three men whod accompanied them back to the office were ignoring cerino in fact they were ignoring everyone whats happening laurie whispered to lou i dont know he said something weird is going on laurie looked up at the three men they appeared nonchalant picking at their nails adjusting their ties they hadnt lifted a finger to help anyone looking in the other direction laurie saw the man whod run back into the office just after she and lou had gone out he was sitting in a chair with his head in his hands looking at the floor laurie heard the sound of footsteps approaching it sounded as if whoever was coming had metal taps on his heels out the blasted doorway laurie saw beams from several flashlights bobbing toward them presently a rather dapper darkly handsome man came to the blownout door he stopped to survey the scene he was dressed in a dark cashmere coat over a pinstriped suit his hair was slicked back from his forehead my god cerino he said with derision what a mess you have made laurie looked at cerino cerino didnt answer he didnt even move i dont believe it lou said lauries head spun around she looked at lou and saw the shock registered on his face whats happening she asked i knew something weird was going on lou said what laurie demanded its vinnie dominick lou said whos vinnie dominick laurie asked vinnie shook his head surveying what was left of tony then walked over to lou detective soldano vinnie said how convenient that youre here he pulled a cellular phone from his coat pocket and handed it to the detective i imagine youd like to contact your colleagues to see if theyd be so good as to come over here im sure the da would like to have a long talk with paul cerino in the background laurie was aware of the three men who had been lounging around before vinnie dominick arrived they were now going around the room collecting guns one of them brought lous over to vinnie having retrieved it from angelo vinnie proceeded to give it back to lou in disbelief lou looked down at the phone in one hand and his gun in the other come on lou vinnie said make your call unfortunately ive got another appointment so i cant be around when the men in blue arrive besides im kind of a shy sort of guy and i wouldnt feel comfortable with all the acclaim the city would want to throw my way for saving the day obviously you know what mr cerino has been up to so you dont need my help there but if you dont dont hesitate to give me a call you know how to get ahold of me im sure vinnie started for the door motioning for his men to follow him as he passed angelo he turned back to lou youd better call an ambulance for angelo here he said he doesnt look so good then looking down at tony he added the mortuary van out there will be fine for this dog turd with that he left lou handed laurie his gun while he used the cellular phone to call he identified himself to the operator and gave the address when he was finished he took back his gun who is this vinnie character laurie asked hes cerinos main rival lou said he must have found out what cerino was up to and this is his way of turning him in very effective id say with us here as witnesses its also a clever way to get rid of his competition you mean vinnie knew cerino was behind all these overdoses laurie asked she was stunned what are you talking about vinnie must have figured out that cerino was killing off patients ahead of him on jordan scheffields cornealtransplant waiting list oh my god laurie exclaimed what now lou asked after the night hed been having he wasnt ready for much more its twice as bad as i thought it was laurie said the drug overdoses were really homicides to get eyes cerino was having people killed whod signed up with the manhattan organ repository for organ donation lou glanced at cerino hes more of a sociopath than i could ever have imagined my god he was working both sides of the problem supply and demand cerino lifted his head from his hands what was i supposed to do wait like everybody else i couldnt afford to wait in my business every day i couldnt see i risked death is it my fault the hospitals dont have enough corneas laurie tapped lou on the shoulder he turned to face her theres a strange irony to this whole affair laurie said shaking her head we argued with one another about whose series was more socially relevant and therefore more important your ganglandstyle murders or my upscale overdoses only to learn that they were intimately connected they were just two sides of the same horrid affair you cant prove a thing cerino growled oh really laurie said epilogue january am wednesday manhattan lou soldano stamped the wet snow off his feet and walked into the morgue he smiled at the man in the security office who didnt challenge him and went directly to the locker room quickly he changed into green scrubs pausing outside the main autopsy room doors he donned a mask then pushed through his eyes traveled from one end to the other inspecting the people at each table finally his eyes spotted a familiar figure that even the bulky gown apron and hood could not hide walking over to the table he looked down laurie was up to her elbows in a huge corpse for the moment she was by herself i didnt know you did whales here lou said laurie looked up hi lou she said cheerfully would you mind scratching my nose she twisted away from the table and closed her eyes as lou complied a little lower she said ahhh thats it she opened her eyes thanks she went back to her work interesting case lou asked very interesting laurie said it was supposed to be a suicide but im beginning to think it belongs in your department lou watched for a few minutes and shuddered i dont think ill ever get accustomed to your work at least im working laurie said thats true lou said yet you shouldnt have been fired in the first place luckily things have a way of working out for the best laurie glanced up i dont think the families of the victims feel that way thats true lou admitted i just meant in relation to your job bingham ultimately was gracious about it laurie said not only did he give me my job back he also admitted i had been right well partly right i was wrong about the idea of a contaminant well you were right about the important part lou said they werent accidental they were homicidal and your contribution didnt end there in fact thats why i stopped by we just got an airtight indictment against cerino laurie straightened up congratulations she said hey it wasnt my doing lou said you get the credit first you were able to match that skin sample under julia myerholtzs fingernail with tony ruggerios remains that was critical next you exhumed a number of bodies until you made a match with kendall fletchers teeth on angelo facciolos forearm any forensic pathologist could have done it laurie said im not so sure lou said anyway faced with such incontrovertible evidence angelo pleabargained and implicated cerino that was what we needed its downhill from here you did pretty well yourself laurie said you got the kaufmans maid to pick angelo out of a lineup and tony out of mug shots that wouldnt have been strong enough for an indictment lou said or even if id gotten an indictment i wouldnt have gotten a conviction certainly not of cerino but anyway its over i shudder to think that there are people like cerino out there laurie said its the combination of intelligence and sociopathy that is so frightening as heinous as the whole cerino affair was it had some ingenious aspects imagine having his thugs put people into refrigerators to preserve the corneal tissue longer they knew that wed erroneously ascribe that to the hyperpyrexia that cocaine toxicity causes the point is lou said the vast majority of people who play by the rules and abide by the laws dont realize that there is a large number of people who do the opposite one bad side to cerinos indictment is that vinnie dominick is unopposed he and cerino used to keep each other in check but no longer organizedcrime activity has gone up in queens with cerinos departure from the scene not down now that it is all over laurie said i wonder why it took us so long to figure out what was happening i mean as a doctor i knew that new york is behind the times with its medicalexaminer laws and that there is a waiting list for corneas so why didnt i see it earlier i bet the reason you didnt see it was because it was too diabolical lou said its hard for the normal mind to even think of such a possibility i wish i could make myself believe that laurie said im sure that its true lou said perhaps laurie said well i just wanted to let you know about cerino lou said he shifted his weight clumsily im glad you did laurie said she studied him he avoided her eyes guess id better get back to my office lou said he nervously glanced around making sure no one was paying them any attention is there something youd like to say laurie asked youre acting suspiciously familiar yeah lou said finally making eye contact would you like to go out to dinner tonight purely social no business laurie smiled at this replay of lous painful social awkwardness it was particularly unexpected now that they had worked together on the cerino case and knew each other better in all other respects lou was decisive and confident we could go back to little italy lou said in response to lauries hesitation you never give a girl much warning laurie said lou shrugged it gives me an excuse to myself if you refuse unfortunately i have plans laurie said of course lou said hastily silly of me to ask well take care lou abruptly turned say hello to jordan for me he called over his shoulder laurie felt a surge of old irritation as she watched lou stride toward the double doors she fought against the urge to snap back at him he had not lost his penchant to be infuriating the doors to the autopsy room shut behind lou and laurie turned back to her job at hand but she hesitated then stripping off her rubber gloves her apron and gown laurie strode from the autopsy room the hall was clear lou had already disappeared guessing he was in the locker room laurie pushed directly into the mens side laurie caught lou with his scrub shirt half off exposing his muscled and hairy chest selfconsciously he lowered the garment i resent your implication that id be seeing jordan scheffield laurie said her arms akimbo you know full well he was implicated in this whole affair i know he was implicated lou said but i also know the grand jury did not indict him i also made it a point to learn that the board of medicine didnt even discipline him even though there was a strong suspicion that he knew what was going on in fact some people believe that jordan discussed the affair with cerino but did nothing because he liked the increase in surgery it provided so jordans out there pulling in the big bucks like nothing happened and you think id still be seeing him under these conditions laurie asked incredulously thats an insult i didnt know lou said sheepishly you never mentioned him i thought it was clear laurie said besides with as close as we have been working together you could have asked im sorry lou said maybe its more that i was afraid you were still seeing him you remember that i admitted ive always been a bit jealous of him he is the last person you should feel jealous of laurie said jordan would be lucky to have an ounce of your honesty and integrity id like an ounce of his schooling lou said or his sophistication he always made me feel like a secondclass citizen his urbanity is superficial laurie said the only thing he is truly interested in is money the embarrassment for me is that i was as blind to jordan as i was to what cerino was doing i was bowled over by the rush he gave me and his apparent selfconfidence you saw through his facade but i couldnt even when you told me directly thats not your fault lou said you think better of people than i youre not the cynical bastard i am besides youre not laboring under a hangup about your background like i am you should be proud of your background laurie said its the source of your honesty yeah lou said but id still rather have gone to harvard when i told you i had plans tonight i was hoping you might have suggested we get together tomorrow night or next week as prosaic as it sounds im going to my parents tonight what about you coming with me youre kidding lou said me yes laurie said warming to the idea one of the positive spinoffs of this whole affair with cerino is my relationship with my parents has improved dramatically for once my father even recognized that id done something he could relate to in a positive way and i think ive grown up a tad myself ive even stopped rebelling i think dealing with this affair has finally allowed me to come more or less to terms with my old guilt in relation to my brothers death this is starting to sound a bit out of my league lou said i suppose it seems sophomoric and overly analytical laurie agreed but the bottom line is that visiting my parents can be fun lately ive been seeing them about once a week and id love for you to come along id like them to meet someone whom i really respect are you pulling my leg lou asked absolutely not laurie said in fact the more i think about it the more i hope youll come and if you enjoy yourself maybe youll still be willing to take me out to little italy tomorrow night lady lou said you got yourself a deal
